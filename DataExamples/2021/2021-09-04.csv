The Kuwait and New York architecture studio was invited to work on the challenging – just 3m wide – plot and used it to create an experimental prototype for city living a micro-apartment design occupying an otherwise unused piece of land inbetween existing structures.

The unit promotes an apartment interior design that is time and cost effective to build explain the architecture team and offers practical solutions to spatial but also financial issues that often affect city dwellers.

Micro-apartment is a prototype for urban living

Named Duplex AO (DAO) the scheme presents an example of how the concept might work set here on the side of an existing residential building – running across one side of the plot where an old storage structure used to be. The idea is that this duplex apartment can be multiplied and adapted or scaled up to fit various different sites.

‘Despite the difficult dimensions law restrictions and low economical resources DAO has successfully triggered unexpected spatial values that provoke rather new forms of sustainable micro-living’ say the architects. This is combined with ‘economically viable and energy-efficient green solutions that helped raise awareness in the region regarding critical environmental matters’ they add.

The micro-apartment features an entrance hall that leads to a reception a kitchen and a gym (which may also be used as a second bedroom or a study). Located upstairs is the master bedroom and the bathroom. Stepping out from the bedroom into the generous balcony residents can enjoy the outdoors in a private sheltered setting carved out by the apartment’s dramatic angled facade – a feature that defines the prototype micro-apartment’s volume and highlights the dynamic nature of the overall concept.

It has always been amongst Teesside's finest homes and remains so today – although it did have a slightly more spartan period in its existence when it was bought by the local authority in the 1960s and turned into a day centre which was subsequently closed then sold in 2017 to once again be turned into a family home.

Today Upsall Hall might be a grade II listed property but it is also a thoroughly modern home stunning refurbished and beautifully finished to the most minute of details from decor to die for to all the mod cons the most discerning of homeowners could want. It also offers all the space you could ask for both inside and over 13 acres of gardens and grounds.

Upsall Hall - Roseberry Newhouse

From the moment you enter the double electric gates and negotiate the sweeping carriage driveway though the immaculate grounds and up to the front of the house you know it's special.

Step inside and that's immediately confirmed by your first impressions – a spacious entrance hall with feature fireplace porcelain tiled floors decorative pillars and a stylish staircase which wouldn't be out of place in the grandest of mansions.

Off of this lies the extensive ground floor accommodation – a modern kitchen dining room with integrated appliances and an island unit; utility room; grand drawing room with feature fireplace and bay window overlooking the gardens; dining room with the most magnificent wood panelled walls and wood-framed windows; two cloakrooms; a period library with classical wood mouldings panels and book shelving plus a decorative fireplace and an expanse of almost floor-to-ceiling windows – including a beautiful arched window – which allow light to flood in and a cinema room.

There is also cellar space and a boiler room.

Upstairs off the pillared landing with roof light are the spacious master bedroom with a dressing room and luxurious en-suite bathroom with separate shower and free-standing bath; guest bedroom with dressing room four further double bedrooms two family bathrooms a dressing room and a shower room.

With so many highlights in the main house it seems almost trite to label the attached leisure complex as such but it's a description which is certainly fitting.

It is home to a gym plus a simply stunning pool room with sauna Jacuzzi cloakroom showers and a bar area with seating plus bifold doors which open on to the terrace which is home to a covered fully-equipped outdoor kitchen. The perfect setting for relaxing as a family or entertaining.

Upsall Hall - Roseberry Newhouse

If that weren't enough accommodation for you there is a refurbished three/four bedroom property in the grounds called The Old Stables plus outbuildings all set in 13 acres.

Laid mainly to lawns the immaculately maintained gardens are bounded by mature trees to provide a great degree of privacy and are home to a pond. There is also an adjoining paddock.

Upsall Hall has new windows gas central heating and benefits from a smart home entertainment system throughout. For those who would like to take on a project – or require even more space to grow into – the currently unused top floor offers further potential to convert.

Upsall Hall is situated in Nunthorpe and is on the market at a guide price of £3m.

The review was confirmed earlier this year and is assessing the authority’s ‘Investing in Nottinghamshire’ scheme aimed at improving the council’s estate.

Within those plans is a new flagship £14.7m office block at the upcoming Top Wighay Farm development near Linby as well as upgrades to County Hall and facilities in Mansfield and Worksop.

However concerns were raised in July over the plans particularly given the authority’s planned move to a hybrid working model.

Meadow House on Littleworth Mansfield.

The new model reflecting changes to the workforce during the pandemic will lead to more staff splitting their time between a home and office environment.

Opposition members fear ‘money could be wasted’ by investing in new offices but the council has insisted its review will plan ‘25 years into the future’.

Coun Keith Girling economic development and asset management committee chairman  said: “We’re doing the review because we understand people might not want to go back to how it was before Covid.

“We’re looking at how we’re doing the hybrid system but we have got to look not just for now but 25 years into the future.

“It’s not going to be precise but it’s going to be as accurate as we can get it to ensure the staff who work for this council can function properly and in appropriate accommodation.”

The ‘Investing in Nottinghamshire’ scheme was unveiled before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Top Wighay Farm building the council said last year would set a ‘new benchmark’ in environmental sustainability.

It would be supported by a new building near the council’s County Hall headquarters.

The plans also feature £3m improvements to Meadow House Littleworth Mansfield and a £2.75m investment in new office facilities in Bassetlaw.

A council spokesman said: “Earlier this year outline planning consent was granted for the [Top Wighay] site.

“We are currently progressing the procurement of a developer for the residential element of the planned new village and continue to look at proposals for developing a new office building at the site.

David has been open about the reason why he went on the hit BBC dance show when he said he was enticed by former swimmer Mark Foster who was previously on the show in 2008.

When he was announced to be on it in 2019 David said: ""I’ve kept it a secret for so long. I told my mum and she put it up.

""I've been asked to do it a number of times and I had a chat with Fos [Mark Foster] and he said it’s an amazing experience a great show.

""I did have a practice go… I was knackered it was just doing the simple moves. I might start doing some dance art as opposed to the art of dancing.""

With incumbent Arun Kumar ’s term as chairman and CEO coming to an end early next year accounting firm KPMG has kickstarted the process of picking his successor  sources aware of the development said.The new chief will take over at a time when the Big Four audit firms are trying to grow their non-audit advisory businesses and gunning for market share in technology-related services.A 10-member board at KPMG India under Kumar will run the selection process and it has reached out to partners on the criteria used to evaluate the candidates.

Such was the festive offering at Peña Adobe Park Saturday where music roared dancing fascinated and roping and riding skills inspired.

Dozens gathered for the Peña Adobe Historical Society open house held in conjunction with National Hispanic Heritage Month.

Initially slated as part of Fiesta Days festivities the latter was recently cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns. But as they say the show must go on so it did.

Dancers with Juvenil Danzantes Unidos de Vacaville enthralled the crowd seated in a circle around the “stage area” on benches and home-brought chairs on mats and the lawn itself.

As the brilliant colors of the dancers’ clothing whirled and swirled visitors swayed to the lively music as well.

Meanwhile Francisco Pulido from Rancho El Zapotillo in Dixon with his horse Pirate wowed visitors with his expert roping and riding skills. Loud applause met the pair’s movements throughout their performance.

Throughout visitors wandered through the booths to learn more about the location’s history toured the Mowers-Goheen Museum and its expansive artifacts and roamed the nearby grounds.

Youths too energetic to sit still played throughout the park mingled with the abundance of doggies present and snacked on sugary churro bites from Fairfield-based Churro My Heart.

For many the event’s focus on Hispanic culture hit home.

“I brought my son out here because I don’t think he’s ever seen anything like this” said Marisa Carbonell of Vallejo of David 13.

Culturally she continued there aren’t many Hispanic-centric festivities in Solano so this event was very much appreciated.

“It makes me feel very proud” she said “It just fills me with pride.”

Lisa Fong of Sacramento had never been to the park. So to come on a day with music and dancing and more was a neat surprise.

“It’s always nice to see people’s cultural experiences” she shared. “We’re very pleased.”

Maria Woo of Fairfield enjoyed the fun on a mat in the shade.

Happy to be outdoors she was overjoyed by the fun.

“And for them to have it for free it’s beautiful” she said.

Kathi Fotinos of Vacaville accompanied by family described the event as significant.

“I love that we can do cultural stuff” she advised. “This is what California is all about and we should know our history.”

According to researchers in the last dozen years the range of the European mantis in Poland has increased significantly despite being listed as an endangered species.

Only in the northern part of the country the sight of this insect remains rare.

Professor Agnieszka Soszyńska-Maj president of the Łódź Branch of the Polish Entomological Society said: “We ask residents on social media to join the project of creating a map of the occurrence and observations of the European mantis in Łódź and its vicinity in a word to capture the sudden appearance of this unusual insect in our city. If someone notices a European mantis in their apartment on a balcony in a park on a meadow on a plot in a garden please take a photo (if possible) and enter the place and date in a post on the Facebook page of the Łódź Branch of the Polish Entomological Society (https://www.facebook.com/LodzPTE/).""

Łódź is an 'urban heat island' and the high temperatures of this summer and investments in 'flower meadows' may have contributed to a rapid increase in the occurrence of mantises.

Scientists emphasize that despite its large size the insect will not harm humans. Since the mantis is under protection they also ask not to interfere with its life condition. European mantis may not be caught or kept as a pet nor its cocoons with eggs removed. If an insect flies into the apartment it should be carefully taken outside.

For a representative of the Polish fauna the mantis is a large insect: females can grow up to 9 cm in length. It is a predator and uses its characteristic raptorial front legs to hunt larger insects usually locusts and grasshoppers.

Mantises are quite voracious. However despite the common belief that females eat males mating of these insects ends up in beheading the male in less than 30 percent cases.

Adults appear from August to October. After mating the female deposits an ootheca containing 100-200 eggs on a plant. The larvae emerge after wintering. Preying mantises are highly thermophilic insects they occur naturally in dry and warm mid-forest meadows grasslands heaths edges of pine forests in wastelands and fallow lands. Their slender shape and light green or yellow-brown colouration allow them blend well with the surroundings and they are difficult to spot in the nature. (PAP)

Drake’s “Certified Lover Boy” has been streamed millions and millions of times since it was released on Friday and the rapper’s new album is also inspiring an almost as impressive number of memes poking fun at its artwork.

The album art designed by British artist Damien Hirst features emoji of 12 pregnant women with different skin tones wearing different color tops.

Drake gave fans a sneak peek at the artwork last month on social media when he announced his sixth full-length studio album was dropping.

Rapper-singer Lil Nas X quickly announced his new album by posting an almost identical image featuring 12 pregnant men.

The floodgates opened after that as brands fans and haters came up with their own multi-colored memes.

The Maury Show weighed in on Friday by posting pictures of Maury Povich with the caption Certified “You ARE the Father” Boy – a play on the show’s often scandalous paternity test revelations.

The massive Samsung factory according to a proposal on file with Williamson County would have 6 million SF of buildings on a 1200-acre site owned by Samsung.

Some 1800 people would be employed at the computer chip factory to produce advanced semiconductors to meet global demand that has outstripped current supply and slowed industry including auto manufacturing.

The Taylor site is east of Interstate 35 and about 15 miles from the town of Round Rock where the Dell computer company is headquartered.

The addition of the Samsung factory would expand the technology center reputation of Austin which currently has facilities operated by Apple Advanced Micro Devices Oracle Google Facebook to name a few.

Samsung which hopes to break ground on a new chip factory in the first quarter of 2022 and start production in 2024 told the Austin Business Journal on Friday that it continues to consider several locations for the new plant. Nothing has been finalized with officials in Taylor.

Seoul-based Samsung has disclosed that it is considering sites in Arizona New York in South Korea and in Travis County (Austin) where it already has a factory.

The Taylor acreage is south of US Highway 79 and west of FM 973 in Williamson County.

“The county recognizes that development of the (Samsung) project will likely serve as an economic stimulus to the area resulting in significant job growth and increased tax revenue for the county the Taylor Independent School District and the City of Taylor Texas” says a draft of the county’s agreement.

The unsigned document called Williamson County Development Agreement outlines the obligations between the county and Samsung Austin Semiconductor LLC.

Roadways and infrastructure around the chip factory would be improved and tax incentives would be granted to Samsung.

Another large manufacturing facility a 4 million-SF Tesla factory is under construction in east Austin.

In the ’90s she was at the center of then-President Bill Clinton’s impeachment scandal after news of their affair was made public. Monica was just 22 years old at the time and she’s been very open about how difficult that time was for her. For a while the former White House intern was the punch line to just about every joke on late-night television and the subject of near constant criticism in the media.

These days Monica is owning her story (she’s a producer on Impeachment: American Crime Story) and speaking out about the unfair treatment she and other women faced from the mainstream media in the not-so-distant past. In a new interview with InStyle she compared her situation to the criticism Britney Spears faced in the media in the past.

“I think it’s long overdue and wonderful to see it happening for different women in different arenas and scenarios” she explained. “I made a mistake. Britney didn’t. There were other young women this happened to and there’s an enormous amount of collateral damage. So I think it’s not just an apology to a person; it’s an apology to how you’ve affected a culture. What is sexual agency? What does it mean? It’s not surprising that this de-objectifying of women is happening alongside the #MeToo movement. They braid together in a way that makes sense.”

In the interview Monica also revealed that she and Britney actually crossed paths IRL back in the early aughts and the brief encounter clearly made an impact.

“She was with Justin Timberlake and she was going into Henri Bendel just as I was leaving” she said of her Britney fangirl moment. “I had my handbag company at the time and she said she thought the bags were cute. I was beside myself so I got her some. But at that time I wasn’t able to have the perspective to recognize ‘Oh this is happening to other women.’ When the fat-shaming happened to Jessica Simpson [in 2009] I thought Oh okay. This didn’t just happen to me. This is happening now to other people too. Not that that’s a good thing.”

It’s definitely not a good thing especially when you consider the mental and emotional toll that public shaming and ridicule can have on a person. And if you haven’t considered that don’t worry because Monica has been *super* candid about that too.

“I have a friend I’ve known for 15 years and every time I see her she says ‘I can’t believe you’re still alive’” she explained. “Just having survived those past traumas. I’ve had a lot of growth in the last year in ways that I never would have expected.”

This week Columbus Ohio–based designer Catherine Williamson of Mix Design Collective tells us about how she and her husband Bryan Williamson got into the field with an eye toward paying down their debt; the moment they realized they were all-in on design; and how they’ve tracked their style evolution through a series of increasingly ambitious rental projects.

What was your path to starting your own firm?

So Bryan majored in interior design and construction management in college. I majored in accounting and was a CPA before I met him—I had no idea that that was in my future. I got my master’s degree in tax had my CPA license in New York and I was consulting for a big CPA firm.

So design officially entered your life through Bryan?

That’s right. I mean I grew up in a small house in New Jersey and my parents did an addition while I was in high school—I remember enjoying that process and getting to help decide on things like the couch was really exciting to me but I never thought anything of it other than “This is fun.”

How did you and Bryan meet?

One of Bryan’s really good friends went to college with me at Fordham and we met in New York when we were both doing summer internships. After that summer he went back to Ohio. About a year later he sent me a message randomly that was like “Hey the Fordham basketball team is in Ohio. I hope you’re doing well” or something like that. We started chatting online then emailing which led to phone conversations and then ultimately grew to us like making visits between New York and Ohio.

Bryan and I both graduated during the recession and at the time no one was hiring in the interior design field. No one was even building anything really and he was having a really hard time finding a job in Ohio. I was in New York still and I had my accounting job which was thankfully stable. And Bryan was like “Well maybe I’ll just move to New York and we’ll see what’s going on there. Maybe there’ll be some more opportunities there.” There still wasn’t much in the construction field but he ended up getting a job at a company building custom furniture.

How long did you stay in New York?

We lived in New York for a couple of years together but I was getting burned out at my job. My values were shifting and Bryan didn’t see a future at his job either—it was just a job. Plus the taxing nature of living in New York when you’re not making a ton of money was getting to us. Bryan coming from Columbus was like “We should move back. It’s really great there.” He had been keeping tabs on the things that were popping up there—new restaurants and just the development of the city as a whole and he was so excited about it.

We took a trip to visit his family there and we drove around some of the downtown areas that had all of these old houses. A lot of them needed to be renovated but we could see an energy there and the idea of fixing something up and bringing it back to life was really appealing to me. We started thinking “We could actually own a house here for less than we’re paying in rent in New York.” That’s what really sealed the deal. We moved to Columbus and bought our first house in January 2013.

What was the reno like on that first house?

I wouldn’t count the first house as actual design. Whatever we have developed today was completely unintentional—it was a passion that we were following and it ended up developing into a whole bunch of other things that we are now doing full-time. But then we were just tinkering and doing Pinterest projects.

How did that pivot into your business?

After moving to Columbus we had space—literally and figuratively—to process and enjoy life in a way that we hadn’t been able to in New York. It felt like we were on the hamster wheel and then we hopped off of it. We started evaluating different parts of our lives and one of them was our student loan debt and other debt which we hadn’t really put much thought into when we were living in New York. In order to pay that off we decided to list our spare bedroom on Airbnb which allowed us to pay our mortgage while still living in our house. We started having people come every other weekend then every weekend and that extra income allowed us to really go full force on paying off some of our debt. It ended up being a really in-demand location. And from our Pinterest tinkering it looked cute. It was the perfect way to make extra money without having to spend a ton more time working.

The goal was that if we can get rid of that debt we could have more flexibility in what kinds of jobs we needed to hold—because at the time we had such a high amount of debt that we were paying off every month it was almost equivalent to Bryan’s salary. We thought “If we can get rid of that debt we can have more freedom.” The house ended up becoming a full-house Airbnb and whenever we rented it out we would stay at a motel. But over the course of several months the motel ended up being like our second home because so many people were renting our house. We were finally like “What are we doing? This is stupid. We’re living in a motel.”

I’m guessing that was a very good financial proposition though.

It was. We were making so much progress on our debt which is why I think we were so focused on that—the light at the end of the tunnel was so big and so bright that it felt like whatever we had to do to get there it was no big deal. But we also realized that we could buy another house and pay less than we were paying to stay at that cheap motel. We ended up buying a fixer-upper of a duplex. The thought was to move into one half then renovate the other half to make some rental income while we were living in it while also continuing to rent out our first house. We thought it was just going to be a cosmetic remodel and that it would be very simple but it turned out to be a full gut renovation. We found roaches and mice and there was a dead cat in the furnace. It was one of those [properties] that a slumlord had tried to make look good—and not having any experience we thought that it was in good shape. It was baptism by fire. We remodeled the whole place which was our first real experience working through a renovation together.

I had started a blog called “Beginning in the Middle” and we started sharing our process there. We were sharing it on Instagram too and it was right when Instagram accounts started to really grow. As we did people started reaching out about doing their projects.

Mix Design Collective

What was the impetus for the blog? Was the idea that this could become a business?

I’ve always liked writing. I started blogging about six months after we moved and I liked sharing as we were doing our Pinterest projects. It was just the [act of] documenting it—in the process of blogging you’re forced to be present in the project that you’re working on and appreciate the progress. Having the blog throughout this whole journey has been awesome for that.

Fast-forwarding a bit what are all of the pieces of your business today?

We ended up buying a couple more properties between that disaster house and where we are now which happened in a span of three or four years. Those are all Airbnb rentals and that brand is The Village Host.

[All] of those rentals are our project houses where we’ve experimented and designed without limits. We just did what we were feeling so each one is like a capsule of where we were at that time—what we thought was cool and what we were gravitating toward. ... We look back at them now and they’re cute but I think we’ve evolved design-wise over the years.

And then the people calling about doing their design projects because of the blog—that led to a design firm?

Yes. Our design studio is called Mix Design Collective and that really ramped up when we were almost finished paying off our debt. We realized that if we could make just a little bit more money we could both quit our jobs. So we were like “Let’s start saying yes to people who are contacting us about their projects.”

We spent a couple of years really heavily building that. What we realized in doing both the Mixed side and The Village Host side was that we really enjoy being our own clients. So when we had our first daughter at the end of 2018 we made a decision to stop client work so that we could focus on her and finish the rentals that we had bought but hadn’t renovated while we were building up the design firm.

What was the moment when you realized you were all-in on this as a business?

When we both quit our jobs. This was definitely a side hustle until spring of 2017 and we did the majority of our property renovations while we both had day jobs. Once we both quit it was like “OK we’re in this now.”

Is there a world where you would be interested in client work again?

It has to be the right fit. We’re definitely not the right people for taking whatever comes our way. We’ve realized that we really put our whole selves into whatever project is in front of us so everything has to align and feel really good for us to want to do that.

What was that conversation like to determine if the client was a good fit?

Once a client contacted us we would reply to find out some more information about the project—and sometimes right off the bat it was obvious that it wasn’t a good fit. But if it seemed OK we would reply back with a PDF of all of our information—[it outlines] our process all of the services we offer how we work our price range and what you can expect from working with us. We just put it all out there. If they got back to us after [reading] that it was kind of like “OK this is the first little hurdle to get over to finding that perfect client.” After that we would have a phone conversation with them and chat more about their project and get an idea of whether we think it would be a good fit. Ideally we want to work with people we wouldn’t mind getting dinner with.

The other thing is that right now we’re a small team—it’s just Bryan and me plus some subs. So resource-wise if we’re putting ourselves into a new project then what are we not putting ourselves in on our own development side? We might try to do some consulting if we can find the time.

Is there a sense that this could grow into something where you have a whole team of employees or is keeping it small part of the appeal?

We would love to grow. We just want to do it organically and intentionally.

Can you tell me more about the design scene in Columbus?

It’s small and there are not a lot of design-forward places in commercial or residential. It’s starting to get that way but sometimes it feels like it’s a couple years behind. Some of the things that people are building now are still that industrial farmhouse look—things that were really in a couple years ago. I don’t think it’s just Columbus experiencing that. But we would love to see more clients wanting [more current designs] and the same with the restaurants that are popping up.

What is your biggest challenge right now?

Our latest project is an 1890s bed-and-breakfast that we bought earlier this year. It’s going to have nine guest suites. We are designing and renovating the whole thing and it’s a massive project that’s kind of reminiscent of our first disaster duplex—a property that appeared to be put-together. But it’s also been really fun and if this works it will hopefully be the start of more developments like this for us.

We’ve gotten the management part of Airbnb down to a science so most of the time things run smoothly. Of course when there’s one issue there’s 10 issues at once and that’s always really stressful. But we’re working on that. We recently hired someone to help us field those maintenance issues that come up and we are definitely hiring a manager for the bed-and-breakfast. But on the design side and contractor side it’s just the two of us. We’re just really open and try to communicate well. With this bed-and-breakfast project our goal was to be on the same page design-wise before we even started demo.

Was that not always how you worked?

It’s what we would advise any client but we never follow our own advice! But for this project we were like “We need to do this so that we’re not arguing throughout the entire renovation. Let’s just be super clear about what each of us wants and doesn’t want meet in the middle and go for that.”

How do the two of you typically divide up the responsibilities of the design work?

We actually collaborate a lot. I know a lot of couples who work together where they each pick a lane and don’t cross over but we totally do cross over. Bryan definitely handles the construction—if I’m involved with that I would be like a helper. He’s taught me a lot about tiling and trim and all that and I actually enjoy helping him with that stuff. Otherwise we hire that out. On the design side we’ll usually sit down together in the beginning and conceptually get on the same page and then I’ll be the one to execute it—I’m sourcing things and getting it to completion when it comes to all the details.

Mix Design Collective

What is the biggest thing you wish you would have known from the start of all of this?

Don’t be afraid to say no and don’t be afraid to change your course. If you feel like something is the right decision do it. We were [recently] in an episode of Point of View: A Designer Profile on the Magnolia Network which shares our whole story; I hope it inspires people to do things that they’re dreaming about doing—to just jump in and get started instead of trying to wait for the perfect moment because there probably never will be one.

When you look ahead where do you see the most opportunity to grow?

I think by hiring people. Right now we’re doing one project at a time and that’s great. But if we had a team what could we do? And it’s fun to dream about that. Our next thing is figuring out what kind of help we need. Management and maintenance are two things that we are doing that we would love to not do anymore.

And for Bryan—his internship was in custom furniture building when we first met and he’s always loved furniture design and I would love to design product lines and just kind of start building that side of our business as well. So we’ll see! We have no idea what this is going to look like for us but that stuff is sounding really fun so hopefully we can explore it.

Hidden cameras in a private space such as a bedroom or bathroom in an unfamiliar place like an Airbnb or other rental property are a nightmare for most people. However hacker and cybersecurity researcher Marcus Hutchins better known as MalwareTech posted a short video to TikTok explaining how to detect hidden cameras within an Airbnb or hotel. Using his simple tricks along with some of our own it is easy to keep your privacy at home and away.





Hutchins' Examples Of Hidden Cameras In Various Devices

Earlier this week Hutchins posted a short video explaining “How to find hidden cameras in AirBnBs” as part of his TikTok Q&A series. The first tip Hutchins mentions in this video is that you should keep an eye out for devices that are “conveniently placed where a creeper would want to look.” His example is a suspicious fire alarm directly above a bed which should be checked for hidden cameras.

Inexpensive Tools To Help You Scan For Spy Cams And Audio Devices

To ensure there are no cameras anyone can use a bright flashlight and keep an eye out for a blue-tinted reflection which would come from any size of camera lens. Another option is to turn out all the lights and use the front-facing camera on your phone to look for infrared LEDs that are used for night vision cameras. In his video demo Hutchins utilizes this trick to spot some IR lights on an alarm clock where the camera can also be seen shining a bright light through the reflective cover.Besides these tricks that Hutchins presented  there are other handy tactics you should be aware of such as dedicated tools for finding hidden cameras and microphones. These tools which run anywhere from $15 to $150 on Amazon use the same principles for finding cameras and can also detect RF signals from radio transmitting microphone bugs. You can see what using one of these would be like in the Modern Rogue video above where they test a budget recording device detectorThough all of this may seem like spy technology recording equipment is becoming smaller and more easily hidden especially in a large bedroom. Furthermore anyone can buy a hidden camera embedded in any gadget like a fire alarm or charging brick through Amazon at incredibly low prices. Thus being on the lookout for hidden recording devices outside of your home is never a bad idea when your privacy and dignity are at stake.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHkxMDAuY29tL3ZpcmFsL2FpcmJuYi1oaWRkZW4tY2FtZXJhLWhvdGVsLXJvb23SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to spot hidden cameras in AirBnb rooms,"Hotels and Airbnbs have their own catalogue of horror stories.

From accommodation being cancelled upon arrival to owners inviting themselves around for a spontaneous snack – all the way to creepy (and possibly illegal) incidents where cameras have been found disguised in household objects.

A former hacker turned to TikTok to teach his 117K followers users about cybersecurity. In one of Marcus Hutchins’ (@malwaretech) most-watched clips he shows fellow TikTokers how to detect if there are any hidden cameras in their vacation accommodation.

Marcus explains: “The first thing you are going to want to look for is devices that are conveniently placed where a creeper would want to look.

“Take this fire alarm for instance. It is placed right above the bed.

“One way to see if the device is a camera is to shine a bright light at it.

“If you hit a camera lens it’s going to get a blue-ish reflection.

“Now you can test this by shining a light at your phone and seeing how the camera looks when placed under a flashlight.”

The flashlight reveals a camera lens hidden in the fire alarm @malwaretech/TikTok

He then demonstrates how people can check small seemingly innocent items for cameras such as alarm clocks and USB chargers.

“This alarm clock is mirrored” he said ‘but if we shine a bright light at it we can see through the glass and see there is a camera there.

“This technique can also work on two-way mirrors.”

The tiny lenses can be hidden in seemingly innocent items @malwaretech/TikTok

“These cameras are really small as you can see here so they can be hidden in anything even a hole in the wall” he added.

The video which racked up 5.5 million views was inundated with concerned comments. “New fear unlocked” one said while another joked “Another reason to never leave my house haha.”

A third was curious as to why people hidden cameras around the accommodation: “Can someone explain to me what the purpose is? Do they just want to watch the tenants living their lives? Sleeping? Eating? Changing? What’s the point!”

Packing your portfolio with rapidly growing stocks is key but it's all too easy to buy growth stocks that fizzle out after a couple of quarters. If you want to become more wealthy over the next few years and beyond you'll need to identify companies that are supported by a handful of different trends and capabilities that reinforce their consistent and meaty growth.

All three of the healthcare companies I'll discuss today are highly successful and they're also escalating their revenue-making potential by building on their difficult-to-imitate products. While the largest gains will go to investors who hold these innovative companies for years they're also moving quickly enough to make the time between now and 2024 quite exciting so let's dive in.

1. Intuitive Surgical

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.32%) sells robotic surgery units to hospitals around the world and business is booming. Even amid the economic disruption of the pandemic the company increased its base of installed systems by 10% between June 2020 and the same period in 2021. That's a strongly positive sign for Intuitive's future as every installed robotic surgery system implies significant future revenue from maintenance and sales of fresh tools and accessories. In 2020 a stunning 77% of its revenue was recurring.

And the more procedures that the robots perform per year the more the hospitals end up spending. From the second quarter of 2019 until Q2 2021 the number of procedures performed by Intuitive's robots increased by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.5%. In terms of revenue that works out to a CAGR of 15% -- despite the near-total stoppage of elective surgical procedures amid the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

Moving forward Intuitive will be looking to increase the rate of new system installations to make up for lost time in 2020. All the while it'll be working on making new surgical tools and instruments to expand the range of procedures that its robots can perform. That will lead to higher revenue from existing customers and it might serve to attract new buyers too.

While competitors may be starting to make inroads into the robotic surgery market investors probably don't need to worry very much. Once hospitals have spent time and money training surgeons on a given surgical system there's a high cost to switch to a competing product so Intuitive can continue to make long-lasting headway even as competitors become more established.

2. Align Technology

Align Technology (ALGN -3.10%) makes invisible removable teeth straighteners that are comparable in function to braces. But the company's Invisalign-branded products are arguably much more aesthetically appealing than braces which is no small ingredient in its recipe for success.

By solving a key problem with a formerly dominant legacy product Align has had an easy time finding prospective customers and gaining market share. Internet searches for doctors capable of fitting patients for Invisalign increased by 82% year over year in Q2.

Align also sells imaging technology to dental care professionals which they can use to fit their patients for the company's straighteners. So it makes money first when customers want to have the ability to sell its main product and then again when customers buy cases of straighteners to distribute to patients. And sales are hot: In the second quarter of 2021 revenue from imaging systems rose by a whopping 20% sequentially and income from cases of aligners rose by 11.6% sequentially making for more than $1 billion in total revenue for the period.

Finally Align is slated to reward its shareholders by initiating an accelerated stock buyback program worth $75 million to speed up its existing buyback program that's budgeted for $1 billion. The accelerated buyback should be finished by late October so expect some upward pressure on the stock price between now and then.

3. DexCom

DexCom (DXCM -0.85%) develops continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for people with type 2 diabetes. Unlike the traditional finger-stick method for measuring a person's glucose level DexCom's CGMs use a disposable under-the-skin sensor that patients wear for 10-day intervals. Then the sensor uploads data to a smartphone app where patients can see their glucose levels in real time. That means patients can recognize when to take corrective action earlier thereby better protecting their health and comfort -- and without needing to prick their finger multiple times per day. And when patients exhaust their supply of wearable sensors they'll need to put in an order for another case. So there's a recurring component to DexCom's revenue base which helps it grow more consistently.

Much like with Align Technologies DexCom's product practically sells itself just because it doesn't have the fundamental flaws of the traditional option. Thus it's no surprise that the company's total revenue grew by 32% year over year to reach $595 million in the second quarter of this year. What's more management expects its gross profit margin to rise to 67% an even larger increase than it initially predicted for 2021.

Before the end of the year DexCom expects to launch the seventh edition of its CGM device. Meanwhile management will be proceeding with international sales efforts in new major markets including France Turkey and India. Its stellar product expanding revenue and strengthening margins provide quite a lot for investors to like and the next few years should be exciting for shareholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlock unlimited digital access to floridatoday.com Click here and subscribe today.

Three years ago Ken Ogden qualified for the national CrossFit Games while undergoing radiation therapy for skin cancer — and he finished in 20th place out of 20 competitors in his division.

""Dead last"" he describes.

The Indialantic gym rat subsequently lost his 2019 season to shoulder surgery after he tore his left rotator cuff. Then the COVID-19 pandemic struck wiping out last year's CrossFit Games masters divisions.

After months of epic workouts at CrossFit OwnIt in West Melbourne Ogden overcame long odds this year at the CrossFit Games in Madison Wisconsin. He made history by winning the newly created Men's 65+ division.

""You see him training alongside you. He's my father's age — and you literally forget that there's this guy who's in his late 60s now who's walking on his hands upside-down. It's almost unbelievable"" said Matias Rodriguez Ogden's coach and co-owner of CrossFit OwnIt.

""You start thinking 'Wow I know my dad can't do that.' And there's really no differences between my dad and Ken. It's just discipline. It's perseverance. And it's this mentality that CrossFit ingrains in you which is not accepting 'no' "" Rodriguez said.

""He's had every reason to quit. He's had his shoulder. He had cancer. He went through radiation. He's had Achilles (tendon) stuff. He had a bicep tear. These are things that he doesn't even mention that I remind him of"" he said.

Ogden who turned 67 last month won the grueling three-day CrossFit Games competition from July 27-29 at Alliant Energy Center.

Workouts included a 3-mile run 300-meter swim rope climb deadlifts dumbbell squats sandbag squats and pullups — for starters.

""Ken’s spirit and determination are what defines CrossFit athletes and participants anywhere"" said Justin Bergh CrossFit vice president of sports and partnerships.

""He accepted every challenge never gave up on himself and with the help of good coaches and a great community he was able to realize an audacious goal"" Bergh said.

""It’s especially impressive that he went from supporting the CrossFit Games as a volunteer to wearing a gold medal in such a short time"" he said.

Ogden swam freestyle and butterfly and played water polo at Auburn University. He has retired from teaching physical education and coaching swimming at Coastline Community School in South Patrick Shores and he now coaches a weekly group fitness class at Trinity Fitness Beachside in Indian Harbour Beach.

He joined CrossFit OwnIt in April 2017. That's the year he first attended the national CrossFit Games as a volunteer drawing inspiration to join the field of competitors.

He said his 2018 CrossFit Games last-place finish in the Men's 60+ division fueled his competitive fire.

""I really didn't feel like I belonged like I was out of my league. These guys are just killing it — and I'm just surviving"" Ogden recalled.

""But I was very motivated to come back and start working hard for 2019. But my shoulder never got better. I got an MRI and found I had a torn rotator cuff"" he said.

""So it took me out of the 2019 season. And honestly I was pretty down about that. And then we had the pandemic. But it is funny how things work out sometimes"" he said.

This marked the first year that CrossFit Games officials added 65+ age divisions for men and women. Bergh said these athletes are redefining what it means to age well with many becoming stronger faster and healthier each year.

Ogden said he focused on his diet and hired Sarah Findle nutrition coach at CrossFit OwnIt in the months leading up to the event.

The result? By ""eating cleaner"" and swapping out pizza bacon cheeseburgers and chocolate cookies for chicken rice vegetables and fruit he dropped from 181 pounds to 168. He stands 5 feet 9 inches tall.

Ogden also embarked on an eight-week training program with Rodriguez — featuring lots of handstand walks — to strengthen his shoulders and improve his overhead-squat numbers.

""One common attribute among champions in our sport is that they have great acceptance. They control what they are able to: how they eat how they train and who they surround themselves with. Then they take the challenges as they come"" Bergh said.

""In Ken’s case his training in the gym prepared him for his fights with cancer and injuries outside the gym. And that same mindset was on display in Madison as he never gave up and ended up on top"" he said.

Ogden has battled skin cancer since 2016: A squamous cell carcinoma tumor on his right cheek required surgery and 150 stitches.

Then in 2018 while qualifying for the CrossFit Games he underwent six weeks of radiation treatments for squamous cell carcinoma on his left cheek. He now has basal cell carcinoma on his nose and he will soon undergo surgery.

Ogden has been invited to compete at Wodapalooza a four-day CrossFit competition in mid-January at Bayfront Park in Miami. He vows to concentrate on improving his weaknesses for the 2022 CrossFit Games including snatches overhead squats and ""muscle-ups"" performed on a pullup bar.

""Anybody who would walk into this gym would think that he's chasing the younger guys he's trying to keep up with the young guys. The fact is that we're trying to keep up with him"" CrossFit OwnIt co-owner Matt Spaunburgh said.

""I mean he works out two three times a day. He even rides his bike to the gym from beachside from Indialantic. That's something that a youthful person does"" Spaunburgh said.

""We're just trying to keep up with him"" he said.

The 46-year-old Spanish singer-songwriter revealed the news to Ricky Martin and Sebastián Yatra and their millions of followers on Instagram during a live chat promoting their upcoming tour set to kick off later this month. Final is set to drop on Sept. 17.

“It might be my final album” the “Bailando” siner told them. “It’s not something that I have been thinking about for the past few months. It’s something that I have been thinking about for the past few years. There’s going to be Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 but they’re final. I’m in that moment in my life that chapter in my life where I think it’s the right time to put it out and I’ve been thinking about this since 2015.”

Although it might be his last album Iglesias reassured fans that it doesn’t mean he’ll stop making music. “I’m never going to stop writing songs because I love writing songs but I’m going to do it in a different way — meaning they don’t necessarily have to be packaged as an album — so this project to me is important.”

Final Vol. 1 will be Iglesias’ 11th studio album and will follow 2014’s Sex and Love which peaked at No. 1 on Billboard‘s Top Latin Albums chart (dated April 4 2014).

Most recently Iglesias teamed up with Farruko for the summer gem “Me Pasé” which was released in July and became his first single since 2019. The reggaeton-infused rhythmic anthem is the first track off Iglesias’ Final Vol. 1 which will drop just days before his North American tour with Martin and Yatra kicks off in Las Vegas on Sept. 25.

Though it’s important to clean out a flooded basement quickly to avoid mold growth there are other important steps to take first according to experts.

According to Allstate the first thing homeowners should do after a flood is to check for gas leaks and loose power lines – without touching them. If there are any contact your utility company.

8 COUNTIES IN THESE 3 STATES ACCOUNTED FOR HALF OF FLOOD CLAIMS IN 2020: REPORT

Homeowners should also check the foundation for cracks or obvious damage. If it seems unsafe or if there’s water standing next to the outside of the house walls Allstate says people should not enter their homes.

Before entering your home make sure to turn off the gas and electricity Allstate says.

According to the EPA homeowners should make sure to take pictures of their homes and belongings for insurance purposes.

HURRICANE TIPS FOR FLOODING HIGH WATER

Here’s what else you need to know about cleaning up your flooded home.

Wear protective gear

To clean up any flood damage the EPA recommends wearing an N-95 mask to avoid breathing in mold rubber gloves and goggles to keep out dust and small particles. The American Red Cross also recommends wearing long sleeves and long pants and boots or work shoes.

Don’t pump water out too quickly

If there is still water in your basement FEMA says homeowners should not pump it all out immediately because the floor could crack and the walls could collapse with the quick change in pressure.

Instead FEMA recommends that homeowners follow its ""recommended rate to pump"" by drawing down one foot of water waiting 24 hours drawing down another foot of water and waiting another 24 hours.

IDA REMNANTS CAUSE AMTRAK TO CANCEL SERVICE BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND BOSTON

If the water level remains down after those steps you can draw down 2-3 feet of water every 24 hours according to FEMA.

Once your basement is empty of water FEMA says homeowners should ""act fast"" on clean up.

""Time is critical to combat the threat of mold which can appear in one or two days"" FEMA says.

Clean out items debris

According to Allstate homeowners should first find their ""irreplaceable"" items and put them in an elevated and dry place.

According to Allstate homeowners should also remove all debris and mud – which ""may contain many health hazards"" – from their home and make some repairs like patching any holes in the roof walls or windows check for broken pipes and brace sagging floors and ceilings.

The American Red Cross says homeowners should throw out any food beverages or medication that has come into contact with flood waters as well as any items that absorb water that can’t be cleaned or disinfected such as mattresses carpeting cosmetics stuffed animals and baby toys.

According to FEMA ""all wet materials mud and debris must be removed to the outside of the house.""

Dry out your home

The EPA recommends opening all doors windows cabinets and drawers to give your home some airflow to help it dry out.

""When electricity is safe to use use fans and dehumidifiers to remove moisture"" the EPA says.

According to FEMA homeowners should cut away wet wallboard and insulation ""at minimum one foot above the high water line."" They should then ""scrub every surface touched by contaminated water"" and make sure there aren’t hidden pockets of water.

""Vacuum any remaining water and run fans and dehumidifiers"" FEMA says.

The EPA recommends drying your home and everything in it ""as quickly as you can"" within 24 or 48 hours of possible.

Clean all mold

To clean mold FEMA recommends mixing 1.5 cups of bleach per gallon of sudsy water and spraying the mixture on any mold before using a stiff brush on the mold.

""Let the affected area air dry"" FEMA says. ""If it takes a week for visible moisture to dry it will take at least another week for unseen parts to dry.""

HURRICANE IDA: FOOD STORES STRUGGLE TO REMAIN STOCKED AMID SHORTAGE

""Treat again as necessary"" the agency says on its website.

According to the EPA mold cleanup must be complete before you can move back into your home to avoid health issues such as asthma attacks eye and skin irritation and allergic reactions.

Here are a few observed-from-the broadcast observations from the game.

Skylar Thompson is back

Thompson who missed the last seven games last year with a shoulder injury was on point from the start completing 9 of 14 passes for 144 yards and running for two touchdowns. The only negative an end zone interception on the first possession.

He also led a Wildcat offense that amassed 344 yards total offense.

Vaughn the Wildcats' sophomore running back was held in check by Stanford for much of the game. But all he needed was one touch to remind fans why he was a breakout star last year as a true freshman. His 59-yard touchdown run on a third-and-long in the second quarter put K-State up 14-0.

He had another long run late in the game called back on a holding penalty.

Vaughn finished with 13 carries for 124 yards.

Wildcat defense came to play

K-State's defense featuring seven new starters clearly has upgraded from a year ago. The Wildcats shut down one Stanford drive inside the 25-yard line in the second half with sacks from Eli Huggins and Khalid Duke and got interceptions from Louisville transfer Russ Yeast and redshirt freshman TJ Smith who missed much of last year with a knee injury.

Linebacker Cody Fletcher and end Spencer Trussell also recorded sacks.

New kicker Taiten Winkel solid

Taiten Winkel who won the place-kicking job in preseason was perfect in his debut kicking a 40-yard field goal that made it a three-possession game in the fourth quarter and made all three extra points.

Google has announced the general availability of offline viewing for all file types in Google Drive on the web.

The new feature lets you access PDFs images Microsoft Office documents and other non-Google files even without an internet connection.

It's gradually rolling out to all Drive users and should be live for everyone by next week.

In early 2019 Google began testing an option in Google Drive's web version that lets you make all file types such as PDFs images office Microsoft Office documents available for offline viewing. Now that feature has come out of beta.

Google has announced the general availability of offline mode in Drive on the web. The new capability allows everyone to mark all file types accessible even without an internet connection. It comes in handy for people who frequently travel to areas where internet connections can get spotty. Previously only Google files including Docs Sheets and Slides can be made available to access offline.

The company is now moving cargo for outside customers in its latest move to compete directly with FedEx and UPS .

""They want to be a new kind of U.S. Postal Service where everything can get everywhere but also quickly"" said e-commerce consultant Chris McCabe who was a seller performance investigator at Amazon from 2006 to 2012.

Amazon said in its first-quarter earnings report that capital expenditures were up a whopping 80% from a year earlier helping it increase capacity of its in-house logistics network by 50% year over year. According to SJ Consulting Group Amazon is now shipping 72% of its own packages up from 46.6% in 2019.

In 2014 Amazon started building its global transportation network from scratch. Seven years and 10 billion deliveries later Amazon now has 400000 drivers worldwide 40000 semi-trucks 30000 vans and a fleet of more than 70 planes. Perhaps the biggest investment so far is the new $1.5 billion Amazon Air hub that opened in Kentucky in August.

For outside merchants Amazon already offers a variety of shipping services. In the U.K. Amazon has a ""logistics as a service"" program — a business model that researchers from DePaul University predict Amazon will launch in the U.S. in the next 18 months while Morgan Stanley predicted it could happen this year. According to one investigation Amazon has already begun quietly transporting cargo on its planes for the U.S. Postal Service although analysts say it won't try to replicate the vast array of services offered by FedEx and UPS.

""They're not going to be just this blanket carrier that will deliver whatever package that you want them to to whatever address"" said Dan Romanoff who researches Amazon for Morningstar. ""Amazon is sort of cherry-picking their routes. They want to run and sort the parcel sizes they want to deliver.""

Amazon's algorithms also allow sellers to take advantage of LTL (less than load) truck space at discounted rates while allowing Amazon to make money on otherwise wasted space. Amazon seller Keith Gregory just started using the program called Amazon Freight. Gregory's vitamin and supplement company Highland Laboratories is based in a 3500-person town in Oregon and does about $4 million of annual sales on Amazon. Gregory says Amazon charges up to $1700 less than FedEx or UPS for some of his routes from Oregon to Southern California.

""For us being in a rural community the fact that somebody is willing to cater to us and they're willing to accommodate pick-up schedules and not just say 'Okay we'll be there every day at 3:30' is also very attractive too. So not just not just the rate piece but the fact that they're also willing to use their vast fleet of vehicles to help us with our logistics as well which UPS and FedEx are not cooperative in that sense"" Gregory said.

Amazon also offers its Fulfilled By Amazon or FBA services for orders not made on Amazon.com which explains why some orders from eBay Walmart and others arrive at your door in Amazon packaging.

""There were points in time in our company's existence where really Amazon shipped 100% of our orders for all channels"" said Amazon seller Bernie Thompson who uses what Amazon calls multi-channel fulfillment for many of the consumer electronics sold by his company Plugable Technologies.

""If you go today and buy a Plugable product on eBay it's actually going to be coming from an Amazon warehouse and very often delivered by an Amazon delivery service"" Thompson said.

Former Amazon product safety manager Rachel Greer says the current shipping expansion is reminiscent of other times Amazon has used immense resources and data to disrupt an industry such as with Prime Video and Amazon Web Services.

""I was part of the process for making sure that FBA sellers were compliant more than a decade ago. And they were like 'Well we have excess capacity. Let's use it'"" Greer said. ""And then when AWS started we had excess capacity. Let's use it. So of course if Amazon develops a platform it works well and of course if it's going to have excess capacity they're going to try to sell it to someone.""

The deal if it goes ahead would see Amazon channel millions of dollars to Johnston beneficiaries — particularly in the police and fire departments — through separate agreements with the retailer while trimming its property tax bill.

Rhode Island has agreed to put money into road work on Route 6 that will help speed Amazon trucks between the new warehouse and points across the state.

On the other end Amazon will contribute to economic development programs run by Gov. Dan McKee's administration.

Giant new Amazon warehouses have been sprouting up across the country as brick-and-mortar retail gives way to online shopping delivered by truck.

Town planners signed off on preliminary designs for the multistory warehouse earlier this summer. It would be built on nearly 200 acres of forested land near the Route 6 ramps to Route 295.

Documents filed with the secretary of state's office in advance of a Sept. 15 Johnston Town Council meeting on the project outline the agreement town officials struck with the retailer.

The agreements confirm Amazon is behind the warehouse project an open secret for months despite town officials referring to the company by a code name.

Amazon expects to spend around $290 million building the distribution center and employ 1500 people there when it is up and running according to the documents posted online Friday.

What Amazon would pay to Johnston and the state

And it has agreed to make a series of payments to Johnston and the state for various public causes ranging from the town senior center and youth sports to road work and police. If added together these contributions could exceed $12 million over 20 years according to copies of the agreements filed with the secretary of state's office.

They are:

$100000 for a traffic study of the impact of the warehouse;

Up to $1 million for road work recommended by the traffic study;

$1.25 million over five years to the state for ""Rhode Island Municipal Education and Training Programs"";

$5.4 million over 10 years to Johnston public safety operations;

$50000 to Johnston youth sports;

$100000 to the Johnston Senior Center;

$250000 to the Johnston Municipal Land Trust;

$100000 for Johnston Memorial Park; and

$2.75 million over 20 years to the Rhode Island Small Business Assistance Program.

The agreement also includes payments of $583000 per year for 20 years to create an Amazon ""P-TECH"" job training program at Johnston High School plus $400000 to get the program started. (This would be $10.6 million over 20 years but it is unclear if the town or Amazon is the primary beneficiary.)

Public hearing set for Sept. 15 at Johnston High School

The Johnston Town Council has scheduled a special public hearing on the Amazon deal on Wednesday Sept 15 at 7 p.m. at Johnston High School.

Under the tax treaty agreement Amazon's annual property tax bill starting in January 2024 will be $5.7 million and will rise to $9.1 million in 2044. Johnston currently collects $60000 per year on the undeveloped land.

An estimate of how much the company would have paid without the tax treaty known as a tax stabilization agreement is not included in the documents.

Under typical treaties a property owner planning a major construction project will be allowed to pay a percentage of the tax bill that would normally be charged to the new development. But the resolution does not say what percentage of the regular tax bill Amazon will pay under the treaty.

Part of the agreement with Amazon includes the state Department of Transportation which has agreed to pay $2.7 million toward highway work on Route 6 presumably to speed the flow of Amazon trucks to the new warehouse. It's unclear what the full cost of the roadwork would be but Amazon has agreed to pick up the balance of the cost according to the documents.

The robin's-egg-blue lockers shared a self-service screen and displayed the e-commerce giant's ubiquitous smile logo.

The problem according to a Fresno city councilmember's complaints last November was that they were placed along a poorly lit side of the building out of sight of security cameras. It was easy to predict what happened next: Someone tried to get into the lockers.

The attempted break-in should've been a facepalm moment for Amazon says the councilmember Miguel Arias because that unmonitored location was sure to tempt criminals. The lockers could collectively hold thousands of dollars of merchandise far more alluring than the inexpensive bags of ice typically found in vending machines in front of the pumps.

""I don't know how they landed on a gas station"" Arias said of Amazon's decision to install the lockers. ""It's where you get a beer on your way home after hours not a place where you go to get your $500 iPhone.""

After Arias raised his concerns the Fresno City Council voted to prevent the developer responsible for the convenience store a local chain called Johnny Quik from installing Amazon lockers at a new store he sought to build in another location. The company didn't respond to a request for comment.

Fresno isn't alone in experiencing frustration with Amazon lockers as the company installs them across the country to thwart thieves looking for its easy-to-recognize packages on neighborhood stoops. Chicago residents were baffled in August when a set of Amazon lockers were installed directly on walkways in two city parks partially obstructing paths and adding corporate branding to leafy municipal amenities. Photos of the lockers were widely shared on Twitter and Reddit. Businesses have also had second thoughts after striking deals to host the lockers.

The Chicago conflict taps into larger objections to corporate intrusion onto public property. Corporate names have been added to subway stations and high school sports stadiums. Even the National Parks Service has pondered naming benches and interior spaces after corporate donors. Transit agencies cover buses and fill train stations with ads.

An Amazon smile in a Chicago park might strike some as a small if obtrusive element of the tapestry of corporate messaging already in the public sphere. Still activists and civic planners question whether parks should be added to the list of corporate logo-filled locations. Park space is supposed to serve everyone not just Amazon customers said Jennifer Minner a professor of city and regional planning at Cornell University.

""Installing lockers that essentially serve people who are spending money is taking away a broader public benefit that serves more people"" Minner said.

Most locker placements are uncontroversial and lockers at bus depots and 7-Elevens rarely raise eyebrows. Nevertheless an awkwardly located locker plays into a broader image problem Amazon has had in managing local relations. The company has been blamed for putting Main Street booksellers and local retailers out of business with predatory low pricing. And community activists have raised concerns about working conditions for Amazon's subcontracted delivery drivers and at its warehouses -- which are sometimes set up in the disused malls it's blamed for putting out of business.

Amazon didn't provide information about whether it implements safety and crime prevention measures around its outdoor lockers or whether that's the responsibility of the organizations hosting the lockers. But Av Zammit an Amazon spokesman said in a statement that the company values community feedback. Amazon is reviewing the locker placement in Chicago ""to ensure they are all located in appropriate areas that serve both customers and the community"" he said.

Amazon spokesperson Alyssa Bronikowski provided further comment. ""We have been working closely with the Chicago Park District since 2020 to add Amazon Lockers following requests from the district for this added benefit for the community"" she said. ""The focus of our partnership has been to provide park patrons and community members with access to a secure and convenient delivery option.""

Amazon launched its lockers 10 years ago in Seattle New York state and the Washington DC area. Since then the lockers have been part of its Amazon Hub service which includes Whole Foods locations where Amazon customers can pick up their packages at the counter. As of 2019 Amazon said it had installed lockers in more than 900 cities and towns in the US.

Some high-rise apartments also have lockers installed so tenants don't have to wait at home for a delivery or depend on an apartment manager to give them their packages. Amazon Locker Plus locations offer self-service kiosks as well as an Amazon attendant to help. UPS also offers delivery lockers with its Access Point Program and some third-party companies offer lockers that accept packages from multiple carriers. Walmart installed parcel lockers in its own stores but recently began phasing them out.

Locking out porch pirates

Amazon markets the locker installations as a way to combat porch piracy another problem the company helped create. The lockers also serve as a source of income for public agencies and businesses that host them though in many cases the rent Amazon pays isn't disclosed. In Jacksonville Florida for example Amazon partnered with the transportation authority to install lockers at bus terminals and transportation hubs. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment.

The company struck a similar arrangement in Johnson County Kansas with local 7-Eleven stores. 7-Eleven didn't respond to a request for information on how it handles the safety of outdoor lockers.

Neither partnership has prompted complaints about safety or vandalism.

Still the placement of Amazon lockers hasn't always gone smoothly. Staples and RadioShack ended agreements with the company in 2013 removing a service that had invited a competitor into their stores. A set of lockers at Sacramento State University in California was removed two months after it was installed in 2014 because the campus bookstore had the exclusive right to serve as a bookseller at the college.

Few installations have gone as poorly as a recent placement in Chicago's Brands Park.

In photos posted online one monolithic segment of lockers appears to consume roughly a third of the walkway and create a blind corner. The placement is near a fence that would make it difficult for a delivery person to unload a dolly of packages while still leaving room for park visitors to get by especially a visitor who's in a wheelchair or pushing a stroller.

Community members quickly objected. A petition calling for the removal of the lockers appeared on Change.org and racked up more than 13000 signatures. (The goal was 15000.) Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez who represents the ward that includes the park complained about the corporate logo marring public property even though the city was getting rent for the placements.

Rodriguez-Sanchez said on Twitter that the Amazon-branded behemoths are ""a slap in the face"" in part because they would net the parks department roughly $137600 in the first year at most.

The lockers have been removed from Brands Park as well as another Chicago park. The program which had already led to the installation of lockers in 49 parks and aimed for a total of 102 lockers locations is on hold while the parks department reviews Amazon's plans.

There's also the question of how safe Amazon customers might feel going to a park after work potentially in the dark to pick up a valuable package. In Fresno city councilmember Arias said the lockers at the Johnny Quik have become an amenity for his constituents because the convenience store increased safety by installing additional lighting and security cameras. Still he wondered how no one thought of that concern to begin with.

""You can credit Amazon for a lot of innovation in their logistical delivery system"" Arias said. But the initial installation showed ""a lack of understanding of the local community."""

Since there was a schedule change (by a few minutes) between when I put the reservation on hold and when I was ready to ticket I had to call an agent rather than issuing the award online.

Three days passed and I never got a ticketing email. The awards still showed as being ‘On Request’. So I rang up American to fix the problem. The agent naturally first told me there was no problem but that’s obviously wrong.

Partner award travel doesn’t get ticketed right away but it usually happens in a few hours or overnight.

It’s not for travel right away and they’ll prioritize immediate travel. There may well be a backup in the ticketing queue. But it does not take three days .

. Every time I’ve ever had an award not ticketed after three days it’s because something is wrong (easily fixable).

There were schedule changes and American wouldn’t ticket until the schedule changes were accepted. These were just a change to flight times of 10-20 minutes and they’d taken place before I had requested ticketing. The agent I gave my credit card for taxes to didn’t clean up the reservations so they simply sat unticketed.

When award tickets fall out of the queue do not expect American Airlines to do anything about it proactively. Don’t even expect them to tell you. Watch for the ticketing email or check your account to see that the status of the reservation has changed to ticketed in order to ensure your reservation is all set.

Don’t get me wrong this is a minor complaint in the scheme of things for me. I know what I’m doing. A simple phone call got the reservations cleaned up and ready for ticketing. But most people think that when you ticket an award you have an award ticket. But that isn’t quite the case.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA5LzA0L2NvbXBhbmllcy1yZXNwb25zZS10ZXhhcy1hYm9ydGlvbi1iYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Dell Hewlett Packard among firms declining to comment on Texas abortion ban,"An array of large American companies with ties to Texas have declined to stake out a position on the state’s strict new abortion ban a stark contrast with corporate America’s recent willingness to speak out on racial justice  voting rights and other polarizing social issues.

Alaska Airlines Takes Middle Road On Employee Vaccinations,"Alaska Airlines will not require its existing employees to be vaccinated or fine them for choosing to forgo the jab. However those employees will be subject to “regular” testing and other restrictions. In leaving it up to employee is Alaska taking a courageous position or a cowardly one?

Alaska Airlines Takes Cautious Approach To Employee Vaccinations

In one corner are carriers like United Airlines and Frontier which require all employees to be vaccinated. With full FDA authorization granted for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (now known as Comirnaty) United employees have until September 27th to be fully vaccinated of face termination.

On the other end American Airlines has encouraged its employees to get vaccinated but left it totally up to them with no mandate or even testing requirements.

Between the two Delta Air Lines will not require existing employees to be vaccinated but will fine them $200/month if they take part in company-sponsored healthcare and withhold COVID pay if they contract COVID-19 and are not vaccinated.

Alaska Airlines is taking a slightly different approach. Employees who choose not to vaccinated will:

face “regular” mandatory testing

participate in a vaccine education program

not receive special COVID pay

Employees who are vaccinated will receive a $200 bonus. Furthermore all new hires must be vaccinated.

One Mile At A Time calls the policy “disappointing” and asks:

“I don’t really get the message that Alaska Airlines is trying to send here either. The company states it’s committed to protecting employees and guests agrees vaccination is the best way to do that the vaccine now has full approval yet the airline won’t require vaccination? I don’t understand the disconnect here…”

Those are reasonable concerns and his logic is sound. I think the missing issue is the litigation that Alaska does not want to deal with. U.S. federal law actually leaves room for tremendous personal autonomy when it comes to vaccines and religious exemptions need only be sincere not even necessarily reasonable or proven through past practice.

During the pandemic we have seen certain churches push back against neutrally-applicable restrictions to gathering on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment free exercise clause. Los Angeles County has spent millions of dollars paying legal fees for churches its sued to stop indoor worship during the pandemic. The Supreme Court has said to stay “hands off” religion. My hunch is that the same legal logic will be applied to employer-initiated vaccine mandates for those who push back on religious grounds.

(In that sense I think United is eventually going to roll over to employees who refuse even on vague religious grounds or face many lawsuits.)

Thus I don’t see the Alaska position as courageous as much as it is realist and practical. That said I do think that Delta’s policy has a lot more teeth while still falling within the current First Amendment jurisprudence.

CONCLUSION

Alaska Airlines will only hire new employees who are vaccinated and will subject current employees who refuse the COVID-19 to regular testing. While such a policy appears weak for an airline that voices full support for the vaccine it likely recognizes the practical legal boundaries that we are only beginning to see.

Airline employees have access to non-revenue travel meaning you'll only get a seat if there's space available. For those who like a good gamble showing up to the airport without a confirmed seat can be thrilling yet incredibly nerve-wracking.

Back in summer 2019 — also known as the golden year for air travel — I was an intern at JetBlue Airways. One of the perks was standby travel and during those 10 weeks I wanted to take full advantage of my (short-lived) benefits. Overall it was a success as I flew more than 30 times that summer with seven of those flights on the coveted JetBlue Mint business class.

During my internship I learned a lot about standby travel and the airline industry as a whole. While standby travel is certainly not for the faintest of hearts there are ways to get good at it and mitigate stress from all of the uncertainty.

How standby travel works as an airline employee

I was an intern in JetBlue's headquarters in Long Island City New York. (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy)

Whether you're a pilot flight attendant gate agent or even an intern you may have standby travel privileges that get you free flights on the airline you're working for and (potentially) on partner airlines. While you can travel for free within the 50 U.S. states any international taxes and fees will apply if you're flying out of the country.

While most airlines rank employees based on seniority and role JetBlue full-time and part-time employees were ranked on a priority list based on their check-in time. Occasionally JetBlue employees could get one-time priority passes and jump to the top of the standby list bypassing other employees on the ranking.

However as an intern I was on the same priority level as seasonal employees which meant that we were grouped under all full-time and part-time staff but above partner airline employees. Regardless of your place on the list all non-revenue travelers must show up at the gate and wait to be issued a ticket. If the flight was considerably empty the gate agent may go ahead and ticket you at the start of the boarding process. But if the flight only had a few seats left — or was completely full — all non-revenue passengers must wait until the end of the boarding process for standby seats to clear.

With this much uncertainty it's essential that you only travel with a carry-on or personal bag as you never know which flight you'll end up taking that day. Since I only had free time to travel on weekends this wasn't a problem as I never needed to check a bag in the first place.

All summer I made sure to travel light with nothing bigger than a carry-on bag. (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy)

Since JetBlue only offers paid upgrades to its passengers it was easy for non-revenue flyers to snag Even More Space (EMS) seats or even Mint seats on qualifying routes. Interns only had access to JetBlue-operated flights but full-time employees could fly standby on partner airlines as well widening the opportunities for international trips.

Finally in terms of dress and behavior you're supposed to blend in with the rest of the crowd while looking neat and polished. For example you're not allowed to wear flip flops or sweatpants as a non-revenue passenger.

Your standby benefits extend to immediate family

At JetBlue your standby benefits as a full-time employee extend to your immediate family (spouse dependent children and parents). Airline employees will also get buddy passes throughout the year handing them out to extended family or friends.

My mom and I went on some cool trips that summer including to San Francisco. (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy)

As an intern I could extend my travel privileges to my parents and one designated travel companion. I brought my mom with me on several trips that summer and I think she enjoyed the standby privileges as much as I did.

How to work the odds in your favor

Now that I've given a brief rundown here's how you can work standby travel in your favor. While some of it's luck there's actually more strategy involved.

First I had access to a separate website where I'd book non-revenue tickets and monitor flight loads in real time. For example my new intern friend Peter and I wanted to start easy. That means we weren't interested in flying a competitive route such as New York (JFK) to Los Angeles (LAX) from the get-go.

Instead we picked New York (JFK) to Nantucket on the first flight of the day — 7:10 a.m. We checked the flight loads the night before and since there were 60+ empty seats we knew we could hop on this flight with no issues. We were ticketed as soon as we arrived at the gate.

There's no better feeling than getting your seat confirmed when you're on standby. (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy)

A perk of standby travel that I hadn't considered before is that you have flexibility in your travel plans. We did a quick day trip in Nantucket and there were plenty of flights going back to New York that day (JFK and LGA). While we were initially intending on leaving around dinnertime we decided to hop back on the flight around 4 p.m. so we could get back to Manhattan earlier.

On my way home from San Diego I wanted to try out Mint for the first time but there were only a few seats left and a long list of standby passengers. Instead I decided to book a flight to Boston-Logan International Airport (BOS) to snag a Mint seat and then jumped on a flight from Boston to New York (LGA).

What happens when there's not a seat available

Out of the 30+ flights I took that summer I was denied boarding only once. Those are some pretty good odds especially since the summer is the busiest travel season and full of bad weather delays.

My mom and I wanted to fly to Los Angeles so we picked the first flight of the day that had about 15 seats the morning of. With other higher priority employees on the list there was only one seat left. My mom took the last seat while I hopped on standby for the next flight that left just an hour later and we finally met up at the airport.

There are several other instances where seats may fill up last minute. For example delays and cancellations can lead to rebooking on later flights during the day — so that flight with 30 seats available might be snatched up by revenue passengers. That's why it's important to monitor the flight loads religiously check the forecast and see where the aircraft is coming from or going since numbers can change last minute.

Standby travel is also a game of exercising patience as gate agents are often overworked when it comes to delays and cancellations. We were advised to never go up to the gate until boarding has finished as you'll want to stay out of the way as much as possible.

Several interns and I flew to St. Martin at the end of the summer. To ensure that we'd all get back to New York some of us took the earlier flight home while the others took the later flight. No matter how many seats are available it's always stressful not to have a confirmed ticket so splitting up helped us travel together without leaving one of us stranded.

Spontaneity is the spice of life

Thanks to JetBlue offering free in-flight Wi-Fi I could then plan the rest of my trip once I got a confirmed seat and was en route to my destination. Depending on where I was going I would only bring enough clothes for a day trip. I would look at last-minute hotels or Airbnbs on the flight.

On the ground I would spend most of my time walking spending time on the beach or exploring restaurants in the area. Standby travel is an entirely different way to travel than I've ever experienced.

Bottom line

As someone who's quite spontaneous already I loved the thrill of non-revenue travel and exploring a new destination for a fraction of the cost. However as I returned to a ""normal"" paying passenger I also enjoy the peace of mind that comes with a confirmed booking and the ability to earn points and miles and work toward elite status."

The number of EVs on the road continues to rise nationwide including the Southeast. But our region lags the national average in growth. What's going on here?

The Positive News

Every month sales of electric vehicles or EVs have been rising across the Southeast and the pace is not slowing. A total of 206000 electric vehicles have been sold in the six states as of July(21). That's 46% more EVs on the road than a year ago double the number of 2018 and four times 2015.

""The momentum is there"" says Nick Nigro of Atlas Public Policy which compiled the report for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. ""Similarly charging deployment is up considerably. About a third or so of all charging stations in the Southeast have been deployed in the last year or so.""

Atlas EV Hub / Southern Alliance for Clean Energy

Growth Lags

However even as sales numbers rise in the Southeast they're not keeping pace with national trends says Nigro. The U.S. as a whole has 6.1 electric vehicles per 1000 people. But none of the six southeastern states in the report is close to that. Georgia (4.8 per 1000) and Florida (4.74) lead the region in adoption. North Carolina is at 2.85 and South Carolina is at 1.57 per thousand.

And installation of electric vehicle chargers is not keeping pace either. As of July the U.S. had 0.36 charging ports installed per 1000 people. Among the six southeastern states in the Atlas study only Georgia with 0.35 per thousand comes close. North Carolina is 0.25 and South Carolina is 0.16.

Why Does It Matter?

The federal Environmental Protection Agency says the transportation sector is the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. accounting for 29% of emissions. Putting more electric vehicles on the road is an important way to reduce emissions. So federal and state leaders have set targets for expanding the use of EVs.

On Aug. 5 President Biden issued Executive Order 14037 that sets a voluntary goal of having 50% of all new vehicles sold in 2030 be electric or plug-in hybrid. Right now only about 2% of cars sold are EVs. And North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has said he wants 80000 electric vehicles on state roads by 2025. That would be a big leap from July's total of 29270.

Atlas EV Hub / Southern Alliance for Clean Energy

Why The Lag?

Sales of EVs are helped in part by federal tax credits of up to $7500. There's also a $1000 tax credit for installing a charging station. But if you live in another part of the country the incentives don't stop there.

State tax credits and other incentives are likely behind faster sales elsewhere. California for example has its own tax credits (up to $7000for electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) and a $1500 ""clean fuel reward"" to spur adoption of EVs. And there are local incentives too: Some cities around the country offer local rebates for buying EVs or installing chargers.

Tesla has a handy state-by-state chart.

But in the Southeast no state offers any tax credit or financial incentives for buying EVs. And incentives from utilities or local governments are scarce.

Stan Cross electric transportation policy director at the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy said if southeastern states want to expand the use of EVs they need to adopt incentives that have been proven to drive sales elsewhere.

""We're beginning to see best practices and case studies emerge from other places in the country that we can begin to deploy here in the Southeast"" he said.

So far legislatures and policymakers across the Southeast haven't jumped on the bandwagon even though their states have ambitious climate goals that require actions like expanding electric vehicle use.

What States Are Doing

Most southeastern states are doing one thing to help: Spending money from their states' multimillion-dollar settlements with Volkswagen over software that helped vehicles cheat on diesel emissions tests. Over the past 12 months Southeastern states (except Georgia) spent $102 million from the Volkswagen settlement on EV-related initiatives. According to the Atlas report states spent the largest portion of the funds over the past year to buy electric school buses and most of the rest to help expand vehicle charging networks.

Meanwhile electric utilities are offering their own plans to expand vehicle charging and fund other EV programs. In North Carolina Duke Energy in June proposed a $56 million program.

But Will Everyone Benefit?

Stan Cross of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy says equity among racial and income groups is an issue as states decide how to spend money on EVs. ""What does equitable distribution of charging infrastructure even mean?"" Cross asked. ""Understanding that and making sure that it's done in a way that this transition to electric transportation doesn't just get us out of internal combustion engines and into EVs but also overcomes some of the historical inequities that are baked into our transportation system so that everybody has access to the benefits of driving EVs

Manufacturing Grows Too

One area where the Southeast doesn't seem to be lagging is in recruiting EV-related businesses. That includes manufacturers such as British electric vehicle maker Arrival which is building two plants in the Charlotte area. And a consortium of Korean companies is building a $2.6 billion battery plant in Georgia. Nick Nigro of Atlas notes that the six Southeast states account for 18% of the U.S. population. But they've attracted ""37% of the investment that we've tracked for manufacturing of vehicles and batteries"" Nigro said.

He thinks the same energy should go toward expanding use of the products those factories produce. ""What the Southeast has done to attract manufacturing and jobs from different parts of the country and other parts of the world they have to do for the products too"" he said.

People Want EVs

Incentives could be the key to turning our interest in EVs into more sales. And there is interest. A survey of U.S. consumers last month by ValuePenguin which is owned by Charlotte-based loan marketplace LendingTree found that more than half of respondents either already own an electric vehicle or want to buy one in the next five years. Skeptics were in the minority said Andrew Hurst a data writer for ValuePenguin.

""We asked whether or not people either want to buy one or wanted to buy another one within the next five years. Only 37% of people said they absolutely do not want an electric vehicle"" Hurst said.

""So the enthusiasm is certainly there"" he said. ""Over the next five years I anticipate that that will scale up as electric vehicle models become more ubiquitous become more affordable for consumers.""

Atlas EV Hub / Southern Alliance for Clean Energy

The poll found that the higher up-front price of EVs versus gas-powered vehicles is a barrier to sales. So are worries about vehicle range and the availability of charging stations. That's where local tax breaks or other incentives could help.

Hurst also points out that most people don't realize another important point about buying electric - their insurance likely will cost more (up to 39% more for some of the more popular models.) That's a function of the higher cost for electric vehicles and the insurance industry's struggle to price new technologies like smart-driving systems that could lead to more expensive damages.

The online survey of 2050 U.S. consumers was conducted by Qualtrics on behalf of LendingTree.

We didn't know how bad. | Will Bunch,"Twenty years after the September 11 2001 terror attacks what’s striking about America’s most cataclysmic day of the new millennium is how personal it still feels after all these years. I think for most of us the striking eternal image of that second plane striking the South Tower of the World Trade Center competes with the little things from that day. I remember postponing my inevitable journey to the newsroom to sit for 10 minutes under a tree out back with our not-quite-trained golden retriever puppy (Rosie RIP) trying to reconcile the beauty of a royal-blue September sky with the horror that had just occurred in Lower Manhattan.

I next remember mass chaos just trying to get into the old Daily News office at Broad and Callowhill. It took 10 minutes to get down one block of Vine Street because cars were filled with people who didn’t seem to know why they’d left work or where they were going. Then my editors gave me an impossible assignment — 12 hours to assemble the big-picture story of what had just happened even as we had no idea who did the attack or whether the death toll was hundreds or tens of thousands. Rather than Churchillian bombast I wrote simply about World Trade Center workers who were gossiping about the Yankees or the weather when they saw the plane.

“It was 8:46 a.m.” I wrote as night fell on 9/11 “and America would never be the same again.”

Looking back two decades later I can’t decide which is weirder — that I wrote this in the darkness of that confusing day or that somehow I got it right. America was changed forever and — despite those initial days where we hoped the sadness and the rubble would give rise to national unity and a sense of purpose that had felt missing in the detached irony and greed of the go-go 1990s — for the most part it has changed for the worse. Those drivers going every which way at cross purposes on Vine Street weren’t just a traffic jam but a metaphor for the road ahead.

Any national unity dissolved rapidly into fear and paranoia which a cynical new government in Washington preferred to exploit rather than tamp down — the better to plant our flag in oil-rich lands abroad and silence any dissent here at home. Those bad tidings — and the conspiratorial mindset we embraced in the wake of 9/11 — would be turned against nations that had nothing to do with the attacks against immigrants in general against legitimate protest and finally inevitably against one another. The era that started with the Islamic radicals who hijacked Flight 93 failing to reach the U.S. Capitol dome ended with American fanatics breaching its rotunda. The late Osama bin Laden could not have drafted a better script for his evil ambitions.

And let’s be clear: The ultimate blame for 9/11 rests squarely with those who planned and executed an attack that killed 2977 innocent people in the name of religious fanaticism and a Middle Eastern power trip — bin Laden and his associates in al-Qaeda. It’s impossible to write about that day without either a full-throated condemnation of the banal evil behind September 11 and also our heartbroken memories of the decent everyday people — firefighters and executive assistants and cops and stockbrokers — who lost their lives because of that immorality.

In responding to their deaths some positive things occurred — including the killing of bin Laden and the minimizing of at least the old original al-Qaeda. Despite the inevitable carping from air travelers an airport-security regime that’s successfully prevented any hijackings for these two decades has been quite an achievement. It’s also a reminder that America could have spent the last 20 years only doing what was necessary — shoring up our anti-terrorism regime on U.S. soil and right-sizing our role in the world. Instead our hubris — which was actually masking our inner fears — that America must respond to any threat to our daydreams of exceptionalism with massive force caused us to double down on military imperialism with tragic consequences in a tortured odyssey that led us full circle to last month’s chaotic scenes at the Kabul airport.

That fish stunk from the head. The post-9/11 history of America might have played out differently if then-President George W. Bush hadn’t indulged the neo-conservative wet dreams of those like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld to exploit a “new Pearl Harbor” to project American power on a global stage preferably in the world’s oil-producing regions to keep the spigot of climate-destroying fossil fuels wide open.

Textbooks on political propaganda will for centuries study how everyday citizens’ righteous anger and fears over 9/11 were manipulated to win support for invading an oil-rich nation in Iraq that had nothing to do with the 2001 attack and for spending $2.2 trillion and 20 years in Afghanistan on a mission that should have been measured in months. But perhaps even worse in the long run was the Cheney doctrine that America needed to project strength in the world by establishing a gulag archipelago of black prison sites where the inhumane dark art of torture was (counter-productively) practiced — its immoral center a concentration camp at Gitmo. It was only natural that this polar opposite of a “kinder gentler America” would bleed into other areas.

America was never the same again after 9/11 because the new “homeland-security state” inevitably criminalized immigration so that a nation that once promised to welcome the world’s political and economic refugees yearning to breathe free instead spent billions on border walls and turned Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE into a secret police force of deportation.

America was never the same again after 9/11 because homeland security also became a buzzword for stifling political dissent in our own streets especially as all the surplus military equipment created by our costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan found its way to urban and even small-town police departments who policed protests with riot gear and mass arrests. When the Department of Homeland Security sent a federal military force in 2020 to Portland to battle anti-racism protesters there was an aura of inevitability that the monster of 9/11 had been turned against our own citizens.

America was never the same again after 9/11 because the blatant lies that were told to U.S. citizens to invent the case for invading Iraq easily swallowed by the mainstream media in a shameful moment of jingoistic cheerleading created the petri dish of cynicism and distrust that allowed conspiracy theories to nuture and grow first about 9/11 itself but eventually about matters as diverse as “the Big Lie” of the 2020 election or COVID-19 vaccines. The cable-TV news regime that grew in the wake of 9/11 often fueled misinformation instead of quelling it.

Let’s be clear: America also had its problems that go far beyond September 11 including the abuses and gross inequities of late-stage capitalism structural racism and sexism (which sometimes intersected with 9/11 paranoia) and the cultural resentments of a broken faux meritocracy that caused our college/non-college divide. I’d argue it was these issues that produced the demagogic neo-fascism of Donald Trump but Trump also used the sharpened language of “the war on terror” to demonize immigrants and Muslims on his warped path to the White House.

Ironically Trump promised voters he would dismantle our most visible remnant of 9/11 — the endless “forever war” in Afghanistan the Middle East and elsewhere but even as POTUS he was unable to buck the military-industrial complex to pull it off. Over 20 years America wasted trillions on these pointless conflicts that could have been spent — in an era of deadlier floods wildfires and drought — on wind and solar energy and electric cars or on eliminating child poverty and food insecurity here in the “homeland” or on not dismantling the public health infrastructure that would have helped us respond faster and smarter to the coronavirus. Does anybody actually feel safer today than they did on September 10 2001?

In the smoke and haze of the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center America bought into myths that we could somehow win a global war against an idea — “terror” — and somehow retain our prestige and power in the world when the exact opposite has occurred. A 20-year “forever war” has bankrupted America economically but also morally. But in his common-sense attempt to end this President Biden seems to be paying a steep political price. The departure from Afghanistan may have been chaotic and ugly but it gave the United States the bad-tasting medicine it needed on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 to finally begin driving in the right direction: A dose of reality.

It was two years after she had burst to the fore with a moving win over Serena Williams in the 2018 United States Open women’s singles final where she had stood small and unguarded crying in front of an audience that had been rooting for her opponent.

Now in September after winning the U.S. Open for a second time Osaka was asked by the ESPN analyst Tom Rinaldi to explain why she had entered each of her seven matches wearing a face mask bearing the name of a Black victim of racist violence.

“What was the message you wanted to send?” Rinaldi asked Osaka.

“Well what was the message that you got?” she replied. “I feel like the point is to make people start talking.”

Her answer volleyed back at him reflexively precise and a bit arch revealed a sharply different woman from the one who had withered under excruciating boos at Arthur Ashe Stadium after her first U.S. Open title."

The Platinum Card® from American Express (review) is a card that’s primarily worth getting for the incredible perks that it offers.

There are generally better cards for earning Amex Membership Rewards points with one major exception — airfare purchases. The Amex Platinum is my go-to card for purchasing airfare. In this post I wanted to share everything you need to know about putting your airfare spending on the card.

Earning 5x points on airline tickets with the Amex Platinum

While there are several cards offering bonuses on airfare purchases the Amex Platinum Card is the single most rewarding. The Amex Platinum offers 5x Membership Rewards points:

On flights booked directly with airlines

On flights booked through Amex Travel

A few things to note about the 5x points on airfare purchases:

You’re capped at earning 5x points on up to $500000 in flight purchases per calendar year (which shouldn’t be an issue for a vast majority of people) and then 1x

There’s no registration required but rather you’ll automatically receive the bonus points to your account upon making an eligible purchase (the bonus points should post the same time as the standard points post)

It doesn’t matter who you’re purchasing an airline ticket for as long as your card is being used

While The Business Platinum Card® from American Express (review) offers 5x points on airfare purchases through Amex Travel it doesn’t offer 5x points on airfare purchases directly with airlines

The Amex Platinum offers 5x points on airfare purchases

Stack 5x points with great travel coverage

What makes the Amex Platinum Card so great for airfare purchases is that you’re not just earning 5x points but you’re also getting great travel coverage. Among other things this includes trip cancellation coverage trip interruption coverage and trip delay coverage.

The Amex Platinum Card offers reimbursement when your trip is canceled or interrupted as follows:

You can be reimbursed for up to $10000 in non-refundable travel expenses per trip up to $20000 per 12 consecutive month period

This applies to covered reasons which includes accidental bodily injury inclement weather military orders terrorist action call to jury duty one’s dwelling made uninhabitable and a quarantine imposed by a physician for health reasons

Coverage applies to you and your family members (including domestic partners) and traveling companions who purchase a trip with your card

You must file your claim within 60 days of the covered event

The Amex Platinum Card offers reimbursement for trip delays as follows:

This applies if you’re delayed by at least six hours

If eligible you can be reimbursed up to $500 per trip for necessary expenses like hotels meals and other essentials

There are of course terms to be aware of so you’ll want to consult your benefits guide for all the details.

Get valuable travel coverage in the event of irregular operations

Do you earn 5x points on flights booked with travel agencies?

With the Amex Platinum Card you earn 5x points on flights booked directly with airlines or flights booked through Amex Travel. But what about flights booked through online travel agencies (OTAs) like Orbitz Expedia etc.?

Technically you have to book directly through an airline or Amex Travel to get 5x points though often when you make bookings through OTAs the reservation is still processed directly by the airline. So I’ve often received 5x points even when booking flights through Expedia (since the credit card charge still shows as being from the airline directly) though that’s no guarantee.

This is a case of “your mileage may vary” — don’t expect to receive 5x points with OTAs but don’t be surprised when you do.

You may still receive bonus points on OTA bookings

Should you book flights through Amex Travel?

You can earn 5x points on flights either when booking directly with airlines or when booking through Amex Travel. What are the pros and cons of booking through Amex Travel which is Amex’s online travel booking platform?

In general I’d consider using Amex Travel when you’re trying to use the Amex International Airline Program Amex Insider Fares or the Amex Pay With Points program since these are exclusively available through Amex Travel. All of these can potentially be a great deal on airfare.

However other than that personally I’d highly recommend booking travel directly with airlines when possible especially in this era. Why?

Airlines have so many schedule changes nowadays and it’s much easier to change flights if you’re working directly with an airline rather than through a third party

With tickets being easily changeable without fees nowadays (on most airlines) it’s easier to manage your reservations travel credits etc. directly through an airline website

In some cases you’ll earn more points when booking directly with an airline than when booking through an online travel agency (for example JetBlue offers double points when booking direct)

JetBlue offers more points when booking direct

How valuable is the Amex Platinum for airfare purchases?

I’d say the Amex Platinum Card is extremely valuable for airfare purchases especially if this is a big-spending category for you:

I value Amex Membership Rewards points at 1.7 cents each so to me that’s the equivalent of an 8.5% return on airfare spending which is in line with the best return on airfare spending you’ll find on any card

In addition to that you get fantastic travel coverage in the event that your flight is delayed or canceled

For me the two single biggest factors to consider when deciding which card to use for spending are the rewards you earn and the purchase protection you get and that’s an area where this card can’t be beaten for airfare.

The Amex Platinum is unbeatable for airfare purchases

Bottom line

The Amex Platinum Card is a card that I recommend having mostly for the benefits as there are generally better Amex cards for everyday spending. The one exception is airfare purchases where you really can’t beat the card.

The Amex Platinum offers 5x points on airfare purchased directly with airlines or through Amex Travel plus it offers great travel protection. When you combine the two that’s a fantastic value proposition.

While I still primarily have the Amex Platinum for the perks that it offers the return on airfare spending sure is a nice added benefit since this is a fairly big spending category for me.

Do you use the Amex Platinum for airfare purchases or which card do you use?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzL2FydGljbGVzL3RoZXNlLWFyZS10aGUtdG9wLTUtY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtY29tcGFuaWVzLWZvci1jdXN0b21lci1zYXRpc2ZhY3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Are the Top 5 Credit Card Companies for Customer Satisfaction,"There's a familiar name at the top of the list.

J.D. Power recently released its 2021 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study. For the last 15 years the consumer intelligence company has ranked card issuers on a 1000-point scale. This year national card issuers received an average score of 809.

Even though most consumers aren't contacting their credit card companies too often it's nice to know you won't spend hours on hold or deal with subpar service if you do need to get in touch. If you're looking for the best credit card options in terms of customer service you'll find the top five national issuers below along with how well they scored.

1. American Express (838)

When it comes to providing an excellent customer experience American Express is hard to beat. This is the 11th time it has been number one according to J.D. Power's rankings.

Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards

It's clear that American Express prioritizes customer satisfaction. Wait times are generally on the shorter side it has plenty of special offers and events for its clients and it provides a quality mobile app.

Another notable perk is the complimentary protections many American Express cards offer. These can include:

While other card issuers have similar protections they typically offer them through third-party companies. American Express offers these protections itself which often results in a smoother claim process.

2. Discover (837)

Discover is also a mainstay near the top of these rankings and it was second here by a razor-thin margin just like in the 2020 study. It finished first in the 2019 study.

This is another card issuer that has invested in customer service. Discover offers 24/7 assistance and U.S.-based agents are available by phone live chat and messaging.

Quality service isn't the only part of Discover's winning formula. Discover credit cards are well-liked because they have valuable benefits their rewards are easy to use and they've gotten rid of common fees. None of Discover's cards charge an annual fee or a foreign transaction fee and Discover automatically waives your first late fee.

3. Capital One (815)

After a seven-point improvement Capital One went from slightly below average in the 2020 study to a little above average in 2021.

That's somewhat surprising considering that Capital One had lengthy hold times early in the COVID-19 pandemic. It also reduced some cardholders' credit limits during the pandemic. The J.D. Power study mentioned that credit limit issues were a big source of consumer frustration.

Capital One credit cards may have helped balance out those problems. The card issuer offers a variety of quality card products that can fit just about any consumer's needs.

4. Chase (807)

Even though Chase was fourth it was two points below average. As a whole national credit card issuers didn't have a great year for customer satisfaction.

If these rankings were based solely on each issuer's credit cards Chase would have an argument for first place. Chase credit cards are extremely popular and most of them score highly in reviews. It has fantastic rewards cards in particular including for cash back and travel rewards.

Unfortunately some consumers have found Chase's customer service lacking. It would be nice to see Chase improve in this area and score better next year.

5. Bank of America and Citi (805)

These two credit card companies tied for fifth place with a score four points lower than average. They took two different paths to get there though.

Bank of America fell by seven points from the 2020 study. This card issuer doesn't have quite as many options as some of its competitors. It does however offer bonus credit rewards to clients in its Preferred Rewards program. Those who qualify can get much more value from Bank of America credit cards.

Citi scored four points higher in 2021 than it did in 2020. While it's still below average it has been making small steady improvements. And even though it isn't the most popular card issuer several of the best Citi credit cards are top options in their categories.

The best of the rest

The rankings above are for national card issuers that met J.D. Power's study award criteria. There were also a few notable card issuers that didn't fit into that group.

Goldman Sachs the card issuer for the Apple Card received a score of 864. It's considered a midsize card issuer and it was far ahead of that group's average score of 796.

USAA received a score of 860. It's a national card issuer that didn't meet the study award criteria.

Navy Federal Credit Union received a score of 866. It's a midsize card issuer that didn't meet the study award criteria.

It was a down year overall for customer satisfaction with credit card companies but there were still card issuers that excelled. American Express and Discover did well as usual. Although other national issuers had their issues it was a challenging year because of COVID-19. With any luck scores will improve next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoYW1lcmljYS5jb20vaG9ub3JlZS9hdWRyZXktaGVuZGxleS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Audrey Hendley,"As President of American Express Travel Audrey Hendley leads one of the largest multi-channel consumer travel agencies in the world.

HARD-EARNED POINT KICKS OFF WCQ

The USMNT started its World Cup qualifying campaign with a tough 0-0 draw vs. El Salvador in front of a raucous sellout crowd of 29000 at San Salvador’s Estadio Cuscatlán. It proved to be a back-and-forth affair as both sides struggled to establish rhythm on a choppy and spongy playing surface.

The U.S. and El Salvador both showed some flashes in attack on set plays nearly scoring on headers from their respective center backs in the opening 15 minutes. Second-half substitutes for the USA made a difference late and Weston McKennie factored into two of the USMNT’s best chances in the 73rd and 75th sending a header just wide and sending in a cross for Kellyn Acosta that forced the Salvadoran goalkeeper into action.

Goalkeeper Matt Turner recorded his seventh shutout in eight starts with the USMNT. After winning his first seven appearances Turner is undefeated in his first eight games with the USA conceding just one goal- a penalty kick in a 6-1 win against Martinique in the 2021 Gold Cup group stage.





INTRODUCTION TO CONCACAF WCQ

Thursday night’s match provided an introduction to the rigors of Concacaf World Cup qualifying for many of the USMNT’s young player pool. Twelve of 16 players made their World Cup qualifying debut for the USA in the match against El Salvador tying a modern-era record set in the opening game of 1998 World Cup qualifying on Nov. 3 1996 vs. Guatemala in Washington D.C. Gio Reyna became the second-youngest U.S. player to start a qualifying match following only Christian Pulisic. Also making his qualifying debut Tyler Adams became the youngest player to captain the USMNT in the modern era.

The starting line-up carried an average age of 23 years 282 days the fourth-youngest WCQ line-up in the modern era and third-youngest in matches where the team had not already qualified or advanced to the next round. The only lineups that were younger came in April 1989 from the first two matches of qualifying for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA5LTA0L3BlcnNvbmFsLXdlYWx0aC13aGF0LW15LXdvcnN0LXRyYWRlcy10YXVnaHQtbWUtYWJvdXQtaW52ZXN0aW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What My Worst Trades Taught Me About Investing,"In a recent appearance on Bloomberg TV anchor Tom Keene surprised me with this question: “What is your best Apple story?” I said that in the early 2000s I managed to snag a loaner iPod soon after they were released. It was obviously a new digital version of the ubiquitous 1980s Sony Walkman. At the time Apple Inc.’s shares were trading at $15 with $13 a share in cash on the balance sheet. I did not see a lot of risk in the shares. I pitched it to my firm’s 800 or so brokers many of whom bought lots of shares.

But I was surprised when soon after and the shares shot up to $20 the brokers began to sell. “Up big 33% gotta ring the bell” is what I was told. I held on and finally sold when my “stop loss” order was triggered on a pullback after the shares reached $45 leaving me with a 300% gain. “A triple!” I smugly declared in what was probably the worst sale I ever made.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIxLzA5LzA0L21jY2hyeXN0YWwtYWZnaGFuaXN0YW4tbmF2aXN0YXItY29uc3VsdGluZy1nZW5lcmFscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley McChrystal and other generals who led in Afghanistan now thrive in the private sector,When Stanley A.

We at Bell Tower Green are excited to open the park on Sept. 10 the day before Pops at the Post. This project has been in the works for almost six years and the grand opening is only a few days away. So what possessed us to work all this time on a project costing $13 million? First we all believed that Salisbury needed an attractive green space downtown. Take a look around and you will see lots of buildings but very few areas of green. We live in a world of hardscapes but very little of soft pleasing and comfortable landscapes. That was of primary importance to us. Bell Tower Green will help change the character of our community.

The next objective was to ‘cultivate community’ to the extent we could with a park. It is well documented that parks bring people together. Bell Tower Green will be a place for everyone. We will see children at play people engaging and visiting with one another as they walk the park. Bell Tower Green will be Salisbury’s front porch. Do you remember how the front porch was a part of life before we all built a back porch for privacy? When that happened we lost a sense of community. We must bring back the conversation smiles relaxation renewal and respect that comes with getting to know others. Am I Pollyannish about what can happen in this park? In some ways yes but don’t you think this can help us cultivate community? Won’t the park be a building block to more community engagement? All of us on the Bell Tower team and the City of Salisbury sure think so.

Parks have also proven to be a source of economic development. People want to live close to parks and green spaces. With people come retail establishments and other activities. Over time the investment in parks comes back many times in a broader economic base and increased property taxes. In addition tourism will grow because this park will be a destination for families in a close geographic radius. As tourism grows Salisbury will be seen as a gem in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. This will bring more residents and greater prosperity. As Victor Wallace has said we have the physical and social infrastructure of a city many times our size.

I hope you will join us at 11 a.m. on Friday for the groundbreaking ceremony and later in the day for yoga (3 p.m.) and our four bands are starting at 4 p.m. running until 10 p.m. It’s going to be lots of fun. The park will be deeded to the city that day and it will become your park the best ending imaginable.

We didn't know how bad. | Will Bunch,"Twenty years after the September 11 2001 terror attacks what’s striking about America’s most cataclysmic day of the new millennium is how personal it still feels after all these years. I think for most of us the striking eternal image of that second plane striking the South Tower of the World Trade Center competes with the little things from that day. I remember postponing my inevitable journey to the newsroom to sit for 10 minutes under a tree out back with our not-quite-trained golden retriever puppy (Rosie RIP) trying to reconcile the beauty of a royal-blue September sky with the horror that had just occurred in Lower Manhattan.

I next remember mass chaos just trying to get into the old Daily News office at Broad and Callowhill. It took 10 minutes to get down one block of Vine Street because cars were filled with people who didn’t seem to know why they’d left work or where they were going. Then my editors gave me an impossible assignment — 12 hours to assemble the big-picture story of what had just happened even as we had no idea who did the attack or whether the death toll was hundreds or tens of thousands. Rather than Churchillian bombast I wrote simply about World Trade Center workers who were gossiping about the Yankees or the weather when they saw the plane.

“It was 8:46 a.m.” I wrote as night fell on 9/11 “and America would never be the same again.”

Looking back two decades later I can’t decide which is weirder — that I wrote this in the darkness of that confusing day or that somehow I got it right. America was changed forever and — despite those initial days where we hoped the sadness and the rubble would give rise to national unity and a sense of purpose that had felt missing in the detached irony and greed of the go-go 1990s — for the most part it has changed for the worse. Those drivers going every which way at cross purposes on Vine Street weren’t just a traffic jam but a metaphor for the road ahead.

Any national unity dissolved rapidly into fear and paranoia which a cynical new government in Washington preferred to exploit rather than tamp down — the better to plant our flag in oil-rich lands abroad and silence any dissent here at home. Those bad tidings — and the conspiratorial mindset we embraced in the wake of 9/11 — would be turned against nations that had nothing to do with the attacks against immigrants in general against legitimate protest and finally inevitably against one another. The era that started with the Islamic radicals who hijacked Flight 93 failing to reach the U.S. Capitol dome ended with American fanatics breaching its rotunda. The late Osama bin Laden could not have drafted a better script for his evil ambitions.

And let’s be clear: The ultimate blame for 9/11 rests squarely with those who planned and executed an attack that killed 2977 innocent people in the name of religious fanaticism and a Middle Eastern power trip — bin Laden and his associates in al-Qaeda. It’s impossible to write about that day without either a full-throated condemnation of the banal evil behind September 11 and also our heartbroken memories of the decent everyday people — firefighters and executive assistants and cops and stockbrokers — who lost their lives because of that immorality.

In responding to their deaths some positive things occurred — including the killing of bin Laden and the minimizing of at least the old original al-Qaeda. Despite the inevitable carping from air travelers an airport-security regime that’s successfully prevented any hijackings for these two decades has been quite an achievement. It’s also a reminder that America could have spent the last 20 years only doing what was necessary — shoring up our anti-terrorism regime on U.S. soil and right-sizing our role in the world. Instead our hubris — which was actually masking our inner fears — that America must respond to any threat to our daydreams of exceptionalism with massive force caused us to double down on military imperialism with tragic consequences in a tortured odyssey that led us full circle to last month’s chaotic scenes at the Kabul airport.

That fish stunk from the head. The post-9/11 history of America might have played out differently if then-President George W. Bush hadn’t indulged the neo-conservative wet dreams of those like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld to exploit a “new Pearl Harbor” to project American power on a global stage preferably in the world’s oil-producing regions to keep the spigot of climate-destroying fossil fuels wide open.

Textbooks on political propaganda will for centuries study how everyday citizens’ righteous anger and fears over 9/11 were manipulated to win support for invading an oil-rich nation in Iraq that had nothing to do with the 2001 attack and for spending $2.2 trillion and 20 years in Afghanistan on a mission that should have been measured in months. But perhaps even worse in the long run was the Cheney doctrine that America needed to project strength in the world by establishing a gulag archipelago of black prison sites where the inhumane dark art of torture was (counter-productively) practiced — its immoral center a concentration camp at Gitmo. It was only natural that this polar opposite of a “kinder gentler America” would bleed into other areas.

America was never the same again after 9/11 because the new “homeland-security state” inevitably criminalized immigration so that a nation that once promised to welcome the world’s political and economic refugees yearning to breathe free instead spent billions on border walls and turned Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE into a secret police force of deportation.

America was never the same again after 9/11 because homeland security also became a buzzword for stifling political dissent in our own streets especially as all the surplus military equipment created by our costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan found its way to urban and even small-town police departments who policed protests with riot gear and mass arrests. When the Department of Homeland Security sent a federal military force in 2020 to Portland to battle anti-racism protesters there was an aura of inevitability that the monster of 9/11 had been turned against our own citizens.

America was never the same again after 9/11 because the blatant lies that were told to U.S. citizens to invent the case for invading Iraq easily swallowed by the mainstream media in a shameful moment of jingoistic cheerleading created the petri dish of cynicism and distrust that allowed conspiracy theories to nuture and grow first about 9/11 itself but eventually about matters as diverse as “the Big Lie” of the 2020 election or COVID-19 vaccines. The cable-TV news regime that grew in the wake of 9/11 often fueled misinformation instead of quelling it.

Let’s be clear: America also had its problems that go far beyond September 11 including the abuses and gross inequities of late-stage capitalism structural racism and sexism (which sometimes intersected with 9/11 paranoia) and the cultural resentments of a broken faux meritocracy that caused our college/non-college divide. I’d argue it was these issues that produced the demagogic neo-fascism of Donald Trump but Trump also used the sharpened language of “the war on terror” to demonize immigrants and Muslims on his warped path to the White House.

Ironically Trump promised voters he would dismantle our most visible remnant of 9/11 — the endless “forever war” in Afghanistan the Middle East and elsewhere but even as POTUS he was unable to buck the military-industrial complex to pull it off. Over 20 years America wasted trillions on these pointless conflicts that could have been spent — in an era of deadlier floods wildfires and drought — on wind and solar energy and electric cars or on eliminating child poverty and food insecurity here in the “homeland” or on not dismantling the public health infrastructure that would have helped us respond faster and smarter to the coronavirus. Does anybody actually feel safer today than they did on September 10 2001?

In the smoke and haze of the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center America bought into myths that we could somehow win a global war against an idea — “terror” — and somehow retain our prestige and power in the world when the exact opposite has occurred. A 20-year “forever war” has bankrupted America economically but also morally. But in his common-sense attempt to end this President Biden seems to be paying a steep political price. The departure from Afghanistan may have been chaotic and ugly but it gave the United States the bad-tasting medicine it needed on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 to finally begin driving in the right direction: A dose of reality.

It was a beautiful day under a sparkling blue sky and as he sped down Maryland’s Route 32 with the window down and radio blasting the teenager was sure it was going to be a lucky day.

Soon after 8.46am the radio cut to news that a plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers in New York City. At 9.03am by now at his desk he was stunned to hear that a second plane had crashed into the other tower followed half an hour later by similar catastrophe at the Pentagon in Washington.

He leapt back into his car and screeched into reverse only to find himself stuck in gridlocked traffic sandwiched between hundreds of other vehicles. He was stuck outside the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA) the US intelligence body that runs one of the largest surveillance operations in the world.

The road was jammed with personnel streaming out of the NSA building following an order to evacuate. The air was thick with the sound of yelling cellphones ringing car engines revving vainly in the stationary traffic.

The surreal spectacle of thousands of NSA intelligence agents abandoning their posts after the worst terrorist attack on the US only to be bogged down in gridlock made a deep impression on the teenager Edward Snowden. As did 9/11 itself which radically changed the course of his life.

In its wake Snowden became caught up in the surge of patriotism that swept the nation. Inspired to play his part he joined the army entered the intelligence community and some 12 years after 9/11 found himself back at the same NSA where he had ground to a halt on that fateful day.

The attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon had brought Snowden deep into the heart of America’s secretive surveillance operations. But in the process it had given him access to highly classified databases that revealed to him a massive secret world a sort of hidden state-within-the-state that had been created in the wake of 9/11.

Snowden would go on to carry out the largest intelligence leak in the NSA’s history. It would expose one of the great legacies of 9/11 – the rise of the ubiquitous US surveillance state.

“Panic made us politically vulnerable” Snowden told the Guardian as he ruminated on the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11. “That vulnerability was exploited by our own government to entitle itself to radically expanded powers that had for decades been out of reach.”

Snowden said that upon reflection the explosion of domestic spying post-9/11 should have been anticipated. “We should have known what was to come and looking back at the public record I think that on an intellectual level many of us did know. But political and media elites relentlessly repeated that the choice here was obvious: a guarantee of life or a certainty of death.”

That teenager on 9/11 is now an exile from his own country charged under the Espionage Act for having revealed the US government’s mass espionage on its own people. The way he sees it 20 years on the false claim that expanding state power was necessary to avoid certain death from further terrorist atrocities has led to decades of public indifference.

“With that framing who could care whether or not the gloves came off the machinery of state? We are only now beginning to care again – to care collectively – because we sit at the bottom of a 20-year hole carved by our neglect.”

It happened in the blink of an eye. Within hours of the fourth plane crashing into a field in Shanksville Pennsylvania George Bush’s White House and intelligence chiefs had begun to lay the foundations of the mass surveillance state.

The Patriot Act which swatted away longstanding rules preventing the state from monitoring US citizens without “probable cause” was passed in a lightning-fast 45 days. The legislation became law with minimal debate or opposition in Congress granting domestic law enforcement agencies sweeping new powers.

It allowed the government to track the online behavior of Americans while making it much easier to acquire a warrant. It gave the green light for the FBI and CIA to carry out “roving wiretaps” where agents could follow communications trails between phones and computers.

It eviscerated the firewall that had been in place since the 1970s shielding US citizens from foreign surveillance. And it greatly boosted the power of the FBI to obtain personal customer records of Americans from phone companies banks and internet providers without court approval through so-called National Security Letters.

If the Patriot Act was produced in a flash behind the scenes secret systems for mass surveillance were being built at even greater speed. One of the most audacious plans was drafted by nightfall on the day of 11 September itself.

The plan ominously titled “Total information awareness” was the brainchild of John Poindexter a disgraced former naval officer who had been Ronald Reagan’s national security adviser and a key figure in the Iran-contra scandal. TIA Poindexter blustered would act as an early-warning alarm for future 9/11s by gathering up the digital data of all Americans – innocent or guilty – and using it to search for patterns of terrorist activity.

No warrants would be sought. They would just do it irrespective of laws or constitutional niceties.

“We must put introduction of new technology on a wartime basis” Poindexter said. Weeks later he managed to sell the idea to the Pentagon in return for a $200m budget.

The NSA wasn’t far behind. The agency was busy devising Stellar Wind its warrantless surveillance system. It sought to identify terrorist links by analysing the metadata drawn from the emails telephone calls and internet activity of huge numbers of Americans.

The Snowden documents showed that by 14 September – just three days after the attacks – the then director of the NSA Michael Hayden had taken a “tactical decision” to begin snooping on the digital communications of people based in the US. From now on the NSA granted itself the power to surveil any American on US soil who was in digital contact with a foreign country where terrorism was known to exist – no warrant needed.

This was a seismic shift. It meant that the nation’s most powerful eavesdropping agency had ascribed to itself without consulting Congress or the courts the ability to listen in to the communications of Americans in a way that violated constitutional rights and laws. On 4 October 2001 the White House granted permission again in secret and without consultation for the NSA to turn its spotlight on to US citizens in what became known as the President’s Surveillance Program.

“They essentially claimed wartime authority to engage in domestic surveillance that is criminal under statutory law” said Ben Wizner Snowden’s lawyer who works on surveillance at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

How could the spymasters have moved to put in place complex systems of mass surveillance just hours and days after 9/11? There is only one answer many observers believe.

“They had it all ready” said Cindy Cohn executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) which defends civil liberties in the digital space. “This is what the NSA had long wanted – to ‘sit on the wire’ to watch all internet traffic and pick out whatever they chose. Now they finally had the crisis they needed to make it happen.”

By the 10th anniversary of 9/11 an entire nation within the nation had arisen dedicated to keeping the American people nominally safe by placing everybody under observation. The Washington Post called it a “Top Secret America hidden from public view”.

The sprawling surveillance infrastructure had proliferated to the extent that nobody – not even top intelligence officials – knew how much it cost or how many it employed. The Post’s best estimate in July 2010 was that it spanned 10000 locations across the US.

The scale of growth can be glimpsed by looking at some of the public elements. The number of National Security Letters granted each year increased more than fourfold between 2000 and 2003 peaking at almost 60000 the following year. By 2008 almost 20000 people were being targeted under its remit.

The intelligence budget grew from a little over $40bn a year in the late 1990s to almost $100bn by 2010 remaining $80bn to this day.

When Wizner looks back on the past 20 years he is struck not just by this explosion in surveillance but also by the failure of governance that enabled it. Key institutions like the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court which is supposed to provide legal oversight genuflected in front of the NSA.

“This is a story about checks and balances failing” Wizner said. “The courts deferred to the expertise and secrecy claims of the executive Congress failed to hold the intelligence agencies accountable.”

Even the media fell short of holding power to account. When in 2005 the New York Times revealed the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping the newspaper admitted that it had sat on the story for a year at the behest of the White House.

The LA Times spiked a story brought to it by a whistleblower who revealed that the telecom company AT&T had handed over all its internet traffic to the NSA. The paper had been lobbied by Hayden and the then director of national intelligence John Negroponte.

Traditional oversight did have some successes. Ron Wyden a US senator for Oregon managed to have Poindexter’s Total Information Awareness program shut down in 2003 after an intern in his office stumbled across documents describing the operation.

“That was one of our first wins – it would have been the biggest spying operation in history” Wyden said. (Three years later it was revealed that elements of the program had secretly been transferred from the Pentagon to the NSA.)

Wyden a longstanding member of the Senate select committee on intelligence has been at the forefront of efforts to force sunlight into the world of secret surveillance. As the 10th anniversary of 9/11 was approaching he issued his famous warning on the Senate floor telling the American people that when they found out how the government had interpreted the Patriot Act “they will be stunned and they will be angry”.

In another legendary moment two years later he posed a direct question to the then director of national intelligence James Clapper about whether the NSA was collecting data on hundreds of millions of Americans. “No sir” Clapper lied.

Wyden told the Guardian that the exchange showed how far the government had allowed itself to slide in terms of basic American values. “James Clapper lied to the American people and he lied to the committee. It wasn’t the only time they lied – they lied several times over the years which is why I finally said I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t ask the question I did in public.”

It is a paradox of Wyden’s attempts to wrench surveillance into the open that despite his efforts the full truth about the massive dragnet of all Americans’ digital communications remained concealed. As a member of the committee the senator was briefed in secret about the warrantless eavesdropping but was constrained by what he has called the “cumbersome and unwieldy” restrictions on his public remarks.

The Guardian asked Wyden whether he thought with the benefit of hindsight over these past 20 years that Congress could have done more to check the intelligence agencies.

“You look back and the answer is: sure. You keep pushing the rock up the hill and you have wins and there are times when you wish there had been stronger support for reform.”

Before Edward Snowden there was Mark Klein. He was the whistleblower who exposed the AT&T story that the LA Times declined to publish. Klein was a technician assigned to the internet room of AT&T’s Folsom Street building in San Francisco through which colossal quantities of data passed every hour. It was 2004 and unbeknown to the public the telecoms company had been bending over backwards since days after 9/11 to help the US government spy on its own people.

As Klein went about routine maintenance his eye was drawn to a splitter cabinet inside the room. It was dividing the light beam carrying the data into two separate signals and passing one of them – an exact copy of the other – down to the floor below.

Klein’s curiosity intensified when he tried to follow the signal and found that the lower room was locked behind a door marked 641A. Nobody was allowed in without special authorization from the NSA.

When Klein obtained internal engineering documents outlining the flow of data through the splitter cabinet down to the secret room his suspicions were confirmed. The NSA was copying and collecting everybody’s information carried not only by AT&T but also by 16 other internet providers who shared the pipeline.

“I was horrified and astonished. It was like a police state sweeping up everybody’s information blindly and allowing agents to go through it at their leisure.”

Klein’s discovery was made public by Wired magazine in 2006. The documents he obtained went on to form the basis of a major lawsuit launched by the EFF though in 2008 Congress passed a law absolving AT&T and other phone companies from any legal liability for collaborating with the spy chiefs.

Mark Klein Thomas Tamm Thomas Drake William Binney Kirk Wiebe Edward Loomis Diane Roark – the list of individuals who for a variety of motives provided critical information to investigative journalists seeking to expose the surveillance state is long and impressive. Without them given the failure of checks and balances we might still be in the dark today.

“Everything we know about mass surveillance we know not because of our government institutions but despite them” Wizner said. “We know because of courageous sources and journalists who pried those stories out into the light.”

And then there was Snowden. On 6 June 2013 – almost 12 years after 9/11 – the first incendiary story exposing the NSA’s dragnet of the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers was published by the Guardian. The next day the paper reported on Prism a system for sucking up data from US internet giants including Google and Facebook.

The lid on the secret US surveillance state had finally been lifted. One of the documents Snowden disclosed neatly encapsulated the NSA’s posture: “Sniff It All Know It All Collect It All Process It All Exploit It All Partner It All.”

Snowden has an even more vivid way of summing up the public consequences of the closed world he had bust open. In his memoir Permanent Record he writes: “All of us had been reduced to something like children who’d be forced to live the rest of our lives under omniscient parental supervision.”

It is tempting to think of the mass surveillance put in place post-9/11 as a great leveler – after all the NSA did grab the metadata of all Americans irrespective of race class or religion. But to suggest that 9/11 gave birth to a new equality of snooping under the government’s all-seeing eye would be a travesty.

Surveillance has always fallen unevenly in the US stretching back to the days when slaves were required to carry lanterns at night so they could be followed. After 9/11 it was the turn of Muslims.

“The Patriot Act was the stepping stone for what became open season on American Muslims” said Nihad Awad the executive director of the advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “There were no rules. The government just said ‘Let’s go after Muslims.’”

Before 9/11 Awad had been invited to sit on White House advisory committees. After 9/11 he and his family would routinely be stopped and searched at airports and treated like criminals. “We became the enemy” he said.

For years Awad was puzzled by the hostile stories in the press containing personal details the banks that refused to do business with him. He had to wait until Snowden to make sense of what was happening.

An investigation by the Intercept based on the Snowden files showed that Awad had been placed on a top-secret list of 7485 people many foreigners but also including an unknown number of Americans whose emails were being monitored by the NSA and FBI. They included other high-profile Muslim Americans including a former Republican candidate a lawyer and university professors.

“When Snowden let us know that I was on the list I realized the government had access to my private emails and were sharing them with Congress and leaking them to the media” Awad said.

“I felt invaded by my own government punished for leading a civil rights organization. If people like me in positions of influence were treated like this what about the average Muslim?”

View image in fullscreen In 2012 Asad Dandia discovered a disturbing secret about a friend he met while helping run a charity that distributed food to needy Muslim families in southern Brooklyn. Photograph: Laylah Amatullah Barrayn

Asad Dandia was born and raised in Brooklyn. He was eight years-old on 9/11 and a teenager when his troubles started. As a religiously observant Muslim he had founded with friends a food distribution charity offering help to struggling families from his community.

In March 2012 he was contacted through Facebook by a stranger named Shamiur Rahman who said he wanted to volunteer for a spiritually grounded organization like his. Rahman said he had been through a rough patch himself and now wanted to help others.

Dandia welcomed Rahman in. “He quickly grew close to me and to my circles” he said. “He met my family he ate my mother’s food he slept over one night. We shared many intimate moments of emotional and spiritual reflection.”

At times Rahman behaved strangely. Whenever Dandia introduced him to anybody the first thing he would do would be to ask for their phone number. He also asked provocative questions like what Dandia thought of the killing in Benghazi of Christopher Stevens the US ambassador to Libya.

“That was a really dumb question – it was murder and obviously we thought it was wrong” Dandia said. But he gave Rahman the benefit of the doubt.

“I attributed that to the fact he had mental health and drug addiction issues. I thought we should be patient with him.”

A few months after Rahman entered his life Dandia was taken aside by a member of his local Muslim community who was working as an NYPD officer. “You are being watched there’s a file with your name and photos in it and you are being followed” he told Dandia.

Seven months into their friendship Rahman posted a confession on Facebook. He was an NYPD informant tasked with infiltrating Muslim groups and mosques.

The news travelled fast and sent a chill throughout the area. Mosques asked Dandia to stop fundraising for his food bank as they were afraid of being targeted themselves. Dandia grew reclusive.

“It made me suspicious of people. I hid my left-leaning political views and deeper religious commitments. That wasn’t how I wanted to live in a state of permanent paranoia but there was a complete breakdown in trust.”

Through the Associated Press Dandia came to learn that he was just a speck in the NYPD’s mountainous surveillance of Muslims. Communities up and down the east coast were mapped through a secret “Demographics Unit” and individuals’ daily habits – shopping work prayer school – tracked on massive CIA-designed databases.

Muslims with drug habits who fell into the NYPD’s clutches like Rahman were offered lenient treatment in return for turning informant.

“I felt betrayed” Dandia said. “I was born and raised in New York. This is the city that I love and that I’m proud to call my home. It targeted me because of my religion like a foreign enemy.”

Since Snowden shone his laser beam into the secret surveillance state-within-a-state there has been a concerted effort to restore the balance destroyed after 9/11 between individual liberties and national security. The USA Freedom Act in 2015 curtailed some of the NSA’s metadata practices passing the storage of bulk phone records from the agency to the phone companies and opening up the foreign intelligence surveillance court to a modicum of public scrutiny.

It was the first time since the 1970s that Congress had limited the NSA’s authority in any way. “We have closed great swathes of the internet to the oldest methods of mass surveillance” Snowden told the Guardian.

In 2019 the NSA let it be known that it had shut down its mass collection of phone and text records. The NSA cited “technical irregularities” but by then it was widely known that the spying program had not only been illegal in its inception it just hadn’t worked.

Despite the NSA’s claim that by snooping on all Americans’ communications it had thwarted numerous other 9/11s the agency could only point to one terrorism case that of Basaalay Moalin found guilty of funding Somali extremism that had come through the phone records program. Last year a federal judge concluded that even Moalin’s case had been irrelevant: the NSA played no role in his conviction.

There have been other victories in the battle against the surveillance state. Wyden was heartened by the vote in the Senate last year on his amendment to protect the browsing history of Americans from secret surveillance.

The amendment failed but by only one vote. “I thought that was very telling we almost won – that wouldn’t have happened 15 years ago.”

Asad Dandia signed up to a class-action lawsuit challenging the NYPD’s mass surveillance of him and so many other Muslim Americans. In 2016 they achieved a groundbreaking settlement that sharply reined in police targeting of religious and racial groups.

“I felt empowered it gave me hope that Americans can push the country to live up to its own ideals” he said.

Perhaps the biggest shift has been among the American people. The urge of individuals to protect themselves against state eavesdropping became so intense that tech giants were forced to respond and in 2016 for the first time since the internet was created it carried more encrypted data than unencrypted.

Which is not to say that the state-within-a-state has withered away or that the balance between privacy and security has been perfected. “Not even close” Cohn said.

The Guardian asked surveillance experts what in the present moment keeps them up at night. What dastardly new tricks from the spymasters do they fear most?

Wyden pointed to legal loopholes that allow shady private data brokers to sell Americans’ personal information to government agencies without any court oversight. “I continue to be very worried about that” he said.

Snowden raised a similar shift where mass surveillance is now predominantly performed by “amoral telecommunications and surveillance-masquerading-as-advertising companies. They exploit weaknesses in our laws devices and networks to pad out their dossiers and then sell them to governments.”

Cohn talked about how surveillance cameras were being weaponized with the addition of facial recognition technology that could have especially dire consequences for people of colour.

Wizner said he sweated over the rise of robotic surveillance and AI. “More and more we will see critical decisions affecting liberty being made inside black boxes” he said.

For Patrick Toomey of the ACLU’s national security project what keeps him up at night is simply all of it the whole technological gamut. “The threat is persistent surveillance – of being surveilled wherever we go using a vast network of devices that can potentially listen to what we say or recognize who we are based on our faces or the way we walk. There’s a very real danger that this sensitive information will be used to make decisions that are discriminatory or inaccurate that can profoundly impact our lives.”

In the last analysis the US surveillance state got away with operating in total secret for so many years after 9/11 that it raises the question: are we still in the dark?

“This will always be like trying to keep the kibble from the cat” Snowden said. “So long as they know what they want is out there somewhere they’re going to work out new ways to get it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9pbi1kZXB0aC9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi8yMDIxLzA5LzA1L3Blb3BsZS13aG8tc3Vydml2ZWQtY29sbGFwc2UtdHdpbi10b3dlcnMtc2VwdGVtYmVyLTExLzU0NTM0ODUwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sept. 11 survivor stories: 20 people lived through twin tower collapse,"This content is only available to USA TODAY subscribers.

It’s exactly the type of story that has executives itching to get people back to offices. Chance meetings like this are essential for innovation the theory goes. “Remote work virtually eliminates spontaneous learning and creativity because you don’t run into people at the coffee machine” Jamie Dimon the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase recently told shareholders.

Creativity is hard to quantify. But research including studies of companies working remotely during the pandemic supports Mr. Dimon’s argument only up to a point. The data shows that in-office work is helpful at one part of the creative process: forming initial relationships particularly with people outside your normal sphere.

In the past year and a half that hasn’t been happening much with large shares of American office workers still remote and the Delta variant pushing some companies including Google and Ford to keep offices closed until 2022. A significant share of workers say that they want to return at least some of the time and that they miss meeting colleagues in the office.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“It was like she was dreading her premonition” he said quietly. “It’s almost as if she knew.”

That’s what happened on Sept. 11 2001 when two hijacked planes purposely flew into the World Trade Center in New York. Wendy Faulkner 47 a mother of two daughters who lived in Mason and worked as vice president of information technology at the Chicago headquarters of the retail-insurance brokerage Aon Risk Services was killed.

She was in New York for a one-day meeting that was supposed to last a few hours. The meeting was on the 104th floor of World Trade Center 2. When those in the tower were ordered to evacuate after the first plane crashed everyone scrambled toward the elevators.

There was only room for one of the three women standing there. Faulkner and another women waited. They were never seen again.

The night before Lynn Faulkner ended the conversation with his wife with “I love you.”

“If you’re going to say last words” the 69-year-old said “those are the words to say.”

His wife’s body never was recovered buried under the tons of rubble.

“It doesn’t seem like 20 years ago” he said when asked about the upcoming anniversary. “Life is a mixture you know. It seems like it happened yesterday and then it seems like it happened one thousand years ago.”

The Faulkners were opposites and that worked during their 20-year marriage. He loves riding motorcycles and flying planes while his wife was content reading an Agatha Christie novel while sipping hot tea in front of the fireplace.

“The chances were I would be the first one to die” said Faulkner two years younger than his wife. “That was always our thought. If you had told me this little lady would be killed by terrorists I would have said you’re ridiculous. Her odds were 100 million to one but it doesn’t matter if you’re the one.”

Lynn Faulkner a retired communications and advertising executive hasn’t moved from his Mason home. His daughters Loren 39 and Ashley 33 have started their careers.

Loren a mother of three is an anesthesiologist at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville and Ashley is a faculty member at Ohio State University.

Lynn Faulkner who once said he’d never love again after losing his wife married Aletha eight years ago. He called her “a wonderful beautiful lady.”

In the years immediately after his wife’s death Faulkner said his life was frozen by the terroristic acts on Sept. 11 2001. He had frequent nightmares and insomnia. There were times he said when he fell asleep at a red light while driving his daughter to soccer practice.

“I really can’t remember a few years” he said. “It’s like they didn’t exist.”

But he does remember a conversation he had with a man two years ago during a social event. After being introduced to Faulkner the man said “I know you. Your claim to fame is your wife was killed on 9/11.”

He wanted to punch the man in the face he said.

“I was hurt and it angered me at first” he said. “9/11 is what happened to my family. It wasn’t something I sought or wanted. I didn’t want it to be my defining moment.”

Every Sept. 11 for the past 19 years his Warren County neighbors have planted flowers as a memorial to Wendy at the base of the front yard flagpole that flies two flags an American and Remembrance.

The Remembrance flag depicts the Twin Towers with the simple slogan: “Never Forget.”

The license plate on Faulkner’s Harley-Davidson motorcycle is “91101.” The plate on his GMC truck parked in the driveway reads “NVR4GIT.”

It was that way 20 years ago. It’s that way today.

Less than one week after 9/11 when it became apparent Wendy Faulkner didn’t survive the family discussed ways to honor her memory. She was a daughter of missionaries who sent a care package to an orphanage in the Philippines every month.

“What a heart she had” Faulkner said.

They founded the Wendy Faulkner Memorial Children’s Foundation a nonprofit organization that for 19 years took donations and completed good work around the world.

“She spent her life trying to help people” he said of his late wife.

But over the years as 9/11 has fallen deeper in peoples’ memories the financial support of the foundation has decreased he said. The family made a commitment that every dollar raised would benefit the needy children. He refused to hire a professional fundraiser.

Sometime in the near future the foundation will close he said.

He has dealt with the heartache associated with 9/11 for 20 years. He was asked what advice he’d give others dealing with grief: “I know this sounds obvious but you have to live one day at a time. Put one foot in front of the other and keep moving. Things will get a little better a little easier.”

He paused for a few seconds then added: “Lean on your faith. You will need that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vaW4tZGVwdGgvbmV3cy9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wOS8wNS9zZXB0ZW1iZXItMTEtc3Vydml2b3Itc3Rvcmllcy1lbGV2YXRvci1mcmVlLWZhbGwtc291dGgtdG93ZXIvNTQ1MzQzNjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,September 11 escape: How a man survived 900-foot elevator drop,"This content is only available to USA TODAY subscribers.

Twenty years later he’s still living with it.

A brace and a quarter-sized divot on his left leg reflect the injuries that ended his police career a lifetime dream. He has post-traumatic stress disorder. He keeps shelves of mementoes including a cross and miniature twin towers fashioned from trade center steel. He was portrayed in a movie and wrote two books about enduring the ordeal.

“It never goes away for those of us that were there that day” he says.

Nearly 3000 people were killed when hijackers in Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida terror network rammed four commercial jets into the trade center the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11 2001. Yet an estimated 33000 or more people successfully evacuated the stricken buildings.

They navigated mountains of smoky stairs in the World Trade Center’s twin towers or streamed out of a flaming Pentagon. Some fled an otherworldly dust cloud at ground zero. Others willed their way out of pitch-dark rubble.

Sept. 11 survivors bear scars and the weight of unanswerable questions. Some grapple with their place in a tragedy defined by an enormous loss of life. They get told to “get over” 9/11. But they also say they have gained resilience purpose appreciation and resolve.

“One of the things that I learned” Jimeno says “is to never give up.”

‘IT’S ALMOST LIKE YOU’RE REBORN’

It wasn’t Bruce Stephan’s first incredibly close call.

In 1989 his car got perilously wedged on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit and the upper deck collapsed while he was driving across.

Twelve years later the engineer and lawyer was settling into his workday on the 65th floor of the trade center’s north tower when one of the planes crashed about 30 stories above .

Only after his roughly hourlong walk down the crowded stairs did Stephan learn that another plane had hit the south tower — the building where his wife Joan also an attorney worked on the 91st floor. Above the impact zone.

Unable to reach her by cell phone Bruce Stephan dashed to a payphone and called her relatives who told him she’d gotten out.

Then the south tower fell and Stephan’s fear spiked anew. Had Joan been caught in the collapse? Hours later he finally learned that she was OK. (At least one other couple elevator operators Arturo and Carmen Griffith also survived; their story inspired a recent film “Lovebirds of the Twin Towers.”)

“My experience from the first disaster was that it’s a strangely happy moment when you know that you’ve survived” Bruce Stephan says. “It’s almost like you’re reborn… to know that you’re alive and that you still have a shot at life and here’s your chance to do something.”

“When it happened a second time it’s just like ‘Oh my God.’”

After the earthquake the New York City natives resolved to change their workaholic lives. After 9/11 they did.

Within two months the couple moved to Essex a northern New York town of roughly 700 people. While telecommuting and sometimes actually commuting they made time for other things — church a book club amateur theater gardening zoning meetings a local newsletter. They cherished a newfound sense of community.

But a work opportunity pulled them back to San Francisco in 2009. They loved it until the pandemic made them rethink their lives again.

“One of the things that that we discovered as a result of the disasters was that being in a community … is maybe the biggest reward you can have” Stephan 65 says from their front porch in Essex. They moved back last year.

‘I WAS A WALKING ZOMBIE’

Désirée Bouchat pauses by one of the inscribed names on the 9/11 memorial: James Patrick Berger. She last saw him on the 101st floor of the trade center’s south tower.

“Some days it feels like it happened yesterday” she says.

At first people figured the plane crash at the north tower was accidental. There was no immediate evacuation order for the south tower. But Berger ushered Bouchat and other Aon Corp. colleagues to the elevators then turned back to check for more people.

Just as Bouchat exited the south tower another plane slammed into it. Nearly 180 Aon workers perished including Berger.

For a while Bouchat told everyone including herself: “I’m fine. I’m alive.”

But “I was a walking zombie” she says now.

She couldn’t multitask anymore. Remarks that used to bother her stirred no reaction. She was functioning but through a fog that took more than a year to lift.

Bouchat eventually felt that she needed to talk about 9/11. The Springfield New Jersey resident has now led about 500 tours for the 9/11 Tribute Museum (it’s separate from the larger National September 11 Memorial & Museum).

Bruce Powers has traveled from Alexandria Virginia to lead Tribute Museum tours too. And every Sept. 11 the 82-year-old repeats his seven-mile (11 km) walk home from the Pentagon after the attack that killed 184 people 10 of whom he knew.

The walk the tours and hearing other guides’ personal stories “serve well in helping me deal with what happened” says Powers a now-retired Navy aviation planner.

The public hasn’t fully recognized the losses survivors felt says Mary Fetchet a social worker who lost her son Brad on 9/11 and founded Voices Center for Resilience a support and advocacy group for victims’ families first responders and survivors. “Although they are still living they’re living in a very different way.”

‘I COULDN’T FIGURE OUT HOW I GOT OUT OF THERE ALIVE’

For a time after 9/11 Police Department Officer Mark DeMarco replayed the what-ifs in his mind. If he’d gone right instead of left. A bit earlier. Or later.

“I couldn’t figure out how I got out of there alive” he says.

After helping evacuate the north tower the Emergency Service Unit officer was surrounded by a maze of debris when parts of the skyscraper tumbled onto a smaller building where he’d been directed. Some officers with him were killed.

Barely able to see his own boots with a small flashlight DeMarco inched through the ruins with two officers behind him.

Then he took a step and felt nothing underfoot. He looked below and saw utter darkness.

Only later — after the officers turned around and eventually clambered through shattered windows to safety — did DeMarco realize he’d nearly tumbled into a crater carved by the collapse.

Now 68 and retired DeMarco still wears a wristband with the names of the 14 ESU members killed that day. He worries that the public memory of the attacks is fading that the passage of time has created a false sense of security.

“Have fun with life. Don’t be afraid” he says. “But be mindful.”

‘IT’S NOT SOMETHING TO BE GOTTEN OVER’

A tsunami of dust washed over emergency medical technician Guy Sanders so thick that it clogged his surgical mask.

The 47-story building at 7 World Trade Center had just collapsed about seven hours after the burning towers fell and debris ignited fires in the smaller high-rise.

A part-time EMS supervisor for a private ambulance company in the city Sanders had scrambled to respond from his day job at a Long Island collections agency. He was en route when the towers collapsed killing eight EMA workers including his colleague Yamel Merino. Sanders went to funeral after funeral for EMTs firefighters and police.

Yet 9/11 only deepened his commitment to EMS. Though it was tricky financially he soon went full-time.

“I never wanted to be in a situation where people needed me and I couldn’t immediately respond” he says.

He still doesn’t. But health problems — including a rare cancer that the federal government has linked to trade center dust exposure — forced his 2011 retirement says Sanders 62 now living near Orangeburg South Carolina.

“You get people telling you ‘Well (9/11) happened so long ago. Get over it.’ But it is a trauma” says Sanders who joined a first responders’ and survivors’ support group. “It’s not something to be gotten over. It’s something to be addressed.”

‘SURVIVING IS ONLY THE FIRST PIECE OF THE JOURNEY’

Breathing through an oxygen mask in a hospital bed Wendy Lanski told herself: “If Osama bin Laden didn’t kill me I’m not dying of COVID.”

Nearly two decades earlier the health insurance manager escaped the north tower’s 29th floor and ran barefoot through the dust cloud from the south tower’s collapse. Eleven of her Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield colleagues died.

“The only good thing about surviving a tragedy or a catastrophe of any kind is: It definitely makes you more resilient” says Lanski who was hospitalized with the coronavirus — as was her husband — for two touch-and-go-weeks in spring 2020.

But “surviving is only the first piece of the journey” says Lanski 51 of West Orange New Jersey.

She has the twin towers “9/11/01” and “survivor” tattooed on her ankle. But the attacks also left other marks ones she didn’t choose.

Images and sounds of falling people and panes of glass lodged in her memory. She was diagnosed in 2006 with sarcoidosis she said; the federal government has concluded the inflammatory disease may be linked to trade center dust. And she has asked herself: “Why am I here and 3000 people are not?”

Over time she accepted not knowing.

“But while I’m here I’ve got to make it count” says Lanski who has spoken at schools and traveled to conferences about terror victims. “I’ve got to make up for 3000 people who lost their voice.”

‘IT MOTIVATES ME TO LIVE A BETTER LIFE’

Buried in darkness and 20 feet (6 meters) or more of rubble from both towers Will Jimeno was ready to die.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department rookie was in searing pain from a fallen wall pinning his left side. Fellow officer Dominick Pezzulo had died next to him. Flaming debris had fallen on Jimeno’s arm and heated the cramped area enough that Pezzulo’s gun fired sending a flurry of bullets past Jimeno’s head. He had yelled for help for hours. He was terribly thirsty.

“If I die today” he remembers thinking “at least I died trying to help people.”

Then Jimeno who is Catholic had what he describes as a vision of a robed man walking toward him a bottle of water in his hand.

We’re going to get out he told Sgt. John McLoughlin who was trapped with him.

It was hours — of pushing back pain thinking of rescues in past disasters talking to keep alert — before they were found and gruelingly extricated by former U.S. Marines NYPD officers a onetime paramedic and firefighters as blazes flared and debris shifted and fell.

“If you wanted to picture what hell looked like this was probably it” recalls then-NYPD Officer Ken Winkler.

Jimeno was freed around 11 p.m. McLoughlin the next morning. Jimeno underwent surgeries and lengthy rehabilitation.

But he says his psychological recovery was harder. Trivial things made him lose his temper — fueled he now realizes by anger about the deaths of colleagues and people rescuers couldn’t help. At times he says he thought of suicide. It took three years and multiple therapists before he mastered warding off the outbursts.

It has helped to tell his story in talks in the 2006 Oliver Stone movie “World Trade Center” and in Jimeno’s two newly released books — the illustrated “Immigrant American Survivor” for children and “ Sunrise Through the Darkness” about coping with trauma.

The Colombian-born U.S. Navy veteran hopes that people see in his story “the resiliency of the human soul the American spirit” and the power of good people stepping up in bad times.

Sept. 11 “motivates me to live a better life” says Jimeno 53 of Chester New Jersey. “The way I can honor those we lost and those that were injured is to live a fruitful life. To be an example to others that Sept. 11 did not destroy us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjEvMDkvOTExLTIwLXllYXJzLWxhdGVyLXR3by10cmFnZWRpZXMtdHdvLXNldHMtb2YtcmVmb3Jtcy12aWV3cG9pbnQuaHRtbNIBe2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjEvMDkvOTExLTIwLXllYXJzLWxhdGVyLXR3by10cmFnZWRpZXMtdHdvLXNldHMtb2YtcmVmb3Jtcy12aWV3cG9pbnQuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,9/11 20 years later: Two tragedies two sets of reforms. (Viewpoint),"My brother-in-law Sean Rooney was killed at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 2001. He worked in the South Tower.

Sean and the others in his office had started down the stairway to evacuate after a plane hit the North Tower but the Port Authority announced over an intercom that they should return to their offices if they were able. This is recorded in the background of a voicemail Sean sent his wife my sister Beverly Eckert to tell her that he was OK and that he was heading back upstairs to his office. He’d call back soon.

By that time my sister was rushing home from her work in Stamford Connecticut having heard the news that a plane crashed into the trade center. Sean did go back up the stairs. When the second plane hit his tower he was trapped above the impact zone.

Sean called my sister again. He asked what she could see on TV and they talked about every way to escape including trying to get to the roof where there had been a rescue after the terrorist attack at the very same World Trade Center in 1993. But the doors were locked. The stairwells were thick with smoke. The windows were hot.

Knowing the hopelessness Sean told Beverly to tell his family he loved them and then they spoke about their love and their Camelot lives together. They saw the movie “Camelot” on their second date when they were just 16 years old and they would say on every anniversary together that their lives were like the words in the song from the movie “happily-ever-after-ing.”

Sean was struggling to breathe. My sister heard the terrible sounds through the phone while watching Sean’s tower collapse on TV. Sean was killed. His remains have never been found.

Sean was like another brother to me. He was fun and funny and he was a great cook too – winning combinations for our frequent family get togethers. Beverly worked for a time at Traveler’s Insurance Co. on Maple Street here in Springfield and I saw them often. They both doted on my children.

What gets me through the dark days though are my memories of Sean and Beverly as builders a perfect antidote to the destruction on 9/11.

Sean was a weekend carpenter entirely self-taught. He balanced his cerebral work at Aon Insurance Co. with all kinds of home improvement projects in each of their homes as their jobs transferred them around New York Massachusetts and finally to Stamford. Along the way both Sean and Beverly acquired carpentry plumbing and electrical skills to renovate each one of their homes do-it-yourself style.

With their outgoing neighborliness Sean and Beverly also built community among the residents in the Glenbrook section of Stamford. Their last act together was to organize a Labor Day block party in September 2001. We treasure a photo of them taken on that weekend no doubt the last picture of them together as a couple.

Beverly was a builder too. After Sean was killed she worked through her grief volunteering with her local Habitat for Humanity using Sean’s tools and his carpenter’s belt to build homes in Fairfield County and in Slidell Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. Sean’s tool belt and tools are now on exhibit at the 9/11 Museum about the lives of those who died that day.

Beverly also helped build her community. She volunteered regularly at a local elementary school and a nursing home and co-founded the Voices of September 11th an effective support group that continues today to provide survivors and family members with resources and seminars on healing. She also tackled a bigger project with others to change the New York City building code to improve safety in skyscrapers based on the problems uncovered in the chaotic evacuations of the Twin Towers.

Beverly’s most nationally significant work was with 11 others who formed The Family Steering Committee a core group of people each having a family member who was killed on 9/11. They lobbied Congress relentlessly to demand accountability. This group of citizens was the conscience of the nation to press for an investigation attend all the meetings of the 9/11 Commission and pressure for the implementation of its proposals. I was able to accompany Beverly on some of her missions. The 9/11 Commission issued about 40 recommendations in its 2004 report including a reorganization of the federal government. A new cabinet department of homeland security and a new position of the director of national intelligence were created so that information would no longer be siloed and warnings missed.

Just weeks before her death Beverly was in D.C. yet again with a group to lobby President Obama to seek justice for the victims of the terrorist attack on the USS Cole and to prosecute the terrorists held in Guantanamo Bay. Beverly did not want revenge for the death of her husband and the thousands of others. She often said that revenge which overtook many in our country was counter-productive. What she wanted was accountability here and abroad so the tragedy of 9/11 would never happen again.

It was the scholarship Beverly founded in Sean’s honor building his legacy at his high school which occasioned her own death. She took Continental/Colgan Airlines Flight 3407 to Buffalo on Feb. 12 2009 to be with Sean’s family on his birthday and to award the Sean Rooney Scholarship to the next recipient. Beverly never made it. Flight 3407 crashed into a single-family house just 5 nautical miles from its intended landing. All passengers and crew on board were killed as well as one man in the house struck by the plane.

Why did Flight 3407 crash? Beverly’s work fueled by her love for Sean and the rage at what happened on 9/11 provided a roadmap for The Families of Continental Flight 3407 a group formed soon after the crash to follow the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB report issued in 2010 found multiple failures in training and operations resulting in the pilots’ loss of control approaching the landing. The crash as it turns out was needless. The Families of Flight 3407 demanded accountability and lobbied Congress hard to pass The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Act of 2010 addressing the factors identified by the NTSB investigation that contributed to the crash.

Who knew citizens could even do that? We knew from Beverly’s example. There was a core group from the Families of Flight 3407 including my sisters Susan Bourque and Karen Eckert who retired from their jobs to travel to D. C. almost weekly during that first year and completely at their own expense to push for the most comprehensive reforms in aviation since 1986.

The Families of Flight 3407 were up against a powerful professional and well- financed lobby from the airlines who fought the reforms every step of the way. The airlines figured that our energy and interest would burn out over time but they were no match for the grief and fury of The Families of Flight 3407 that this needless crash should not happen to anyone else ever again. We never gave up. The core group traveled to D.C. over 75 times attending every Congressional hearing on aviation safety since 2009. I was able to join my sisters at the larger events with other members of the Families of Flight 3407 who turned out in person or by email whenever there needed to be a strong showing of people demanding the government do what is right and make commercial air travel safer for everyone.

It has taken 12 grueling years of pressure on Congress the FAA and three administrations to reform commercial aviation safety in these ways:

- improve crew member training especially on stall and upset recovery;

- impose flight and duty time limits reflecting the current science on sleep;

- require air carrier ticket disclosure (my sister’s ticket was from Continental Airlines yet she had to board a small regional carrier);

- set standards for pilot professional development;

and create a Pilot Records Data Base.

The last reform the creation of a Pilot Records Data Base was just finalized this may. The NTSB found that the captain on my sister’s Flight 3407 deliberately concealed multiple training deficiencies at previous employers including his failure to upgrade to captain. The pilot was finally certified after failing two more times and he was entrusted with the lives of commercial air travelers to get them safely to their destinations. An executive of Colgan Airlines stated he would not have hired this pilot had he known the pilot’s prior history but it was Colgan Airlines negligence that the pilot was not sufficiently trained.

The final rule (PDF) for the Pilot Records Database now requires air carriers and certain other operators to report pilots’ employment history training and qualifications to the database. The rule also requires air carriers and certain operators to review records contained in the database when considering pilots for employment. This reform shouldn’t have taken this long.

Before the crash of Flight 3407 the longest period of time without a fatal crash on a U.S. commercial airline was two and a half years. After the crash of Flight 3407 in 2009 there have been no fatal U.S. commercial airline crashes. The aviation reforms are working.

While I would give anything to have Sean and Beverly back I am grateful for the reforms after 9/11 making us safer from foreign terrorists who want to harm us and safer after the crash of Flight 3407 when we travel on commercial airlines. I am grateful too for living in a country where citizen action demanding accountability can still work underscoring the truth of a statement attributed to Margaret Mead: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world.

NEW YORK (AP) — Trapped deep in the wreckage of the World Trade Center Will Jimeno lived through the unthinkable. Twenty years later he’s still living with it.

The injuries ended his police career. He has post-traumatic stress disorder. He keeps shelves of mementoes including a cross and miniature twin towers fashioned from trade center steel. He was portrayed in a movie and wrote two books about enduring the ordeal.

“It never goes away for those of us that were there that day” he says.

Nearly 3000 people were killed when hijackers in Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida terror network rammed four commercial jets into the trade center the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11 2001. Yet an estimated 33000 or more people successfully evacuated the stricken buildings.

Sept. 11 survivors bear scars and the weight of unanswerable questions. Some grapple with their place in a tragedy defined by an enormous loss of life. They get told to “get over” 9/11. But they also say they have gained resilience purpose appreciation and resolve.

“One of the things that I learned” Jimeno says “is to never give up.”

In 1989 Bruce Stephan’s car got perilously wedged on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit and the upper deck collapsed while he was driving across. Twelve years later the engineer and lawyer was working on the 65th floor of the trade center’s north tower when one of the planes crashed about 30 stories above .

Only after his hourlong walk down the crowded stairs did Stephan learn that another plane had hit the south tower — the building where his wife Joan also an attorney worked on the 91st floor. Above the impact zone.

It would be hours before the two were reunited.

“It’s almost like you’re reborn ... to know that you’re alive and that you still have a shot at life” says Bruce Stephan 65.

Shortly after 9/11 the couple moved to Essex a northern New York town and strove to balance work with other things -- church amateur theater gardening. They cherished a newfound sense of community.

But a work opportunity pulled them back to San Francisco in 2009. They loved it until the pandemic made them rethink their lives again. They moved back last year.

Désirée Bouchat pauses by one of the inscribed names on the 9/11 memorial: James Patrick Berger. She last saw him on the 101st floor of the south tower.

“Some days it feels like it happened yesterday” she says.

At first people figured the plane crash at the north tower was accidental. There was no immediate evacuation order for the south tower. But Berger ushered Bouchat and other Aon Corp. colleagues to the elevators then turned back to check for more people.

Just as Bouchat exited the south tower another plane slammed into it. Nearly 180 Aon workers perished including Berger.

For a while Bouchat told everyone including herself: “I’m fine. I’m alive.”

But “I was a walking zombie” she says now.

She couldn’t multitask anymore. Remarks that used to bother her stirred no reaction. She was functioning but through a fog that took more than a year to lift.

Bouchat eventually felt that she needed to talk about 9/11. The Springfield New Jersey resident now leads tours for the 9/11 Tribute Museum.

So does Bruce Powers who also annually repeats every year his seven-mile walk home from the Pentagon on 9/11. The walk and tours “serve well in helping me deal with what happened” says Powers 82 a now-retired Navy aviation planner.

For a time after 9/11 Police Department Officer Mark DeMarco replayed the what-ifs in his mind. If he’d gone right instead of left. A bit earlier. Or later.

“I couldn’t figure out how I got out of there alive” he says.

After helping evacuate the north tower the Emergency Service Unit officer was surrounded by a maze of debris when parts of the skyscraper tumbled onto a smaller building where he’d been directed. Some officers with him were killed.

As he inched his way out in darkness with two other officers DeMarco nearly tumbled into a crater carved by the collapse.

Now 68 and retired DeMarco still wears a wristband with the names of the 14 ESU members killed that day. He worries that the public memory of the attacks is fading. “Have fun with life. Don’t be afraid” he says. “But be mindful.”

A tsunami of dust washed over emergency medical technician Guy Sanders so thick that it clogged his surgical mask.

The 47-story building at 7 World Trade Center had just collapsed about seven hours after the burning towers fell and debris ignited fires in the smaller high-rise.

A part-time EMS supervisor Sanders had scrambled to respond from his day job. He was en route when the towers collapsed killing eight EMA workers including his colleague Yamel Merino.

Yet 9/11 only deepened his commitment to EMS. He soon went full-time.

“I never wanted to be in a situation where people needed me and I couldn’t immediately respond” says Sanders 62 now living near Orangeburg South Carolina.

He still doesn’t. But health problems — including a rare cancer that the federal government has linked to trade center dust exposure — forced his 2011 retirement.

Breathing through an oxygen mask in a hospital bed Wendy Lanski told herself: “If Osama bin Laden didn’t kill me I’m not dying of COVID.”

Nearly two decades earlier the health insurance manager escaped the north tower’s 29th floor and ran barefoot through the dust cloud from the south tower’s collapse. Eleven of her Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield colleagues died.

“The only good thing about surviving a tragedy or a catastrophe of any kind is: It definitely makes you more resilient” says Lanski who was hospitalized with the coronavirus — as was her husband — for two weeks in spring 2020.

But “surviving is only the first piece of the journey” says Lanski 51 of West Orange New Jersey.

She has asked herself: “Why am I here and 3000 people are not?” Over time she accepted not knowing.

“But while I’m here I’ve got to make it count” says Lanski who has spoken at schools and traveled to conferences about terror victims. “I’ve got to make up for 3000 people who lost their voice.”

Buried in darkness and 20 feet or more of rubble from both towers Will Jimeno was ready to die.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department rookie was in searing pain from a fallen wall pinning his left side. Fellow officer Dominick Pezzulo had died next to him.

He had yelled for help for hours and was terribly thirsty. Then Jimeno who is Catholic had what he describes as a vision of a robed man walking toward him a bottle of water in his hand. We’re going to get out he told Sgt. John McLoughlin who was trapped with him.

It was hours — of pushing back pain thinking of rescues in past disasters talking to keep alert — before they were found and gruelingly extricated by former U.S. Marines NYPD officers a onetime paramedic and firefighters as blazes flared and debris shifted and fell.

“If you wanted to picture what hell looked like this was probably it” recalls then-NYPD Officer Ken Winkler.

Jimeno was freed around 11 p.m. McLoughlin the next morning. Jimeno underwent surgeries and lengthy rehabilitation.

But he says his psychological recovery was harder.

It has helped to tell his story in talks in the 2006 Oliver Stone movie “World Trade Center” and in Jimeno’s two newly released books.

The Colombian-born U.S. Navy veteran hopes that people see in his story “the resiliency of the human soul the American spirit” and the power of good people stepping up in bad times.

Says Jimeno 53 of Chester New Jersey: “The way I can honor those we lost and those that were injured is to live a fruitful life.”

Associated Press

Over the past week or so Apple has eased some longstanding restrictions that helped make its App Store into a big moneymaker for the company. The company has long required app developers to pay high commissions to Apple on the sales of paid apps as well as purchases of subscriptions or digital items inside their apps.

Apple is facing some significant pressure to open up the App Store further. A federal judge is soon expected to return a verdict in an antitrust lawsuit filed by Epic Games the maker of Fortnite that seeks to strike down much of Apple’s commission system. And earlier this week the South Korean legislature passed a law that would allow developers to sidestep payment systems run by both Apple and Google – and the commissions of 15% to 30% they charge.

But Apple hasn’t always explained its moves very clearly leaving some iPhone users with unanswered questions as to what exactly Apple is doing and whether and how they’ll be affected.

What is happening in Apple's App Store?

Late Wednesday Apple agreed to App Store changes starting next year to resolve an investigation by Japanese regulators. For the first time Apple will allow Spotify Netflix and other apps that sell digital subscriptions to music video magazines newspapers books and audio to include an in-app link to their own sites where users can sign up outside Apple’s payment system.

Apple took a more limited step in the same direction last week when it agreed to let app developers email their users about ways to sidestep Apple when signing up for subscriptions. Such efforts could previously have gotten apps kicked out of Apple’s store. That change resulted from a preliminary settlement in a class-action lawsuit that still requires court approval.

Spotify CEO Daniel Ek applauded the Wednesday move as a “step in in the right direction” in a Thursday tweet. But he lamented that Apple isn’t granting the same freedom to all apps including those that make video games.

“Our goal is to restore competition once and for all not one arbitrary self-serving step at a time” Ek tweeted.

Will iPhone owners pay less for apps?

Probably not.

In theory subscription apps could lower their prices although there’s little reason to think they will. Netflix for instance has been steadily raising prices for reasons that have nothing to do with Apple’s commissions. The video streaming service says the price increases help it pay for a steady stream of new original programming.

But the changes could make life easier for some users of services like Spotify and Netflix which had simply blocked sign-ups in their iPhone apps because they didn’t want to share that revenue with Apple. Instead users have had to visit the companies’ websites to start a subscription they could then use with their iPhone app.

Apple defends App Store commissions

The company maintains the fees it charges help it recoup the more than $100 billion it has spent on its iPhone ecosystem. And it notes that most of the 1.8 billion apps on its store pay nothing because they rely on ads instead of subscriptions and other user purchases.

Apple also insists that control over its app ecosystem helps protect the privacy and security of its customers. Critics however say that’s just a pretext for preserving a commission system that unexpectedly turned into a gold mine even though company co-founder Steve Jobs didn’t envision making money from the store when it opened. Apple doesn’t disclose the app store’s financial performance in its financial results but it is a major component of the company’s services division which generated $54 billion in revenue the last fiscal year.

Will Apple's actions affect Epic Games lawsuit ruling?

It’s unlikely although Apple’s changes appear to address one of the key concerns that U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers raised during the Apple-Epic trial in May.

During the trial she had seemed troubled by a provision that forbids in-app notifications pointing out that purchases can also be made through web sites and other means not just within the app. Such notices she mused wouldn’t be much different than a merchant’s display of the different credit cards – Visa Mastercard America Express or Discover – that has long been a staple at cash registers."

Earlier this year scientists at Purdue University produced the whitest paint ever created which they claim reflects 98.1% of sunlight and can produce similar cooling effects as standard air conditioners. Now an associate professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at Northeastern University in Boston Yi Zheng has invented a new way to significantly cool buildings without a cooling system – using a sustainable material called “cooling paper.”

How Cooling Paper Works

The new cooling paper reflects the solar rays away from buildings and sucks the heat out of the interiors. The paper’s porous microstructure contains natural fibers that absorb warmth and re-emits it away from the building. As a result the paper can be applied to the roofs of commercial buildings and homes or incorporated into building materials for construction.

Zheng came up with the invention when he saw a recycling bucket filled with printed paper waste. He recalled thinking “How could we simply transform that waste material into some functional energy material composite materials?”

He immediately got to work and started making a pulp using his own high-speed blender. Once the pulp made from waste paper and the material used to make Teflon was complete he formed it into a water-repelling paper that can be used to coat buildings.

Successful Results

When Zheng and his team tested the cooling paper under different humidity levels and temperatures they found that the paper reduced the interior temperature by 10°F making a massive difference on a scorching day. “I was surprised when I obtained the same result. We thought there would be maybe 10% 20% of loss but no” Zheng recalled.

According to The Hill 75% of all homes in the US have air conditioners and are releasing approximately 117 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per year. There is no doubt that these appliances are significantly contributing to global warming. Zheng’s new invention could reduce those carbon emissions and electricity use. Another plus is once the material is at the end of its lifecycle it can be reformed and still perform as well as the original.

Zheng concluded:

The ultimate goal is to reduce global warming. The starting point is to reduce the use of carbon-based materials and also to reduce global warming.

Zheng’s invention was featured in the American Chemical Society journal Applied Materials & Interfaces and in 2019 National Science Foundation CAREER awarded him for his research.

Benefits Of A Cool Rooftop

A cool roof can significantly benefit a building its dwellers and the environment by:

Extending roof service life

Reducing energy costs by decreasing air-con needs

Improving indoor comfort for spaces that don’t have cooling systems like covered patios or garages

When several buildings in a community have cool roofs it can:

Reduce local air temperatures (known as the urban heat island effect)

Lower peak electricity demand preventing power outages

Reduce power plant emissions such as sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide nitrous oxides and mercury by minimizing cooling energy use in buildings

How To Keep Cool Without Air-Con

Rising temperatures have been linked to insomnia dehydration and in some cases death. Below are some tips and steps you can follow to beat the heat during the hottest times of the year.

Take a cold shower when your skin is hot. If you don’t have time to take a full-body wash you can fill a spray bottle with cool water then mist yourself.

Wet your hair press cold washcloths to hot areas on your body (like the back of your neck) or soak your feet in cold-ice water.

Fabrics make a huge difference in body temperature; consider light-weight breathable moisture-absorbing fabrics that are meant to soak up sweat.

On that note two Chinese scientists recently developed a new fabric that looks like a regular t-shirt but radiates heat and reflects light to cool the skin temperature by nearly 5°C effectively.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMzA0Mzg5NDIxMDA5MDJY0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID-19 discarded disposable gloves as a source and a vector of pollutants in the environment,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030438942100902X on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMzA0Mzg5NDIxMDA5MDJY0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Plus personne ne doit mourir pour rien” assure le patron de la junte

Le 5 septembre 2021 restera dans les annales de l’histoire politique guinéenne. Très tôt le matin des tirs sporadiques ont réveillé les citoyens de la commune de Kaloum quartier administratif abritant la présidence de la République. Après avoir dans une vidéo devenue virale sur les réseaux défini les grandes lignes la junte est allée à la radio télévision guinéenne.

Dans son discours le colonel Mamady Doumbouya a dénoncé les tares du pouvoir caractérique par une gabégie financière la politisation à outrance de l’administration publique la pauvreté et la corruption endémique.

Pour mettre un terme à ces tares la junte promet de travailler désormais avec “le peuple souverain de Guinée dans sa totalité. Nous avons décidé à partir de l’instant de dissoudre la constitution”.

En ce qui concerne la rédaction d’une nouvelle constitution elle s’engage à faire participer “les quatre régions naturelles et la diaspora”.

Avant de rassurer : “La personnalisation de la vie politique est terminée. Nous allons mettre en place une transition transparente et inclusive. Nous allons mettre en place un système qui n’existe pas. Ce système il faut qu’on soit tous ensemble”.

Et de regretter : “ Il y a eu beaucoup de morts beaucoup de blessés et beaucoup de larmes. Nous allons tous nous asseoir pour rédiger une constitution qui est adoptée à nos réalités capable de régler nos problèmes parce que si vous voyez l’état de nos routes vous voyez l’état de nos hôpitaux vous vous rendrez compte qu’après 62 ans d’indépendance il est temps” qu’on se donne la main

S’agissant de la constitution elle est dissoute : “C’est vrai nous avons dissout la constitution. Nous allons disssoudre les institutions. La fermeture des frontières terrestres pendant une semaine et nous allons comment faire pour la frontière aérienne. Avec tous nos camarades nous allons trouver la solution pour sortir de cette gabegie”.

Ensuite la junte appelle à l’occasion de prise du pouvoir par les militaires ses “frères d’armes des unités de toute la république de se mettre au côté du peuple cette fois-ci pour aider le peuple de Guinée. Nous invitons chacun en ce qui le concerne pour continuer les activités régaliennes” en protégeant la population et en assurant sa sécurité.

“Nous allons engager une concertation nantionale pour une transition inclusive et apaisée. Plus personne ne doit mourir pour rien” assure le patron de la junte

Avant de rassurer l’ensemble des partenaires bi et multilatéraux les organisations internationales pour le respect des engagements pris vis-à-vis d’eux.

Le colonel Doumbouya a aussi évoqué Jerry Rawlings qui disait “si le peuple est écrasé par ses élites il revient à l’armée de rendre au peuple sa liberté”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmFuY2UyNC5jb20vZnIvYWZyaXF1ZS8yMDIxMDkwNS1tYWxpLXVuLWNoZWYtZGUtbGEtcG9saWNlLWluY3VscCVDMyVBOS1wb3VyLW1ldXJ0cmVzLWxpYiVDMyVBOXIlQzMlQTktc291cy1sYS1wcmVzc2lvbi1kZXMtcG9saWNpZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,À Bamako un commissaire écroué puis libéré sous la pression des policiers,"Au Mali le gouvernement a dénoncé samedi soir une manifestation de policiers en armes la veille.

Un acte ""condamnable"" pour le gouvernement du Mali. Le pouvoir intérimaire malien a dénoncé samedi 4 septembre dans la soirée une manifestation de policiers en armes ayant eu lieu la veille. Un mouvement de protestation qui a abouti à la libération d’un responsable de la police écroué pour son rôle présumé dans la répression sanglante de la contestation de l’été 2020.

Des hommes en uniformes et armés sont descendus dans la rue pour manifester"" ce qui est un acte ""condamnable"" commentait un communiqué lu à la télévision publique. ""Le gouvernement demande à tout le monde de se rassurer"" a poursuivi le communiqué assurant que la lutte contre l’impunité continuait.

Plus tôt dans la journée sous pression de ses collègues le chef des Forces spéciales antiterroristes le commissaire divisionnaire Oumar Samaké a été remis en liberté. Il était devenu vendredi la première personnalité placée en détention dans le cadre de l’enquête sur la répression en juillet 2020 du mouvement de contestation sous la présidence d’Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta renversé depuis par les militaires.

Mais Oumar Samaké n’a passé que quelques heures en détention à Bamako et a recouvré la liberté dans des conditions peu claires après qu’un certain nombre de policiers ont marché sur sa prison.

Libéré ""par souci de paix""

Un surveillant de prison Yacouba Touré a indiqué vendredi à l'AFP que des policiers étaient ""venus en grand nombre bien armés"" à la maison d'arrêt centrale de Bamako. ""Nous n'avons pas fait la résistance ils sont partis avec Ousmane Samaké sans incident"".

Un responsable du ministère de la Justice a déclaré sous le couvert de l'anonymat à l'AFP que ""par souci de paix"" les autorités avaient décidé de le faire libérer sans que les policiers n'entrent dans la prison.

La Synergie des sections syndicales des Surveillants de prison du Mali a évoqué ""des événements désastreux"" et a appelé les autorités à ""prendre leurs responsabilités pour éviter une situation regrettable"".

L’Association malienne des droits de l’Homme ""indignée""

L'Association malienne des droits de l'Homme (AMDH) au Mali s'est dite ""profondément indignée de la libération au forcing"" d'Oumar Samaké et ""condamne avec véhémence"" cette ""atteinte grave à la démocratie et à l'État de droit"".

Elle se dit ""scandalisée"" que ""des forces de l'ordre qui doivent faire respecter la loi"" aient agi ""illégalement pour obtenir la libération d'une personne incarcérée suite à une décision de justice"" et ""fustige cette obstruction au travail de la Justice par des agents chargés de l'application de la loi"".

""L'AMDH craint que cette situation sape des efforts en cours en matière de lutte contre l'impunité"".

>> Mali : l'ONU déplore ""l'impunité généralisée"" des violations des droits humains

Le 10 juillet 2020 après des semaines de mobilisation contre le président Keïta une manifestation avait dégénéré en plusieurs jours de troubles à Bamako. L'opposition avait fait état de 23 morts et l'ONU de 14 manifestants dont deux enfants tués pendant la répression.

Les journalistes de l'AFP avaient vu des hommes encagoulés vêtus de noir arme automatique à la main à l'arrière de pick-up dans les rues de Bamako sans marque distinctive. Ils avaient été communément identifiés comme des membres des forces antiterroristes. Leur emploi à des tâches de maintien de l'ordre avait suscité l'indignation.

Les événements de vendredi rappellent combien ces investigations sont sensibles et combien la situation demeure volatile au Mali pris dans la tourmente sécuritaire et politique depuis 2012.

La zone concernée se trouve au large de Port Fourchon un port de Louisiane (sud) situé à environ 160 kilomètres de La Nouvelle-Orléans qui se consacre principalement au stockage et à l’acheminement de pétrole. Les gardes-côtes de Louisiane «ont été informés d’une pollution» dans ce secteur et «y répondent» selon un communiqué publié dimanche.

Une entreprise texane spécialisée dans les plateformes pétrolières en mer Talos Energy doit envoyer dimanche une équipe de plongée pour tenter de déterminer la source de la fuite de pétrole selon les gardes-côtes. «L’enquête n’a pas encore déterminé l’origine de la fuite; néanmoins des observations approfondies sur les lieux indiquent que les structures de Talos n’en sont pas la source» a fait savoir l’entreprise dans un communiqué assurant qu’il n’y avait «pas d’impact» sur les côtes ou sur la faune à ce stade.

Talos Energy précise avoir cessé en 2017 la production dans la zone concernée par la fuite de pétrole en bouchant les sources et en enlevant son réseau de tuyaux.

La plus grave marée noire de l’histoire

Charriant des vents de 240 km/h l’ouragan Ida a frappé les côtes de la Louisiane il y a une semaine causant des dégâts «catastrophiques» selon les autorités locales. Ida devenue tempête a ensuite poursuivi son chemin et en particulier touché New York et sa région.

Le golfe du Mexique riche en hydrocarbures est l’une des grandes zones de production pétrolière des États-Unis. C’est là qu’avait explosé en 2010 la plateforme Deepwater Horizon déclenchant une marée noire généralement considérée comme la plus grave de l’histoire.

Beginning on May 31 Season 1 of the animated sci-fi drama will begin streaming on Netflix in the U.S. the U.K. Ireland and New Zealand. The Netflix deal is non-exclusive meaning the episodes will remain available on Max. Sources tell Variety that Netflix is considering picking up “Scavengers Reign” for a second season but a decision won’t be made until after Season 1’s debut on the streamer.

The series is set on an alien planet where a damaged interstellar freighter ship gets stranded and follows the remaining crew as they struggle to locate their ship and missing crewmates while navigating a hostile world that has thrived without human interference.

Variety named “Scavengers Reign” one of the top 19 shows of 2023 with critic Alison Herman writing that it “pairs the engrossing ambience of a nature documentary with the propulsive thrust of narrative. Its characters are fully realized and flawed but their main scene partners are an environment they need to intuit the workings of alongside the audience. The 12-episode season is a deep cut worth seeking out (or renewing if you’re the powers that be and Warner Bros. Discovery).”

Popular on Variety

“Scavengers Reign” was created Joseph Bennett and Charles Huettner who executive produce alongside Chris Prynoski. Sean Buckelew and James Merrill serve as co-executive producers with Benjy Brooke as supervising director. The series was produced by Green Street Pictures in partnership with Titmouse Inc.

“We are beyond thrilled that ‘Scavengers Reign’ will be joining the incredible animation lineup on Netflix” said Bennett Buckelew Merrill and Brooke on behalf of Green Street. “We’re immensely grateful to everyone who has watched the show already and to Netflix for giving it an opportunity to be discovered by a wider audience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vY3RleGFtaW5lci5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9qdWxhaS10aGUtc2Vyb3RvbmVzLWFyZS1sb29raW5nLXRvLWxldC10aGUtbXVzaWMtZmxvdy1hdC1hcmNoLXN0cmVldC10YXZlcm4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Julai & The Serotones are Looking to Let The Music Flow at Arch Street Tavern,"The best way to realize a band's particular talents is the way they interact with their audience.

MEMPHIS Tenn. — With a stunning acrobatic once-in-a-lifetime goal fitting of a video game the Memphis 901 FC snatched a last second win against the Birmingham Legion Saturday night at AutoZone Park in downtown Memphis.

The match-winning goal was delivered by Raul Gonzalez with just moments left in stoppage time. Gonzalez’s heroic masterpiece was just minutes after a beautiful goal by Roland Lamah.

“I thought to myself ‘Let me get off the ground let me really put my whole body into this and make it 100%.’ I jumped up for it tried to find the center of the ball and make contact and I hit it on frame and it went upper 90°. It was a little bit of luck and a little bit of concentration. I was kind of shocked when it went in but I was relieved to know it went in because what a time to score. Given the season and knowing where we’re at to get a result coming off of multiple ties recently is a great way to move forward” Gonzalez said of his brilliant winning goal.

“It was crazy. I thought we had lost the game. Their first goal was a gift and we responded brilliantly. The second half was completely one-sided and honestly the whole game was our game. We’ve dealt with a lot of stuff this year and we’ve played very well and lost embarrassingly. So to come back with that attitude and that effort shows where this club and this team is at. It was unreal but it was a deserved win” said Memphis 901 FC Head Coach Ben Pirmann.

With the breathtaking win Memphis 901 FC now is 6-7-7 (25 points) on the season. Birmingham fell to 12-7-3 (39 points). Memphis 901 FC’s next match is Saturday September 11 at 7pm against the Miami FC at AutoZone Park.

Most of us stopped going to the bank during the pandemic and once you realize how easy it is to get things done from your phone or computer why go back?

But some of the biggest cyber threats we face today are banking Trojans — malicious programs that hunt for bank information while disguising themselves as harmless documents. They can scan what you type steal your money and compromise all of your most sensitive passwords. These often come loaded in malicious apps. Tap or click for more info on apps recently caught stealing bank credentials.

Your bank account is one of the most important things in your life to protect from hackers. Without strong cybersecurity you could end up losing money and critical personal data. If you haven’t given your online bank accounts a security checkup now’s the time. Here are the steps you need to take.

1. Create strong passwords

Creating strong passwords is the most fundamental step in securing your accounts. Weak options like 12345678 or Password can be easily guessed or cracked with software that hackers can download for free. And if you share a weak password across multiple accounts or profiles you’ll have a domino effect on your hands if one of them gets compromised.

To protect your accounts here are some good rules for making better passwords:

Always use a random (or non-sequential) set of upper and lowercase letters numbers and symbols. Always make your passwords eight characters or longer. Use unique passwords for every single account every single time.

If you’re having trouble figuring out strong passwords here’s an example we use here at Komando.com: T/V\ho2nnL. It comes from a random sentence — a Metallica lyric. “Take my hand off to never-never land.”

Use the first character from each word to get “tmhotnnl.” Then replace some words and letters with symbols and numbers. “M” becomes /V\ and “to” becomes 2. Finally capitalize a few of the letters to make a tough password that’s easy to remember: “T/V\ho2nnL”.

Tap or click here for even more ideas to help you generate stronger passwords.

2. Set up two-factor authentication

Activating two-factor authentication (2FA) for your bank accounts is a great way to keep hackers out. When it’s set up you can’t log in without a code that your bank sends to your phone via text message. Hackers won’t have access to your phone which means it’s unlikely they’ll be able to get in. Plus you’ll know any time someone tries to log in without your permission.

Here’s how you can set up 2FA for some of the nation’s biggest banks.

Chase: Chase automatically sets customers up with 2FA from the get-go. The first time you sign in to your account from a new device you’ll be asked to verify your identity with a text code. Your phone number and email address will need to be current on your account so if either is out of date call the support number on the back of your card.

Wells Fargo: Open the tab labeled Your Security Center from the Wells Fargo app or website or tap or click here to activate 2FA for your account. You’ll be asked to enter a phone number where you can receive your security code. Once you type in the code 2FA will be active the next time you log in.

Bank of America: Choose Profile & Settings in the upper left-hand corner of BoA’s website and click Manage SafePass. From here you can add any phone numbers you want your security code sent to. When you’re finished you’ll be asked to verify your debit or credit card details to complete the setup.

Citibank: Citibank customers already have 2FA active by default. The first time you sign in to your account from a new device you’ll be asked to verify your identity with a text code. Your phone number and email address will need to be current on your account so call the number on the back of your card if either is out of date.

If you don’t see your bank listed here you can usually find the option under the account settings or security settings for your bank’s website or app where you have the option to change your password.

In addition to 2FA some banks offer encrypted security tokens. These small handheld devices generate one-time passcodes you can use to log into your account. Because they’re physical devices owned by your bank and kept safe by you there isn’t a way for a hacker to gain access without physically handling one. Ask your banker for more information.

3. Stick to secure devices

Some devices are much better for checking your accounts than others. If your PC gets a virus for example you might have a hacker watching you type in your password without even realizing it.

One smart step you can take is securing every device you bank on with a strong antivirus and antimalware solution. Kim’s pick is TotalAV. Tap or click for more info and a link to get 85% off your first year.

To protect your accounts you can pick and choose a device that you only use for finances. For this we recommend a lightweight Chromebook computer. These affordable laptops run ChromeOS which means they aren’t vulnerable to the same kinds of malware as a full-fledged Windows PC.

This ASUS Chromebook retails for less than $200 and is secure enough to check your most sensitive bank accounts. It can also browse the web play videos on YouTube and stream music from your favorite services like Spotify.

If you’d rather not spend money on a new Chromebook you can protect your account using biometric security settings like your fingerprint or face. If your phone has a face scanner (like Apple’s FaceID) or a fingerprint reader you can use these to verify your logins. Check the Settings area of your bank’s app to see if biometric authentication is offered.

4. A little dishonesty won’t hurt

Most banks will have you set up security questions when you create your account. These questions are used to verify your identity in the event you get logged out or make a major change to your settings.

But what if a hacker or stalker knows more about your life than you expect? If you post details about your life on social media it can be easy to crack security questions without ever breaking into your account. Tap or click here to see if you’re oversharing on social media.

That’s why it’s important to remember that you don’t have to answer every security question accurately. In fact it’s better for your security to give fake answers and write them down rather than connect the answers to your real life.

The next time you have to set up an account and answer security questions pick answers that are easy enough to remember but aren’t necessarily true. Then take a piece of paper or a cheap journal and write down your answers. You’ll be glad you did.

5. Freeze your credit – It’s FREE!

All of us will eventually fall victim to a data breach at some point. But just because your data is compromised doesn’t mean you’re in danger just yet. If you take proactive steps like freezing your credit you can prevent the problem from getting much worse.

Here’s why: If your credit is frozen hackers won’t be able to open any new accounts in your name. It’s one of the most effective ways to curb identity theft and all it takes to set up a credit freeze is a quick phone call to one of the three national credit bureaus.

Best of all it’s free to request a freeze as of 2018. It’s security that you don’t even have to pay for!

Tap or click here to see the benefits of freezing your credit along with the numbers you need to call.

6. Set up alerts and stay in the know

Every week Kim gets a message from her bank that shows her account balances. If anything seems unusual she can immediately contact her bank to find out what happened.

If you’re not checking your account regularly you could end up missing something major like a hack or password breach. Activating notifications through your bank’s website or official app is an easy way to stay in the know.

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc3BvcnQvcnVnYnktdW5pb24vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY3cwdmxlMW41cnJv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9ydWdieS11bmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy9jdzB2bGUxbjVycm8uYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Premiership: Newcastle Falcons 17-28 Bath,"It was a fast start by Bath who went over for the first time inside five minutes. Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

In truth Bath's discipline gave Newcastle hope of a comeback as the latter stages were littered with penalties but they managed to hold on for the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDI0LTA1LTA5L2Zvcm1lci1iZWQtYmF0aC1zdWVzLWh1ZHNvbi1iYXktZm9yLTMwMC1taWxsaW9uLXRyYWRpbmctZ2FpbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Bed Bath & Beyond Sues Hudson Bay for $300 Million in Trading Profits,"The former Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. seeking to generate cash for its creditors sued to recover more than $300 million in trading profits from Hudson Bay Capital Management the hedge fund at the center of a last-ditch financing plan that failed to prevent the retailer’s collapse.

According to the official Blues website there are 22 individuals who’ve left on loan to try experience first-team football elsewhere.

Here is a look at how the 22 players have fared since sealing moves away:

Nathan Baxter (Goalkeeper) – Hull City

London-born shot-stopper Baxter has worked his way up the football pyramid after previous spells out on loan in the National League League Two and League One.

You can see the logic in sending the 22-year-old to the second tier however he’s currently sat on the bench.

He did make his Hull debut in a Carabao Cup defeat so it looks like he’ll have to be patient waiting for his next opportunity.

Jamie Cumming (Goalkeeper) – Gillingham

Cumming 21 is another English goalkeeper from the academy who’s very highly rated.

He’s played all five league matches so far for League One club Gillingham conceding six goals during that time.

It’s a loan move that should be great for his development.

Karlo Ziger (Goalkeeper) – NK Rudar Velenje

20-year-old Ziger has moved abroad for his pursuit of senior minutes.

He’s joined Slovenian second-tier club NK Rudar Velenje and made his debut for them just before the international break in a 3-1 victory.

Ethan Ampadu (Defender) – Venezia

Ampadu has left the Bridge again for a second consecutive year on loan. The 20-year-old Welshman suffered relegation from the Premier League last year with Sheffield United and it looks like he’ll battling the drop again this campaign.

He’s joined Serie A club Venezia who are back in the Italian top flight after promotion last year. His debut will come after the international break.

Juan Castillo (Defender) – Birmingham City

Castillo 21 has been with Chelsea for five years without yet making a senior appearance.

The left-back has dropped down to the Championship and the bulk of his minutes has come in the League Cup so far rather than the league.

Jake Clarke-Salter (Defender) – Coventry City

Clarke-Salter spent last year on loan with Birmingham but this year has moved to Midlands rivals Coventry.

Aged 23 it’s difficult to see him breaking into Tuchel’s plans despite two senior appearances for Chelsea.

He’s played in three out of four Championship games so far this season and it feels like he needs to this year to go well to earn himself a permanent move elsewhere.

Emerson Palmieri (Defender) – Lyon

Emerson was an important part of the Italy team that won Euro 2020 this summer but there is no room for him in the Chelsea squad. Unfortunately Marcos Alonso and Ben Chilwell are above him in the pecking order.

The 27-year-old left-back has joined French giants Lyon because he’s got massive talent and he’s started well in his opening two appearances for them in Ligue 1.

Levi Colwill (Defender) – Huddersfield Town

Aged 18 he’s an impressive centre-back that is already a regular for Championship outfit Huddersfield.

He looks a natural during his first taste of senior football which is why he’s definitely someone that could be knocking on the first-team door sooner rather than later if his development continues at this rate.

Henry Lawrence (Defender) – AFC Wimbledon

Lawrence is an exciting full-back that has already made six appearances since his loan to League One outfit AFC Wimbledon.

The 19-year-old is an attack-minded right-back with pace and energy.

This looks like a great fit.

Ian Maatsen (Defender) – Coventry City

Maatsen joins fellow Chelsea loanee Clarke-Salter with a spell at Coventry.

He’s started very well as the left wing-back in a 3-5-2 system so he’s definitely somebody that has found an ideal destination.

Matt Miazga (Defender) – Alaves

26-year-old centre-half Miazga is another who’s played for the Blues first-team in the past but there is no chance he’ll be back.

He’s gone to Spain for the first time in his career with Alaves who have lost their opening three La Liga matches. He’s played in just one of those games though.

Baba Rahman (Defender) – Reading

Rahman is one of those players who you forget is still on the Chelsea books. He’s played 23 senior games since he arrived in 2015 but has now joined his fifth different loan club.

The 27-year-old Ghanian full-back’s debut should come after the internatonal break. In theory he should do quite well in the Championship.

Dujon Sterling (Defender) – Blackpool

Sterling 21 remained with Chelsea’s Under-23s last year despite previous loan spells in the Football League.

The versatile defender completed a move to Blackpool just before the summer window shut and he should help improve a team currently sat 22nd in the Championship.

Tino Anjorin (Midfielder) – Lokomotiv Moscow

Anjorin was around the first-team group under Tuchel which is why some are not happy he’s left the Bridge.

The exciting 19-year-old playmaker is heading to Russia after leaving this week.

His deal includes a £17million option for Lokomotiv albeit there is a follow up buy-back clause for Chelsea.

Tiemoue Bakayoko (Midfielder) – AC Milan

Bakayoko is another Chelsea flop that just never showed any form since joining from Monaco back in 2017.

His deal is a two-year loan to Italian giants Milan who have an obligation to sign the 27-year-old if certain conditions are met.

He’ll make his second debut at the San Siro after the internatonal break because he previously played for them on loan.

Thierno Ballo (Midfielder) – Rapid Vienna

Ballo 19 will join up with his new loan club after the international fixtures.

The Austrian attacking midfielder showed his talent in the Blues Under-23s team last year with seven goals in 21 league matches so this is a great next step for him.

Danny Drinkwater (Midfielder) – Reading

The ex-Leicester City title winner has been a total flop in West London but he’s still on the club’s books and has departed on another loan.

This time the 31-year-old is back in England and it’ll be intriguing to see if he can rediscover any kind of form in the Championship.

Conor Gallagher (Midfielder) – Crystal Palace

Gallagher impressed during stages of his loan at West Brom last year but immediately this season’s destination looks a better fit.

The 21-year-old attacking midfielder scored twice away to West Ham before the internatonal break.

It looks like he’s going to get a chance to play a creative role for Patrick Vieira’s side.

Billy Gilmour (Midfielder) – Norwich City

Gilmour 20 is arguably the one Blues loanee that fans are most expecting to be back in the first team at Stamford Bridge next season.

The Scottish playmaker has predictably forced his way into the starting line up given his quality but it looks like being a tough season after three defeats from three in the Premier League.

Armando Broja (Forward) – Southampton

Chelsea striker Broja joined Premier League rivals Southampton for his first taste of the English top flight.

The 19-year-old scored twice in a Carabao Cup win against Newport County so hopefully he can force his way into the league XI at St Mary’s.

Michy Batshuayi (Forward) – Besiktas

Bathsuayi 27 will forever be remembered by Chelsea fans for scoring the goal that clinched the Premier League title back in the 2016/17 season.

The striker is now playing in Turkey and has failed to score in his opening two appearances for his new club.

It was a difficult 2020/21 campaign where he struggled for minutes out on loan at Crystal Palace.

Kenedy (Forward) – Flamengo

Kenedy has returned to his native Brazil to play with Flamengo albeit he’s yet to make his debut for them.

The 25-year-old was superb in Spain last season by scoring eight goals and setting up six assists in 44 appearances for Granada.

A supply chain issue has meant that blood test tubes haven't been able to reach the UK.

This has meant doctors have been told only to perform emergency blood tests.

One doctor told Insider that this is causing ""huge anxiety"" amongst the medical community.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The UK is running out of blood test tubes causing some sectors of the National Health Service (NHS) to grind to a halt.

As a result non-urgent blood tests have had to be suspended appointments canceled and patients and doctors alike are concerned.

One of the problems is that the NHS relies on a single supplier Becton Dickinson (BD) for their testing tubes.

They have not publicly disclosed the reason for the supply chain issues which many believe are linked to border and supply challenges linked to Brexit which has also caused a range of food shortages in the UK.

It's not just blood test tubes that the UK lacks but flu jabs too according to the British Medical Association vice-chairman David Wrigley who spoke to the BBC on the issue.

With COVID-19 still very much part of daily life and winter around the corner anxieties are beginning to mount.

As a result doctors have been told they must reduce their testing by up to 25% according to the British Medical Association (BMA).

Dr. Vishal Sharma BMA consultants committee chair said in a statement: ""It is shocking that this situation has been allowed to develop – in particular the apparent over-reliance on one manufacturer and the woeful lack of any kind of reserve supply.

""The manufacturers should also have to explain how they allowed stocks to run so low that patients will now suffer as a result. If we don't get on top of this shortage – and quickly – then we could very easily end up in a catastrophic position particularly in hospitals where patients come to serious harm.""

-Karen Wedge – Lewis (@karenwwfc) September 4 2021

Dr. Julia Patterson a medical doctor who runs Every Doctor an advocacy group for doctors in the UK told Insider: ""It's a nightmare. They're one of the essential tools in our diagnostic toolkit as clinicians and so to have your access to doing diagnostic blood tests removed mostly is really difficult and really stressful – and it can put patients at risk.""

That's a huge anxiety to doctors. You don't want your patient to become an emergency because you can't do blood tests.""

BD has promised to deliver 9 million imported blood tubes to the NHS this week for immediate distribution.

In a statement to Insider BD said it also increased its manufacturing capacity by 20%: ""We expect the situation to stabilize and recover through September based on the volume of tubes we are supplying to the UK"" it said.

A UK Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson added: ""We have secured tens of millions of additional blood tubes including importing additional supplies from the EU and the US which will be available to the NHS soon and there continues to be stock in place to ensure clinically urgent testing continues.

""Patient safety is always the top priority and we continue to work closely with NHS England the devolved administrations and the NHS to minimize any impact on patient care.""

Being the backbone of many diagnostic investigations a shortage of blood test tubes is terrifying at the best of times.

But now amid more than 30000 new COVID-19 cases in the UK every day and rising COVID deaths the panic begins to rise according to the NHS. Bring in the oncoming winter and a delay in flu jabs – the striking reality of this crisis becomes clearer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbnhyYWRpby5jb20vbmV3cy9pc2xlLW9mLW1hbi1uZXdzL2Jsb29kLXRlc3QtdHViZXMtc2hvcnRhZ2Utbm9ybWFsLXNlcnZpY2Utb24taXNsYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blood test tubes shortage: Normal service on Island,"No issues at Island's main hospital

Noble's Hospital has enough blood test tubes to retain a normal testing service.

Government says critical shortages in the UK are not currently affecting the Isle of Man.

A spokesperson has told Manx Radio efforts are in place to ensure a healthy stock level at all times given the Island's remote location.

The UK's supply chain for the tubes is currently running very low forcing many hospitals to restrict blood tests to all but emergency cases.

It's a global problem involving supply and freight logistics.

The crisis has been exacerbated in the UK by the closure of the primary production facility at the country's main supplier Becton Dickinson.

The plant is undergoing a two-week maintenance programme.

A Noble's Hospital spokesperson said that while there are no problems at the moment it is a good time to remind people to carefully consider whether a test is appropriate and essential during the current shortage.",,,,,,,,,

Kraft Heinz will pay a $62 million penalty after regulators charged it on Friday with violating federal anti-fraud and record-keeping requirements. Two of the food conglomerate's former executives have agreed to pay a combined civil penalty of $400000 as well.

""Kraft and its former executives are charged with engaging in improper expense-management practices that spanned many years and involved numerous misleading transactions millions in bogus cost savings and a pervasive breakdown in accounting controls"" the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement.

The company behind Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and Heinz ketchup — along with its former operating and procurement chiefs Eduardo Pelleissone and Klaus Hofmann — didn't admit to or deny the charges but agreed not to commit future violations the SEC said.

Kraft Heinz didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider. The company said in a regulatory filing that it fully cooperated with the SEC it has improved its financial reporting and the settlement concludes the investigation.

The SEC accused Kraft Heinz of overstating its cost savings inflating its profits and misleading investors as to how cheaply it makes its products.

The food giant restated its financials after the SEC launched its investigation in 2019 reversing $208 million of supposed cost savings from nearly 300 transactions between late 2015 and the end of 2018.

The SEC alleged in its complaint that Kraft Heinz employees drafted contracts showing upcoming savings from suppliers were already realized recorded upfront payments without disclosing the future orders they related to and reported discounts without revealing they were tied to price hikes in the future

The agency also alleged that the food conglomerate lacked sufficient internal accounting controls accused Pelleissone and Hofmann of ignoring warnings signs and attributed the alleged false accounting to excessive pressure to achieve unrealistic cost-savings targets.

Kraft Heinz counts Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as one of its largest shareholders with a 27% stake. Berkshire partnered with 3G a Brazilian private equity firm to buy Heinz in 2013 and helped finance the condiments giant's $100 billion merger with Kraft in 2015.

The claims against Kraft Heinz echo those against Wells Fargo which paid a $3 billion fine after employees resorted to opening fake accounts to meet aggressive sales targets.

Buffett a Wells Fargo shareholder for more than 30 years blasted the bank's management and has virtually eliminated his stake over the past year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL21pY2hhZWx0bmlldHplbC8yMDIxLzA5LzA0L3RoZS11bml2ZXJzaXRpZXMtd2l0aC10aGUtbW9zdC1ncmFkdWF0ZXMtd29ya2luZy1hdC10b3AtZm9ydHVuZS01MDAtY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Universities With The Most Graduates Working At Top Fortune 500 Companies,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2021/09/04/the-universities-with-the-most-graduates-working-at-top-fortune-500-companies/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL21pY2hhZWx0bmlldHplbC8yMDIxLzA5LzA0L3RoZS11bml2ZXJzaXRpZXMtd2l0aC10aGUtbW9zdC1ncmFkdWF0ZXMtd29ya2luZy1hdC10b3AtZm9ydHVuZS01MDAtY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9rYXRlLW1pZGRsZXRvbi1wcmluY2Utd2lsbGlhbS1zZXJpb3VzbHktMTMxMzAwODI4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Kate Middleton and Prince William Are ""Seriously Considering"" Moving from Anmer Hall to a Huge New Estate","Looks like Kate Middleton and Prince William might be ditching their country estate Anmer Hall (it's less of a ""hall"" and more of a sprawling mansion) and are ""seriously considering"" moving closer to the Queen in Windsor. Which could imply that they're about to take on more senior roles in the royal family since Windsor is where Her Majesty is currently living and working full time.

So where are the Cambridges going to relocate exactly? It's up in the air at the moment but according to The Sun they've been ""eyeing up"" Ford Belvedere which is a ""house"" (emphasis on those quotes) in Windsor Great Park.

The home is owned by the Crown Estate and is currently being leased to some friends of the royals. Who...I guess would be asked to leave if Kate and William moved in? Either way this place is massive—and steeped in history since it happens to be where King Edward VIII signed his abdication papers. Looks like Wills and Kate are keeping options open though because The Sun reports that royal aides have ""rejected"" the property.

The Daily Mail also reported on the potential move with a source noting that ""Anmer Hall made sense while William was a helicopter pilot in East Anglia and it was useful for Christmases at Sandringham but it doesn’t really work any more. It’s a little too far away for weekends but Windsor is a perfect compromise. They are eyeing up options in the area.”

FYI a move to Windsor would also mean that Kate could be much closer to her own family who live just 40 miles away in Bucklebury Berkshire!

Looking for a great way to invest in artificial intelligence? When scouring the market for great stocks sometimes the best buy is one that's already in your portfolio. According to three Fool.com contributors that's just the case with these three AI stocks: DigitalOcean (DOCN 10.22%) IBM (IBM 0.53%) and LendingClub (LC -2.38%). Here's why we'd buy each of these AI companies again in a heartbeat.

Making tech work for small businesses too

Nicholas Rossolillo (DigitalOcean): I was first drawn to this stock because of its focus on small businesses and aspiring digital entrepreneurs. Cloud computing and all of its ancillary tech like AI (which is often handled at a remote data center and delivered via an internet connection) can be expensive to implement -- and tricky to figure out how to make work.

But DigitalOcean is trying to break down some of the barriers that have held many small businesses back from putting cutting-edge technology to work. In fact this young company has over 602000 customers in 185 countries and it's still going strong. Its key to success? Making it affordable to build and launch a new digital product (as little as $5 a month) and making it easy to get started (code can be written and deployed in minutes).

For those trying to get educated on cloud computing DigitalOcean has an extensive library of online tutorials and blogs that can even be used by developers working on a different cloud service (since DigitalOcean is an open source platform). Included in its educational library: how to put AI and machine learning (a branch of AI in which a computing system learns from experience) to use.

I recently purchased shares and I plan on buying again in the future. Small business spending on the cloud is growing at a double-digit rate and DigitalOcean expects it can grow its sales at about a 30% clip this year and into 2022. It's also profitable a rarity among small fast-growing firms like this. The stock is up 65% since its IPO this past spring. However at 18 times expected current year sales DigitalOcean still looks like a long-term value if it can maintain its momentum.

IBM: Low prices huge dividend yields and a market-leading AI package

Anders Bylund (IBM): Good old International Business Machines is not just a respected name in the field of artificial intelligence but the clear-cut leader in this $156 billion market according to IDC. Big Blue sowed the seeds to its Watson AI engine decades ago and has nurtured that asset into a problem-solving system with serious business chops.

The company's entire business model is now focused on Watson-powered artificial intelligence delivered in a variety of hybrid cloud computing models.

""We fundamentally believe that core to the competitiveness of every company going forward will be their ability to use AI to unlock real-time value from their data wherever the data resides"" IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in a recent earnings call.

The long-term promise of IBM's artificial intelligence strategy is undeniable but investors have lost patience with the company's long-running transformation process. As a result you can pick up IBM shares on the cheap today at just 13 times free cash flow or 12 times forward earnings. Furthermore the low stock price and the company's firm commitment to a strong dividend policy has boosted IBM's dividend yield to a generous 4.7%.

I've said it many times before and I'll gladly say it again: Big Blue is a great long-term investment at these modest prices and I'm seriously thinking about adding a few more stubs to my own IBM holdings someday soon.

This AI-driven lender has tripled this year and still has room to run

Billy Duberstein (LendingClub): One of the biggest industries where AI is making an impact is in the world of fintech. It's a fairly broad catch-all term but AI and automation has become especially front and center in the world of loan underwriting. In just the past couple months two new-age fintechs that each use big data and automation to underwrite personal loans have taken off: Upstart Holdings (UPST -2.94%) and LendingClub up 57% and 93% respectively over the past three months.

LendingClub and Upstart are similar in many ways. Both companies use big data and artificial intelligence to approve more loans while also offering lower rates than most credit card companies which primarily use FICO scores. And both companies also use a marketplace model whereby they resell their loans to partner banks and asset managers based on partner underwriting criteria.

While both companies are similar and each has a lot of promise I'm going to go with LendingClub today. Why? Well it largely comes down to a question of valuation and business model. After all both LendingClub and Upstart had strikingly similar operating metrics last quarter but their market valuations are very very different:

Company Originations Marketplace Revenue Total Revenue Net Income Market Capitalization LendingClub $2722 million $151.7 million $204.4 million $9.4 million $3.1 billion Upstart Holdings $2795 million $187.3 million $193.9 million $37.3 million $18.6 billion

While LendingClub and Upstart have strikingly similar financials Upstart trades at a market cap over six times that of LendingClub!

Not only that but Upstart's higher profitability is also a bit misleading due to a key business model difference. In February LendingClub acquired Radius Bank which gave LendingClub a banking license and allowed it to hold deposits. According to management LendingClub will now be holding 15% to 25% of its loans on its own balance sheet going forward unlike Upstart which is a ""pure"" marketplace as of now.

While LendingClub will receive more total profits over the life of the loans it holds on its balance sheet it also has to deduct current expected credit losses (CECL) from new loans up front which totaled $34.6 million last quarter. Add that back and LendingClub would have actually been more profitable than Upstart.

Both companies are pioneering the exciting field of AI-driven loan underwriting which is leading to impressive results; however given that LendingClub is basically valued at one-sixth of Upstart it's definitely the pick for me even after its recent run."

Hochul‘s husband spent hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying state officials including “staff at the Office of Governor and Lt. Governor” while she was lieutenant governor records show.

Delaware North a Buffalo-based gambling and hospitality giant where William Hochul Jr. serves as general counsel and senior vice president paid New York lobbying shop Bolton-St. Johns more than $300000 between 2019 and 2021 for lobbying services in Albany according to a review of JCOPE filings by The Post.

William Hochul joined the company in 2016 after three decades as a federal prosecutor. His wife became Gov. Cuomo’s lieutenant in 2015.

In several instances Delaware North and its lobbyists engaged in “direct lobbying” of the “Executive Chamber/Staff of Office of Governor and Lt. Governor” in 2020 and 2021 a time when Kathy Hochul held the position records show.

In one 2020 case the lobbying centered on “Covid reopening safety plan[s] in New York State.” In another 2021 instance it focused on “ongoing issues with sports betting in the State of New York.”

William Hochul has continued in his Delaware North job despite his wife’s ascension last week to the Governor’s mansion.

“[William Hochul] will not be involved in anything whatsoever to do with the State of New York. He will recuse himself from anything to do with New York State” Hochul’s office told The Post.

Delaware North netted $3.7 billion in revenue in 2020 and employs 55000 people according to Forbes.

“Right now the state of New York is developing the rules for mobile gaming apps which is by far the most lucrative place where the industry is going” John Kaehny the executive director of Reinvent Albany told The Post. In April Gov. Cuomo signed a bill legalizing online sports betting. Just days ago the New York State Gaming Commission approved a new set of regulations knocking out the last procedural hurdles to the plan.

In her new role Gov. Hochul can appoint members of the New York State Gaming Commission.

Delaware North said it will not pursue a mobile-betting license but it has huge interests in gaming and casinos currently owning the Finger Lakes Gaming & Racetrack in Farmington NY; and managing the Hamburg Gaming casino. It also has a $39 million agreement with the NY Thruway Authority to manage food and drinks at rest stops records show.

“Neither Delaware North nor its lobbyists have ever lobbied the former-Lieutenant Governor or her staff on any matter on behalf of Delaware North” a company spokeswoman told The Post insisting that JCOPE “does not allow lobbyists to delineate between the governor and lieutenant governor’s offices” in filings.

A rep for JCOPE said the latter is not true and that its forms easily allow delineation of offices.

Though Gov. Hochul has promised a “new era of transparency” her new executive chamber is shaping up to be one with deep lobbying ties.

The lion’s share of Delaware North filings from Bolton-St. Johns lists Michael Keogh as a lobbyist for the company. The longtime Bolton partner is married to Karen Persichilli who this week became Gov. Hochul’s powerful new secretary.

Keogh’s name also pops up on several other six-figure gaming advocacy contracts for clients like Rivers Casino Caesars Entertainment and the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe.

Persichilli herself is no stranger to lobbying spending more than five years as “head of state government relations” for JP Morgan Chase according to her LinkedIn bio.

Gov. Hochul spent time as a lobbyist for M&T Bank in Buffalo after she left Congress in 2012 the Associated Press reported.

Hochul’s daughter-in-law Christina Hochul is director of federal policy at Biogen according to her LinkedIn page. The pharmaceutical firm has spent at least $20000 this year on state lobbyists.

“When Bolton-St Johns supported Delaware North we never worked with Mr. Hochul Mr. Keogh did not ever do work for Delaware North and Bolton-St Johns’ contract ended with Delaware North in February 2021” a company spokesman told The Post saying Keogh’s name was only on the forms out of an abundance of caution.

A rep for Hochul said with respect to Persichilli that “recusals have been put in place to ensure that any New York State business relating to the Secretary’s spouse will be delegated.”

Kaehny said Hochul’s “ironclad policies” to ensure against conflicts in her administration should include independent oversight of gaming issues by either the state attorney general or the comptroller.

“The question really is one of sincerity. If Hochul truly wants what she called a new era and change in Albany culture she has to lead by example” Kaehny said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s one of the largest natural harbours in the world – and those living near Cork Harbour insist that it’s also one of the most interesting.

This was the last port of call for the most famous liner in history the Titanic but it has been transformed into a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.

The harbour has been a working port and a strategic defensive hub for centuries and it has been one of Ireland's major employment hubs since the early 1900s. Traditional heavy industries have waned since the late 20th century with the likes of the closure of Irish Steel in Haulbowline and shipbuilding at Verolme. It still has major and strategic significance in energy generation shipping and refining.

Giraffe wander along its shores from which tens of thousands of men and women left Ireland most of them never to return. The harbour is home to the oldest yacht club in the world and to the Irish Navy.

This deep waterway has also become a vital cog in the Irish economy.

‘Afloat.ie's Cork Harbour page’ is not a history page nor is it a news focus. It’s simply an exploration of this famous waterway its colour and its characters.

Cork Harbour Festival

Ocean to City – An Rás Mór and Cork Harbour Open Day formerly existed as two popular one-day events located at different points on Cork’s annual maritime calendar. Both event committees recognised the synergy between the two events and began to work together and share resources. In 2015 Cork Harbour Festival was launched. The festival was shaped on the open day principle with Ocean to City – An Ras Mór as the flagship event.

Now in its sixth year the festival has grown from strength to strength. Although the physical 2020 festival was cancelled due to Covid-19 the event normally features nine festival days starting on the first week of June. It is packed full of events; all made possible through collaboration with over 50 different event partners in Cork City as well as 15 towns and villages along Cork Harbour. The programme grows year by year and highlights Ireland’s rich maritime heritage and culture as well as water and shore-based activities with Ocean to City – An Rás Mór at the heart of the festival.

Taking place at the centre of Ireland’s maritime paradise and at the gateway to Ireland’s Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way Cork is perfectly positioned to deliver the largest and most engaging harbour festival in Ireland.

The Cork Harbour Festival Committee includes representatives from Cork City Council Cork County Council Port of Cork UCC MaREI RCYC Cobh & Harbour Chamber and Meitheal Mara.

“It’s my little palace. If you offered me any other place now I wouldn’t take it - unless I win the Euromillions. Only then I might consider it” he says.

Jim 77 is one of a growing number of older people who have decided to ‘downsize’ from a large home to become a local authority tenant in a smaller home in a deal that frees up larger properties for social housing.

Originally called downsizing and now rebranded in Housing for All as ‘rightsizing’ the approach has been pioneered by Cork City Council through schemes like the award-winning 30-unit Arus Mhuire development in Blackrock on the southside of the city that Jim now calls home.

The gated scheme off the Skehard Road comprises a mix of one and two-bed units is owned by the council and managed by the Tuath housing association.

Many more such schemes are planned under the government’s new housing strategy with a pledge to develop a national policy on rightsizing and to explore options to support and incentivise rightsizing on a voluntary basis.

The scheme allows people aged 60 or over who own their private house or who are existing local authority tenants to apply to their local authority for a tenancy in one of its downsizing developments. The local authority can also buy private homes at a discounted rate linked to the age of the homeowners and then offer the homeowners a tenancy in a downsizing scheme.

Different financial arrangements apply depending on the circumstances but in all cases the local authority gets the larger house and the applicant gets a tenancy in a downsizing scheme. Fifty years ago Jim moved into what was then a new three-bed terraced council house in Avonmore Park in Mayfield raised his family there and ended up owning the house.

But once his two children were raised and following a divorce Jim a former cameraman with the Chorus tv channel and who freelanced on the Hot Country music tv channel said he felt it was “a fright to be living alone in a three-bed house when a family could use it”. He explored the downsizing option and approached City Hall where housing officer Pascal O’Leary talked him through his options.

Jim was offered a tenancy in a one-bedroom apartment in Arus Mhuire and the council acquired his property in Avonmore Park. “Many of my old neighbours from Avonmore Park had moved on themselves and it was sad to be leaving my neighbourhood. One neighbour even asked me to consider not moving” Jim said.

“But once I decided that was it. So I got a skip a large skip and made the move - there’s an amount of stuff that comes out of a house after 50 years.”

He finally moved into his new home last July. “It was worth the wait” he says.

“It’s close to local shops I can walk to Mahon Point and it’s a few minutes from the South Ring Road.

Jim Hourihan is delighted that a young family has moved into his three-bed house in Mayfield. ""I hope they will be there for 50 years.” Photo: Larry Cummins

“And I’m nearly on the Blackrock Road - I was joking with friends on the northside that I’d need elocution lessons. But seriously it’s really ideal and everyone here is lovely.”

“It’s a one-bedroom unit with a kitchen/dining area a fabulous wet room and I’ve a lovely balcony. I’ve no regrets.”

And he’s heard from his former neighbours that a young family recently moved into his old house.

“That makes me feel good because it was a happy house a lucky house so I’m delighted for them. I hope they will be there for 50 years” he says.

He has encouraged other people in a similar situation to consider downsizing - or rightsizing.

Work is well advanced on the construction of a 35-unit downsizing scheme in the former office block Springville House on the Blackrock Road and work is about to begin on 25-units on the South Douglas Road and on 24-units in a scheme at Hawkes Road in Bishopstown.

Sinn Féin TD for Cork North Central Thomas Gould has called for a public education programme on the downsizing/rightsizing scheme to make more people aware of it.

“If there are elderly people struggling to maintain three or four-bedroom houses then we can offer them support and at the same time provide a home to a family who desperately needs it” he said.

“I’m regularly being contacted by elderly people who are extremely interested in downsizing and looking for support in how to access the scheme. When I contact the council the staff operating the scheme couldn’t be more helpful.

“A simple information campaign could let people know about the options out there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1YmxpbmxpdmUuaWUvbmV3cy9kdWJsaW4tbmV3cy9kdWJsaW4tcHViLXdldGhlcnNwb29ucy1zYWxlLWFsY29ob2wtMjE0ODM1ODHSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5kdWJsaW5saXZlLmllL25ld3MvZHVibGluLW5ld3MvZHVibGluLXB1Yi13ZXRoZXJzcG9vbnMtc2FsZS1hbGNvaG9sLTIxNDgzNTgxLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Irish pubs closed: Popular Dublin Wetherspoons pub up for sale and it's not cheap,"Something went wrong please try again later.

The Three Tun Tavern in Blackrock is now up for sale and is available to purchase immediately.

The pub is located on the corner of Temple Road and Carysfort Avenue and has an overall floor area of 9505 sq ft.

The pub operates over two floors and recently underwent a full refurbishment and is now in exceptional condition for prospective buyers.

The first floor has a large open plan bar with a dining area as well as a beer garden out the back. Other first floor facilities include a kitchen store rooms office and patron WC facilities.

The surrounding area in Blackrock has seen significant investment in recent years with upgrades to Frascati Centre as well as the refurbishment of nearby office buildings.

Round 2: Four-Try Second Half Salvo Keeps Munster On Course

The reigning champions took just 25 minutes to pocket the bonus point at Energia Park their elusive full-back Ella Roberts touching down on her first start.

Elise O’Byrne-White Lisa Callan Nikki Caughey and Niamh Byrne also registered tries their clinical play leading to a 27-0 half-time lead.

Ulster rallied during the third quarter with well-taken scores from forwards Ilse van Staden and Taryn Schutzler but Phil de Barra’s Blues had too much quality and depth.

Their 11-try haul was completed by Michelle Claffey’s brace Roberts’ second of the evening and Grace Miller and lively replacements Emily McKeown and Vic O’Mahony added their names to the scoresheet too.

Leinster stated their intent with a quick-fire third-minute score the returning O’Byrne-White crossing in the left corner after incisive running from Roberts Miller and Jenny Murphy.

Busy scrum half Molly Scuffil-McCabe knitted it all together nicely but Ulster responded well with Jemma Farrell kicking cleverly and captain Beth Cregan and second row Schutzler imposing themselves up front.

However the hosts went 12-0 up when pacy hooker Callan cut past two defenders outside the Ulster 22 and fended off full-back Dolores Hughes for a fantastic finish under the posts. Murphy converted.

With athletic flanker Emma Murphy in player-of-the-match form Leinster whipped up the pace again early in the second quarter.

Skipper Christy Haney and Jennie Finlay punched holes in the Ulster defence before Scuffil-McCabe neatly fed Caughey for a five-pointer out left.

Lovely hands from Mairead Holohan then sent Murphy charging past halfway the move breaking down but Scuffil-McCabe’s kick through was seized upon by Roberts who brilliantly beat Peita McAlister’s challenge to hare home.

Replacement Lauren Farrell-McCabe kept the pace high following a quickly-taken penalty on the half hour the blue wave leading to centre Byrne going over on the right via a big hand-off on Fern Wilson.

One of Ulster’s best moments came just before the break out-half Toni Macartney slashing through past halfway yet that good work was undone when Farrell missed touch from a penalty.

They fell further behind three minutes into the second half Finlay using a dummy to pierce the defensive line before Claffey last week’s player-of-the-match in Galway stepped off her right and reached out to score.

A bout of direct carrying finally got Ulster firing in the opposition as replacement prop van Staden bounced off a tackle to score to the left of the posts. Farrell added the extras.

Ulster swiftly handed back those five points though as Farrell-McCabe ran back a kick in superb fashion managing to pass out of a tackle for Claffey to claim an opportunist 48th-minute try.

Nonetheless Neill Alcorn’s charges were now making more inroads – particularly through their pack – and Schutzler broke down the blindside of a lineout maul for an snappily-taken effort making it 37-12.

Ulster’s industrious number 8 Stacey Sloan battled hard at the breakdown to win a relieving penalty. However there was another Leinster try around the corner – and a final flourish in front of an appreciative home crowd.

The speedy Roberts profited from some good passing to score despite Macartney’s cover tackle and then replacement Rachel Horan broke off the base of a scrum and fed winger Miller for a deserved 66th-minute score.

There was still time for Naas flyer McKeown to make her mark on her debut bursting past Jill Stephens to score in the left corner from 25 metres out.

Narrowbody aircraft are nothing new to transatlantic travel but JetBlue's entry into the highly competitive New York to London route caused quite a stir.

For travelers sitting in the cabin the experience is comparable with other transatlantic carriers with lie-flat seats in business class and mood lighting and amenity kits for passengers in the back. But how does transatlantic flying in an A321 differ from a 787 Dreamliner for the people sitting farthest forward — the pilots?

In my career I've spent just over 3000 hours flying the A321 (7000 hours total with the A320 family) and nearly 4000 hours flying the 787 Dreamliner. As a result I feel I'm in a good position to compare and contrast how it feels to fly the two aircraft particularly on routes with longer flight times.

Each aircraft has its own little quirks some of which many pilots like others which pilots may not prefer. It's like the difference between driving a Mercedes and BMW: They both offer quite a different driving experience but ultimately either will get you safely to your destination.

Airbus A321LR versus the Boeing 787 Dreamliner

787 Dreamliner

Starting with my current ride the 787 was made for long-haul flight with a range of 7500 nautical miles. It was the aircraft selected by Qantas to fly the first-ever direct flight between Australia and the U.K. a 17-hour epic from Perth Airport (PER) to London Heathrow.

The 787 is a widebody aircraft meaning there's enough space in its 18-foot-wide cabin for two aisles. It has a wingspan of 197 feet and has a length of between 187 feet for the 787-8 to 223 feet for the 787-10. It has three fuel tanks enabling it to carry more than 100 tons of fuel allowing it to fly nonstop journeys between cities such as Perth and London and Sydney and New York.

Airbus A321LR

The A321LR is a descendent of the original A321 a variant of one of the most popular aircraft ever built for the short-haul market the A320.

By adding extra fuel tanks it has a range of 4000 nautical miles meaning it is able to comfortably fly routes such as London to New York City and Miami to most of South America. As a result it is an extremely attractive option for not only established long-haul carriers but also short-haul airlines looking to expand into lucrative intercontinental routes.

One of the main advantages for airlines is that it requires very little extra training for their crew. Pilots already rated to fly the A320 family can fly an A321LR without the need for the long (often three-month) conversion course required to move onto a larger aircraft like the 787.

The A321 is considered a narrowbody aircraft meaning that the 12-foot-wide cabin is only wide enough for a single aisle. It is also somewhat smaller than the 787 with a length of 144 feet and a wingspan of 118 feet.

Ergonomics

To the outsider the flight deck of an A321 and a B787 are quite similar. However when you spend thousands of hours sitting in them you become very aware of the similarities and differences.

The most obvious difference is that the A321 has migrated to using a sidestick located outboard from the pilot whereas the B787 still has a traditional control column situated between the pilot's feet.

Both have their advantages but I'm going to get off the fence here and declare that I prefer the Airbus setup particularly for long flights.

The flight deck of an aircraft is basically our office. Not only is it our office but it's also our dining room and our lounge. It's where we can sit for nine to 10 hours in a single stretch so the more ergonomically designed and comfortable it is the better we will perform.

The control column on the 787 is great for flying the aircraft but most of the time we engage the autopilot a couple of minutes after takeoff and then leave it engaged until a few minutes before landing. With the autopilot engaged we have no use for the control column. This would be fine on a short flight but when we're sitting for hours on end it just gets in the way.

You'll see most Boeing pilots with a clipboard for their inflight paperwork. This is because there are few places to store it and more to the point it is difficult to write with the control column in the way. As a result we use a clipboard to keep the paperwork together and to provide a flat surface on which to keep a track of our route and fuel status.

It is also difficult to eat your food properly as you can't fit the tray onto your lap without moving the seat back away from the controls. As a result to ensure that one pilot is able to reach the controls at all times we sometimes have to take it in turns eating.

On the A321 however the position of the control stick to the side of the pilot means Airbus has been able to install a fold-away tray table. Once airborne with the autopilot engaged just like on the 787 the pilots are able to pull out the table and use it to complete their paperwork and eat their meal just like being at a proper desk or table.

The absence of the control column also means it's much easier to get comfortable in the seat as we are not restricted as to where our legs can go.

Winner: Airbus A321LR

Ride Comfort

We've all been there: Just as the meal service starts the bumps begin. As you try to take a sip of your red wine a jolt forces the glass against your chin and its contents into your lap. For most people turbulence is just an inconvenience while for others it's a real fear.

Turbulence is caused by variations in the wind speed and direction hitting the aircraft and affecting the lift over the wings. An increase in wind speed creates more lift a decrease created less lift. Multiply this hundreds of times a second and you get what you experience as turbulence.

In order to counter this designers at Boeing utilized a number of sensors around the 787 which detect and measure changes in angular velocity and air pressure. Lateral gusts of turbulence causing wind are recorded by gyroscopic sensors and vertical movement is recorded by accelerometers. Changes in air pressure around the aircraft are also detected.

All this information is sent to central processing computers which in a fraction of a second calculate not only what is happening to the aircraft but also what needs to be done to counteract those movements. The computers then send electrical signals to the actuators powering the control surfaces on the wings and tail to counteract the forces the aircraft is experiencing.

The result is that as the aircraft instantly reacts to the turbulence-creating forces the bumps you feel in your seat are reduced and feel much less significant than they would on say the A321.

Air Quality

The A312 uses what is known as 'bleed air' to pressurize the cabin. As part of the engine operation some air is 'bled' out of the high-pressure compression stage and then fed into the air conditioning system. This air is then used to pressurize the aircraft and keep the cabin at a comfortable temperature.

This is a tried and tested method that works well across all aircraft types ever since the first pressurized aircraft took to the skies. But on the B787 things are different.

The 787 takes fresh air directly in from outside the aircraft via inlets located just under where the wing meets the fuselage (Photo by NOAH SEELAM/AFP via Getty Images)

Instead of taking air from the engines fresh air is drawn in directly from outside the aircraft forward of the engines by two dedicated inlets on either side of the aircraft. This means the air that we breathe inside the aircraft is fresh from outside and hasn't been through the engine.

Not only does this mean that inside the cabin the air is of much better quality but it also means there are savings to be made externally. As high-pressure air in the engines is not feeding the air conditioning system all of it can be used to generate thrust. This means that the engines are not wasting airflow making them much more fuel-efficient and thus reducing carbon emissions.

Performance

Whilst the range of the A321LR has been increased by the addition of extra fuel tanks and tweaks to the wingtips the wing on the A321LR is very similar to that of the original A321. As a result particularly at heavy weights the aircraft is quite limited to how high it can climb as can be seen in the image below.

The wing on the A321LR limits how high the aircraft can climb particularly at heavy weights. (Screenshot courtesy of Flightradar24)

However the wing on the 787 is an incredible feat of engineering. If you watch the video below you'll have noticed just how much the wings flex as they are creating lift. This design enables the aircraft to climb to higher altitudes for a given weight than most other aircraft types.

This benefits us in a couple of ways. First it means we can often fly above turbulence. There has been many a night flying across the Atlantic where pilots in aircraft below us at 33000 to 37000 feet have complained about the bumpy flying conditions while above them at 43000 feet we've had a smooth ride.

Secondly by flying higher than most other traffic it means we are more likely to get shortcuts. As air traffic is a giant three-dimensional puzzle for Air Traffic Control (ATC) when you have more aircraft at a certain altitude there's less opportunity for them to deviate from their planned route.

When there are fewer aircraft at your altitude ATC can often let you fly more direct routes. This not only saves fuel but also time.

Winner: Boeing 787

Technology

Whilst the A321LR is a relatively new aircraft it is a variation of the original A321. As a result most of the flight deck technology is very similar to that of the original creation. However the 787 is an aircraft designed for the 21st century and therefore has a number of technological advances which help improve flight safety.

One of the most useful features is the Head-Up Display or HUD.

Part of learning to fly a jet aircraft is mastering the ability to flick between scanning the vital flight parameters such as altitude and speed inside the flight deck and viewing the visual picture outside the aircraft. During an approach a pilot's eyes will constantly be darting between the two.

The HUD on the 787 Dreamliner (Image - Charlie Page/TPG)

However for a while now technology has existed in military aircraft that allows pilots to continue scanning the flight parameters whilst still looking outside — it's called a Head-Up Display. A projector is fixed to the ceiling above the pilot's head and from it projects an image of the Primary Flight Display (PFD) onto a piece of glass in front of the pilot.

Whilst this feature is great during most stages of flight it really becomes important during the approach and landing. Some approaches require pilots to fly tight turns very close to the ground often in marginal weather conditions. The approach to Runway 13L at New York's JFK is a great example of this.

When we fly this approach we need to keep our eyes on the runway as much as possible. The HUD enables us to do this whilst still scanning our altitude and airspeed as we fly the tight turn around the corner as can be seen in the video taken in the simulator below.

Winner: Boeing 787

Bottom Line

Whilst both aircraft are capable of flying long-haul routes as a pilot my preference would be to do so in a 787 Dreamliner over an A321.

The flight deck of the A321 is definitely more practical for longer flights with the tray table making the flight deck much more comfortable and usable as both an office and dining room.

However the A321 is still very much a short-haul aircraft updated for long-haul flying.

The 787 on the other hand was designed specifically for long-haul routes. The performance of the wing and features such as the gust suppression system and non-bleed air conditioning mean the entire experience of a long flight is made much more comfortable for everyone on board.

As a result both passengers and crew get off the aircraft feeling much more refreshed and less tired than they would expect.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9kZWxpdmVyaWVzLW9mLWJvZWluZ3MtNzg3LWRyZWFtbGluZXItbGlrZWx5LWRlbGF5ZWQtdW50aWwtbGF0ZS1vY3RvYmVyLTExNjMwODg0OTU50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deliveries of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner likely delayed until late October,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deliveries-of-boeings-787-dreamliner-likely-delayed-until-late-october-11630884959 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9kZWxpdmVyaWVzLW9mLWJvZWluZ3MtNzg3LWRyZWFtbGluZXItbGlrZWx5LWRlbGF5ZWQtdW50aWwtbGF0ZS1vY3RvYmVyLTExNjMwODg0OTU50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mb3JtZXItamV0LWFpcndheXMtNzc3LXNvbGQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wow: Former Jet Airways Boeing 777 Sold For $9m,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mb3JtZXItamV0LWFpcndheXMtNzc3LXNvbGQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS9ib2VpbmdzLWZyZWlnaHRlci1kaWxlbW1hLXNpemUtZW5naW5lcy1hbmQtdGFua2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing's Freighter Dilemma: Size Engines And… Tankers?,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | September 4 2021

Many expect Boeing’s response to the Airbus A350F to be the launch of a 777X freighter. But is this Boeing’s main worry as freighters go?

We recently saw that Airbus has all but launched an A350F freighter. The European manufacturer still hasn’t announced a launch customer however. But this could be a matter of time as Airbus negotiates with some key customers. Crucially Boeing’s reaction to this freighter will likely be immediate. Such an aircraft worries Boeing more than the A321XLR for instance.

Speaking of which Airbus is reportedly looking seriously at launching a newly-built A321neo freighter as we saw. This is the result of changing regulations on noise and emissions that could drive cargo operators to use newer aircraft. These regulations mean that from 2027 airlines will need to keep their CO2 emissions to the same level they had in 2020 (pre-pandemic presumably).

P2F conversions will likely suffice for many operators in achieving these targets. That’s because in 2020 they were still using much older freighters. But a few years down the line Boeing’s planning may also have to include a competing new mid-size freighter. This is a worry but perhaps not an urgent one. With recent experience in 737-800 freighter conversions developing a newly-built 737 MAX freighter (737-8/9F?) should be possible.

Freighter Size Boeing’s Plans And Something Military

At the upper end of the scale analysts believe that an A350F would be as good or better than a Boeing 777X freighter. The latter would be a bigger aircraft of course. But cargo operators will likely care more about the cost for a given weight especially if they need to hit efficiency targets. And more fundamentally some believe that as worried as they are about the A350F Boeing have another problem.

Many believe that Boeing’s concern regarding the freighter market has to do with the middle ground. The 777F is (and the 747-8F was until they stopped offering it) Boeing’s biggest cargo aircraft. But the 767 be it as a new freighter or a conversion is the real “bread-and-butter” freighter for most operators.

ICAO (and now FAA and EASA) regulations mean that Boeing won’t be able to sell new 767Fs beyond 2027/28. Airbus would have had the same problem with their A330F freighter. But they don’t because they don’t actually have any orders for this aircraft. Boeing’s 767 freighter orders (they don’t offer a passenger version) will keep the production line busy until 2026 or so.

But that’s not all that particular production line is doing. After years of making its 767 freighter Boeing’s 767 production line in Everett is now busy with the KC-46A Pegasus. This is an aerial refuelling tanker that won USAF’s KC-X competition against the Airbus MRTT – the second time around. This Airbus uses the airframe of the A330-200.

Military Competition Triggering Freighter Developments?

Obviously changes in environmental regulations don’t affect Boeing’s orders for military aircraft. But there are other factors in play. A new USAF competition (KC-Y KC-Z is further into the future) for even more aerial refuelling aircraft is coming soon. And Boeing’s conundrum regarding the future of its 767 freighter could well affect it. Or is it the other way around?



Boeing won the tanker competition against Airbus before but it wasn’t easy. And a ‘rematch’ won’t be easier – quite the contrary. Boeing’s KC-46A program has been far from trouble-free (to put it mildly). And now Airbus will partner with Lockheed Martin an expert military contractor. Many believe that Boeing’s win in this new USAF tanker competition will depend on improving their tanker.

Ideally Boeing’s new tanker would be an off-shoot of their New Mid-size Airplane (NMA) or New Boeing Plane (NBA). That’s if the latter is a twin-aisle jet close in size to the 767. But this is out of the question. Such an aircraft could take a decade to hit the market and the USAF wouldn’t wait that long. Improving their 767 freighter platform itself is likely Boeing’s only way of improving their tanker.

This wouldn’t be Boeing’s first time planning to improve the 767 – then as a freighter and passenger jet. We have previously looked at the 767-X and 767-XF as an NMA alternative. In essence this is a 767 with General Electric GEnx engines. These engines currently power the 747-8 and the 787. A version for the 767 would be closer to the 747-8’s GEnx-2B (below).

Re-Engining Boeing’s Bread-And-Butter Freighter

But it’s not that simple. The fan diameter of the GEnx is larger than that of the PW4000 or GE CF6 currently powering the 767. The 767-X/XF would require taller (telescoping) landing gear to accommodate those engines. Ideally it would also have a new wing. But Boeing knows all too well that re-engining AND re-winging a plane isn’t a quick job. See 777X.

We previously examined the idea of this re-engined 767 as a possible “quick” answer to the A321XLR. But this idea of an updated 767-X or 767-XF freighter was shelved at least once before Boeing’s MAX crisis. It would be costly and the market prospects of a passenger version are… doubtful at best. But could such a platform win Boeing’s next air refuelling tanker contract? Could the 767-XF become the KC-46B?

If it did obviously Boeing could still introduce a freighter version. The plane would meet the post-2028 emission/noise regulations. And cargo operators clearly need little convincing of the merits of the 767 as a freighter. Also these operators wouldn’t need it until 2028 with USAF having a similar or later delivery requirement for its tankers. Boeing should have the time to do it if they launch it soon!

Two Can Play The Re-Engine Game

This brings us to Airbus. They call their bid with Lockheed the LMXT tanker. ‘LM’ is obviously ‘Lockheed Martin’ the ‘XT’ bit is more mysterious. Some analysts expect the two partners to offer a version of the Airbus A330 MRTT based on the A330neo. Except it could have American engines instead of Rolls-Royce’s.

Stealing a page from Boeing’s re-engining of its freighter could help Airbus in other ways. Some argue that an American engine option will be a necessity for the Airbus A350F. But this plane is too big to participate in the USAF tanker competition. So could Lockheed’s participation motivate Airbus to re-engine the A330neo? And if so could we see an A330neo freighter (A330-800F?) competing with Boeing’s commercial offerings post-2027/28?

There are a lot of things in Boeing’s plate today beyond freighters. The 737 MAX will hopefully be ungrounded everywhere by the end of the year but the 777X and 787 programs are still a worry. In any case freighters are one of Boeing’s traditional strong suits. They have been detailing demand for freighters 20 years into the future.

So the question is which freighter size is Boeing’s biggest earner? And how can the upcoming USAF KC-Y tanker competition affect their freighter projects?

Now it needs to win over the residents,"The problem from the perspective of Whelan and many of his neighbors was this: They later discovered the developer was buying on behalf of Harvard University which was eyeing an expansion from over the river in Cambridge. Ostensibly the secrecy was a way to avoid driving up the price but no matter the motivation the maneuver sowed distrust.

Developer Beal Cos. had bought land along Western Avenue and was seeking community input about what to do with it.

The meeting took place more than two decades ago but longtime Allston resident Brent Whelan remembers it like yesterday.

Now as Harvard partners with private developers to build its answer to Kendall Square on the vast holdings it has accumulated in Allston the country’s oldest and wealthiest university is confronting the ghosts of its past. Harvard has received blowback as it seeks approval for the first piece of this massive development puzzle a 14-acre section of what it dubs its Enterprise Research Campus across Western Avenue from its business school. Just last month Allston’s elected leaders urged Acting Mayor Kim Janey to bottle up city approvals until after the November elections citing concerns that Harvard is being too guarded about its larger intentions.

If town-gown relations don’t improve this could just be the start of Harvard’s headaches.

The university has roughly 150 acres left to develop in Allston most of it in the old Beacon Park Yard and tied up in the long-debated realignment of the Massachusetts Turnpike that now hems in the former rail yard. Harvard leaders want neighborhood support to help unlock what could amount to decades of new construction bringing jobs housing and opportunity to Boston’s northwestern edge.

But winning that trust won’t be easy. Harvard and developer Tishman Speyer have spelled out plans for those initial 14 acres: a roughly 1.9 million-square-foot complex that would include offices labs apartments a hotel and conference center and part of a greenway to help connect the area to the Charles River. But neighbors say they need a broader vision of Harvard’s ultimate aims in Allston — not just details about individual projects.

“We sort of feel like Harvard needs to show its cards” Whelan said. “Has Harvard been a good open partner? Far from it.”

Despite the friction Harvard and the nearby residents do have interests that overlap. No single landowner would benefit more than Harvard from the Pike realignment while the community sees the star-crossed project as a way to heal the fissure sliced through Allston when the highway extension was built in the mid-1960s. Harvard would chip in $58 million toward West Station a transit hub that residents say is long overdue. And the university has committed tens of millions to a massive drainpipe to serve some of its land but also a big swath of the neighborhood.

But local civic leaders continue to cast a wary eye toward the giant institution which owns more than 350 acres in Allston by some estimates one-third of the neighborhood. That includes nearly 190 acres used directly by Harvard such as its athletic facilities the business school and its new science and engineering complex. Harvard’s Allston portfolio also includes the 36-acre Enterprise Research Campus area and roughly 100 acres in the former Beacon Park rail yard.

“Harvard is performing as a development company not as an educational institution” said Anthony D’Isidoro president of the Allston Civic Association. “They talked about Beacon Park being the next Seaport District. If it’s going to turn out like the Seaport we don’t want any of that.”

Like Whelan D’Isidoro remembers Harvard secretly buying up parts of the neighborhood through Beal Cos. (Harvard notes the land where the Tishman project will go was bought in a public auction from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.) Even today he says Harvard brings in private developers — such as Tishman and Samuels & Co. — as partners that bear the brunt of community relations work for these new projects.

Harvard’s primary go-between in these discussions has been Mark Handley director of government affairs and community relations at the university. But civic leaders such as D’Isidoro argue that the top Harvard brass — including president Larry Bacow — should play a more prominent role.

Perhaps no neighborhood drama illustrates Harvard’s challenges better than the dustup over the drainpipe.

At a cost of well north of $50 million the storm-water pipeline proposed for North Allston would be the most expensive in the Boston Water and Sewer Commission’s history. Its cost would be fully shouldered by Harvard which would like it to serve the area of the Tishman development along Western Avenue though university officials say they have a backup plan for the first part of that project at least should the pipeline not work out.

They might need it.

Because the pipe would cross state parkland to reach the Charles the use of that land must be approved by the Legislature through a bill filed by the local state representative. In this case that would be state Representative Mike Moran. And he wants to know what Harvard has in mind for the neighborhood.

Without more details for the area beyond those first 14 acres Moran said he has no intention to file the bill. Harvard says it’s sharing everything it can. The impasse has stretched on for two years.

“This is the one and only time in my lifetime that the people who live down there actually have a real voice” Moran said. “I’m not giving up that voice just because Harvard is asking me to do that.”

Harvard and Tishman are hearing from the neighborhood too as the first section of the Enterprise Research Campus undergoes review by the Boston Planning & Development Agency.

Community leaders are pushing for more affordable housing urging at least 20 percent of the 765 apartments planned there be set at below-market rents up from the city requirement of 13 percent. Tishman has proposed doing more than the minimum but says it can’t do 20 percent in the first phase of the development before more lucrative lab space can be built though it can reach that threshold in the second phase.

And some in Allston just want more housing in general particularly considering how many more life science jobs could be coming with other projects planned nearby. Resident Jessica Robertson worries that Allston could turn out like parts of Cambridge with lab and office construction far outpacing new housing and gradually making the neighborhood more homogenous more bland and more costly.

“Today Allston is a diverse community in a number of ways” Robertson said. “Is it going to be a neighborhood populated entirely by pharma bros? That’s definitely my fear.”

Developer Tishman Speyer envisions building a lively neighborhood across the street from Harvard Business School as pictured in this conceptual rendering. Tishman Speyer

Still she conceded that while Harvard may represent in some ways the biggest threat to the neighborhood the university’s wealth and long-term vision could also represent Allston’s biggest opportunity. Robertson pointed to the success of the Charlesview apartments an affordable housing complex nearly a mile down Western Ave. from Harvard Business School that Harvard helped rebuild nearly a decade ago. That project earned kudos for how it was integrated with the surrounding community.

“Harvard is committed to working with its host communities to address the region’s high cost of housing and creating home ownership opportunities” Harvard spokeswoman Brigid O’Rourke said in an e-mail.

O’Rourke also said there are dozens of opportunities for Harvard to engage with Allston and “we’re proud of the deep and meaningful relationships we have throughout the neighborhood.” She noted various ways the university will solicit feedback from a broader array of residents beyond those tuning into BPDA meetings on Zoom including with “pop-up” appearances at events focus groups and workshops.

Harvard’s Mark Handley also presented a peace offering in late July: nearly an acre of land on Seattle Street — near the southwestern edge of its Enterprise Research Campus area — that the university would give away to support development of affordable condos. It was a response to concerns that housing at the ERC will be all rental units. Details remain minimal but the finished product could resemble a 20-unit condo project on Harvard-donated land on nearby Antwerp Street.

Neighbors found the offer encouraging though it’s unlikely to assuage concerns that Harvard’s undeveloped portion of Allston is at risk of becoming another Seaport — or in city councilor Liz Breadon’s words “a playground for folks who are mostly white people who have a lot of money.”

“There’s an expectation that Harvard can do more” said Breadon who recently sent the letter to Janey urging city officials to wait until after this fall’s mayoral election to approve the research campus project and a rezoning study for a nearby stretch of Western Ave. where Harvard also owns property.

The letter — which was also signed by Moran and two other state legislators who represent the neighborhood — accused Harvard of “grossly insufficient” community outreach.

Breadon said her constituents worry Harvard is too reliant on a piecemeal approach with third-party developers rather than taking more responsibility for articulating a broader plan. They wonder: Is Harvard hiding the full picture yet again?

“I haven’t seen this level of frustration in the neighborhood in over 10 years” Breadon said. “They’re doing this one project at a time. ... [It] really is a war of attrition.”

It still has a long way to go but thanks to a number of developers and businesses willing to invest in the future of the area — along with public investment — it’s slowly turning around.

For many a big part of the draw was the construction of the new $200 million Lowell Justice Center just around the corner on Jackson Street.

Assistant City Manager and Department of Planning and Development Director Christine McCall said the Jackson/Appleton/Middlesex streets area as a whole has seen significant redevelopment in recent years with many projects in close proximity to the Justice Center and only a short distance from the Lowell commuter rail station.

She pointed to three such projects on Middlesex Street led by Nine Zero Two Development and Peter Marlowe that are underway.

“These projects are excellent examples of the type of smart-growth and transit-oriented development we want to see in the JAM area” McCall said. “We are very excited to see these projects come to fruition.”

Justin MacFarlane principal of Nine Zero Two Development said he fell in love with Lowell while living in Billerica in 2016 a few years after he moved to Massachusetts from Canada.

“You come to Lowell and you see the diversity and the history and just the potential of the city” MacFarlane said. “When I talk to people who have been here quite some time they say it’s easier to see that potential when you’re coming from the outside. I’ve had nothing but positive experiences here.”

MacFarlane is in the process of constructing a $5.5 million 16000-square-foot new building at 160 Middlesex St. which will house 24 small apartments (400 to 600 square feet) on the upper floors and a 1700-square-foot commercial space likely to be a restaurant on the first floor. The units will be a mix of studio and junior one-bedroom apartments — another term for a studio with a separate enclosed sleeping area he said. He also plans to move his business office from the Boston area to the property.

Late last year MacFarlane also purchased the property at 78-80 Middlesex St. In collaboration with D² Development MacFarlane plans to redevelop the former fitness center site into 26 residential units that will have an open courtyard down to the pool in the lower level. The $6.5 million project will have a mix of unit sizes ranging from 650 to 1200 square feet he said.

All of the units in both developments will be market-rate and add different housing choices to the city McFarlane said.

As an advocate of having people from different walks of life and socioeconomic backgrounds living together he said he is also working on starting a charity that bridges the gap for those transitioning out of housing assistance programs. Knowing how difficult that transition can be MacFarlane said the aim will be to donate 12 to 16 months rent-free to those who meet certain criteria “just to allow them that leg up.”

A couple doors down at 138-140 Middlesex St. Marlowe is the general contractor for a project to redevelop the existing building into three ground-floor commercial units and three apartments above.

The property is owned by Jose and Maria Ribeiro Brazilian immigrants who also own the Romeu & Juliett Cafe around the corner on South Street. Marlowe also worked with the couple on that project finished last year which has apartments on the upper floors.

Marlowe said the historic building on Middlesex Street was originally the Eliot Street School and later housed the Hanover Leather Co. He said the project which required a total gut renovation began in 2019 and was slowed by the pandemic but should be completed by Thanksgiving.

The commercial units will include a salon and a rental office space and they’re in negotiations with a pizzeria for the third unit which will have outdoor seating in the back Marlowe said. He said the Ribeiros who live elsewhere in the city are looking forward to moving into the largest of the apartments in the building.

Marlowe said he looks around the neighborhood and is reminded of what the Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston looked like in the early 1970s before the buildings were restored and the surrounding area was built up ultimately becoming some of the most expensive real estate on the East Coast.

“So that’s what happens — start building it up and everybody follows the leader” he said.

Across the street from MacFarlane’s 160 Middlesex St. development Joe Healy who opened Lou’s Deli at 155 Middlesex St. with longtime friend and business partner Andrew Bartlett in May said their timing was perfect.

“I had always thought to myself that Court House Deli who had occupied the space before me had a great idea about opening that space but kind of mistimed it” Healy said noting the multiple delays in construction of the Justice Center and then the pandemic likely both had roles in his predecessor’s demise.

As soon as Healy saw the storefront open up he jumped on it. He said the deli which specializes in high-end creative sandwiches with a California twist has had steady business since it opened buoyed by the extensive network he and Bartlett as native Lowellians have in the city.

Healy said he does have concerns about customers having to walk past the Lowell Transitional Living Center and the crowds that are often outside on the way to his business. But what he’s looking forward to is the future — when the adjacent developments are completed and occupied as well as such larger developments nearby as WinnCompanies’ 201 Canal Apartments due to open this spring

“I think the development will carry us” Healy said.

The larger developers are also excited about the other development happening around them as WinnCompanies Executive Vice President Michael O’Brien made clear during a recent tour of the property at 201 Canal.

“It’s one plus one equals 10 — the more life more vitality” O’Brien said. “It’s all additive and it’s just a wonderful place to do business.”",,,,,,,,,

Her coworker has confessed to the killing,"Starr Brown a Black transgender woman was shot and killed in Tennessee last month and a coworker has reportedly confessed to the crime.

Police in Memphis say Brown was murdered in the early morning hours of April 19 after she finished her work shift at Checkers a drive-thru fast-food establishment according to local CBS affiliate WREG. She was seen on video driving away in her Pontiac G3 with coworker Alexander Williamson 20 just after 2:30 a.m. Brown’s body was discovered in her car several hours later in a wooded area on Rolling Woods Drive. She suffered a single gunshot wound to her left side.

On April 28 Williamson voluntarily walked into a police station and confessed to the crime local Fox affiliate WHBQ-TV reported. He reportedly gave a full confession but police provided no information about a possible motive or why he decided to confess.

Alexander Williamson Shelby County Sheriff's Office

Brown is the 11th known trans individual to die violently this year and the second known Black trans woman to be killed according to the Human Rights Campaign.

Jasmine Tasaki founder of WeCare Tennesse which supports trans women of color in the state decried violence against Black trans women and called for greater efforts on behalf of the trans community.

“It saddens me that we are living in a time where black transwomen are murdered with no outrage” Tasaki said in a statement. “Our community continues to suffer yet we find ways to go on. It is with deep hurt that I say Starr Brown’s name. She is now with the ancestors and can rest. It’s our duty to push harder for liberation for our people; we can only save ourselves.”

Brown was a victim of violence last year when shot while waiting for an Uber after work on October 18. She was accosted by two men around 3 a.m. She was able to use mace on the man with a gun but he wiped his face and shot her in the leg. She later told local ABC affiliate WATN-TV she felt lucky that the man didn’t shoot her in the back as she fled.

This is not the first time Williamson has been charged with murder. He was arrested in 2022 along with his brothers Artavious 23 and Ajaylin. 22 for the shooting death of a man who had been in an earlier dispute with Artvavious. He reportedly returned with his brothers to the man’s Memphis home where he shot and killed him after challenging him to a fist fight WHBQ-TV reported at the time. Williamson then 19 was charged with second-degree murder."

For more than a year it was more a matter of “where” than “if” for Chippendales.

The show was sort of floating (or gyrating) in adult-revue limbo throughout the pandemic. For a time it seemed the boys in bow ties would head to Omnia at Caesars Palace. Then its room at Rio appeared to be closed for good a result of Caesars Entertainment’s decision to shut down many of its small-capacity venues in May.

The show insisted it would find a place to play even as the playground shrank.

In the end the Chipps brand and its fired-up cast has proved it isn’t dispensable. The show has bounced back in the very home we expected to be closed at Rio this weekend.

“This is our home and I think that Caesars just felt we were the right piece of entertainment to have in the hotel” Chippendales Director of Operations Katerina Tabakhov said before Friday’s packed performance. “We are super happy to be back here. Everything is exactly how we need it to be.”

Company officials have effectively confirmed that stance.

“The return of Chippendales at the Rio rounds out the right level of programming for the property” Caesars Entertainment’s president of entertainment Jason Gastwirth said in a statement. “We are incredibly pleased to begin offering the show to our guests yet again.”

If Friday night’s performance is an indication the production hasn’t at all lost its capacity to ignite and excite bachelorette parties. Audience members are still summoned to the stage to take party in the “50 Shades” spoof or demonstrate their favorite sexual positions amid a cascade of screams.

Other returning crowd favorites are the motorcycle striptease (which will get you thrown out of any Harley-Davidson dealership) the signature shower scene (loofah optional) and a new Latin-themed number that plays like a New Year’s Eve party in Cabo.

The most obvious difference between now and back then of course is the crowd is in face masks. And boy the theater’s crew (and the dancers themselves) are taskmasters about keeping those masks up unless you are actively drinking.

There was plenty of that Friday. There were at least a half-dozen bachelorette celebrations in the venues cocktails flowing as freely as the partiers’ dance moves. The shrieks weren’t muffled by their face covers either.

“Our audiences have been wild” says Tabakhov who has effectively taken over operations as visionary shareholder Kevin Denberg (long the show’s managing partner) has shed involvement in the production. “No matter how depressing it is outside it’s fun in here.”

The Chipps performers and numbers were in impressive condition especially considering they had four weeks to whip themselves back into shape for the relaunch.

The show is trumpeting the return of Chipps vet Chaun Williams also featured on the HBO Max series “FBoy Island.” Williams was so young when he started his first tour in the show (just 19) he couldn’t even visit the adjacent Flirt Lounge after the show. Also in the mix is Ricky Rogers who has wound up on MTV’s “Double Shot at Love” and “Jersey Shore Family Vacation” with his friend and former Chipps celebrity guest host Vinny Guadagnino.

The show’s dance captain Ryan Kelsey is back. He is the rare adult-review performer who has donned a Colonel Sanders costume for a KFC “Chickendales” commercial. Kelsey is also playing guitar in a couple of spots; he has developed his music skills throughout COVID.

And the show’s vocalist Jayson Michael can belt it even while slipping out of one.

Chippendales’ return could not have come soon enough. Competition is steep for male revues in Las Vegas. “Magic Mike Live” is in a new theater at the Sahara and is also the focus of an HBO Max reality-contest show “The Real Magic Mike” (premiere date to be announced). “Thunder From Down Under” has been performing for months at its fancy new theater Thunderland Showroom at Excalibur (that show’s opening in 2002 actually pre-dates Chippendales). “Aussie Heat” has been running since June 2020 at Mosaic on the Strip. A new revue “Uncensored” opened in July at Señor Frog’s at Treasure Island.

But the Chippendales are kind of like the New York Yankees of male strip shows. The brand is forever familiar earning equity with its iconic shirtless-bow tie costumes. The image has been recognizable for 40 years boosted by the late Patrick Swayze and Chris Farley in their epic Chipps-audition skit on “SNL.” Such ventures as KFC’s “Chickendales” campaign only enhances the brand recognition.

The Chipps are currently the focus of two streaming projects. “Immigrant” starring Kumail Nanjiani is an eight-part series targeted for Hulu. Also the Oscar-winning production company Lightbox is developing “Curse of the Chippendales” a four-part docuseries that has been approved by Discovery+ streaming service. A timeline for distribution for both projects is also to be announced.

All that multimedia activity for a show that at the moment has no touring production and no performances outside the Rio. The Chippendales live performances are carried by these 10 guys at an off-Strip hotel while some of its toughest competition plays to new rooms on the Strip.

“We know there is way more competition than ever so we are keeping busy” Tabakhov said. “But we are feeling solid. The show has been performing great. We like where we are.”

Hochul‘s husband spent hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying state officials including “staff at the Office of Governor and Lt. Governor” while she was lieutenant governor records show.

Delaware North a Buffalo-based gambling and hospitality giant where William Hochul Jr. serves as general counsel and senior vice president paid New York lobbying shop Bolton-St. Johns more than $300000 between 2019 and 2021 for lobbying services in Albany according to a review of JCOPE filings by The Post.

William Hochul joined the company in 2016 after three decades as a federal prosecutor. His wife became Gov. Cuomo’s lieutenant in 2015.

In several instances Delaware North and its lobbyists engaged in “direct lobbying” of the “Executive Chamber/Staff of Office of Governor and Lt. Governor” in 2020 and 2021 a time when Kathy Hochul held the position records show.

In one 2020 case the lobbying centered on “Covid reopening safety plan[s] in New York State.” In another 2021 instance it focused on “ongoing issues with sports betting in the State of New York.”

William Hochul has continued in his Delaware North job despite his wife’s ascension last week to the Governor’s mansion.

“[William Hochul] will not be involved in anything whatsoever to do with the State of New York. He will recuse himself from anything to do with New York State” Hochul’s office told The Post.

Delaware North netted $3.7 billion in revenue in 2020 and employs 55000 people according to Forbes.

“Right now the state of New York is developing the rules for mobile gaming apps which is by far the most lucrative place where the industry is going” John Kaehny the executive director of Reinvent Albany told The Post. In April Gov. Cuomo signed a bill legalizing online sports betting. Just days ago the New York State Gaming Commission approved a new set of regulations knocking out the last procedural hurdles to the plan.

In her new role Gov. Hochul can appoint members of the New York State Gaming Commission.

Delaware North said it will not pursue a mobile-betting license but it has huge interests in gaming and casinos currently owning the Finger Lakes Gaming & Racetrack in Farmington NY; and managing the Hamburg Gaming casino. It also has a $39 million agreement with the NY Thruway Authority to manage food and drinks at rest stops records show.

“Neither Delaware North nor its lobbyists have ever lobbied the former-Lieutenant Governor or her staff on any matter on behalf of Delaware North” a company spokeswoman told The Post insisting that JCOPE “does not allow lobbyists to delineate between the governor and lieutenant governor’s offices” in filings.

A rep for JCOPE said the latter is not true and that its forms easily allow delineation of offices.

Though Gov. Hochul has promised a “new era of transparency” her new executive chamber is shaping up to be one with deep lobbying ties.

The lion’s share of Delaware North filings from Bolton-St. Johns lists Michael Keogh as a lobbyist for the company. The longtime Bolton partner is married to Karen Persichilli who this week became Gov. Hochul’s powerful new secretary.

Keogh’s name also pops up on several other six-figure gaming advocacy contracts for clients like Rivers Casino Caesars Entertainment and the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe.

Persichilli herself is no stranger to lobbying spending more than five years as “head of state government relations” for JP Morgan Chase according to her LinkedIn bio.

Gov. Hochul spent time as a lobbyist for M&T Bank in Buffalo after she left Congress in 2012 the Associated Press reported.

Hochul’s daughter-in-law Christina Hochul is director of federal policy at Biogen according to her LinkedIn page. The pharmaceutical firm has spent at least $20000 this year on state lobbyists.

“When Bolton-St Johns supported Delaware North we never worked with Mr. Hochul Mr. Keogh did not ever do work for Delaware North and Bolton-St Johns’ contract ended with Delaware North in February 2021” a company spokesman told The Post saying Keogh’s name was only on the forms out of an abundance of caution.

A rep for Hochul said with respect to Persichilli that “recusals have been put in place to ensure that any New York State business relating to the Secretary’s spouse will be delegated.”

Kaehny said Hochul’s “ironclad policies” to ensure against conflicts in her administration should include independent oversight of gaming issues by either the state attorney general or the comptroller.

“The question really is one of sincerity. If Hochul truly wants what she called a new era and change in Albany culture she has to lead by example” Kaehny said.",,,,,,

CPB,Campbell Soup Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vY2FtcGJlbGwtc291cC1jcGItb3B0aW9uLXRyYWRlcnMtYnVsbGlzaC1hZnRlci1lYXJuaW5ncy01MjAwMzE40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Campbell Soup (CPB) Option Traders Bullish After Earnings,"After Campbell Soup Company (CPB) reported that it had exceeded analysts' predictions for its fiscal fourth quarter earnings results option traders are taking actions that they think the share price will move higher in the future. This may come as no surprise considering that the share price rose 2% the day after the announcement.

Campbell Soup reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.55 and $1.87 billion in revenue beating analysts' expectations calling for EPS of $0.47 and revenue of $1.81 billion. In the week prior to the announcement investors had slightly bid up the share price from the bottom of an extreme range with a large number of put options in the open interest.

Option trading volume indicates that traders had been buying put options and selling calls; however option trading activity after earnings indicate that traders are growing confident in CPB's share price going forward. That's because the price action has risen from the lower extreme range while option activity implies that traders are buying calls and selling puts.

Key Takeaways Traders and investors bought shares of CPB following the earnings announcement as the stock rose 2%.

The share price of CPB recently rose above its 20-day moving average.

Put and call option activity appears to be positioned for the share price to rise.

The volatility-based support and resistance levels allow for a stronger move to the downside.

This setup creates an opportunity for traders to profit from a reversal in the earnings-based price movement.

Option trading is a literal bet on the probabilities of the market - a bet made by traders that are on average better informed than most investors. The key to maximizing insight into option trading is to understand the context in which the price movement took place. The chart below illustrates the price action for CPB’s share price as of September 3 illustrating the setup after the earnings report.

Current Trends

The one-month trend of the stock saw the share price falling closing well below the 20-day moving average before rising after earnings and closing in the middle of the range depicted by the technical studies in this chart. These studies are formed by 20-day Keltner Channel indicators. These depict price levels that represent a multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) for the stock. This array helps to highlight the way the price has fallen to the lower extremes of the range before rising toward the middle after earnings. This price move from CPB shares implies that investors are growing confident in the share price of CPB going forward.

Tip The Average True Range (ATR) has become a standard tool for depicting historical volatility over time. The typical average length of time used in its calculation is 10 to 20 time periods which includes two to four weeks of trading on a daily chart.

Chart watchers can recognize that traders were expressing optimism going into earnings based on the price trend for CPB rising from the lower extreme of the volatility range in the week before the announcement. Chart watchers can also form an opinion of investor expectations by paying attention to option trading details. Prior to the announcement traders appeared to be expecting that CPB shares would move downward after earnings.

Tip The Keltner Channel indicator displays a set of semi-parallel lines based on a 20-day simple moving average and an upper and lower line. Because the upper lines are drawn by adding a multiple of ATR to the average and the lower lines are drawn by subtracting a multiple of ATR from the average price then this channel indicator makes for an excellent visualization tool when charting historical volatility.

Trading Activity

The recent activity of options traders implies that they consider Campbell Soup shares undervalued and have bought call options as a bet that the stock will close within the box depicted in the chart between today and Sept. 17 the next monthly expiration date for options. The green-framed box represents the pricing that the call option sellers are offering. It implies a 68% chance that Campbell Souop shares will close inside this range or higher by Sept. 17. So sellers are only mildly bullish. However buyers are snapping up this pricing suggesting that buyers consider these options underpriced. Since the pricing implies only a 32% chance that prices could close above this green box it appears that buyers are willing to take those long odds.

It is important to note that open interest on Friday featured over 60000 call options compared to over 53000 puts demonstrating the bias that option buyers had. This normally implies that option traders expect upward price movement. After earnings volatility has decreased dramatically but the number of put options in the open interest decreased. This signals a bullish sentiment. For strikes at the money and one step either direction the call volume outweighs the put volume. Out-of-the-money put volume declines at a much slower rate than out-of-the-money call volume.

The purple lines on the chart are generated by a 10-day Keltner Channel study set at 4 times the ATR. This measure tends to create highly correlated regions of strong support and resistance in the price action. These regions show up when the channel lines make a noticeable turn within the previous three months.

The levels that the turns mark are annotated in the chart below. What is notable in this chart is that the call and put pricing are in such disparity with plenty of space to run downwards. This suggests that option buyers have a stronger conviction of the price moving higher in the weeks following the report. Although investors and option traders expected positive movement from the report the share price moved further to the upside than it did after the last earnings report.

These support and resistance levels show a large range of support and resistance for prices. As a result of this it is possible that there could be a large move in either direction in the near future. After the previous earnings announcement CPB shares fell 6.5% in the day following and continued to fall the following week. Investors may be expecting a different kind of move in price in the week after this announcement. With lots of room in the volatility range share prices could rise or fall more than expected in the near term; however there is more room in the volatility range to support a move to the downside.

Wrapping Up

CPB beat analysts' expectations for EPS and revenue. The share price rose 2% the day after the announcement and has remained in the middle of the volatility range closing above its 20-day moving average. Option traders appear to be buying calls and selling puts which translates into a bullish outlook. This activity however does provide more room in the volatility range for a downward move in the share price in the future.

Option Trade Example

As a bet on market probabilities unusual option activity can offer traders insight into investor sentiment toward the company and illustrate what ""smart money"" is doing with large volume orders. One way to capture the bullish sentiment reflected in the post-earnings activity of CPB would be to open a calendar spread.

A calendar spread also known as a horizontal spread is an option strategy which involves simultaneously buying and selling two of the same type of options with different expiration dates but the same strike prices. Calendar spreads allow traders to construct a trade that minimizes the effects of time. A calendar spread is most profitable when the underlying asset does not make any significant moves in either direction until after the near-term option expires.

For example to capture CPB's bullish sentiment selling the Oct. 1 $45 call will deliver a credit of $0.33 with a breakeven price of $45.33. Buying the January $45 costs $1.43 and has a breakeven price of $46.43. After selling the Oct. 1 call and buying the January call the net cost for this trade is $1.10 or $110 per contract (data snapshot as of 2:45 EDT 9/3/2021). The idea behind this trade is to capture the short-term upward trend. The chart below illustrates the setup for this example.



No strategy is without risk. The maximum risk on this trade is the amount paid to open the positions or $1.10 per contract. Calculating the maximum profit on a calendar spread at the outset is difficult as the maximum profit is equal to the time value left in the bought option at the sold option expiration minus the net debit or cost for the trade. However professional traders target 15% to 30% profit. If the short call expires out-of-the-money we can continue to sell short dated calls against our long call position further reducing the cost in the trade.

(Neal Brown postgame press conference)

COLLEGE PARK Md. — Desperately seeking a road win after failing to earn one last season West Virginia repeatedly stubbed its toe in Saturday’s 30-24 season-opening loss at Maryland.

The Mountaineers finished with four turnovers none more important than their final one — a Jarret Doege pass intercepted by Terrapins’ defensive back Jakorian Bennett for a touchback with 8:16 remaining.

“The biggest statistic in football that tells whether you win or lose is turnovers and we had four that led directly to ten points and they had zero” said West Virginia head coach Neal Brown who fell to 11-12 in his WVU tenure. “It’s not overly complicated. It’s that simple.”

Bennett’s interception came on a second-and-10 play from the Maryland 13-yard line and WVU facing a 23-21 deficit.

The Terrapins (1-0) capitalized when quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa found Rakim Jarrett for a 60-yard touchdown pass and a 30-21 advantage with 6:25 remaining.

The Mountaineers (0-1) got into the red zone on their ensuing sequence and produced their only points of the second half on Casey Legg’s 24-yard field goal.

Needing to force a three-and-out to get the ball back and have a chance to go ahead West Virginia allowed Tagovailoa to run for 4 yards on third-and-3 which effectively ended the contest. Tayvon Fleet-Davis’ 53-yard run two plays later sealed the verdict.

“They ran 80 snaps we ran 62 and we got tired” Brown said. “Depth is an issue for us and we said that in the preseason. They wore us down.”

Maryland trailed 21-20 at halftime but went on top for good when Joseph Petrino made a 26-yard field goal with 9:16 remaining.

Winston Wright returned the ensuing kickoff 48 yards to give the Mountaineers good field position and Doege found Sam James for 39 yards before the costly interception.

It marked another squandered opportunity for West Virginia which lost out on several chances to add to a 21-20 lead in the third quarter.

Despite holding Maryland to 26 yards and no first downs in the third WVU was unable to take advantage.

The Mountaineers punted on their first three series of the second half and on the fourth Leddie Brown lost a fumble after being stopped for no gain on third-and-1 from the Terps’ 34. The recovery by Maryland’s Lawtez Rogers prevented West Virginia from trying to convert on fourth down.

“The fumble was just as big [as the other three turnovers]” Brown said. “We were going to be short but we were going to run it on fourth down and go with two chances to get a yard.”

It appeared a shootout was in store at the start with the two teams combining for five touchdowns and six scoring drives on the first eight series.

Petrino’s 45-yard field goal gave UM an early 3-0 lead but WVU responded with a 78-yard drive that was capped by Doege’s 20-yard swing pass to Brown for a touchdown.

The lead was short-lived however as Tagovailoa found Dontay Demus for a 66-yard touchdown pass on the third play of the ensuing series. Demus got behind cornerback Daryl Porter who was making his first college start.

“DP on the one he gave up just had really bad eye discipline” Brown said. “He had his eyes in the backfield and you can’t do that.”

The Mountaineers’ defensive struggles in the first quarter continued on Maryland’s third series which was an eight play 70-yard drive that ended with Tagovailoa tossing an 18-yard touchdown pass to Chigoziem Okonkwo.

“They tackled considerably better than we did” Brown said. “We really struggled in the first quarter and took poor angles in pursuit.”

Wright returned the ensuing kickoff 98 yards to set up Brown’s 2-yard TD run allowing the Mountaineers to close to within 17-14 with 35 seconds remaining in the opening quarter.

“I just understand the scheme” Wright said. “I know how to draw defenders to the opposite side and hit the hole.”

After the Mountaineers forced their first punt they covered 74 yards in six plays and went on top 21-17 at the 11:30 mark of the second quarter when Brown scored his third TD — this one a 9-yard run.

VanDarius Cowan brought down Tagovailoa for a loss of 8 on fourth-and-1 nearing the midway point of the second quarter but Doege threw an ill-advised pass that was intercepted by Nick Cross on the very next play.

“The first interception was a really bad decision” Brown said. “You have to throw the ball away. Can’t make a bad play worse.”

Although the Mountaineers remained in front they didn’t run another offensive play until 2:47 left in the half as a result of Wright muffing a punt that Maryland recovered.

UM was unable to capitalize however as Petrino’s 51-yard field goal missed off the upright.

“Everybody in college football opens up a game with a 10 to 15 play script” WVU linebacker Josh Chandler-Semedo said. “They had a full offseason to figure out what to do. As the game went on and we got into the normal stuff that we practice we started to settle down and make plays.”

The Terps forced a three-and-out to get the ball back late in the half and put together a seven play 66-yard drive to draw closer on Petrino’s 21-yard field goal.

Maryland finished with a 496-328 advantage in total yards.

Doege was 24-of-40 for 280 yards and Brown rushed 17 times for 73 yards.

Tagovailoa completed 26-of-32 passes for 332 yards and three touchdowns.

Demus and Jarrett each had six catches and one touchdown. Demus finished with 133 receiving yards and Jarrett added 122.

Fleet-Davis rushed for 123 yards on 18 carries.

“They didn’t lose it. They didn’t turn it over” Brown said. “The quarterback played really well. We didn’t get as much pressure on him as we thought we would. They did some nice things schematically and helped him in the run game.”

The Mountaineers return to action Saturday when they welcome FCS opponent Long Island for the home opener at 5 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzL2FydGljbGVzL3RoZXNlLWFyZS10aGUtdG9wLTUtY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtY29tcGFuaWVzLWZvci1jdXN0b21lci1zYXRpc2ZhY3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Are the Top 5 Credit Card Companies for Customer Satisfaction,"There's a familiar name at the top of the list.

J.D. Power recently released its 2021 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study. For the last 15 years the consumer intelligence company has ranked card issuers on a 1000-point scale. This year national card issuers received an average score of 809.

Even though most consumers aren't contacting their credit card companies too often it's nice to know you won't spend hours on hold or deal with subpar service if you do need to get in touch. If you're looking for the best credit card options in terms of customer service you'll find the top five national issuers below along with how well they scored.

1. American Express (838)

When it comes to providing an excellent customer experience American Express is hard to beat. This is the 11th time it has been number one according to J.D. Power's rankings.

Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards

It's clear that American Express prioritizes customer satisfaction. Wait times are generally on the shorter side it has plenty of special offers and events for its clients and it provides a quality mobile app.

Another notable perk is the complimentary protections many American Express cards offer. These can include:

While other card issuers have similar protections they typically offer them through third-party companies. American Express offers these protections itself which often results in a smoother claim process.

2. Discover (837)

Discover is also a mainstay near the top of these rankings and it was second here by a razor-thin margin just like in the 2020 study. It finished first in the 2019 study.

This is another card issuer that has invested in customer service. Discover offers 24/7 assistance and U.S.-based agents are available by phone live chat and messaging.

Quality service isn't the only part of Discover's winning formula. Discover credit cards are well-liked because they have valuable benefits their rewards are easy to use and they've gotten rid of common fees. None of Discover's cards charge an annual fee or a foreign transaction fee and Discover automatically waives your first late fee.

3. Capital One (815)

After a seven-point improvement Capital One went from slightly below average in the 2020 study to a little above average in 2021.

That's somewhat surprising considering that Capital One had lengthy hold times early in the COVID-19 pandemic. It also reduced some cardholders' credit limits during the pandemic. The J.D. Power study mentioned that credit limit issues were a big source of consumer frustration.

Capital One credit cards may have helped balance out those problems. The card issuer offers a variety of quality card products that can fit just about any consumer's needs.

4. Chase (807)

Even though Chase was fourth it was two points below average. As a whole national credit card issuers didn't have a great year for customer satisfaction.

If these rankings were based solely on each issuer's credit cards Chase would have an argument for first place. Chase credit cards are extremely popular and most of them score highly in reviews. It has fantastic rewards cards in particular including for cash back and travel rewards.

Unfortunately some consumers have found Chase's customer service lacking. It would be nice to see Chase improve in this area and score better next year.

5. Bank of America and Citi (805)

These two credit card companies tied for fifth place with a score four points lower than average. They took two different paths to get there though.

Bank of America fell by seven points from the 2020 study. This card issuer doesn't have quite as many options as some of its competitors. It does however offer bonus credit rewards to clients in its Preferred Rewards program. Those who qualify can get much more value from Bank of America credit cards.

Citi scored four points higher in 2021 than it did in 2020. While it's still below average it has been making small steady improvements. And even though it isn't the most popular card issuer several of the best Citi credit cards are top options in their categories.

The best of the rest

The rankings above are for national card issuers that met J.D. Power's study award criteria. There were also a few notable card issuers that didn't fit into that group.

Goldman Sachs the card issuer for the Apple Card received a score of 864. It's considered a midsize card issuer and it was far ahead of that group's average score of 796.

USAA received a score of 860. It's a national card issuer that didn't meet the study award criteria.

Navy Federal Credit Union received a score of 866. It's a midsize card issuer that didn't meet the study award criteria.

It was a down year overall for customer satisfaction with credit card companies but there were still card issuers that excelled. American Express and Discover did well as usual. Although other national issuers had their issues it was a challenging year because of COVID-19. With any luck scores will improve next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvbm9yaW5nLTktMTEtZmxpZ2h0LWNyZXctcGF1bC12ZW5ldG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honoring 9/11 crew: A former flight attendant on his quest to push a beverage cart from BOS to NYC,"The 20th anniversary of 9/11 is coming up and former flight attendant Paul ""Paulie"" Veneto is embarking on the mission of a lifetime to honor the flight crew who were killed on that day many of whom were Veneto's close friends and co-workers.

Veneto has embarked on ""Paulie's Push"" to honor the fallen flight crew of Sept. 11 2001 during which he'll be pushing an airline beverage cart from Gate C19 at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) to Ground Zero in New York City.

The journey is in honor of the path of United flight 175 which left out of that gate in Boston on the morning of Sept. 11 bound for LAX. The plane never made it to California crashing into the South Tower after terrorists hijacked the aircraft.

The crew members on board that flight included ​​Captain Victor Saracini First Officer Michael Horrocks flight attendants Robert Fangman Amy Jarret Amy King Kathryn Laborie Alfred Marchand Michael Tarrou and Alicia Titus.

""I've worked that flight I know those crew members"" said Veneto.

Veneto is a former United Airlines flight attendant who was based out of Boston for 25 years. He started working for United in 1997 and flew domestic transcon routes from BOS to Los Angeles (LAX) and San Francisco (SFO) on a Boeing 757 and 767.

Before that Veneto got his start in 1981 for World Airways. ""I got to see the world"" said Veneto who was intrigued by flying as a kid. But not the flying part it was more about meeting people he said.

Veneto said before the crash he worked with the 9/11 base crew doing that same route on the three-class 767. ""I flew with Kathryn Amy [Jarret] and Alfred"" he said. ""[Alfred] was only flying for 10 months.""

Veneto said flight attendants Amy King and Michael Tarrou were engaged to be married.

Veneto said he finished working on the eve of 9/11 and when the first plane hit he immediately called the airport. ""It was chaos.""

""We all knew each other and knew which people flew transcon so I had a good idea who was on the airplane right away"" said Veneto. ""It was an out of body experience. We wanted information they couldn't give us.""

Four days later the airline wanted staff back on planes said Veneto. ""That wasn't an easy thing. There was an awful lot of fear especially in Boston.""

Veneto says he developed an addiction to pain meds after being prescribed Norco for back pain shortly after 9/11. He said ""numbed"" himself with pills for 10 years thereafter while he continued to work as a flight attendant.

Through the rehab program Power Forward 25 he met Kevin Stevens a two-time Stanley Cup winner. The 20th anniversary of 9/11 also marks six years clean and sober for Veneto.

Kevin's sister Kelli Wilson is the one who spearheaded Veneto's mission. Wilson's husband came up with the name.

Acquiring the beverage cart was the easy part. ""I went to the airport and a catering company gave it to me when I told them what I was doing"" said Veneto. ""Two minutes later and they were wheeling the cart out."" They even gave him a few backup carts just in case.

With the help of Dave McGillivray who has run across the country twice and run the Boston Marathon 46 times a strategic route was mapped out and a camera fashioned to the cart to chronicle the journey. ""I have the most elite athletes giving me advice"" said Veneto. That roster also includes Becca Pizzi who has run seven marathons in seven days on seven continents. ""All these people could tell me all this information but no one could tell me how to push a beverage cart"" laughed Veneto. ""It's not gonna be easy.""

Veneto said he started training on Oct. 10 2020. ""I pulled my car up to the beach. I said 'This is Day 1.' I began walking the beach every night every day — whenever I could.""

On March 1 Veneto said he brought the beverage cart to a park to take it for a test spin. By May 1 he moved to the street to get used to the terrain. Veneto would log eight miles in the morning and eight in the afternoon.

Veneto's dedication and training all led up to the kick off on August 21. The journey is 220 miles total. His goal was to log between 10 and 20 miles per day and finish his journey in New York on Sept. 11.

As of publication he's just finished mile 188 in Greenwich CT. That leaves 32 miles left to go in five days — a finish line well within Veneto's reach.

""Nothings going to stop me from getting this thing there — even if i have to throw it on my back and carry it"" said Veneto.

Veneto said he'll be staying in hotels along the way and that two high-school friends will be following close behind in an RV for support.

As part of the journey Veneto will be raising money for crew members' families that have started nonprofits as well as Power Forward 25 which has been his main sponsor. ""I feel so grateful I'm able to do this"" said Veneto.

Veneto has dedicated the mission in honor of the crew members who were killed on 9/11. ""They were never recognized for their heroics because of the enormity of that day"" said Veneto. ""No one recognized what these crew members did at 8 a.m. in the morning. They were still able to get info to us on the ground despite everything going on.""

More than anything Veneto wants the family members to be proud of that 9/11 crew. ""Their loved ones were heroes"" said Veneto.

And as in any city small or large there are community standards and laws that must be obeyed. These days that includes following the federal mandate to wear a mask covering your face and nose while in the airport.

The federal mandate has been extended to January 18 2022 and at TPA anyone who refuses to comply with that rule must ultimately deal with TPA Police Chief Charlie Vazquez and his team of 81 officers.

We sat down with Charlie Vazquez to get the 411 on some of the duties of an airport police chief airport crime TPA's ""mask blitzes"" and where he'd like to go on vacation.

Unsung hero: Charlie Vazquez Director of Public Safety and Security/ Chief of Police at Tampa International Airport (TPA)

TPG: What was your path to become Chief of Police at Tampa International Airport?

CZ: Before coming here I was with the Houston Police Department for 24 years. I retired from there in 2017 as Assistant Police Chief and have been at Tampa International Airport as Director of Public Safety and Security/Chief of Police for four and half years.

TPG: What sort of responsibilities does your job entail?

CZ: We enforce all laws and some federal regulation. And we provide for the safety security and mobility of passengers and employees at the airport. A lot of people are surprised that the airport even has its own police department. We arrest people every day some people for theft some people for warrants.

With 60000 people coming through the airport everyday you're always going to have issues. Sometimes just disturbances misunderstandings and people who have no business being here. Occasional there are assaults. And there is theft. Lucky for us the whole airport is under video surveillance so we have a very high clearance rate for property crimes. And yes we do have a jail on property.

TPG: Do you get involved when a firearm is found at a security checkpoint?

CZ: Yes. It happens quite a bit several times a week. Here in Hillsboro County if you have a permit to carry a concealed weapon [CCW] more than likely you will not be arrested. More than likely we'll escort you off the airside. But if you don't have a CCW it becomes a felony and you will be arrested.

TPG: We hear a lot of stories about the rise of unruly passengers on airplanes. Do you see that reflected in the airport?

CZ: Yes it seems to be people are not as nice or they're aggravated with each other. There does seem to be an uptick in it and lot of it is related to masks.

TPG: How has your team been dealing with passengers who don't wear masks?

CZ: Wearing masks is technically not a law it's a federal mandate that we help enforce.

If you won't put on your mask and the airline or the airport tells you to leave and you don't then it becomes a crime of trespassing and that's usually when we get involved. The last thing we want to do is put people in jail over a mask so we give reminders to people to put their mask on explain the mandate and why it is important and tell them what will happen to them if they don't comply. So far we haven't had to arrest anyone for trespassing because they haven't put on the mask.

Related: Mask mandate during air travel other public transport will be extended until January

TPG: We understand that TPA has mask minders who do regular ""mask blitzes' in the airport?

CZ: For about a month now we've been sending out teams to let people know that we are enforcing the mandate. We all meet at a centralized location we all get masks to pass out and we each take a territory – baggage rental car center airside – and in teams of two or three we go around to tell people to put on their masks. They call it a ""mask blitz"" but it is more like a target enforcement action or a mask audit. We're not about mean mugging people or staring at them; we approach them and remind them to wear their mask indoors. No one really wants to be the mask police – especially the police.

TPG: From your experience as a police chief what advice can you give people who want to be better passengers?

CZ: My advice would be to read and pay attention to all the dos and don'ts from the TSA the airport and the airlines. Pay attention to where you leave your phone your computer your iPads and your other belongings at the airport. We have a lot of laptops left in restrooms. And sometimes people loading luggage into their cars at curbside leave a bag behind. Mostly understand that there's extra pressure now for everyone – including the airline staff and even the police – so be kind to your fellow traveler.

TPG: How has working in the airport changed your idea about traveling?

CZ: I allow for a lot more than time than I did before because I understand things don't always go as planned. And I've learned to be nicer to other people traveling because I've seen the other side of things. Sometimes you're traveling to a funeral or a bad event or you are going to being separated from someone for a long time. Airports are very emotional places.

TPG: If you could go anywhere in the world on vacation where would it be?

CZ: I can still remember Miss Coleman's third grade Social Studies class where she showed us a little town in Holland that had an attraction where the city was made in miniature. I can't remember right now which town that was but I'd like to go see that miniature city.

Airline employees have access to non-revenue travel meaning you'll only get a seat if there's space available. For those who like a good gamble showing up to the airport without a confirmed seat can be thrilling yet incredibly nerve-wracking.

Back in summer 2019 — also known as the golden year for air travel — I was an intern at JetBlue Airways. One of the perks was standby travel and during those 10 weeks I wanted to take full advantage of my (short-lived) benefits. Overall it was a success as I flew more than 30 times that summer with seven of those flights on the coveted JetBlue Mint business class.

During my internship I learned a lot about standby travel and the airline industry as a whole. While standby travel is certainly not for the faintest of hearts there are ways to get good at it and mitigate stress from all of the uncertainty.

How standby travel works as an airline employee

Whether you're a pilot flight attendant gate agent or even an intern you may have standby travel privileges that get you free flights on the airline you're working for and (potentially) on partner airlines. While you can travel for free within the 50 U.S. states any international taxes and fees will apply if you're flying out of the country.

While most airlines rank employees based on seniority and role JetBlue full-time and part-time employees were ranked on a priority list based on their check-in time. Occasionally JetBlue employees could get one-time priority passes and jump to the top of the standby list bypassing other employees on the ranking.

However as an intern I was on the same priority level as seasonal employees which meant that we were grouped under all full-time and part-time staff but above partner airline employees. Regardless of your place on the list all non-revenue travelers must show up at the gate and wait to be issued a ticket. If the flight was considerably empty the gate agent may go ahead and ticket you at the start of the boarding process. But if the flight only had a few seats left — or was completely full — all non-revenue passengers must wait until the end of the boarding process for standby seats to clear.

With this much uncertainty it's essential that you only travel with a carry-on or personal bag as you never know which flight you'll end up taking that day. Since I only had free time to travel on weekends this wasn't a problem as I never needed to check a bag in the first place.

All summer I made sure to travel light with nothing bigger than a carry-on bag. (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy)

Since JetBlue only offers paid upgrades to its passengers it was easy for non-revenue flyers to snag Even More Space (EMS) seats or even Mint seats on qualifying routes. Interns only had access to JetBlue-operated flights but full-time employees could fly standby on partner airlines as well widening the opportunities for international trips.

Finally in terms of dress and behavior you're supposed to blend in with the rest of the crowd while looking neat and polished. For example you're not allowed to wear flip flops or sweatpants as a non-revenue passenger.

Your standby benefits extend to immediate family

At JetBlue your standby benefits as a full-time employee extend to your immediate family (spouse dependent children and parents). Airline employees will also get buddy passes throughout the year handing them out to extended family or friends.

As an intern I could extend my travel privileges to my parents and one designated travel companion. I brought my mom with me on several trips that summer and I think she enjoyed the standby privileges as much as I did.

How to work the odds in your favor

Now that I've given a brief rundown here's how you can work standby travel in your favor. While some of it's luck there's actually more strategy involved.

First I had access to a separate website where I'd book non-revenue tickets and monitor flight loads in real time. For example my new intern friend Peter and I wanted to start easy. That means we weren't interested in flying a competitive route such as New York (JFK) to Los Angeles (LAX) from the get-go.

Instead we picked New York (JFK) to Nantucket on the first flight of the day — 7:10 a.m. We checked the flight loads the night before and since there were 60+ empty seats we knew we could hop on this flight with no issues. We were ticketed as soon as we arrived at the gate.

There's no better feeling than getting your seat confirmed when you're on standby. (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy)

A perk of standby travel that I hadn't considered before is that you have flexibility in your travel plans. We did a quick day trip in Nantucket and there were plenty of flights going back to New York that day (JFK and LGA). While we were initially intending on leaving around dinnertime we decided to hop back on the flight around 4 p.m. so we could get back to Manhattan earlier.

On my way home from San Diego I wanted to try out Mint for the first time but there were only a few seats left and a long list of standby passengers. Instead I decided to book a flight to Boston-Logan International Airport (BOS) to snag a Mint seat and then jumped on a flight from Boston to New York (LGA).

What happens when there's not a seat available

Out of the 30+ flights I took that summer I was denied boarding only once. Those are some pretty good odds especially since the summer is the busiest travel season and full of bad weather delays.

My mom and I wanted to fly to Los Angeles so we picked the first flight of the day that had about 15 seats the morning of. With other higher priority employees on the list there was only one seat left. My mom took the last seat while I hopped on standby for the next flight that left just an hour later and we finally met up at the airport.

There are several other instances where seats may fill up last minute. For example delays and cancellations can lead to rebooking on later flights during the day — so that flight with 30 seats available might be snatched up by revenue passengers. That's why it's important to monitor the flight loads religiously check the forecast and see where the aircraft is coming from or going since numbers can change last minute.

Standby travel is also a game of exercising patience as gate agents are often overworked when it comes to delays and cancellations. We were advised to never go up to the gate until boarding has finished as you'll want to stay out of the way as much as possible.

Several interns and I flew to St. Martin at the end of the summer. To ensure that we'd all get back to New York some of us took the earlier flight home while the others took the later flight. No matter how many seats are available it's always stressful not to have a confirmed ticket so splitting up helped us travel together without leaving one of us stranded.

Spontaneity is the spice of life

Thanks to JetBlue offering free in-flight Wi-Fi I could then plan the rest of my trip once I got a confirmed seat and was en route to my destination. Depending on where I was going I would only bring enough clothes for a day trip. I would look at last-minute hotels or Airbnbs on the flight.

On the ground I would spend most of my time walking spending time on the beach or exploring restaurants in the area. Standby travel is an entirely different way to travel than I've ever experienced.

Bottom line

As someone who's quite spontaneous already I loved the thrill of non-revenue travel and exploring a new destination for a fraction of the cost. However as I returned to a ""normal"" paying passenger I also enjoy the peace of mind that comes with a confirmed booking and the ability to earn points and miles and work toward elite status."

Three large US drug distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson will proceed with a proposed $26bn settlement resolving claims that they fuelled the opioid epidemic after “enough” states joined in the companies said.

The companies had until Saturday to decide whether enough states back the $21bn proposed settlement with McKesson Corp AmerisourceBergen Corp and Cardinal Health Inc and a $5bn agreement with J&J.

The distributors said on Saturday 42 states five territories and Washington DC signed on to their agreement. The exact tally for J&J’s related deal was not immediately clear.

The companies will make their first annual settlement payment into escrow on or before September 30 the distributors said. The final amount will depend on several factors including the final participation rate of states and political subdivisions they added.

North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein a lead settlement negotiator called the support level a “remarkable showing of unity and commitment across the country to address this problem”.

The settlement’s complex formula envisioned at least 44 states participating but ultimately the companies got to decide whether a “critical mass” had joined and whether to finalise the deal.

A number of states had previously said they had not fully signed on by an August 21 deadline: Alabama Georgia Nevada New Mexico Oklahoma Washington and West Virginia.

Cities and counties within participating states have through January 2 to join as well. Ultimately $10.7bn is tied to the extent localities participate.

The deal unveiled by 14 state attorneys general on July 21 is designed to resolve more than 3000 lawsuits accusing the distributors of ignoring red flags that pain pills were being diverted into communities for illicit uses and that J&J played down the risks of opioid addiction.

The money would fund treatment and other services.

The companies deny wrongdoing saying the drugs were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and that responsibility for ballooning painkiller sales lies with doctors regulators and others.

The deal is separate from a settlement resolving similar claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its wealthy Sackler family owners. A bankruptcy judge on Wednesday approved that deal which Purdue values at more than $10bn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhdGFlbHhzaS5jb20vaW5zaWdodHMvc2FtZC10aGUtbmV4dC1yZXZvbHV0aW9uLWluLWhlYWx0aGNhcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SaMD – The Next Revolution in Healthcare,"The digital revolution can be seen across almost every industry including healthcare and ‘Software’ is playing a crucial role facilitating the same as it has changed almost every aspect of healthcare whether it's patient and provider interaction personalized healthcare medical device functioning or pharmaceutical discoveries.

One of the revolutionary developments in the medical devices industry that is significantly contributing to the digital transformation of healthcare is Software as a Medical Device (SaMD).

The SaMD market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21.9% from 2020 to 2027. It has seen rapid growth in recent years. SaMD aids in the prediction monitoring and diagnosis of a disease allowing medical professionals to take preventive actions at the correct time. As it does not involve any hardware it can employ fast feedback loops for improvements. In addition to this the growth in technologies such as AI/ML IoT Telehealth Cybersecurity AR and VR has further boosted the growth of SaMD.

SaMD Categorization

In 2014 IMDRF gave the possible framework for risk categorization of SaMD. It considered two factors for classification; the significance of information given by SaMD for making healthcare decisions. The second factor is related to healthcare conditions such as critical serious and non-serious.

Based on the intersection of these two factors IMDRF divides the risk assessment into four different categories based on the impact on the patient or public health. The categories are ranked in order of relative importance. Category-IV has the most significant impact whereas Category-I has the least.

Technologies used in SaMD

SaMD uses different technologies that can assist in monitoring patient health detecting and diagnosing the disease as well as connecting doctors and patients thus offering health solutions that are cheaper faster and more effective.

AI/ML – To improve patient care AI/ML-based SaMD services aim to improve diagnosis accuracy therapy effectiveness care decision making and monitoring efficiencies. FDA approved 64 AI/ML-based software and medical devices in Radiology Cardiology and Internal Medicine/General Practice.

AR and VR – The various applications of mixed reality in healthcare will enable the interaction of the digital with the physical environment in a multi-dimensional way that will help prevent manage and cure a wide array of ailments. Although several challenges lie ahead for the large-scale adoption of AR technologies in healthcare nevertheless new approaches will continue to emerge to overcome these obstacles. According to a Harvard Business Review study VR-trained surgeons exhibited a 230% improvement in total performance compared to traditional-trained surgeons.

How are Different Players Utilizing SaMD in Healthcare?

Since its inception SaMD has been used in multiple ways through different technologies and is assisting medical professionals to deliver patient-centric treatments. Apart from medical device companies the quick adoption of SaMD can be seen in pharmaceutical companies start-ups and big tech giants. Discussed below are some of the SaMD applications in various industries and organizations:

1. Medical Device Companies:

It's difficult to discuss the medical device industry without acknowledging software's enormous contribution to medical innovation. Some of the key applications where medical device companies are using ‘SaMD’ are

Decision support system – Clinical Decision Support (CDS) is an area where AI can help clinicians collect analyze and infer from a large number of patients' data to make the best clinical decision. For e.g. Fujifilm partnered with Hera-MI a French start-up to create AI solutions to provide comprehensive analysis and decision support to clinicians and hospital staff. AI will detect difficult anomalies and aid radiologists by reducing their time spent on cases considered not problematic.

AI will detect difficult anomalies and aid radiologists by reducing their time spent on cases considered not problematic. Patient treatment lifecycle management – Patients can use SaMD to track their health activities and vital parameters in real-time communicate with health professions and request medical assistance if necessary. SaMD technologies aid physicians in generating personalized treatment plans for patients with chronic conditions based on data generated by the software. An example of this is Zimmer Biomet a leader in musculoskeletal surgery introduced the ZBEdgeTM Connected Intelligence Suite of Integrated Robotics and Digital Health Technologies. The Orthointel Orthopedic Intelligence Platform collects pre intra and post-operative data and gives insights to clinicians which in turn optimize patient care.

2. Pharmaceutical Companies:

SaMD is completely reimagining the way the pharmaceutical industry is operating. It is helping Pharma companies in engaging patients across their medication lifecycle. Here are a few trends in pharma where the applications of SaMD are being employed:

Preventive Care – The companies have demonstrated that digitally tracking a patient's condition using the technology can improve medication adherence and disease control while lowering hospital and emergency room visits. An example of this is Propeller Health a digital health company that has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. FDA for its connected platform developed in partnership with AstraZeneca to help improve the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Propeller sensors attach to patients' existing inhalers and send data on medication use to the Propeller app on their smartphones. The patients can then share the information with their clinician to formulate a personalized treatment plan.

Propeller sensors attach to patients' existing inhalers and send data on medication use to the Propeller app on their smartphones. The patients can then share the information with their clinician to formulate a personalized treatment plan. Precision Medicine – It is a valuable and effective tool for disease diagnosis and patient pre-care. The software will examine the patient's personal and genetic information and circumstances to diagnose and treat the disease. Pharma companies utilize this information for tailoring the treatment to patients' needs. For e.g. Javelin Biotech in collaboration with Pfizer aims to develop an industry-leading Organ-on-a-Chip” predictive pharmacokinetics platform It has the potential to be a market-leading platform for evaluating small molecule ADME (absorption distribution metabolism and excretion) properties. The ADME platform will combine a micro physiological system (MPS) also known as an ""organ-on-a-chip"" with interactive computational software to assist in informing human pharmacokinetic (PK) predictions.

Pharma digital ecosystems for treatment adherence – Using SaMD pharma companies are trying to completely engage patients by supporting them in all the possible aspects of care delivery. Software mitigates the challenges faced in medication adherence and provides a solution for personalized drug therapy management digital patient involvement and tele-pharmacy. Cardinal Health launched OutcomesTM a digital pharma ecosystem that connects pharmacists payers and pharmaceutical firms to tackle the medication non-adherence challenge. Outcomes' expanded connect platform which builds on its existing software offers an open architectural marketplace approach to delivering solutions to pharmacies quickly effectively and efficiently. Its digital ecosystem already serves a network of 23 million patients and 60000+ pharmacy locations across the country streamlining pharmacy procedures and improving patient interaction.

3. Tech Giants:

According to the McKinsey report the worldwide market for digital health was estimated to be worth $350 billion in 2019. Further markets for technologies used for SaMD such as precision medicine digital diagnostics telehealth etc. are predicted to rise at least 8% each year. No wonder that tech conglomerates are investing billions in research and acquisitions in the field of SaMD. Examples below discuss how eagerly tech giants are stepping into healthcare to bring advanced medical solutions with SaMD:

Apple has gained success by vertically integrating its experience and product. It appears that it is taking a similar approach to healthcare by connecting various components of the user experience such as the device health record platform and potentially telemedicine services. Apple has bolstered its overall software portfolio with several recent artificial intelligence acquisitions including Silk Labs. Apple’s ResearchKit and CareKit Software Developer Kits (SDKs) provide templates for easily creating an application an essential step in Apple's transition to a healthcare platform.

Google being specialized in technological development is also continuously making its way to attract healthcare stakeholders. A dermatology tool powered by artificial intelligence was demonstrated by Google Health researchers. Using a simple phone camera the program assists users in identifying dermatologic problems. Another significant innovation is AI algorithms that can detect ever-smaller lung tumors. Etemadi's technology which is a collaboration between Google Northwestern University and other institutions is one of several that are moving towards clinical adoption.

4. Start-Ups:

According to one report trends in healthcare start-ups are majorly towards clinical intelligence and enablement screening and diagnostics virtual care delivery and disease management and therapeutics. SaMD plays a significant role in all of these domains.

SaMD Life-Cycle

SaMD is frequently used as part of a clinical workflow sequence to improve diagnosis treatment and patient management. Regulations and protocols have had to keep up with the kind of development procedures medical devices require due to the emergence of Software as a Medical Device.

The necessary recommendations for designing a SaMD can be found in AAMI TIR45 a Technical Information Report (TIR) from the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). It explains the agile manifesto many techniques (such as Definition of Done) their implementation and tailoring to reference models such as IEC 62304 and ‘FDA CFR Title 21 Part 820.30'.

However problems with the design and/or implementation of SaMD into a workflow might cause users to make wrong choices/decisions and delays in making decisions can have negative repercussions for patients. All organizations need to look at the two aspects of the software lifecycle:

1. Quality management – To ensure quality organizations must follow ISO 13485:2016 which outlines the parameters for a quality management system that demonstrates an organization's ability to consistently offer medical devices and related services that comply with many region-specific and global regulatory standards.

– To ensure quality organizations must follow ISO 13485:2016 which outlines the parameters for a quality management system that demonstrates an organization's ability to consistently offer medical devices and related services that comply with many region-specific and global regulatory standards. 2. Risk management – Medical device manufacturers must identify potential risks associated with the devices. Estimate evaluate and control those risks and assess the effectiveness of the controls. For risk management they need to follow ISO 14971:2019 which applies to all SaMD life cycle phases.

Risk assessment and quality management of a SaMD are not only performed during the development phase but also need to be observed in the post-production and post-deployment stages. According to the real-world feedback on software performance there can be a modification and up-gradation which may create more risks; hence post-production liability must be treated with the utmost attention.

Parting Thoughts

The future of SaMD is promising not only for patients and practitioners but also for society. Moving ahead some of the most valuable technologies in the healthcare industry will not be new gadgets or large equipment but rather companion software that gathers crucial patient data to generate actionable insights to be used to create personalized healthcare plans.

In the healthcare software sector a long-term vision towards evolving patient care agility and flexibility is required to respond to frequent changes in consumer expectations and business requirements. Healthcare organizations need to take a very holistic and structured approach towards the SaMD lifecycle management process that leads to creating solutions that deliver maximum value in terms of patient outcomes within the digital healthcare ecosystem.

An announcement from the three largest U.S. drug distribution companies and a confirmation from drugmaker Johnson & Johnson which had previously announced that it would move ahead came Saturday. That was the deadline for the companies to decide whether there was enough buy-in to continue the settlement plan.

The distribution companies — AmerisourceBergen Cardinal Health and McKesson — said that 42 states had agreed to join. Johnson & Johnson did not immediately say how many states agreed to its part of the settlement.

Together the settlements are likely to represent the biggest piece between companies in the drug industry and state and local governments over the addiction and overdose epidemic in the U.S. Prescription opioids such as OxyContin and Vicodin and illicit ones such as heroin and illegally made fentanyl have been linked to more than 500000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000.

Under the $26 billion settlement which was initially announced in June states were given a month to decide whether to join. Then it would be up to the companies to decide whether it was enough to keep going.

The next step is trying to get local governments to sign on to the deal and agree not to continue their lawsuits. This phase is to last until Jan. 2. After that the companies will again decide whether enough have joined to implement the deal.

Saturday's milestone came days after a judge gave initial approval to a settlement worked out in bankruptcy court between OxyContin maker and some 3000 plaintiffs. That deal could be worth $10 billion over time.

In all the cases governments have agreed to put most of their shares toward drug treatment and education programs and other measures to fight the epidemic.

This year there have been three trials on governments' claims over opioids though none have reached a verdict. More similar trials are queued up for this year and next.",,,

As a fully vaccinated 25-year-old I boarded the Carnival Vista on July 3 with a sense of confidence.

At the time it felt as if a window of hope had opened. With more Americans getting vaccinated some were leaving masks at home summer flings were in full swing and people were booking the vacations they'd spent a year and a half dreaming about.

I had few qualms joining hundreds of vaccinated passengers on the ship — Carnival's first to leave the US since the coronavirus pandemic began — to cover the return of cruises. As the ship sailed from Galveston Texas to Belize Honduras and Mexico I happily spent eight days eating at the buffet doing yoga and sightseeing.

But since getting back on land with the Delta virus variant surging in the US I wouldn't board a cruise today with the same confidence I had two months ago.

In August The Washington Post reported that the same ship I went on had 27 breakthrough cases of fully vaccinated people getting COVID-19. While most had mild or no symptoms one passenger later died The New York Times reported.

The Times noted that the cruise line described it as unlikely that the 77-year-old passenger who died contracted the virus on the ship but as more breakthrough cases happen aboard the massive vessels travelers — like me — are reconsidering the appeal of what felt like for a short window of time a carefree vacation.

Health experts told Insider it's up to individuals to weigh the risks of cruising right now against how much they value the experience while others who spoke with CNBC have urged travelers to avoid cruises and warned that they can be ""a recipe for transmission.""

Cruises may be tightening COVID protocols but they're still risky

On the Carnival Vista I saw few signs of the pandemic. At the time of my trip Carnival required 95% of passengers to be fully vaccinated the majority of people were maskless crowds of sweaty people danced together every night and people eagerly lined up at the self-serve buffet.

But today that feeling of normality has vanished.

As the highly infectious Delta variant spreads Carnival and other cruise companies have tightened COVID-19 protocols. All passengers on the same ship now wear masks indoors and get tested regardless of their vaccination status. When I boarded Carnival required only unvaccinated passengers to wear masks — though I couldn't tell whether this was enforced — and show a negative COVID-19 test result on boarding.

As of Monday 35 ships that were operating or would be operating in the US had suspected or confirmed positive COVID-19 cases according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Health experts say cases are to be expected.

""If you're on a major cruise ship with thousands of people it's inevitable that there's going to be a case"" Amesh Adalja a pandemic-preparedness expert at Johns Hopkins University told Insider. ""Especially if there are any unvaccinated individuals on board.""

Deciding whether cruising is a smart choice falls on individual travelers and their risk assessment Adalja said.

For Leana Wen an emergency physician and public-health professor at George Washington University the decision of whether vaccinated travelers should cruise comes down to personal medical circumstances and how much they value the experience.

""The Delta variant does change the risk calculus but that's not saying that people shouldn't do the things that they enjoy"" Wen told Insider.

Wen said it's important to remember that no activity — whether a Target run or an eight-day Caribbean cruise — was risk-free.

In an ideal world Wen said cruises would have 100% vaccinated populations and require prior testing.

Speaking with CNBC Luis Ostrosky a division chief for infectious diseases at UT Health part of the University of Texas at Houston suggested tighter restrictions.

Noting that any sort of travel including cruising was highly risky Ostrosky said a safe cruise would require two-week quarantines and negative COVID tests 24 to 48 hours before boarding and negative tests after stepping onto the ship.

I won't be cruising anytime soon

Despite being vaccinated I fear spreading the virus and don't want the hassle of quarantining should I test positive.

Cruises also aren't my ideal way to travel. The Carnival Vista dropped me off at three destinations I'd never visited but I'm not sure I can check Belize Honduras or Cozumel off my bucket list after spending just a few hours at each port.

Still thousands of cruise fans value the experience and plan to sail this year.

Chris Gray Faust the managing editor of the review site Cruise Critic told Insider she'd heard from readers who described positive experiences.

""The cruisers who are traveling right now are very excited to be back on board"" Gray Faust said. ""They have accepted the different safety requirements and protocols put out by the cruise lines and are enjoying the experience.""

For others like Linda and Gene Andrus cruising isn't worth the risk.

The Texas couple said they had a Carnival cruise planned for October 16 but as the date approached Linda Andrus told Insider the couple decided to reschedule it for 2022. They said they considered their age (both are in their 70s) the vaccination rates on ships and the protocols put in place by Carnival and decided to give the cruise — which would have been Linda's 12th and Gene's 11th — a miss.

At least anecdotally the Andruses aren't alone. An August survey from Cruise Critic of 2965 of its readers found that roughly a third wanted to wait to see what happened with the Delta variant before boarding a ship and separately would prefer waiting to go on a cruise until cases were lower in the US.

For me the risks outweigh the benefits

Cruising has always had its risks. The CDC says cruises are ""often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases.""

The design of cruises — from buffets to singles mixers to tight enclosed casinos — is conducive to viruses spreading which makes them a riskier form of travel compared with trains planes or cars Adalja and Wen said. But both added that it seemed as if cruise lines had demonstrated an ability to control outbreaks.

""As long as cruise ships are not contributing to superspreader events that are leading to huge spikes in COVID cases then it should be an individual choice on whether that risk is worth it to them"" Wen said.

For me the buffets and cruise karaoke sessions just don't make the cut.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5L3N0YXRlbi1pc2xhbmQtbWFsbC1jYXJuaXZhbC1yZXR1cm5zLWZvci1sYWJvci1kYXktd2Vla2VuZC5odG1s0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2lsaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDkvc3RhdGVuLWlzbGFuZC1tYWxsLWNhcm5pdmFsLXJldHVybnMtZm9yLWxhYm9yLWRheS13ZWVrZW5kLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Staten Island Mall Carnival returns for Labor Day Weekend,"STATEN ISLAND N.Y. -- The Staten Island Mall Carnival returned just in time for Labor Day as a way for children to enjoy the remaining days of summer.

On Saturday children of all ages could be seen enjoying rides carnival food and a variety of games.

Tom Burton the carnival’s coordinator said the carnival returned after a hiatus due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the spring.

And everyone wanted to do it again.

“Right after the hurricane not many people knew we were opened from Wednesday so [Friday] was the first day for it” said Burton.

The Staten Island Mall Carnival is back for Labor Day Weekend through Sunday Sept. 12.

Due to COVID-19 instead of giving carnival-goers paper tickets they can now get digital tickets where credits are uploaded to a card.

When children are ready to go on a ride the person standing guard at the ride will scan the card so there is no physical contact.

The Staten Island Mall Carnival is back for Labor Day Weekend through Sunday Sept. 12.

The carnival has brought back many of popular rides including the Tilt-a-Whirl LeapFrog Carousel Ferris Wheel and The Scooter while introducing a brand new ride -- The Ring of Fire.

The Ring of Fire is a 60-foot tall rollercoaster that goes around in a circle.

On Friday The Pizza Parlor held a pizza pie-eating contest.

The event also features s food court-style area offering Columbian Latin and Italian foods in addition to the usual carnival eats.

The Staten Island Mall Carnival is back for Labor Day Weekend through Sunday Sept. 12.

The carnival will run every day until Sunday Sept. 12 with weekday hours of 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. and weekends -- Labor Day included -- noon until 10 p.m. Admission is $5 but does not cover the cost of rides or food. Additional information on passes can be obtained at simallcarnival.com and at the Amusements of America Staten Island Carnival page.

On Tuesday Sept. 7 there is free admission from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. for customer appreciation day.

But is it all going to plan for the cruise lines in resuming operations?

Cruise News Update

So is it all going to plan as cruise lines continue to move forward on resuming cruise operations? Well for Carnival Cruise Line it doesn’t seem to be so smooth. We’ve got updates on the next batch of Carnival ships that are restarting protocol changes from Carnival and Disney Cruise Line.

And even P&O Cruises planning to have two ships in the Caribbean before the end of the year along with a big day for Royal Caribbean’s Oasis of the Seas which is restarting operations. Plenty to get through.

Five Carnival Ships to Restart Through November and December

So let’s start with the big news from the week with Carnival Cruise Line announcing which ships will be resuming operations through November and December. It’s not all gone to plan as just five Carnival ships will return through the two months. The fleet won’t be fully back in action before the end of the year which was the first hope.

Carnival Valor will follow Carnival Glory in New Orleans with four- and five-night sailings starting on Nov. 1;

Carnival Legend will restart Nov. 14 out of Baltimore replacing Carnival Pride which restarts guest operations from Baltimore Sept. 12 and then moves its homeport to Tampa following a Panama Canal repositioning cruise;

Carnival Radiance will have a new maiden voyage date of Dec. 13 out of Long Beach (rescheduled from Nov. 5 due to a revised dry dock transformation plan);

Carnival Pride’s new service from Tampa is scheduled to start on Nov. 14;

Carnival Conquest’s restart from Miami on Oct. 8 has been rescheduled to Dec. 13;

Carnival Sensation’s Oct. 21 restart from Mobile has been moved to Jan. 2022

Five vessels in total will return in 2022 including Carnival Liberty out of Port Canaveral Carnival Sunshine from Charleston Carnival Paradise from Tampa Carnival Ecstasy out of Jacksonville and Carnival Sensation out of Mobile. That does mean further cancellations as those ships remain on hold longer than expected.

Carnival Splendor and Carnival Spirit based out of Australia are to remain on hold through December 16 as the cruise line continues to work with the government on a safe return down under.

Carnival Cruise Line also provides an update on its protocols to align more with recent updates by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and new rapid testing sites at all of its homeports.

The cruise line will continue to follow CDC guidelines to make sure guests and crew remain safe. Guests will have to present proof of vaccination and a negative test at check-in something which is already in place for current departures.

However Carnival plans to make it easier by setting up mobile pre-cruise rapid testing sites at all of its homeports. The full details are still to come but this will make it easier for those struggling to get tested before their cruise.

On August 29 2021 the CDC updated its Conditional Sailing Order including adjustments to testing which now needs to be completed within two days before sailing rather than the previous three days. Carnival now says “Effective with sailings as of September 13 2021 the CDC requires pre-cruise testing for vaccinated guests to be taken within two days prior to the sailing date. If the sailing is on Saturday the test may be taken on Thursday and Friday and as late as Saturday if you are guaranteed to receive your results in time for check-in.”

Two P&O Cruise Ships to Sail the Caribbean

P&O Cruises plans to have two ships sailing the Caribbean before the end of the year. The cruise line has experienced a hugely successful summer return with the launch of its newest flagship Iona and its popular summer seacations onboard Britannia. The cruise line is ready to expand its cruises and has chosen to do this in the Caribbean with Britannia and Azura.

Britannia will set off on her transatlantic voyage from Southampton in southern England on October 22. The vessel will take 14 days to sail to the Southern Caribbean island of Barbados before she starts the first of a series of 14-day cruises in the Caribbean.

Azura will be the second ship sailing the Caribbean for the UK-based cruise line. Starting December 10 the cruise ship will also be sailing from Barbados on 14-day itineraries that include ports of call such as Trinidad and Tobago Aruba Bonaire Dominica and Martinique.

P&O Cruises are not yet sailing with the entire fleet and will not do so this year. Aurora is currently scheduled to return in February of next year and Arcadia is scheduled to return to sailing in March of next year.

Plenty to look forward to and this will be the first chance British cruisers will be able to enjoy a cruise in the Caribbean since the suspension started in 2020.

Disney Wonder Restart Announced

Disney Cruise Line has announced the restart date for Disney Wonder and an update to its protocols. The ship will start operations on October 1 on an itinerary that will feature three-night sailings from San Diego with a stop at Ensenada Mexico and a day at sea while 4-night sailings will feature two days at sea and a stop at Cabo San Lucas Mexico.

Disney Cruise Line has returned to the U.S. with Disney Dream’s 3- and 4-night itineraries out of Florida. Disney Fantasy will resume on September 11. The cruise line will only be visiting Castaway Cay for the time being with both ships.

However the recent policy changes from the Bahamian government mean that the cruise line had to require all guests to be vaccinated on cruises to the Bahamas just like other cruise lines. It’s also due to updated guidelines issued on August 27 2021 from the U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

For cruises departing from San Diego in October Disney Cruise Line now requires all guests of 12 years and older to be fully vaccinated 14 days before boarding. Guests 11 years old and younger do not have to be vaccinated but should provide proof of a negative test. On November 5 Disney Wonder will depart for a 14-day voyage that will take guests through the Panama Canal to Galveston from San Diego. Disney has made some significant changes for this voyage requiring all guests of all ages to be fully vaccinated.

One more health policy change for guests onboard for cruises to the Bahamas between September 3 and November 1. The Bahamas requires all cruise ship passengers to be fully vaccinated or provide a negative PCR test if 11 years or younger. To comply Disney Cruise Line has now said that all guests 12 years and older should be fully vaccinated with an approved vaccine.

On and after September 13 all guests of all ages whether vaccinated or not are required to take a test administered at the terminal before embarkation.

With so many changes depending on where ships are departing from do make sure you check the cruise line site for all the details before your cruise so you don’t miss any adjustments.

Carnival Announces Cruise Directors

The Miami-based cruise line has announced which cruise directors will be on which cruise ship as more ships make a return to service through the fall season. So here is the list of cruise directors on the coming ships restarting operations:

Carnival Glory restarting on September 12 from New Orleans: Leon Smith

Carnival Valor restarting on November 1 from New Orleans: Marty Pitts

Carnival Pride restarting on September 12 from Baltimore: Frankie Portera

Carnival Legend restarting November 14 from Baltimore: Leigh Xuereb

Carnival Dream restarting on September 19 from Galveston: Deon Williams

Carnival Freedom restarting on October 9 from Miami: TJ Partida

Carnival Elation restarting on October 11 from Port Canaveral: Paully Munhollon

Carnival Cruise Line has already announced the cruise directors for the eight ships currently back in service and you can check that all out over on cruisehive.com.

Oasis of the Seas Restarting Operations

Royal Caribbean’s Oasis of the Seas is finally restarting cruise operations and will be the first to do so out of the Cape Liberty Cruise Port in Bayonne New Jersey. So the cruise ship is departing on September 5 on a seven-night Bahamas sailing including calls at Port Canaveral Florida; the cruise line’s private island of Perfect Day at CocoCay Bahamas; and Nassau also in the Bahamas. The ship will arrive back in New Jersey on September 12.

Oasis of the Seas will continue to sail seven-night Bahamas cruises and will also begin seven-night Eastern and Western Caribbean cruises from Miami in November 2021. Including Oasis of the Seas 14 Royal Caribbean ships have restarted operations which is more than half the fleet. Liberty fo the Seas will be next with cruises from Galveston Texas starting on October 3.

Carnival Glory Cruise Cancelled

With Hurricane Ida having a huge impact on New Orleans Carnival Cruise Line has canceled Carnival Glory’s September 5th departure. The main reason was at the time the city was still under emergency management and the channel leading towards the cruise terminal remained closed.

Carnival Glory’s first return cruise from New Orleans was scheduled to depart on September 5 on a seven-day voyage including calls at Bimini Freeport and Nassau all in the Bahamas. The ship will now restart from the Port of New Orleans on Sunday September 12.

Carnival is allowing impacted guests to transfer to the Carnival Vista sailing departing the Port of Galveston in Texas on Saturday September 4 2021. Guests will have to be fully vaccinated to be allowed to transfer. Unfortunately those under the vaccine exemption won’t be allowed to transfer their booking to the Carnival Vista but are being asked to contact Carnival about their options.

Since the cancellation was first announced the Carnival Glory has already returned to the port and is currently making preparations for its restart on September 12. That cruise will be a seven-day Western Caribbean itinerary with stops at Mahogany Bay Belize and Cozumel along with three sea days. The Conquest-class vessel will become the ninth ship in the fleet to resume operations and the first out of New Orleans since suspensions first began in March 2020.

Carnival midway back in business,"Hey there time traveller!

This article was published 03/09/2021 (979 days ago) so information in it may no longer be current.

After nearly two years the show is — finally — going on.

Wonder Shows a made-in-Manitoba travelling carnival is wrapping up its six-week stay at the Victoria Inn Hotel and Convention Centre on Monday. The Family Fun Summer Fair has been the company’s first event since 2019 owing to the coronavirus pandemic.

“I definitely am feeling hopeful for next year that things will be back to normal” owner Ken Kiernicki says. “It’s been a struggle.”

RUTH BONNEVILLE / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Wonder Shows manager Ken Kiernicki with the Big Wheel behind him at the Wonder Show grounds in Victoria Inn parking lot 1808 Wellington Ave.

Kiernicki 57 has been working in the business since he was 12 years old. He’s had a hand in every aspect of the midway from running rides to operating food trucks to managing carnival games. In 2000 he purchased Wonder Shows from Henry Saluk who founded the company in 1963.

During an average summer season the carnival pops up at roughly 23 major fairs and festivals around Manitoba such as the Icelandic Festival of Manitoba in Gimli and the Morden Corn and Apple Festival. The last 18 months have been wholly devoid of carnival fun — the ferris wheel has gone unspun the apples uncandied and the moles unwhacked.

“It’s been very stressful with no income but we did keep a few guys in the shop and we were constantly working… maintaining the equipment and getting ready for when we got the word to come out” ​​says Kiernicki who employs between 40 and 50 people with some seasonal workers coming from foreign countries such as Jamaica.

Like many service industries Wonder Shows has had a hard time finding enough staff to replace workers who moved on to other jobs amid the pandemic.

There are about 30 rides games and food stands currently set up in the parking lot of the Victoria Inn at 1808 Wellington Ave. It’s a relief to see people enjoying the midway again.

“The response is very good” Kiernicki says. “People were sure looking forward to this kind of entertainment.”

Weather permitting the Family Fun Summer Fair runs Saturday through Monday from noon to 10 p.m. Wristbands are $25 each. Proof of vaccination is not required to enter hand-sanitizer stations are set up throughout the grounds and rides are sanitized at regular intervals.

Wonder Shows will also be running rides at this year’s Boo at the Zoo event at Assiniboine Park Zoo in October. Visit wondershows.com to learn more.

With two superpowers — the US and China — flexing their military muscles in the disputed South China Sea (SCS) this could very well turn into a conventional war – an outcome the world dreads.

The region has three major conflict zones in the same contiguous geography – the Korean Peninsula the Taiwan Strait and SCS. Each of these has China as a party to the dispute and the US in the opposing camp where any minor clash on any one of the issues could possibly ignite the other two.

However it would be prudent to take an overview of how the countries fare against one another and which has an edge over the other for an informed opinion on the issue.

China’s ‘Home Advantage’

Experts say China holds the ‘home advantage’ in the South China Sea where physical control over some of the islands in addition to artificial features in the Spratlys and Senkaku (or Diaoyu in Chinese) allows it to defend them more successfully. Moreover being close to the mainland allows better logistics flow that would support a long war.

Second China’s ‘Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)’ doctrine has influenced the development of ultra-long-range weapons systems that knocks out enemy platforms from afar and prevents close combat.

Based on the concept of “not allowing the enemy to come close to the mainland” China has developed missiles that outrange any of the US weapons in that class.

The YJ-18 and YJ-12 supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles (range 540 km) and the PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missile (300 km) outrange the US’ subsonic 240-km range Harpoons and the 161-km AIM 190D.

The YJ-18 is carried on Type 052 and Type 055 guided-missile destroyers while US Navy’s Ticonderoga-class cruisers and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers carry the Harpoons and the surface-to-air SM-6s the latter that can reach between 230 and 250 km.

The PL-15 combined with the J-20 experts believe would be used in ‘sniping mode’ where the aircraft will slip past fighter screens using a combination of stealth and jamming and knock out enemy airborne early warning transport and air-to-air refueling aircraft. This degrades the logistical and surveillance capability of the adversary instead of facing off its main fighting forces head-on.

US Carriers Could Be Sitting Ducks

Their pride and joy the DF-21D missile (range 1500 km) that threaten US aircraft carriers operate on a similar philosophy. Called the ‘carrier killer’ the missile is totally unconventional where it follows a ballistic trajectory like a strategic nuclear missile leaves the atmosphere and re-enters it to release a re-entry vehicle that propels down to hit an aircraft carrier.

The anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM) is the first (and probably the only one) of its class. The unorthodox system and doctrine had left the US Navy at a complete loss.

“We are at a disadvantage with regard to China today in the sense that China has ground-based ballistic missiles that threaten our basing in the Western Pacific and our ships” former US Pacific Command (PACOM now INDOPACOM) commander Admiral Harry Harris said in testimony before the US Senate Armed Services Committee in March 2018.

Check out how the YJ-18 anti-ship cruise missile is launched from Type 052D destroyer Nanjing of the PLA Eastern Theater Command. pic.twitter.com/nhpxS4sA0G — People's Daily China (@PDChina) February 21 2020

Harris also admitted that the US has “no equivalent” to missiles like the 4000 km range DF-26 ballistic missile that can strike US bases at Guam. US bases in South Korea and Japan are meanwhile threatened by the 1500 km range CJ-10 land-attack cruise missile according to Pentagon estimates.

While experts believe the DF-21D to be unsuccessful without well-networked surveillance and targeting infrastructure China is well on its way to develop that too.

Former US Marine Corps Officer Robert Haddick and visiting Senior Fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies tells Reuters that it is a “very big gap” adding “China’s anti-ship missile capability exceeds those of the United States in terms of range speed and sensor performance.”

Does The US Have Capacity Advantage?

While the US does exceed in capacity since the Arleigh Burke and Ticonderoga carry 96 and 122 Vertical Launch Silos (VLS) cells as against the Type 052 and Type 55’s 64 and 112 VLS.

This leaves the ‘capacity’ advantage redundant since the Chinese side can fire first from a distance that is outside the range of US ships.

“The range disadvantage ends up being decisive. The US does not get a chance to exploit its capacity advantage. What could US ships be launching in response? At the ranges we are talking about nothing” former USN officer Bryan Clark currently with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments told Business Insider.

Third experts also warn against merely increasing US force presence in the Western Pacific without securing basing rights with countries to host them. Without bases the US would have poor aircraft sortie generation rates bigger naval ship repair timelines and slower troop redeployments.

For instance the Philippines has decided to terminate the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the US which envisaged US forces based on islands controlled by Manila in Scarborough Shoal. This makes the South China Sea (SCS) even farther away for the US military which would have to travel all the way from Japan. Japan itself is seeing Okinawans protesting the US military base there demanding American forces vacate the island.

Finally Pentagon-commissioned war games by the Rand Corporation have repeatedly ended in devastating defeats for the ‘Blue Team’ (US forces). According to former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defence David Ochmanek China can just swarm US and Taiwanese forces with thousands of ships fishing craft barges aircraft and missiles to overwhelm USN submarines Harpoons and Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRSAM).

“We are playing an away game against China. For years the Blue Team has been in shock because they didn’t realize how badly off they were in a confrontation with China.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMDQvaG93LWFtYXpvbi1pcy1zaGlwcGluZy1mb3ItdGhpcmQtcGFydGllcy10by1jb21wZXRlLXdpdGgtZmVkZXgtYW5kLXVwcy5odG1s0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjEvMDkvMDQvaG93LWFtYXpvbi1pcy1zaGlwcGluZy1mb3ItdGhpcmQtcGFydGllcy10by1jb21wZXRlLXdpdGgtZmVkZXgtYW5kLXVwcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon is now shipping cargo for outside customers in its latest move to compete with FedEx and UPS,"Amazon is on a spending spree to grow its shipping business and isn't content with only delivering products purchased on its own site. The company is now moving cargo for outside customers in its latest move to compete directly with FedEx and UPS .

""They want to be a new kind of U.S. Postal Service where everything can get everywhere but also quickly"" said e-commerce consultant Chris McCabe who was a seller performance investigator at Amazon from 2006 to 2012.

Amazon said in its first-quarter earnings report that capital expenditures were up a whopping 80% from a year earlier helping it increase capacity of its in-house logistics network by 50% year over year. According to SJ Consulting Group Amazon is now shipping 72% of its own packages up from 46.6% in 2019.

In 2014 Amazon started building its global transportation network from scratch. Seven years and 10 billion deliveries later Amazon now has 400000 drivers worldwide 40000 semi-trucks 30000 vans and a fleet of more than 70 planes. Perhaps the biggest investment so far is the new $1.5 billion Amazon Air hub that opened in Kentucky in August.

For outside merchants Amazon already offers a variety of shipping services. In the U.K. Amazon has a ""logistics as a service"" program — a business model that researchers from DePaul University predict Amazon will launch in the U.S. in the next 18 months while Morgan Stanley predicted it could happen this year. According to one investigation Amazon has already begun quietly transporting cargo on its planes for the U.S. Postal Service although analysts say it won't try to replicate the vast array of services offered by FedEx and UPS.

""They're not going to be just this blanket carrier that will deliver whatever package that you want them to to whatever address"" said Dan Romanoff who researches Amazon for Morningstar. ""Amazon is sort of cherry-picking their routes. They want to run and sort the parcel sizes they want to deliver.""

Amazon's algorithms also allow sellers to take advantage of LTL (less than load) truck space at discounted rates while allowing Amazon to make money on otherwise wasted space. Amazon seller Keith Gregory just started using the program called Amazon Freight. Gregory's vitamin and supplement company Highland Laboratories is based in a 3500-person town in Oregon and does about $4 million of annual sales on Amazon. Gregory says Amazon charges up to $1700 less than FedEx or UPS for some of his routes from Oregon to Southern California.

""For us being in a rural community the fact that somebody is willing to cater to us and they're willing to accommodate pick-up schedules and not just say 'Okay we'll be there every day at 3:30' is also very attractive too. So not just not just the rate piece but the fact that they're also willing to use their vast fleet of vehicles to help us with our logistics as well which UPS and FedEx are not cooperative in that sense"" Gregory said.

Amazon also offers its Fulfilled By Amazon or FBA services for orders not made on Amazon.com which explains why some orders from eBay Walmart and others arrive at your door in Amazon packaging.

""There were points in time in our company's existence where really Amazon shipped 100% of our orders for all channels"" said Amazon seller Bernie Thompson who uses what Amazon calls multi-channel fulfillment for many of the consumer electronics sold by his company Plugable Technologies.

""If you go today and buy a Plugable product on eBay it's actually going to be coming from an Amazon warehouse and very often delivered by an Amazon delivery service"" Thompson said.

Former Amazon product safety manager Rachel Greer says the current shipping expansion is reminiscent of other times Amazon has used immense resources and data to disrupt an industry such as with Prime Video and Amazon Web Services.

""I was part of the process for making sure that FBA sellers were compliant more than a decade ago. And they were like 'Well we have excess capacity. Let's use it'"" Greer said. ""And then when AWS started we had excess capacity. Let's use it. So of course if Amazon develops a platform it works well and of course if it's going to have excess capacity they're going to try to sell it to someone.""

Wider in scope than PAL’s rehabilitation program filed in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis the plea is a key piece in a sprawling restructuring plan that requires sizeable fleet cutbacks debt forgiveness and billions of pesos in fresh capital.

“We are grateful to our lenders aviation partners and other creditors for supporting the plan which empowers PAL to overcome the unprecedented impact of the global pandemic that has significantly disrupted businesses in all sectors especially aviation and emerge stronger for the long term” Tan said in a statement on Saturday.

A parallel filing would also be made in the Philippines under the Financial Insolvency and Rehabilitation Act of 2010 PAL said.

PAL will also return 21 planes that were no longer needed for its revised long-term business plan.

It was unclear whether the fleet reduction representing over 20 percent of PAL’s 95 aircraft would lead to further job cuts.

The carrier removed 2300 jobs or 30 percent of its workforce last March joining other airlines that reduced manpower to lower costs given the pandemic-induced slowdown.

Chance for ‘reset’

Aviation and banking sources told the Inquirer these steps would give the flag carrier the opportunity to “reset” and retool its business for the future.

They also agreed the airline’s near-term recovery was dependent on counterpandemic efforts and would test the commitment of the Tan family in supporting PAL through continued losses.

“It all depends on how much financial ‘rope’ Lucio Tan is willing to provide” Avelino Zapanta PAL’s president during the carrier’s 1999 rehabilitation told the Inquirer.

“Even until next year I don’t see normalization for airlines happening” he added.

While the global health crisis worsened PAL’s financial woes forcing the flag carrier to suspend debt payments as early as April last year signs of trouble were long-brewing for the airline.

After Tan regained full control of PAL in 2014 ending a two-year alliance with conglomerate San Miguel Corp. it pursued a new strategy to expand its international network modernize its fleet and achieve a coveted five-star status by 2020.

When it retired old planes and introduced next-generation Airbus A350-900s the airline opened nonstop flights from Manila to New York and appeared unstoppable in its mission to connect the Philippines to more global gateways.

Losses since 2016

But financial losses began gradually mounting in 2016 and by 2019 PAL Holdings Inc. its parent company had accumulated P22.9 billion in losses.

PAL Holdings lost a staggering P71.8 billion in 2020 alone after flights were disrupted by recurring quarantines.

A year earlier the company’s plans were thrown into disarray due to abrupt management changes culminating in the surprise retirement of Jaime Bautista PAL’s longtime president.

The Inquirer learned that current PAL president Gilbert Santa Maria personally flew to New York for the filing of the Chapter 11 plea.

In the statement Santa Maria thanked PAL’s employees around the world for continuing to deliver “the highest quality of service through these trying times.”

“Following the recent celebration of our 80th anniversary we move forward with renewed confidence as today’s actions enable us to continue serving our customers and the Philippine economy long into the future” he said.

PAL said Tan’s group as majority shareholder will infuse $505 million in equity and debt financing while another $150 million in debt was required from global private investors for “postrestructuring” activities.

The rehabilitation filing showed that PAL’s five largest secured claimants or those whose loans were tied to collateral such as planes and engines were owed a total of $866 million.

These included local banks such as Tan’s Philippine National Bank or PNB ($156.5 million) and the Sy family’s BDO Unibank Inc. ($80.42 million) and China Banking Corp. ($54.83 million).

Claims worth $1.4B

The airline’s top 40 creditors have unsecured claims worth over $1.4 billion.

They include dozens of international aircraft lessors local banks maintenance companies and even government agencies such as the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) and Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP).

The top unsecured bank lenders were PNB ($115.9 million) Asia United Bank ($75.3 million) China Banking ($65.27 million) and Union Bank of the Philippines ($20.1 million).

Tan’s own Buona Sorte Holdings was the largest unsecured creditor with $358.28 million while the CAAP and MIAA were owed $8.65 million and $21.7 million in regulatory fees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL1BvbGl0aWNzL0ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtcmVsYXRpb25zL0luZG8tUGFjaWZpYy9VSy1jYXJyaWVyLXRvLWFycml2ZS1pbi1KYXBhbi1zLVlva29zdWthLW9uLVNhdHVyZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK carrier to arrive in Japan's Yokosuka on Saturday,"TOKYO -- The British aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth will make a port call from Saturday to Thursday at a U.S. naval base in Japan's Yokosuka Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi announced Friday.

Hyundai Glovis the logistics arm of Hyundai Group announced on Sunday it will enter the gas shipping market in 2024 after striking a multi-year deal with major commodity trading company Trafigura.



The shipping deal with the Switzerland-based company will see the Hyundai Glovis carry ammonia and liquefied natural gas for up to 10 years for global markets.



Two very large gas carriers (VLGC) which boast 86000 square meters in capacity will be built with 200 billion won ($173.2 million) in investment the company said.



Unlike LPG carriers the cargo holds of Hyundai Glovis VLGCs are made with special materials to allow for carrying ammonia –- a feature only around 10 percent of VLGCs around the world have the company explained.



Trafigura is one of the world’s largest commodities trading houses by turnover. In 2020 it raked up some 173 trillion won in revenue and 3.4 trillion won in operating profit.



The move marks the company’s shift towards new sectors which has previously focused on car carrier ships.



With liquefied hydrogen carriers yet to be commercialized ammonia has emerged as an effective way of carrying hydrogen for the company from which hydrogen can be extracted after being transported.



Hyundai Glovis also reaffirmed its efforts to build a hydrogen value chain.



“We have proved our competitiveness in the gas shipping industry through a long-term deal with a global commodity trading company” an official at Hyundai Glovis said.



“We will also see the process of building a hydrogen value chain gather speed. We plan to carry liquefied hydrogen and take lead in global hydrogen distribution.”



In a world first Hyundai Glovis and Hyundai Heavy Industries Group’s basic design for a 20000-cubic-meter commercial liquefied hydrogen carrier won approval in principle (AIP) from the Korean Register of Shipping and the Liberian Registry last October."

TODAY’S GUEST Julie Janoski answers even more Urgent Garden Questions each year than I do in her role as Plant Clinic manager at The Morton Arboretum in Lisle Illinois. The inquiries include lots about caterpillars galore from bagworms to gypsy moths (above their caterpillar) and fall webworms.

Besides being an arboretum and public garden The Morton is a world-class 1700-acre research center conservation and education organization and it’s preparing to mark its centennial in 2022.

Last year 17000 questions arrived by phone email or in person at the plant clinic questions representing consumers from 48 states. Julie is a former landscape designer who has managed the arboretum’s free plant clinic for three years after volunteering there for five years before that.

Julie and I talked about the most common questions we each get from gardeners including ones about Magnolia scale and about all those hungry caterpillars.

Read along as you listen to the Sept. 6 2021 edition of my public-radio show and podcast using the player below. You can subscribe to all future editions on Apple Podcasts (iTunes) or Spotify or Stitcher (and browse my archive of podcasts here).

caterpillars and more with julie janoski

Margaret: It’s good to speak to you again Julie. I really enjoyed getting to know you and The Morton Arboretum a little better as part of a recent “New York Times” column we did together. So the arboretum’s stated mission is to act as a champion of trees right? And tell us a little bit about it just briefly.

Julie: So our mission is to try and study and promote the care and appreciation of trees. And we do that in a lot of ways. We have a number of scientists on staff who are studying trees and climate change and how that affects them. We have the 1700 acres that you mentioned. And we also provide a lot of education for homeowners and green professionals in the best practices in tree care based on that scientific background.

Margaret: Right. Always science-based yes. I mean I hope that when the Times column came out that the readers didn’t overwhelm you with more questions than you already get [laughter]. By the way we should say that questions can be emailed in or phone calls and so forth. We’ll give the how to contact you how to contact the Plant Clinic information. So people will be able to do that. What’s your email for the Pant Clinic?

Julie: Our email address is plantclinic @ mortonarb dot org.

Margaret: O.K. so the clinic team is you and I think another full-time staff colleague and then who else?

Julie: So we also have between 45 and 60 volunteers depending on the year who are well-trained. They’re either master gardeners or have horticulture degrees or have been avid gardeners and have gone through a lot of the arboretum training. And they come in and help us answer questions via email or phone.

In addition to whatever their background is we put them through about 30 hours of training ourselves before they can even pick up a phone for us. So these are extremely well-trained volunteers and they are really the core of our team. They spend thousands of hours volunteering here.

Margaret: Right. So I’ve been writing about gardening for a long time and like the doctor at the cocktail party who gets asked medical questions [laughter] I get a lot of plant questions wherever I am. And I suspect you do too. So greatest hits: For me for instance one that always comes up over and again year after year is “When do I prune my…” And it’s usually fill-in-the-blank. But often it’s hydrangea or lilacs. Those are two really popular ones.

And related is “Why didn’t my fill-in-the-blank plant” usually a shrub “bloom? What went wrong?” And that’s often lilacs. It could be hydrangeas. And pests and disease questions in season come up year after year. What are the ones that you’re getting?

Julie: Well we certainly get all of those as well. But a key thing that we do here is plant identification for people. People can send us or bring us samples of plants that they have in their yard or that they found and we can help them identify them. A lot of people aren’t aware of all the different types of plants we have in the area or even how to figure out what they are. So we do a lot of that.

We also help people select plants for specific areas in their yard. So we get a lot of questions about “Hi I’ve got this circle in the middle of my driveway and the tree there died and what should I put back in there?” And we spend time with them trying to figure out what the conditions are in that area how big a plant they can put there what they’re looking for. And then we can make recommendations to help them figure out what to put in a space like that.

This year we’ve been very dry in the Upper Midwest. And so we have spent an enormous amount of time talking about how to water properly. And the fact that even big trees need to be watered when you have a 12-week drought because it’s just so important for the longevity of the tree to get some sort of regular moisture.

Margaret: Yes. And we talked about that in the “New York Times” story was one of the points that you made was that people will go and water their vegetables or water their pots of annuals. But what about the trees? And it may not be showing the signs right away some big old tree especially but it is suffering like you said in a prolonged dry spell. So I believe you told me if more than 10 days to two weeks of dry or something is there a protocol that you recommend to people?

Julie: Yeah. That’s usually exactly the timeframe that we recommend. If it hasn’t rained in 10 days to two weeks you should water your trees and shrubs not just your pots and your annuals. Trees and shrubs lose those fine feeder roots when the soil dries out completely. And it takes them a long time to build that back.

So if you have a prolonged period of dry weather these plants will lose a lot of their root system. And that has very long-term implications especially for big old trees.

Margaret: Right. Now we’re going to get into some creepy-crawly things [laughter]. For the first time this year I saw magnolia scale on a magnolia in my yard. Very small number of the… Well they’re scale insects so they’re like little dots underneath the leaves. And I had never seen them before. And I have read about it and so forth. Is that something you’re hearing about? Is that a trending pest?

Julie: Magnolia scale [below] has been a big pest here for the last five or six years. And you can identify magnolia scale by white fuzzy spots on the stems and branches of your magnolia trees. They only feed on magnolias. So if you find something like that on a different plant it’s not magnolia scale. But yeah we spend a lot of time trying to help people identify it and then figure out what to do with it.

Margaret: And so I just said undersides of the leaves and I guess I meant right by where the leaf is attached the little buds and twigs and so forth.

Julie: Yeah exactly.

Margaret: Yeah. Right. Because it was the only time I’d ever seen it. It was maybe six weeks ago or something. Very few of them. And so it’s on the twigs and branches stems and branches. O.K.

Julie: Right.

Margaret: And what’s to be done?

Julie: Well so magnolia scale if it’s just a minor infestation and you’re only seeing a few of them you can maybe cut those little branches and twigs out just throw them away.

A lot of times people don’t notice it until it’s really covering the tree. And at that point there has to be a chemical intervention—horticultural oil or there are some systemic pesticides you can use. That’s going to vary what’s legal from state to state. So you would want to contact your local cooperative extension for specific pesticide information.

Margaret: Right. And the interesting thing about these scale insects is again it looks like a little bump [laughter] underneath. But it then goes into a crawler stage doesn’t it? Does it start moving around or what happens next?

Julie: Yeah it does. The life cycle of Magnolia scale is really cool if you’re into that sort of thing I guess. [Laughter.]

Margaret: If you like icky creepy things yeah.

Julie: Because basically the white part that people notice is actually a waxy covering that is over the adult scale. And they build that so that they can hatch their babies which we call crawlers. And I say hatch loosely because magnolia scale actually produce live young. And once the young are born they crawl out from under the waxy covering and start to move around. And they’re the only part of the insect that actually moves. So that’s why we call them the crawlers.

Margaret: That’s funny. The other thing about treatment even with horticultural oil is timing is everything. And it works on one life phase and not another. And again I’m not an expert in this; I’ve read a little bit about it. But that’s why it’s so important to not just again ready shoot aim with what you think you might’ve heard about the thing because it has to be timed properly as well doesn’t it?

Julie: Yes absolutely. Once they’re under that waxy covering nothing is going to harm that insect underneath there. So you have to wait until the crawlers come out from underneath it. And that’s true for almost any pest or disease that the timing is nearly as important as the product that you use.

So you always want to clearly identify what problem that you have which disease which pest and then find a product that works on that pest or disease. And then really read the labels for timing to make sure that you’re spraying at the right time. Because if you’re not you’re wasting product you’re putting chemicals into the environment that don’t need to be there.

Margaret: Right. And again even if it’s oil it doesn’t mean you should just do it indiscriminately or waste it even if it’s oil. Yeah.

Julie: Correct.

Margaret: So dare I veer into the world of caterpillars [laughter]?

Julie: O.K. if you must.

Margaret: Did you have a gypsy moth year there? Now I did not. I’ve never had them in the 35 years I’ve been at this property. I’ve never had an infestation. I see the adult moths sometimes when I look for moths at night. I love to go mothing and put out a CFL blacklight and put up a sheet and see what moths are around and so forth.

I know they’re here. But not far from me there were large tracts of land that were heavily infested this year. And I don’t know if you had that also from callers in the Midwest and so forth.

Julie: So this year we did not see as much of an infestation. Last year was a particularly bad year. And the State of Illinois has a spraying regimen where they put traps out all over the state. We’re part of that process. And then they monitor how many moths they catch in the traps which indicates what the populations are. And if the populations are high in certain areas then they’ll come and do aerial spraying for us.

For those of you who don’t know this is a pest that got introduced into the country in the 1860s. And it’s a serious pest because it can eat leaves off a tree and completely defoliate a tree if the populations are high enough. Which of course over time would kill the tree. So we have been fighting gypsy moth for a long long time.

Margaret: Right. So earlier in the year people would have been seeing caterpillars and hearing—you can actually hear them chewing if there’s enough of them. It’s a noise yeah? I mean the crunching.

Julie: Exactly. Yeah. And the caterpillars usually hatch out in May usually mid- to early May. And of course that’s dependent on the weather. It’s a temperature thing; it’s not a date. They don’t suddenly look at their calendar and say “Oh it’s time to hatch.”

And what they need to do in order to turn into the adult moth is eat constantly until they’re ready to pupate or turn into the adult moth. Once they’re a moth they’re not a problem except that they’re out there laying more eggs. It’s that caterpillar phase that’s really really damaging.

Margaret: Right. So I believe with these that even if the aerial spraying like you just said if your government agency says “Hey we’re going to spray” the timing is everything once again. And they go after the young caterpillars not when they’ve reached close to the end of their larval life phase.

And so if people are calling now and people called up and said “What can I do?” There are some things you can do in your home environment your garden environment now looking for egg masses I think can’t you to sort of reduce the population somewhat.

Julie: Exactly. So the egg masses you can look up they look like strips of mud [above]. And they will lay their eggs on tree bark on lawn furniture on firewood on pretty much anything. And they’re pretty obvious. So if you can go and if you find those and can scrape them off there could be thousands of eggs in one of those masses. And if you can scrape them off the tree and throw those away you’re going to prevent that many caterpillars from hatching.

Margaret: Right. And you don’t do this with your fingers folks. That’s an important thing I think. We don’t touch them. We use a putty knife or something to scrape them. And we put them in a bucket of warm water or soapy water or something like that.

Julie: Hot soapy water or with household bleach ammonia. Yeah. The gypsy moth hairs which are part of all of their life stages can actually cause an allergic reaction a skin rash. So you really want to be careful and wear gloves and long sleeves.

Margaret: O.K. All right. And use a tool to scrape them. So that is something that we can do monitoring and reducing the potential very localized infestation of course. If callers are calling now you’re not telling them that there’s anything they could do to the caterpillars. It’s about these egg masses because the caterpillars are done. Their life phase is done.

Julie: That’s correct. They became the moths already about mid-summer.

Margaret: There are other caterpillars like right now fall webworms [above] are happening. And I think people especially if they were shell-shocked by gypsy moths this year any caterpillar looks really like something to be afraid of. But dot dot dot not the case. I mean some are native benign—in effect just good bird food right? [Laughter.] They’re just part of the ecosystem. So what about fall webworms for instance?

Julie: Yeah. Fall webworm we really don’t worry about much because they don’t hatch out until very late in the season. And that’s when they start eating. The trees are nearly done with what they need to do with the leaves for the year. And so any kind of damage that happens late in the summer or early in the fall is really not going to affect the tree at all. So they’re not attractive; their webs are really gross and ugly but they’re not going to permanently harm your tree.

Margaret: Right. They look like these big gauzy enclosures on the ends of branches and they can be on lots of different plants. And I think that’s the other thing that makes them not a big problem is that they’re not host-specific. They don’t have a narrow target where they go on the same kind of trees or the same kind of shrubs and decimate that crop. They are generalists in their diet. So they’ll be on everything.

I’ve even had them on perennials on large-leaf perennials some years. But mostly you’ll see these gauzy things on the ends of branches. And people a lot of times think it’s a recurrence at least here of Eastern tent caterpillars which come early in the spring. And of course it’s not. It’s something different.

Julie: Right. Absolutely. The Eastern tent caterpillar is going to show up in the spring. And just like gypsy moth it can do a lot of damage because it’s eating leaves off a tree in the spring and the tree hasn’t had all season to make food for itself with its leaves. That one is really focused on fruit trees and trees in the rose family especially like crabapples apple trees cherry trees. Those are really the hosts for that one.

In either event you can clip these tents out. You can just open them up with a stick and the birds will work on them. You rarely need to treat either of these infestations unless you have a serious infestation of Eastern tent caterpillar because that one is capable of defoliating a tree.

Margaret: Yeah. What else are you hearing about at the moment? Anything trending there on the hotline [laughter]?

Julie: Well if you’re talking about gross bugs we are seeing a lot of bagworm right now. Bagworm is an insect that takes the leaves or needles of the plants that it’s on and it not only feeds on it but then it winds it together with a piece of silk and attaches it to a branch. So it looks like you’ve got a little hanging bag of dead leaves or dead needles on there [above].

Bagworm infestation same thing. They can defoliate. They do tend to like evergreens which have a harder time re-needling than deciduous trees do. And the bags look different depending on which tree they’re on. So if they’re on an arborvitae they look very different than they would be on something with an actual leaf on it.

So same deal. You have to treat them at the right time. Once they’re tied into their little bags it’s almost impossible to get any pesticide on them. So you have to wait until they hatch out in the spring before you can actually treat them.

The other thing you can do is if you find these bags and they’re fully formed and they’re tied to the branch you can just snip them off and throw them away. We had a gentleman in here about three weeks ago who said he spent a whole day snipping bagworms. And he showed me pictures of a 5-gallon bucket of bagworm bags that he had pulled off of his arborvitae [laughter]. So the good news is he should not have a problem next spring. But yeah that was dedication.

Margaret: It cracks me up in a way because I used to work for Martha Stewart for many years. And so we did cooking and we did crafting and bagworms are kind of like culinary experts and crafting experts [laughter] because they eat their favorite meal and then they also use part of it to make a decorative this enclosure or this thing. They’re kind of wild. They almost look like tiny little pine cones on some of the species hanging down like these little ornaments or something. Very strange.

Julie: You’ve got the Martha Stewart of the bug world.

Margaret: There you go. There you go. Yeah. Do you get a lot of questions about weeds and weed ID and so forth? I get a lot of questions about that.

Julie: We absolutely do mostly in the spring where people will send us pictures of “I don’t remember planting this and it’s coming up all over in my garden.” A lot of times it’s too early to specifically identify something. But if you didn’t plant it and it’s now all over your garden the likelihood is is that it’s fairly aggressive and you may want to get rid of it.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah. I think it’s so important to learn about what your weed seedlings the local weed seedlings look like so that you can get ahead of things earlier. And that’s hard information to find sometimes but it’s proactive to be able to learn that.

What else are you hearing about right now? What other hit items? [Below a section of the arboretum.]

Julie: Well we’ve had a lot of heavy storms in the area so we’ve seen a lot of broken branches a lot of trees down. We’re getting a lot of questions about “What should I do about this branch that’s hanging in my tree?” or “I lost this half of the tree is the other half going to live?” We’re seeing a lot of questions about that right now.

We try and deal with each situation but my best advice on that is to really observe your trees and have them taken care of. The best time to protect against a storm or against an ice storm and make sure that your tree is structurally sound is before the storm happens. So developing a relationship with a good arborist who can help you take dead wood out of your tree on a regular basis and structurally prune it every five to seven years or something like that is really the best thing you can do to protect a tree in a storm.

Margaret: Right. And of course the hesitation is always—it’s easy to put it off because it’s not inexpensive. However compared to what can happen if it goes wrong if a large tree comes down or large branches come down in a storm and so forth it can be even more costly. So again getting ahead of it and having a regular as you say relationship with an arborist who walks the perimeter of your place looks around checks all the trees etc. And helps you stay ahead to be aware of their condition.

I have a number of trees in decline. I’m in a state forest and parkland surrounding me. And there’s a lot of old trees. And knowing which ones are declining and so forth is better than having a giant tree fall at some time.

Julie: Exactly exactly. And it’s not that you have to take them out. These arborists are trained in how to protect and care for trees and stabilize them if necessary. And then tell you the truth if something really does need to come down.

We got pictures from our last storm where a client sent us pictures that she had two big trees in front of her house from the 1800s. We suspect the trees were that age.

Margaret: Wow.

Julie: And the one tree there were two frame trees on each side of her sidewalk and one fell down. Missed the house fortunately. But took the other one down and took the power lines down for about a quarter of a mile. So just keep up with it and make sure you’re observing your plants and observing your trees.

Margaret: Well Julie Janoski from The Morton Arboretum Plant Clinic I’ve been so happy to meet you. I hope we’re going to have regular conversations. And thank you again for helping me with the Times story and with this podcast today. And I hope I’ll talk to you again soon.

And I’ll give lots of links to all of your great resource materials and how people can use the website and of course get in contact with you. Thank you.

The children have no hesitation handling these nearly 2- to 3-inch-long caterpillars letting them crawl all over their clothes.

Shaw and her children were preparing to spend the morning picking up litter along the Salt River when they spotted the dozens of caterpillars in one of the parking lots in recreational areas of the Tonto National Forest. Although some people cringe at the sight of crawly things Shaw and her children do not.

“We love the caterpillars” Shaw said “it’s just been stressful when we’re driving because they (her kids) get really upset about running them over. We don’t want to hurt them.

“I know some people are absolutely freaking out.”

Drive along the Bush Highway and you can’t miss tens of thousands of these caterpillars frantically wriggling to cross as vehicles fly by. They don’t all make it to the other side – many become yellow splotches on the black asphalt.

The caterpillars are on a mission to eat as much as they can before becoming white-lined sphinx moths (Hyles lineata) which are found across most of North America. They are hawk moths which are among the largest in the world and they’re “fast flyers and often highly aerobatic” according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Not only are the caterpillars abundant on roadways they’re showing up in swimming pools and gardens and on walls and hiking trails.

Shaw said the timing of her family’s recent outing to pick up litter was excellent.

“We actually homeschool” she said “and in our curriculum we were learning about butterflies and moths this week. It was perfect.”

In Arizona monsoon storms stimulate the growth of weeds and other plants essential food in the caterpillar’s development. There are more caterpillars than in years past because of the increased rainfall this monsoon season.

The white-lined sphinx moth caterpillars are in their “wandering phase” which takes place right before they burrow underground to pupate according to Sarah Britton a doctoral student in entomology at the University of Arizona. Britton studies the pattern of melanism or color pigments in the caterpillars.

She said these caterpillars sometimes can be found at the tops of plants and even though they’re large they keep eating.

“Then sometimes you see these ones that are in the road or just wandering across big expanses and people are running over them” Britton said. “They’re wandering to find their pupation spot.”

In the pupation phase the caterpillar goes into its chrysalis to become a moth. The caterpillar phase lasts about three weeks and the pupation phase is another three weeks. After that the moths which look like stout hummingbirds with white stripes on primarily brown wings emerge to live for just seven to 10 days.

Dry years also affect the population of the white-lined sphinx moth according to entomologists.

Goggy Davidowitz an entomology professor at UArizona said the white-lined sphinx moth can handle the unpredictability of Arizona’s weather patterns – with one caveat.

“This species is the most abundant hawk moth (Sphingid family in the animal order that includes moths) in all of North America” Davidowitz said. “But the highest abundance (is) in the Southwest they have evolved into semi-arid environments.”

Davidowitz who lives in Tucson said the rains there can be unpredictable.

“So when there is a good rain season they (caterpillars) capitalize on that and they’re very prolific and they’ll put in multiple generations. If it’s a bad year they won’t.”

Davidowitz who spends some of his time researching the white-lined sphinx moth said the number of moths and caterpillars in Arizona has fallen in the past 15 to 20 years.

“Last year we found when we went out black-lighting it was a drought year we got almost no hawk moths at all” he said.

Diminished rainfall and rising temperatures from climate change affects this species’ ability to thrive in Arizona. Since the 1970s the average temperature has increased more than 3 degrees in Arizona which is the third fastest-warming state in the country according to Climate Central.

“They can deal with some unpredictability as a species but they still need some monsoons to thrive” Britton said. “Last year for example we didn’t see this many. If it’s years and years and years of very little rain that’s a big factor in addition to the temperature.”

The white-lined sphinx moth plays a role in pollinating plants in Arizona. This species is considered a “generalist” meaning it doesn’t have a certain type of plant it consumes or pollinates Britton and Davidowitz said.

“Another cool thing about this species is all hawk moths are nocturnal so they fly at night. They will pollinate with both night blooming flowers and day blooming flowers” Davidowitz said.

White-lined sphinx moths often are mistaken for hummingbirds because they resemble the birds and can hover to feed from and pollinate flowers. Their long proboscises are similar to a hummingbird’s beak.

For now watch out for these harmless caterpillars around Arizona as they get ready to head underground to reemerge as moths in about three weeks.

We want to hear from you. Have a story idea or tip? Pass it along to the KTAR News team here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2h1YXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9sb2NhbC1jb21tZW50YXJ5LzIwMjEvMDkvMDQvYnVkZHlzLWZsb3dlcnMtdGhlLWJ1dHRlcmZseS10aGF0LWNvdWxkbnQtZmx5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buddy's flowers: The butterfly that couldn't fly,"There’s something wrong with Buddy.

For the past couple weeks my daughter has nurtured a pair of Painted Lady butterflies the larvae arriving in the mail along with a cup of some sort of sweet peanut butter-like paste. We connected the cup and paste to the top of a netted cage placed them in a warm area of the living room worked hard to keep the cats from using them as a midnight snack and waited.

A few words about Little Bean’s relationship with insects. Besides the curious exceptions of ants and flies she loves them. All of them. She has come to me with a shiny black stag beetle’s pincers attached to her pinky. She has allowed a colony of daddy long legs to swarm over her hands dipping her fingers into the nest like a baptismal font of creepy crawlies. She has chased moths and butterflies. And once while dip-netting for minnows she squealed in delight when the net came up filled with water skimmers.

Raising a caterpillar into a butterfly was an obvious and enjoyable experiment.

But something had gone wrong.

Buddy the butterfly showed up overnight so we never saw his emergence from his pupa. But we carefully unscrewed the bottom of the jar (making sure the second caterpillar was undisturbed) and released our new butterfly into his temporary cage. The cage itself was netting with little plastic branches twigs and leaves for him to settle onto as he tested his brand-new butterfly form.

It was clear though that Buddy’s wing was ill-formed curled up nearly over his head. He crawled fine. But there’d be no fluttering for Buddy.

Buddy was a butterfly that could not fly.

I recalled an essay I read a while back by psychologist David Walsh about empathy in children where he suggests that empathy can’t be a lesson. In other words you can’t teach it directly.

“We can’t sit our children down for formal lessons in empathy” he writes. “Instead empathetic responses emerge over time in the context of caring relationships modeling storytelling communication playing emotion coaching and a whole lot of patience.”

And while I didn’t ever expect raising a butterfly would become a life lesson well here we were.

We sat at our kitchen table that evening over milk and coffee and considered our options.

“Buddy is not going to survive long outside baby without being able to fly” I began. Our originally goal of course was to birth him and then set him free in our flower garden outside.

“Can we take him to one of those animal hospitals” Little Bean immediately suggests “like one of those butterfly zoos?”

I love her more than I’m able to put into words that her first thought is to fix him. I explain that there’s no hospital for butterflies that even if we sent him to a sanctuary they would have the same problem we have.

“I feel like we have two choices” I tell her. “We can let him go outside among the flowers where he’ll be free but his life will be very short. Or we can try to give him the best life we can here inside but that would require a lot of attention.”

“Like feeding him?” she asks.

“Yup.”

She pauses for a long time her face wrinkling in thought. This is life and death stuff big picture decisions in the microcosm of an insect’s world; a split second of life being decided by a six-year-old against the backdrop of all time and all the universe.

Without a word she climbs down off the chair and goes to find her mother and for a moment I feel hurt that she decided not to confer with me but she clarifies after a moment.

“Momma said we could use her black-eyed susans” my daughter says.

“For what?”

She looks at me like I’m crazy.

“For Buddy” she says. “We’ll bring the flower to him.”

I had never even considered a third option. So my daughter and I walk out to the garden and snip off the head of a small yellow flower bursting with pollen. Then we make a mixture of sugar water in a small cap. Finally I chop up a tiny bit of watermelon because I read Painted Ladies like fruit.

We carefully slip this new eco-system under the mesh of the cage.

“How long can he live there daddy” she asks.

“I don’t know baby. But even if it’s a short time we’re going to give him the best life we can.”

Later that night before bed we check on Buddy and discover that he has indeed found the sugar water. He’s perched on the side of the cap one wing open one curled.

As you read this we are now several weeks into Buddy’s life. Sadly the second caterpillar did not make it out of his pupa state leaving Buddy as the sole resident of his mesh cage. We change his water each day and bring him a new fresh flower now and again. He’s still unable to fly but some days we find him on the mesh nearest our living room window soaking in the sun.

Is his life better than it would have been had we let him go out into the flower bed? I don’t know. I don’t even know how to scale a question like that. Buddy is just an insect. But he’s a living creature and there’s value in considering what that life even means.

Maybe the difference won’t be felt by Buddy. Maybe it will be felt by my daughter instead. Or maybe I’ll be the recipient of a lesson in patience. His life is too little to gauge and our world is too big.

But we’ll go on picking flowers for him and he’ll keep on flapping that one good wing and you never know when kindness and empathy and compassion will sink in – will really latch on to a kid’s heart – so you may as well just keep trying because that effort has no cost.

In the end a one-winged butterfly living in your house for a month is a small price to pay for that chance. Who knows? Everybody likes a flower.

Some of these states also report fall armyworm feeding extensively in turf.

In Pennsylvania just this week Penn State Extension entomologist John Tooker started to hear of infestations with reports coming from Franklin Somerset and York counties.

In York County the infestation removed leaves from grass hay fields. Given the regional scope of the challenge it would be surprising if infestations in Pennsylvania were limited to the three counties mentioned.

Tooker’s best advice is to scout hay and alfalfa fields for infestations of fall armyworm caterpillars noting the size of the caterpillars and what portions of the fields are infested. The abundance of caterpillars in one place may be enough to identify the species. We are not worried about just a few caterpillars. If you find more than two or three caterpillars per square foot it will likely be economical to treat that population. If you find damage but the caterpillars are absent look at adjacent fields to see where they might have moved. They can feed in many crop species but are known to damage corn and soybeans. Their feeding in corn should be limited by aboveground Bt traits.

When considering how to control the infestations a few interrelated details need to be kept in mind.

First the smaller the caterpillar the easier they are to control. Once caterpillars are three-quarters of an inch to an inch long they become more challenging.

Second it will be easier to control the caterpillars when they are in hay than if they get to soybean or corn fields. If you catch the infestation early enough cutting the hay would be an option to protect the crop but cutting may also prompt the caterpillars to march to adjacent fields or lawns where they can find healthy green plants. A moving population may be vulnerable and treatable particularly if the majority of caterpillars head in one direction but controlling them requires good timing and availability of a buffer area to treat before they get to an adjacent crop. To avoid driving caterpillar populations out of fields spraying the hay rather than cutting (or before cutting) is a good approach.

Third the choice of insecticide is important. Of course the insecticide needs to be labeled for the crop species and armyworms. Alfalfa has more options than grass hay. When caterpillars are small popular pyrethroids (active ingredients like lambda-cyhalothrin and zeta-cypermethrin are broadly labeled) should be effective but efficacy will decline when caterpillars are bigger.

Beyond the typical pyrethroids growth regulator insecticides (active ingredients like diflubenzuron and methoxyfenozide have broad labels) are options that are more specific and kill the caterpillars when they molt but caterpillar death may take a few days. Growers should use higher rates for heavier infestation or larger caterpillars.

Herrera has headed the department for almost five years and before that was the department’s assistant director. She's worked for the city for just over eight years.

She's taking a job in the El Paso office of CBRE Group an international commercial real estate services and investment firm based in Dallas.

Herrera said she's ready for a new career path with new challenges and opportunities.

""I thought I could transition my skill sets (from) over the last 15½ years and be an advocate for companies looking to expand and help with site selection"" she said.

""We’ve done a lot of really great work at the city. The city is headed in the right direction"" with a lot of new investments by companies in the city and region she said.

She will leave her city job at the end of September.

Elizabeth Triggs former assistant director of the economic development department will become the interim director and oversee its daily operations. She is currently the city’s strategic partnerships officer. She has worked for the city in various positions for almost 10 years.

City officials will select a permanent director later which may involve conducting a search Tammy Fonce a city spokeswoman said in an email. Triggs also could get the job permanently.

At the same time the city is giving economic development oversight duties to David Coronado director of the city International Bridges Department since 2018. He will now be managing director of international bridges and economic development.

The alignment of the two departments is aimed at “a more targeted approach to business expansion and business relocations based on trends and market studies in an effort to yield higher wages and jobs” Fonce said.

Coronado will report to Cary Westin senior deputy city manager who until the changes had direct oversight of the city’s economic development department.

While in most cases your retail electric provider is your first point of contact for your electricity concerns it is your Transmission and Distribution Utility (TDU) that is responsible for responding to power outages and electricity-related emergencies. Nearly all TDUs have a 24/7 power outage phone number available and most have their own power outage map which includes the number of customers affected repair updates and estimated time the outage will last. Continue reading to find your TDU's contact information and what to do if you don't know which one to call.

Does it matter which power grid I am on?

The short answer: Nope.

If your lights suddenly go off and the electrical hum goes silent it is extremely unlikely that the power outage is stemming from the electricity grid itself. In nearly all cases an outage will come from a blown transformer power poles knocked over or power lines snapped by tree limbs. However in the smallest possibility that a power grid faces issues knowing which grid you are on may come in handy.

Texas power grids

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) service area which cover most of Texas is dominated by five deregulated (energy retail) transmission and distribution utility companies (TDUs). The remaining Texas areas that are not on the ERCOT grid are covered by three other national grids (below) which are regulated and not open to retail competition.

The non-ERCOT grids in Texas include (in order of largest to smallest coverage) the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC).

SPP area covers the majority of the Texas panhandle (Lubbock Amarillo Canyon Dumas Pampa Hereford and Panhandle) and the northeast/upper east corner of Texas (cities of Texarkana Henderson Marshall Jefferson Pittsburg Boston Carthage and Center) The MISO service area covers a segment of east-central Texas just bordering north of Harris County and powers Beaumont Tyler Huntsville Jasper Conroe Bryan Madisonville Livingston Woodville and surrounding communities. The grid with the smallest coverage in Texas the WECC has the western tip of Texas. WECC services all of El Paso County and Hudspeth County and portions of Culberson Jeff Davis and Presidio Counties. The major cities in this area include El Paso and Sierra Blanca.

How do I locate the utility company for my area?

Regardless of location and service area you should always communicate a power outage with your utility company not your electric provider. There are a few places to turn to when you need to find out which TDU services your area and exact location.

The monthly electric bill sent by your electric provider (in deregulated zones)

A surefire way to know which utility company works directly with your retail electric provider is to check out your monthly billing statement. Considering every electricity provider charges their customers the utility company's fees and energy rate charges the energy distributor charging those tariffs is most likely listed (by your electric provider) on that same bill.

If you have read this far ... ... that means either you haven't received a bill yet misplaced it or tossed it.

Whatever the case there are a couple other ways (below) to figure out which utility company services your address!

Find your utility company by location

Even though this is more of an estimation using a general location tends to be the fastest way to understand which utility company services an exact address. Below are the Texas power grids their coverage areas with larger cities and the utility company outage information for each.

Find your utility company using your electricity meter's ESID number

If you have a meter already installed and have access to it try to find the ESI ID (sometimes called the ESID) number. This is a unique X-digit number assigned to each meter by the utility company for the area..

ESID / ESI ID format The ESI ID is only numeric (no letters are included) and is found on the front face of the meter. The ESI ID may range anywhere from 17 to 22 digits in length and includes an identification code for each utility company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaXN0YXRlaG9tZXBhZ2UuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9ldmFuc3ZpbGxlLW5hYWNwLXRlYXItZG93bi13b29kbGFuZC1wYXJrLWFwYXJ0bWVudHMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHJpc3RhdGVob21lcGFnZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2V2YW5zdmlsbGUtbmFhY3AtdGVhci1kb3duLXdvb2RsYW5kLXBhcmstYXBhcnRtZW50cy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Evansville NAACP: Tear down Woodland Park Apartments,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.tristatehomepage.com/news/local-news/evansville-naacp-tear-down-woodland-park-apartments/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaXN0YXRlaG9tZXBhZ2UuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9ldmFuc3ZpbGxlLW5hYWNwLXRlYXItZG93bi13b29kbGFuZC1wYXJrLWFwYXJ0bWVudHMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHJpc3RhdGVob21lcGFnZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2V2YW5zdmlsbGUtbmFhY3AtdGVhci1kb3duLXdvb2RsYW5kLXBhcmstYXBhcnRtZW50cy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Chevron Corp is looking to sell its oil and gas assets in the Eagle Ford Basin in south Texas according to sources familiar with the matter and a marketing document seen by Reuters.

A spokesperson confirmed that the company was marketing the assets for sale adding the oil major regularly reviews its portfolio.

At $70 oil and $4 gas Chevron estimated the assets' total proved developed resources - the amount of oil and gas with a 90% or greater probability of profitable extraction - were worth around $1 billion according to the document.

Including undeveloped inventory the assets could be valued as high as $3.8 billion at those prices according to the document. U.S. crude prices were trading at around $69.5 a barrel on Friday while natural gas was around $4.69 per million British thermal units.

Prospective buyers are likely to bid between $1 billion and $2 billion for the assets two of the sources said.

Oil companies have been unloading properties from Texas to California taking advantage of a more than 40% surge in crude prices to shore up cash for future investments and returns to shareholders.

Chevron which plans to resume share buybacks in the current quarter stepped up its sales program in June by marketing two collections of conventional oil and gas fields in the Permian Basin together valued at more than $1 billion.

""From Chevron's perspective a sale further streamlines their upstream operations as they narrow their focus to the largest and most economic oil and gas projects while further diversifying their business to stay abreast of changes in the industry"" said Andrew Dittmar senior M&A analyst at Enverus.

""They are likely hoping to capitalize on a resurgent Eagle Ford M&A market largely driven by interest from private equity buyers.""

The basin has seen over $2 billion in deals so far this year compared to just $500 million in 2020 and $1 billion in 2019 Dittmar added.

Chevron's Eagle Ford assets which the company acquired as part of its takeover of Noble Energy last year span 30440 net acres and had net production of 30300 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021 with 45% of it being natural gas according to the marketing document.

The divestment plans come as Chevron reportedly held talks with activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 to detail its plans to cut carbon emissions. Engine No. 1 won three board seats at rival Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) in June using the top U.S. oil producer's ""inadequate"" response to climate change as its rallying point.

Chairman and Managing Director Chevron Nigeria/Mid-Africa Business Unit

A Message from Rick Kennedy



Chevron is one of the largest oil producers and investors in Nigeria and has been making significant investments in the country for about 60 years. Through Chevron’s principal subsidiary in Nigeria CNL the company operates and holds a 40 percent interest in eight concessions in the onshore and near-onshore regions of the Niger Delta under a joint-venture arrangement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Chevron

also does business through other affiliates in Nigeria.



Deepwater

Chevron entities hold acreages in three operated and six non-operated deep-water blocks with participating interests ranging from 20 to 100 percent. The Agbami field is located 70 miles offshore the central Niger Delta spanning 45000 acres. This Chevron-operated field spans Oil Mining Lease (OML) 127 and OML 128.



Infill drilling continued in 2020 to further optimize production. Chevron holds a 30 percent non-operated participating interest in the Usan field in OML 138.



The Aparo field in OML 132 and OML 140 and the third-party owned Bonga South-

west field in OML 118 share a common geologic structure and are planned to be

developed jointly. Chevron entities hold non-operated interests in the unitized area.





Gas

CNL continues with its efforts to monetize recoverable natural gas resources in the Escravos area. It utilizes the gas to fuel the company’s operations while also supplying the product to the domestic and international markets. CNL supplies significant portion of Nigeria’s domestic gas.



Through investments in gathering and processing of associated gas CNL has reduced routine gas flaring in its operations by over 95 percent in the last 10 years.



We invest in our operations to improve environmental performance while working with the industry to develop innovations and best practices. We believe reducing gas flaring and carbon emissions makes good environmental and business sense.



CNL operates the Escravos Gas Plant EGP which has a processing capacity of 680 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day and LPG and condensate export capacity of 58000 barrels per day. Chevron also operates the Escravos Gas to Liquids (EGTL) facility which is designed to process 325 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from the EGP Phase 3A project turning this into premium-quality low-sulfur diesel fuel and naphtha for export. The EGTL enhances diversification and commercialization of gas resources and continues to provide great value to Nigeria through its high-quality liquid products.



The Sonam asset which is 40 percent owned and operated by CNL is designed to process natural gas through the EGP facility to deliver 215 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day to the domestic market. It also produces 30000 barrels of liquids per day.



West African Gas Pipeline

Chevron is the largest shareholder in the West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited which owns and operates the 421- mile (678-km) West African Gas Pipeline.

The $1.2 billion flagship Economic Community of West African States ECOW-

AS project led by Chevron in Nigeria was designed to transport up to 475 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day from Nigeria to markets in Benin Republic Togo and Ghana.



Chevron in Nigeria



Our Company’s Foundation is built on our values which distinguish us and guide our actions to deliver result the

RIGHT WAY



Corporate Responsibility

Chevron takes its role as a member of the Nigerian community seriously and is active in many corporate responsibility projects promoting health education and economic development.



In 2005 CNL pioneered the community-led participatory partnership approach to community engagement in the Niger Delta to improve community participation in the social and economic development needs of communities close to its operations.



This model called the Global Memorandum of Understanding GMoU gives communities a greater role in managing their own development through community-based platforms known as Regional Development Committees (RDCs). The objective of the GMoU is to ensure peace sustainable development and stability in areas where CNL operates. In 2015 the company launched the GMoU+ to build on the communities’ focus on growing small businesses increasing household income and employment and aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals SDGs.



Environmentally Sound Operations

Chevron entities in Nigeria have a strong commitment to keeping a safe and clean environment in all its operations. We sustain our investment in advanced technologies for identifying tracking and managing key aspects of our operations with the wider deployment of the Lead Detection and Repair (LDAR) programme in our facilities. LDAR helps to detect hydrocarbon leaks (fugitive emissions) which normally would not be seen by the eye or detected by regular gas detectors for effective leaks fixing processes.

Support for COVID-19 response in Nigeria



CNL contributed to several initiatives to support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.



One of these initiatives was our support for an industry-wide coalition under which the NNPC/CNL Joint Venture made in-kind contributions for a value of $3.2 million to the Federal Government initiative and strategy to fight the pandemic. The initiative covered three areas: the provision of medical consumables including personal protective equipment; deployment of ambulances and in-patient support systems; and delivery of medical infrastructure equipment and other items such as ventilators and diagnostic equipment.



Through its community-led participatory partnership model for community development CNL in partnership with the leadership of the communities neighboring its areas of operations in the Niger-Delta region donated funds to support emergency food needs and medical services in the communities.



CNL donated a complete set of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) equipment to Warri Central Hospital in Delta State one of the States where CNL has operations in the Niger-Delta to enhance testing and diagnosis of COVID-19. Additionally we donated other items including test kits medical consumables air conditioners refrigerators a 50-KVA soundproof generating set and coaster buses for contact-tracing efforts. CNL also renovated a four-room laboratory building provided by the Delta State

government.



CNL similarly donated ten 32-seater coaster buses to the Ondo Delta and Lagos States Governments to aid contact-tracing efforts in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.



The Foundation for Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta PIND a non-profit organization funded by Chevron Corporation through the U.S-based Niger Delta Partnership Initiative NDPI) also contributed to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. PIND developed and managed a web-based “PIND Niger Delta COVID-19 Update Center” for dissemination of accurate information regarding COVID-19 in Nigeria. This initiative was

commended by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control NCDC.

In 2020 a sum of N10.35 million was paid to beneficiaries.







Support for STEM Education

Chevron sustained its support for Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) by supporting the South Africa-based African Leadership Academy (ALA) Summer Engineering

Academy (SEA) in which 15 Nigerian scholars participated. SEA is part of the “AfriSTEM” programme designed by Chevron and ALA for highly motivated and talented 16 to 19-year-old high school students selected from over 45 participants drawn from more than 20 schools in Africa all of whom are interested in a career in STEM.



The programme is consistent with Chevron’s commitment to partnerships for community and national development and support to students to explore a career in STEM. It also re-emphasizes the importance the company attaches to the socioeconomic development of communities and countries where it operates in Africa and elsewhere in the world.





Employee Volunteer Programme



Chevron Nigeria’s Employee Volunteering Programme (EVP) provides opportunities for employees to contribute to enhancing the quality of life of the communities around and beyond the company’s areas of operation.





In 2020 despite the challenges of strict lockdowns and social restrictions due to actions taken in fighting the global pandemic Chevon and its employees still successfully implemented two projects in three schools in Lagos and Edo states.



These were the renovation of a three-classroom block at Wesley Girls Senior Secondary School Yaba Lagos; donation of digital learning aids to Ikota Primary School Ikota Lagos; and donations of Chemistry laboratory equipment to the University of Benin Edo State.





National Social Investment Programmes

The NCF is the premier Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) dedicated to nature conservation and sustainable development in Nigeria. The LCC is a

78-hectare dedicated natural land mass on the Lekki Peninsula which serves as a sanctuary preserving and protecting the natural flora and fauna within its enclave.



The LCC’s activities and programmes further promote sound environmental practices and offer education research and tourism opportunities to thousands of visitors and partners annually. The conservation center is the only one of its kind in Lagos State. CNL continues to meet its financial support commitments to the NCF to ensure the sustainability of the LCC.

Foundation for Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta (PIND)

Strategic Purpose



PIND is the non-profit Nigerian counterpart of the United States-based Niger Delta Partnership Initiatives (NDPI) Foundation Inc. that was established by Chevron Corporation in 2010. It was initiated as a regional strategy for addressing deep-rooted socio-economic problems in the Niger Delta rather than simply attempting to manage the symptoms. PIND does this in collaboration with a growing network of international and local partners.

Updated May 10 2024

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is sending humanitarian aid to those affected by the recent rains in Brazil’s southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.

In what authorities consider the state’s worst-ever crisis caused by natural disasters the extreme flooding has forced 200000 people out of their homes and at least 90 people dead and more than 130 missing.

The Brazil Area Presidency has assembled staff and resources to assist those affected by the floods. A letter sent to bishops and stake presidents from Elder Joni L. Koch Brazil Area President and his counselors Elder Arnulfo Valenzuela and Elder Mark D. Eddy all General Authority Seventies states that 21 meetinghouses are now being used as shelters for evacuated people and thousands of basic food packages provided by the Church to the state Civil Defense have already begun to be distributed to the population.

Other humanitarian aid initiatives are underway in close coordination with the government to help the community. The Church’s Welfare and Self-Reliance and Family Services departments are coordinating support and efforts to meet the needs of members as well.

On Wednesday May 8 missionaries from the Church helped unload emergency supplies from an Azul airplane at the military airport in the city of Canoas.

In Saõ Paulo on Thursday May 9 Elder Koch and Elder Valenzuela closely monitored the loading onto an Azul aircraft of 6 tons of supplies purchased by the Church for flood victims bound for the Canoas Air Base. In a social media post on the Church’s official Brazil account the leaders stated that in addition to the donations was “an immeasurable amount of love and sincere prayers for the people of Rio Grande do Sul.” On Friday May 10 Brazil’s first lady Rosângela Lula da Silva wrote her Instagram page: “I want to thank Azul [Airlines] and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who performed alongside FAB [Brazilian Air Force] and were able to get the donations we received to Canoas. ... There were mattresses vacuum cleaners toilet kits blankets among other items.” She said Brazil is united in its support of Rio Grande do Sul.

News reports say some 80% of the population is without running water right now a week into the flooding. Many also do not have telephone or internet services.

The airport bus station and main roads are all blocked or closed going into the capital of Porto Alegre — and more than two-thirds of the nearly 500 cities in the state are affected by the flood waters. Field hospitals have been set up to help those affected.

Social media posts on the Church’s Autossuficiência Brasil and Brazil Area accounts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints further explain how the Church is responding to the disaster which include the following list of donated goods and services:

5000-plus basic food baskets

5000-plus mattresses pillows bedding and blankets

48000 liters of drinking water

5000 hygiene and cleaning kits

400 water filters

Additional humanitarian funds

These donations are being coordinated in collaboration with the State Civil Defense. Local church leaders are also coordinating efforts to help the community.

“[T]he Brazil Area office is mobilized to do everything possible to help and help the population of Rio Grande do Sul our dear brothers and sisters and friends at this time of great sorrow” the post said in Portuguese.

The post states that Church members who want to make donations to those affected by the calamity can do so through official government organizations that are coordinating donations through civil defense and social funds.

In addition the Church’s Family Services department is coordinating a support network of volunteer psychologists to provide emotional support to those affected. And wards and stakes across the country have joined the Church’s Helping Hands volunteer program and are raising donations.

A statement from the Brazil Area presidency said “We pray that as we follow the perfect example of Jesus Christ ‘our hands may become His hands; our eyes His eyes and our hearts His heart’ at this time when our brothers and sisters need us so much.”

Some of the cities in Rio Grande do Sul — roughly the size Ecuador — were already suffering from at least three previous major floods in less than eight months.

The rains are expected to continue in the area along with high winds.

Mr. Gonzalez is the image of the modern missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which has changed many of its practices — from how missionaries preach to how they dress.

The faith long known for sending tens of thousands of neatly and formally dressed young people across the globe each year to preach door to door is encouraging new missionaries to spread the gospel on social media and for some with acts of community service closer to home."

Dalam tahapan ini apa yang dihalalkan dalam pernikahan belum boleh dilakukan. Lantas bagaimana jika kedua orang yang bertunangan saling mengucapkan rasa cinta mereka?

Direktur Umum Departemen Pelatihan Dar Al Ifta Mesir yang juga sebagai anggota fatwa Syekh Amr Al Wardani mengatakan biasanya jenis cinta yang dimiliki orang yang bertunangan adalah tipe yang mengungkapkan cinta dengan tanda-tanda yang menunjukkan keinginan fisik.

Dilansir di elbalad.news hal tersebut bertentangan dengan hukum syariat yang berlaku. Tetapi jika ungkapan cinta adalah jenis yang mengungkapkan penghargaan dan rasa hormat atau jenis lain yang mengungkapkan kekaguman atau awal dari keterikatan hati pada orang maka itu diperbolehkan menurut hukum Islam.

Dia menjelaskan istilah cinta atau penggunaan cinta memiliki beberapa bentuk yang pertama adalah cinta itu muncul dalam bentuk penghargaan dan rasa hormat seperti seorang teman yang mengatakan kepada temannya bahwa dia mencintainya atau saudara laki-laki untuk saudara perempuannya dan ini menunjukkan penghargaannya dan rasa hormat untuknya.

Dia menunjukkan bahwa ada jenis cinta lain yang terkait dengan kecenderungan hati yang disertai dengan kontak fisik dan ini berarti bahwa individu mengungkapkan cintanya kepada orang lain dengan harapan akan ada cinta karena kontak fisik. Dan jenis cinta ketiga adalah kekaguman yang mengungkapkan awal dari kecenderungan hati.

Syekh Al Wardani mengungkapkan bahwa perlu untuk mengatur hal ini setelah penjelasan rinci tentang jenis ekspresi cinta tidak diperbolehkan misalnya seseorang berkata kepada tunangannya ""Aku mencintaimu"" larut malam dengan cara tertentu jadi ini mungkin untuk jenis kedua yang mengekspresikan kecenderungan untuk kontak fisik dan ini tentu saja tidak diperbolehkan.

Dia menjelaskan bahwa adanya kecenderungan hati atau perasaan antara kedua belah pihak adalah urusan Allah SWT yang tidak dapat diatur manusia termasuk masalah saling menyukai di antara yang bertunangan. Tetapi perilaku yang mengikuti perasaan tersebut adalah yang harus dalam batas-batas yang ditetapkan oleh Allah dan tidak boleh ada pelanggaran apa pun.

Klik untuk follow WhatsApp Channel & Google News

Memiliki pasangan memang menyenangkan secara tak langsung bisa memberi banyak pengaruh dalam hidup seseorang.

Namun banyak juga pasangan di luar sana memiliki hubungan tak seperti yang diinginkan. Hal ini disebabkan oleh sikap pasangan yang tak mendukung hubungan tersebut berjalan dengan baik. Terlebih lagi jika pasangannya selalu bersikap kekanak-kanakan atau tak dewasa.

Kamu membutuhkan pasangan yang bisa membuatmu nyaman dan cinta yang dewasa agar hubungan langgeng. Berikut merupakan lima tanda yang bisa kamu temukan dalam dirimu dan pasangan.

1. Saling jatuh cinta pada jiwa pasangan dibanding fisiknya ilustrasi menghabiskan waktu dengan pasangan (unsplash.com/mahkeo) Tak jarang banyak orang mudah jatuh cinta karena penampilan fisik lawan jenis. Itulah mengapa ada istilah ‘dari mata turun ke hati’. Namun jika kamu mencintai seseorang karena penampilan fisiknya tentu itu tidak akan menjamin apa pun. Hal yang terpenting adalah bagaimana kamu bisa mencintai jiwanya sifatnya karakternya melebihi kamu mencintai fisiknya. Ketertarikan pada fisik tentu tak salah namun jangan jadikan sebagai faktor utama karena fisik bisa berubah. Cintailah jiwa pasangan karena itu akan lebih sulit untuk berubah.

2. Intensitas komunikasi tak menjamin nilai seseorang ilustrasi berkomunikasi dengan pasangan (unsplash.com/christinhumephoto) Komunikasi itu penting dan juga harus berkualitas. Maksud dari kualitas adalah bagaimana kamu dan pasangan bisa saling meluangkan waktu khusus untuk saling bertukar cerita berbagi keluh kesah dan sebagainya. Tak harus setiap hari ngobrol berjam-jam seperti anak ABG yang baru mengenal cinta. Kamu bisa menyepakati waktu berkomunikasi saat kalian saling memiliki waktu luang. Nantinya kalian saling mengerti bahwa bagaimanapun komunikasi dengan orang terkasih harus tetap terjaga meski tengah sibuk dengan berbagai hal.

4. Ketika kalian mengerti saat membutuhkan ruang pribadi ilustrasi menikmati waktu me time (unsplash.com/jeshoots) Siapa bilang jika sudah memiliki pasangan maka kamu tidak bisa lagi melakukan hobi atau bersenang bersama teman-teman? Ruang pribadi itu penting lho baik untuk dirimu maupun pasangan. Tanda dari dewasanya cinta di antara kalian adalah bisa saling menghargai waktu ‘me time’ masing-masing. Baik kamu dan pasangan butuh waktu untuk memiliki ruang dan waktu pribadi. Ada waktu untuk bekerja kehidupan pribadi maupun waktu bersama dengan pasangan. Jadi semuanya bisa seimbang tanpa harus ada yang hilang.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3BhbGVtYmFuZy50cmlidW5uZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzA1L3Byb2ZpbC1hcmktd2lib3dvLXBlbWVyYW4tcGFrLWhhcnRhd2FuLWF5YWgtYWxkZWJhcmFuLXNpbmV0cm9uLWlrYXRhbi1jaW50YS1wZXJuYWgtZGl0dWR1aC1tZW5jdXJp0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vcGFsZW1iYW5nLnRyaWJ1bm5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzA5LzA1L3Byb2ZpbC1hcmktd2lib3dvLXBlbWVyYW4tcGFrLWhhcnRhd2FuLWF5YWgtYWxkZWJhcmFuLXNpbmV0cm9uLWlrYXRhbi1jaW50YS1wZXJuYWgtZGl0dWR1aC1tZW5jdXJp?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Profil Ari Wibowo Pemeran Pak Hartawan Ayah Aldebaran Sinetron Ikatan Cinta: Pernah Dituduh Mencuri,"SRIPOKU.COM - Berikut profil Ari Wibowo muka lama namun pemain baru di Sinetron Ikatan Cinta yang menjadi pemeran Pak Hartawan.

Many lonely corners of Utah harbor sites of these former communities. Royal and Cisco are two such decrepit and forgotten towns.

Royal

In the 1880s the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad company was expanding its lines through southeastern Utah and discovered rich valuable coal deposits along the way. Coal was a primary source of energy and extracting and transporting it served as the economic backbone of many small towns in Carbon and Emery Counties.

One such coal mining town named for its location in Bear Canyon just north of present-day Helper bustled with activity in the early 20th Century. Trains came and went moving coal and mine tailings. Dozens of homes sprouted between the canyon slopes and the town carried on as various mining companies bought claims to the area and renamed the settlement Cameron then Rolapp and finally Royal the name by which it is remembered.

Scott Wheeler a present-day resident of Carbon County remembers that railroad and mining companies recruited laborers from Europe and Asia to boost production — and the workers often suffered oppressive conditions.

Wheeler’s mother Phyllis Keele Wheeler moved from Royal to Price when she was in fourth grade and Scott Wheeler has photographs of his mother’s second grade class; a group of over 20 students taught in Royal and also a 1942 shot of his grandfather with a group of more than 100 miners wearing their work clothes and smeared with dirt posing in Royal. In the decade following that photograph coal went into decline and people moved away from Royal.

Wheeler makes a hobby of creating historical “double” photographs. He seeks out old photos of interesting local subjects finds the vantage from which they were taken and recreates the shot in the present-day. One of these “doubles” shows a view of his mother’s childhood hometown one taken in 1922 and the other in 2017. The distinct cliffs and peaks are nearly identical but in one photo they frame rows of rooftops and in the other a lonely dirt road winding through trees and shrubs along the deserted canyon bottom. Wheeler plans to make a 100-year double using the same photograph next year.

Cisco

Many of the structures that made up the town of Cisco Utah have not disappeared though most are in deep disrepair. The town located northeast of Moab on the Colorado River was once a crucial watering stop for the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad. The train stop seeded further industry and population: stores hotels and restaurants developed to accommodate workers and travelers and later ranchers and sheepherders used Cisco as a supply source and to transport their products.

Later vanadium uranium oil and gas deposits were discovered near Cisco and contributed to the economy there. However with the decline of steam engines the town became less important as a rail stop. In the 1970s the new Interstate 70 allowing east-west transit completely bypassed the town of Cisco and the population eventually dwindled to zero.

Scenic Highway 128 passes through Cisco and the abandoned town has been a curiosity to motor-tourists and river-runners who use a put-in near Cisco to access the popular Westwater Canyon stretch of the Colorado River.

In recent years the town’s allure has attracted some new official occupants. Eileen Muza purchased property in Cisco and took up residence there and started an artist-in-residence program called Home of the Brave.

In 2019 Jean and Alan Murawski opened up the Buzzard’s Belly General Store a unique shop in a historic building which they restored that sells not only food drink and sundries but also an eclectic selection of years’ worth of thrift antique and yard sale finds of Jean’s.

Opening a vintage store had been a dream of Jean’s for years and the couple was proud to open the remodeled building and pleased to see steady business — before the coronavirus forced months of closure. Cisco may have felt more like a ghost town during that time but the Murawskis are back open again and doing business.

“We hung in there” said Jean. “We’re open now!”

Cathie Wood predicted Tesla's stock price will quadruple in about four years suggested Zoom could replace legacy companies like Cisco in enterprise communications and praised Robinhood for attracting young people to investing in a Yahoo Finance interview this week.

The Ark Invest chief and popular stock picker also responded to billionaire investor John Paulson's recent dismissal of cryptocurrencies brushed off concerns about market bubbles and reiterated her view that a technological revolution is coming.

Here are Wood's 8 best quotes from the interview lightly edited and condensed for clarity:

1. ""Our base case for Tesla is $3000."" — Wood expects Elon Musk's electric-vehicle company to quadruple its market capitalization to nearly $3 trillion by 2025 partly because its global market share has increased ""fairly dramatically"" in the past five years.

2. ""Many people think of Zoom as nothing more than these video sessions. We think it's going to start taking more share of the communications stack in technology. Zoom is on its way to usurping the role of players like Cisco. It's not just about video and stay-at-home or even hybrid it's much bigger than that.""

3. ""Robinhood has introduced a whole new generation to investing thinking about their future and learning the hard way. Some have experimented with options — it doesn't take long to lose a lot of money with options and they learn quickly. I actually think Robinhood has done a great service to the investment community.""

4. ""John Paulson made an incredible call during the mortgage crisis. What we think he's missing about cryptocurrencies is they're much more than a store of value or digital gold. Bitcoin is a new global monetary system that is completely decentralized and not subject to the whims of policymakers.""

5. ""If regulators get together and agree what exactly these cryptocurrencies are how to define them that will be a good thing. Certainty will be a good thing for this ecosystem.""

6. ""This is the echo of the baby boom. I lived through the baby-boom years and that equity-market move it was magnificent. I do feel we are in the same place now."" — predicting the bull market will continue for another decade.

7. ""We have never been in a period in history where we've had five major innovation platforms involving 14 different technologies all moving into ""S"" curves the curves feeding one another. We're in a period of explosive innovation. ""

8. ""Are we in a bubble? We couldn't be further from it. The average investor doesn't understand how provocative these next five to 15 years are going to be as these S curves feed one another and enter exponential growth trajectories that we have never seen before.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvdHJpcGxlai9uZXdzL3ZheHRoZW5hdGlvbi1hdXNzaWUtbXVzaWMtY2FtcGFpZ24tZ2V0LWphYi1nZXQtbGl2ZS1tdXNpYy1iYWNrLzEzNTI5MDI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get the jab get live music back: Aussie music scene launches #VaxTheNation - triple j,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/vaxthenation-aussie-music-campaign-get-jab-get-live-music-back/13529024 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvdHJpcGxlai9uZXdzL3ZheHRoZW5hdGlvbi1hdXNzaWUtbXVzaWMtY2FtcGFpZ24tZ2V0LWphYi1nZXQtbGl2ZS1tdXNpYy1iYWNrLzEzNTI5MDI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Goldman Sachs Group is hiring bankers from rival firms Citigroup and HSBC Holdings as the US lender seeks to expand its business in the Middle East amid a surge in deals from the region.

Jassim AlSane a senior Citigroup banker will join Goldman Sachs’ Dubai office in November as managing director and the co-head of investment banking operations for the Middle East and North Africa. Also Omar AlZaim is joining the bank as an executive director and the head of investment banking for Saudi Arabia according to a spokesman for the bank.

The hirings come as deal activity picks up in the Middle East fuelled by governments and state-owned firms looking for new ways to raise money and diversify their economies after last year’s slump in revenue from oil sales.

Mergers and acquisitions activity in the Middle East and Africa region has more than doubled this year to about $125 billion (€105 billion) according to data compiled by Bloomberg boosted by deals like a $12.4 billion stake in Saudi Aramco’s oil pipelines.

Goldman Sachs is also beginning to win new business in Abu Dhabi after it was sidelined by some of the emirate’s biggest firms about two years ago following a lawsuit by wealth fund Mubadala Investment to recover losses from its dealings with Malaysia’s 1MDB fund.

Representatives for Citigroup and HSBC declined to comment.

Deal pipeline

Goldman Sachs is poised for a lead role in the potential initial public offering of Emirates Global Aluminium in Abu Dhabi a deal which could value the business at more than $15 billion (€13 billion) people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News on Thursday.

It’s also working with JPMorgan Chase to advise Saudi Aramco on the sale of a stake in a subsidiary that controls its natural gas pipelines people familiar told Bloomberg in July and was one of the joint bookrunners on Qatar Petroleum’s $12.5 billion (€11 billion) bond sale the same month.

AlSane will join Goldman Sachs after spending more than 13 years at Citigroup where he was most recently a managing director in the investment banking division. AlZaim will start in the autumn and will be based in Riyadh in his new role. He will replace Eyas AlDossari who left the bank earlier this year to join the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund.

At Goldman AlSane will work together with Selma Hassan who was appointed as the bank’s head of MENA investment bank in 2019 to help boost the bank’s business with sovereign wealth funds and large corporates.

AlSane began as an analyst at Citigroup in 2008 before rising to become a managing director last year according to his LinkedIn profile.

Some groups say they continue to be contacted by American citizens in Afghanistan who did not register with the U.S. Embassy before it closed and by others not included in previous counts because they expressed misgivings about leaving loved ones behind.

As for green card holders they have lived in the U.S. for years paid taxes become part of their communities and often have children who are U.S. citizens. Yet the administration says it does not have an estimate on the number of such permanent residents who are in Afghanistan and desperately trying to escape Taliban rule.

“The fear is that nobody is looking for them” said Howard Shen spokesman for the Cajon Valley Union School District in the San Diego area that is in contact with one such family who says they cannot get out.

“They are thousands of miles away under an oppressive regime and we’re leaving them behind” he said. “That’s not right.”

Stung by the U.S. military’s chaotic and deadly retreat President Biden has promised that evacuation efforts will continue for the 100 to 200 American citizens who want to leave most of whom he said are dual citizens. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that extends to green card holders and Afghans who supported the U.S. government during the 20-year war.

It’s unclear how that will work without an active U.S. military presence in the country and the Taliban-controlled Kabul airport a major way out of the country now closed. But an undersecretary of state said this past week that all American citizens and permanent residents who could not get evacuation flights or were otherwise stranded had been contacted and told to expect further details about routes out once those have been arranged.

Three school districts in California say they know of more than 30 children enrolled in their schools who have not been able to return. One family who has lived in Sacramento for years has been texting daily with their children’s elementary school principal while trying to escape.

The parents and three children — all legal U.S. residents — went to Afghanistan in April to care for their sick grandmother after being unable to do so for months because of COVID-19 restrictions. Caught by surprise by the quick Taliban takeover the family members were unable to get through the crush of thousands of people at the airport in Kabul before the last U.S. plane left Aug. 31.

Now they fear they will be forgotten by the U.S. government especially since they are not American citizens.

“I’m loosing the hope” the mother who is not being named to protect her safety texted in broken English to Principal Nate McGill who urged her to not give up.

McGill said California Democratic Rep. Doris Matsui who has been working to free the family tried to help them board a flight in Afghanistan. But they were pushed back. The family whose three children are in first third and fourth grade fled amid tear gas and gunfire as U.S. forces and the Taliban tried to control the crowd.

“We run away from the gate. Situation is very scary. Kids are crying because of these firing” the mother texted later adding: “I totally lost my mind sir ... today I saw my death.”

Mohammad Faizi a green card holder from the San Diego suburb of El Cajon said he and his wife and five children were stopped by the Taliban at a checkpoint on their way to the airport. His wife is a U.S. citizen.

Faizi whose family got out just before the last U.S. flight left said he was asked at the checkpoint why he was trying to leave Afghanistan. “I told him ‘That’s our country. That’s my nation. We’re living there. So we have to get out of here.’''

The Taliban which are in need of foreign aid have said they will allow people with valid travel papers to leave and the international community says it will be monitoring to see if they keep their word.

Mike Jason who runs an ad-hoc rescue operation called Allied Airlift 21 said his volunteer group has been in contact with 78 green card holders trapped in the country but that the figure does not capture the scale of the problem. Add their spouses and children to the tally he said and the number rises to nearly 400.

Jason and others say they also believe the number of U.S. citizens is much higher than 200 people and is misleading because it does not include their family members who may be green card holders. Allied Airlift has identified 45 U.S. citizens in the country but has documents on more than 250 family members stuck there with them.

Such volunteers say they are also skeptical of the government’s estimate because it only includes American citizens who registered with the U.S. Embassy before it was shuttered in Kabul a process that was entirely voluntary.

Alex Plitsas an Iraq War veteran who is part of an informal rescue network called Digital Dunkirk said he received calls from six U.S. citizens stuck in Afghanistan in just one day earlier this week — and none had registered with the U.S. Embassy.

He suspects the true number of U.S. citizens left behind could be off by hundreds.

“Those names are starting to trickle out now” said Plitsas a former civilian intelligence officer in Afghanistan. “I expect that number to rise significantly.”

Plitsas said he’s also handled pleas from more than 100 U.S. green card holders trying to leave over the past two weeks and says they should get just as much attention as U.S. citizens.

“They live here” he said. “They’re our folks.”

Republican Rep. Darrell Issa’s office said he is working to evacuate an 80-year-old couple who are both U.S. citizens and live in San Diego County along with two other families from his congressional district that covers El Cajon.

The administration says 6000 U.S. citizens made it out most on U.S. military flights.

Issa said he believes the number of U.S. citizens still there and wanting to leave is closer to 500. That includes roughly the number the State Department says made clear they want to leave and additional U.S. citizens who were not counted because they expressed concern about “leaving behind family members to die.”

If you include the family members of U.S. citizens the number of people could be as high as 1000 he added.

“Unless we continue and get the rest of our American citizens and all those otherwise eligible out we won’t have done our job” Issa said.

Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska a former Air Force officer receiving calls for help in the rescue effort said the Biden administration needs to give a full accounting of those left behind and stop limiting its official tally to U.S. citizens.

“The problem is it doesn’t include families” he said. “They’re lowballing the numbers.”

Rescue coordinator Chuck Nadd an Afghanistan veteran said the numbers being reported back to him by 180 Digital Dunkirk volunteers suggest there are hundreds of green card holders desperate to get out.

Among them are the three Sacramento schoolchildren whose mother recently texted their principal a photo of them with forlorn faces and handmade signs reading “Take us out of Afghanistan please” and “I am SO scared here.”

The Blue Rocks are the High-A affiliate of the Washington Nationals. They play at Daniel J. Frawley Stadium on Judy Johnson Field. The stadium is named after the Mayor who implemented the return of the team back in 1993 and Judy Johnson was a local Negro league star. The team is named for the blue granite rocks that are found on the shore of the nearby Brandywine River.

A few notable players on the Blue Rocks roster include Yasel Antuna Drew Mendoza Israel Pineda and Joan Adon. Some players who were on the team earlier in the year include Cade Cavalli Jackson Rutledge and Gage Canning.



Their opponent for the evening was the Jersey Shore BlueClaws coincidentally a Phillies affiliate so I was familiar with most of the names on the roster such as Ethan Lindow Erik Miller Dominic Pipkin Logan O’Hoppe Carlos De La Cruz and Adam Haseley.

Both teams came into the game having underwhelming records with Wilmington at 43-52 and Jersey Shore at 41-52. However minor league baseball isn’t always about stats and records. Developing players is the priority for the major league organization in most cases.

Let’s get into how my time was At The Ballpark:

Driving and Parking

The park is 45 minutes south of Philadelphia via I-95 South and is located about two miles off the exit. Parking was free which was a pleasant surprise. There were plenty of parking spots in two big lots adjacent to the stadium.

Food and Concessions

Prior to arriving at the park I dined at Del Pez a Mexican Restaurant two blocks from the stadium and enjoyed it very much. The staff was very nice and were happy to hear we came from Philadelphia to visit the area. The food was very good especially the nachos and shrimp tacos. I highly recommend it if you’re in the area. There are many dining options to choose from if you want to eat before the game and a quick search will show them.

Going to a ballgame isn’t complete without eating the food at the park so I made sure I saved room for what they had to offer. There are three food options here – Chickie’s and Pete’s The Greene Turtle and Grotto Pizza. Since I’ve had Chickie’s and Pete’s many times I wanted to try something different – the Funnel Cake Fries from the Greene Turtle. They’re a variation on funnel cake made in the shape of fries and they were delicious. The hot dog wasn’t bad either. I’ve had better but had worse too. There were other standard options such as hamburgers pizza and sausages which I’ll try at future games.

The team store is aptly named The Quarry and had many shirts and hats to choose from. There were also baseball cards cups glasses and other normal merchandise you would find in any team store. The one employee in there told me she’s been working there for years and loves seeing all the friendly faces each game.

Promotions

There were five promotions going on that evening:

1 – Wizardry Night – I had no idea what this would entail but the website assured its readers that the team was up to no good that night and offered an exclusive gift with ticket purchase. Upon arriving at the park the giveaways were a scarf that was made in the Harry Potter colors along with a cup of “Butterbeer” which was actually cream soda. I suppose the team couldn’t use the Harry Potter name so they named it as they did.

2 – Tito’s Tuesday – Discounted prices on Tito’s Vodka drink for fans over the age of 21.

3 – Truly Tuesday – Discounted prices on Truly Hard Seltzers from 6pm until 7:30pm.

4 – Bark In The Park – Fans could bring their canine friends into the park to enjoy baseball with them.

5 – Job Fair – Representatives from about 10 local businesses were at tables handing out giveaways and discussing job opportunities with seekers. The cool part of this was that if you brought a resume to the park you received a free ticket to the game.

Entertainment

The team has three mascots to entertain fans during games – Rocky Bluewinkle is a blue moose Mr. Celery is a stalk of celery and Rubble is a blue rock. Rubble was nowhere to be found during my visit but Rocky was all over the place providing high-fives and taking pictures with anyone who asked. Mr. Celery is a rather interesting creature. He lives inside the stadium and comes out from the left-field gate whenever the Blue Rocks score a run. He does a quick dance to Blur’s Song 2 (Woo-Hoo song) then retreats back to his secluded hiding place. I asked a few of the workers what the celery’s significance to Blue Rocks is but nobody seemed to know. If anyone knows the connection between the two please let me know because I’m stumped.

There were three between-innings games to pass the time – kids racing a stuffed horse kids putting a golf ball and kids racing to gather items to fill up a bucket. Pretty similar to what you see at most minor league parks.

The Game

The BlueClaws won the game 9-8 in 13 innings on a sacrifice bunt by Nicolas Torres and a throwing error by Blue Rock pitcher Davis Moore. Both teams scored a run each in the 10th and 12th innings but Jersey Shore held the Wilmington scoreless in the bottom of the 13th to get Ben Brown the win.

A few interesting observations I saw:

There were only two umpires calling the game which I learned from an employee is normal for High-A games.

The BlueClaws’s bat-person was actually one of their pitchers Ethan Lindow.

There were no ball-people in the outfield so it was common to see third basemen or outfielders track down foul balls to clear them off the field

Dominic Pipkin another BlueClaws pitcher was charting pitches out of the dugout for the team.

Some quick thoughts on a few players:

Logan O’Hoppe: It’s been said that O’Hoppe has great intangibles and they were on display tonight. On groundballs to shortstop and third base in his first two at-bats he hustled down the line both times. I noticed him a few times motioning to the pitcher to calm down or keep the ball low and another time pumping his fist after the pitcher struck out a batter. Coincidentally O’Hoppe was promoted to AA the next day and we wish him great success for the Reading Fightin Phils!

D.J. Stewart: Stewart hit a monster shot out of the stadium in his first at-bat. He then hit another ball to the warning track. He’s having his best season this year numbers-wise.

Jhordany Mezquita: Mezquita didn’t look bad his first inning but the second inning did him in. He gave up 6 runs on 4 singles and 2 doubles that inning.

Jonathan Guzman: Guzman looked pretty smooth defensively turning double plays with ease and having an accurate arm on plays at first base.

Yasel Antuna: The ball sounds different coming off Antuna’s bat. He smoked two sharp singles during the game and made some good plays in the field too.

Ben Pelletier: In his debut game for the BlueClaws he hit a home run and made a great catch in the outfield too. He’s someone I will be keeping my eye on going forward.

Overall it was a fun night at the park. The weather was nice the food was great and the game had an exciting ending. This sentence my son said to me sums up the experience well. “Everyone here was so nice and it was so much fun.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdGhhdGJhbGxzb3V0dGFoZXJlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzA0L3dhdGNoLXBoaWxsaWVzLXBpdGNoZXItcmFuZ2VyLXN1YXJlei1yYmktZG91YmxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WATCH: Ranger Suárez does it all for the Phillies,More. 5 Things you probably didn’t know about Ranger Suárez. light,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS9tb25leS9pbmNvbWUtdGF4LWZvcm1zLWZvci1leGVtcHRpb24tZnJvbS1pLXQtcmV0dXJucy1mb3Itc2VuaW9yLWNpdGl6ZW5zLW9mLTc1LXllYXJzLWFib3ZlLW5vdGlmaWVkLTIzMjQzNTAv0gGTAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbGV4cHJlc3MuY29tL21vbmV5L2luY29tZS10YXgtZm9ybXMtZm9yLWV4ZW1wdGlvbi1mcm9tLWktdC1yZXR1cm5zLWZvci1zZW5pb3ItY2l0aXplbnMtb2YtNzUteWVhcnMtYWJvdmUtbm90aWZpZWQtMjMyNDM1MC9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forms for exemption from I-T returns for senior citizens of 75 years & above notified,"The income tax department has notified declaration forms to be filed by senior citizens aged 75 years and above with the banks to get exemption from filing I-T return for fiscal year 2021-22.

The 2021-22 Budget had introduced a provision for exempting senior citizens of 75 years and above having pension income and interest from fixed deposit in the same bank from filing income tax returns for the financial year beginning April 1.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has now notified rules and declaration forms which senior citizens would have to file with the specified bank who in turn would deduct tax on pension and interest income and deposit with the government.

What are the consequences of PAN becoming inoperative due to non-linkage to Aadhaar? ITR Filing 2024: Without this document you can’t claim income tax deduction on home loan interest

Such exemption from ITR filing would be available only in case where the interest income is earned in the same bank where pension is deposited.

The income-tax act requires all individuals having income exceeding the threshold limit to file their income-tax returns. While the threshold for senior citizens (60 years or more) and super senior citizens (80 years or more) is slightly higher crossing the threshold saddles one to file tax-returns.

Non-filing of tax return not only attracts penalties and but one also gets subject to higher rate of TDS.

Nangia & Co LLP Director Itesh Dodhi said recognising the compliance burden on senior citizens this year’s budget brought in some relief to the senior citizens above the age of 75.

“The CBDT has notified the forms (Form 12BBA) for declaration by the senior citizens to the banks and notified the reporting requirement by the specified banks. With dedicated counters for senior citizens in all major banks and banks providing doorstep banking to senior citizen this measure is expected to make life easier for senior citizens” Dodhi added.

In the Budget Speech 2021-22 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that in the 75th year of Independence of our country the government shall reduce compliance burden on senior citizens who are 75 years of age and above.

“For senior citizens who only have pension and interest income I propose exemption from filing their income tax returns. The paying bank will deduct the necessary tax on their income” she had said."

Until four years ago garbage disposal meant one thing to Savitri Bai Patil - stinking putrefied heaps of trash spread around her neighbourhood in Pune  in western India.But now the streets of the Ashok Meadows housing complex where she lives are clear with workers picking up garbage from residents' doorsteps each day and turning some of it into electricity.Since 2017 the complex has fed its food waste into a digester that converts it into biogas used to light the area's streetlights park social club and gym.""Clean energy from our rancid food leftovers  vegetable peels and other such throwaways? It is unbelievable how the concept of waste management has changed in the past few years"" Bai Patil 62 told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Biogas generators like the one used in Ashok Meadows are now installed in more than 75 locations across India.Developed by Xeon Waste Managers (XWM) based in Pune the EnergyBin systems let communities turn waste into free renewable energy  said company president Jalaj Kumar Chaturvedi.""It is a common sight to find overburdened landfills with garbage that grows by the day. But since these EnergyBins dispose of the waste at the source itself the landfills are spared"" he said.According to Ashok Meadows resident Rishika Mahalley the complex's system - operated and maintained by residents - has helped solve the problem of how to dispose of the nearly a tonne of garbage produced each day by the complex's 550 homes and common areas.Before the community bought the generator at the cost of 2.3 million Indian rupees ($31000) it struggled with unreliable municipal garbage collection which often left waste piling up Mahalley noted.But ""we have now gotten rid of the buzzing flies scourge of mosquitoes and other insects besides of course the stink that came from the vats where the garbage would be left until the municipal vehicles arrived to collect them"" she said.Each day waste pickers paid by the Ashok Meadows residents put between 550 kg and 600 kg (1300 pounds) of food waste into the biogas plant Mahalley said.As the organic matter breaks down it produces a flammable gas made up mainly of methane and carbon dioxide.The methane is then pressurized and piped into a power generator that burns the gas to convert it into 50 kilowatt-hours of electricity for the community each day.Mahalley said before the plant was installed the complex spend about 550 rupees ($7.50) a day on electricity for streetlights and other common facilities - a cost that has now virtually disappeared.It also saves the residents up to Rs 6000 ($82) every month on municipal garbage disposal costs she said.The biggest benefit of biogas plants - which are becoming increasingly popular around the world as a way to create climate-smart energy - is their ability to reduce emissions said Jitendra S. Sangwai a chemical engineering professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai.In particular by capturing climate-changing gases that would normally be released into the atmosphere when organic matter decays in the open such technology can curb emissions of methane gas a potent short-term driver of climate change.While many small-scale biogas digesters are in operation around the globe for now the costs and climate benefits of large biogas generators like EnergyBins are limited to communities that can afford them Sangwai added.The systems can be expensive to buy set up and maintain he said.But XWM president Chaturvedi said the digesters provide multiple benefits.Besides cutting electricity and rubbish collection costs some municipalities can tap into property tax rebates offered to residents who process their own organic waste part of an effort to ease the heavy burden on landfills he said.""With that tax concession and the other savings the generators pay for themselves in three years"" he said.At the South Eastern Railways (SER) headquarters a complex of offices and staff residences in Kolkata a 1000-kg-capacity XWM biogas generator has been operating since January 2020.It services a complex that houses 1200 homes a market a social club and a hospital which has a kitchen that generates food waste throughout the day.Prior to the installation of the digester a once-daily municipal collection was not enough to get rid of all of the food leftovers produced said the hospital's senior dietician Dr. Sanchita Mazumder.""It was a nightmare to dispose of so much waste. We had to dig holes in the backyard to dump it"" she said adding that stray animals would then dig up the garbage and spread it around the complex.That has not been a problem since the biogas unit was installed she said noting that the gas generated from the kitchen's garbage has helped the hospital reduce its use of LPG gas for cooking by 80%.Having a better way to dispose of waste has also cut littering around the complex said Altaf Hussain head of the SER conservancy department.""The best part is how the community is learning to adopt clean garbage disposal methods"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvdG9reW8tcGFyYWx5bXBpY3MvZGV2ZW5kcmEtamhhamhhcmlhLWdldHMtYS1oZXJvcy13ZWxjb21lLW15LW1lZGFsLWlzLWEtc291cmNlLW9mLWVuZXJneS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NTk0MzQzOS5jbXPSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3Rva3lvLXBhcmFseW1waWNzL2RldmVuZHJhLWpoYWpoYXJpYS1nZXRzLWEtaGVyb3Mtd2VsY29tZS1teS1tZWRhbC1pcy1hLXNvdXJjZS1vZi1lbmVyZ3kvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg1OTQzNDM5LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Devendra Jhajharia gets a hero's welcome: 'My medal is a source of energy',JAIPUR: Since the day Devendra Jhajharia became the only Indian to have won three medals in consecutive outings at the Paralympics  he has been on his toes attending endless calls and functions. If at one end he is exhausted on the other he is savouring the moments he had worked for intensively in the past so many years.“I have not rested properly but my medal is a source of energy for me.I look at it once and it re-energises me” said the javelin thrower  who arrived in Jaipur to a rousing welcome on Saturday.Jhajharia won the silver at Tokyo Paralympics in the javelin throw F46 event and completed the treble of medals. In the previous two Paralympics he had won gold in Athens 2004 and Rio 2016.Recalling the sequence of events in Tokyo the 40-year-old athlete said that after the first two throws 60.28 metres and 60.62 metres his coach Sunil Tanwar pumped him up saying ‘medal chaahiye itna tez throw kar phir bhaley haath nikal jaaye’ (We want a medal. Even if it comes at the expense of hurting your hand throw the spear with maximum force and do it).“My warm-up throw was 62 metres. But when the event starts things change. After the first two throws a lot of things were going in my head but I did not lose my confidence and did not get disturbed. And my coach told me to put in the maximum effort even if your hand has to be sacrificed in the process let it be but you have to win the medal. Josh aa gaya tha coach ki baat sunkey (coach’s words gave me a lot of energy and focus)” said the para athlete from Churu district.Jhajharia’s best throw of 64.35 metres that earned him the silver came in the third attempt.Jhajharia believes that India’s sporting culture has changed and now the focus should be on getting our name in the top 20 countries in the medal count at the flagship sporting event.“Now we have the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) scheme in place athletes can have an access to their choice of coach physiotherapist trainer and can also go to foreign countries for training. Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacting with the athletes before during and after the tournament is a big thing and his involvement I will say shows the kind of sports culture we have built. The sporting landscape in our country has changed massively. Now in the coming years the aim should be to ensure we are among the top 20 countries in the medal tally.”The para javelin thrower feels that it is the state governments which also need to step up and create infrastructure that can support para athletes. “All the state governments need to make a lot of effort. First thing is working on the infrastructure where the training facilities cater to the needs of a para athlete. You won’t find any facilities for them anywhere and state governments are not investing in it. At most stadiums and sports centres there is no wheelchair accessibility this shows what exactly is the situation” he remarked.Though his cabinet is glittering with all the possible medals an athlete wishes for the veteran is in no mood to call it quits anytime soon. “Till the day I have enough strength in my hand I will play. Age is just a number and the hat-trick of medals at the highest level is a testimony to that” Jhajharia concluded.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy90ZXNsYS1tYXktcmVsZWFzZS0yNTAwMC1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItd2l0aG91dC1hLXN0ZWVyaW5nLXdoZWVsLWluLTIwMjMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODU5MTg1MDcuY21z0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9yZW5ld2FibGVzL3Rlc2xhLW1heS1yZWxlYXNlLTI1MDAwLWVsZWN0cmljLWNhci13aXRob3V0LWEtc3RlZXJpbmctd2hlZWwtaW4tMjAyMy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODU5MTg1MDcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla may release $25000 electric car without a steering wheel in 2023,"EV calculator How much will I save if I choose an electric vehicle?

For instance I like to run naked through fields of wheat. (That's fair warning in case we go on a road trip together.) As far as the other vices there's only one that's germane to this article. It's Coke with a capital C as in Coca-Cola. Diet Coca-Cola.

I know full well all the reasons I shouldn't drink it but there are so many ""sinful"" things I avoid can't I just have this one little dietary transgression?

While you mull that over let me tell you why Coke is the subject of this article. I've long known that some competitive bicyclists like to drink flattened cola drinks during races for some perceived energy boost.

It's a strategy I sometimes employ too before working out a least when I'm out of Spike® only with me it's Diet Coke and I don't bother letting it go flat because a little case of the burpies certainly isn't going to affect my weight lifting. Besides they often add a little zest to my Valsalva maneuvers.

However I wasn't aware of any actual research on whether Coke (or cola beverages in general) regular or diet truly has any ergogenic benefits. Until now.

A team of scientists writing in the European Journal of Applied Physiology assessed the ergogenic effects of different flattened cola drinks on performance in competitive cyclists.

They also determined whether the ergogenic effects if any were a result of the caffeine or the sugar. It turned out that Coke or more precisely cola drinks really are ergogenic which is kind of like finding out that chocolate donuts make you lose weight.

That's surprising enough but the answer to what it was that provides a kick to the padded spandex shorts is what was really eye-opening.

What They Did and What They Found The scientists recruited 13 competitive cyclists to participate in a randomized double-blind crossover design study. Each cyclist completed 45 minutes of a ""constant power bout"" at 69% of their maximum workload during which time they consumed a total of 16 ml/kg (divvied up into four drinks) of flattened decaf diet cola (the placebo) caffeinated diet cola (diet cola) and cola containing caffeine and sugar (regular cola). Ratings of perceived exertion were lower with both the regular cola and diet cola than with the placebo. Likewise the regular cola and diet cola similarly increased mean power minimum power and total work (but not peak power). A Little Duck Snort of Coffee

What their findings suggest is that it was the caffeine that provided all the ergogenic assistance; that sugar didn't do squat. Regardless of the cause the researchers concluded the following: ""We provide evidence supporting the consumption of commercially available cola for high-intensity cycling in competitive cyclists."" Now you have to admit that it's a bit surprising that the sugar (pure rapidly assimilated carbohydrate) in the colas didn't provide any additional ergogenic benefits in the form of temporary energy. However there might be another factor at play: diet colas generally contain more caffeine than regular colas. An 8-ounce serving of the former has about 32 mg. of caffeine compared to the latter's 25 mg. So assuming a cyclist weighs about 150 pounds and based on the described dosage of 16 ml of cola per kilogram of body weight the diet cola cyclists ingested about 144 mg. of caffeine compared to the 112 mg. ingested by the regular full-caf full-sugar cola drinkers. Could a difference of just 32 mg. of caffeine have ""made up"" for the lack of sugar so that both drinks provided roughly the same amount of ergogenic aid? Maybe if the cyclists were ""caffeine naïve"" but there's nothing in the study that I saw to indicate they were. Of course both 112 mg. and 144 mg. of caffeine are only a little duck snort of caffeine especially when you consider that an equivalent amount of coffee would provide approximately 428 mg of caffeine. Could there be something else in the cola that's helping increase performance? Maybe. Let's look at another study one that probably escaped the notice of the current researchers. A Kick in the Kola Nuts Richardson et al. (2016) compared the effects of regular coffee decaf coffee decaf plus powdered caffeine and water plus powdered caffeine on squat performance. We don't need to get into all the details but the coffee group and the decaf plus caffeine group were able to squat more than the caffeine-only group the decaf-only group and the placebo group. The weight lifted by the coffee group was significantly higher than the placebo group but not significantly higher than the decaf group. If you tease the results apart you see that it apparently wasn't just the caffeine that provided coffee's oomph. Somehow the coffee and the caffeine worked together to make the athletes stronger and even coffee without any caffeine worked almost as well as regular coffee. If that weren't the case the water plus caffeine would work as well as caffeinated coffee. The answer might be in the polyphenols contained in coffee. It appears in the Richardson study at least that these plant chemicals are somehow improving performance which brings me back to the colas. The original formula of Coca-Cola contained actual kola nuts which in addition to caffeine are filled with epicatechins D-catechins tannic acids and probably a ton of other polyphenols. Unfortunately the Coca-Cola Company stopped using kola nut extracts in its Coke in 2016. Regardless Coke contains a whole mess of other ingredients some of which are unknown to all but a few people (and not two who as legend claims never travel on the same airplane together). Many ingredients however are known. A 2015 study identified at least 58 aroma compounds in common colas among them vanilla cinnamon nutmeg orange and lemon essential oils and probably coriander and neroli oil. Am I suggesting that these tiny amounts of cola polyphenols might act like the polyphenols in coffee and confer ergogenic aid? It's possible. Take a look at vanilla for instance. It alone contains a vast array of polyphenols with some 200 volatile constituents. It's just peculiar that the cola study showed an increase in performance given the small amount of caffeine involved. The X factor could be the polyphenols which are inherent to both coffee and cola (although much less so in the latter). Of course I could just be nuts. Anyhow it seems that cola drinks regular or diet provide some sort of mild performance enhancement at least as far as high-intensity work is concerned. Maybe we should just leave it at that.

Ades is the global brand for Plant-Based Beverages for the Coca-Cola Company that represents delicious throughout the day nutrition. Bushera’s main raw material millet will be sourced locally.

Melkamu Abebe Managing Director Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in Uganda said Ades Nutri-Bushera does not only boost the beverage company but also to the millet farmers at the grassroots and other supply chain partners.

He also spoke about the company’s commitment to its purpose of refreshing the world while making a significant positive impact on people communities and the planet.

“The launch of Ades Nutri-Bushera is part of our larger strategy to grow sustainably by creating shared opportunities on our journey to becoming a total beverage company. We are therefore extremely excited for what this opportunity means to us as a company and more importantly to the Ugandan farmers who are involved in growing the millet and the employment opportunities that come with setting up a new line” he noted.

“Ades Nutri-Bushera is perfect evidence of our customer obsession. We listened to our customers our consumers and our community and developed a drink that you wanted. We have crafted it to suit your tastes and preferences; and we have packaged it to ensure we meet your standards of health quality and for your convenience as you consume it at home or on the go. We are constantly innovating to give people more of what they want while actively encouraging informed choices and balanced lifestyles.”

Ades Nutri-bushera has been produced and packaged to match the specific taste and quality preferred by the Ugandan consumer. It is a great tasting modification of the traditional drink made in Ugandan households and traditionally consumed at social gatherings such as weddings child naming ceremonies and traditional gatherings.

Launching Ades Nutri-Bushera is another step forward in the ambitious journey undertaken by Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in Uganda to spearhead the BUBU agenda in Uganda. The company has previously unveiled Minute Maid Fruity Boost Mango and Climb Up Milk whose ingredients and packaging are mainly procured locally.

Conrad Van Niekerk Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Regional Managing Director in charge of Uganda Tanzania and Ghana stressed the company’s commitment to supporting BUBU as a way to support the farmers and suppliers.

“We are very happy today as CCBA to have our own Bushera. We made a business decision to focus on local sourcing more than fifteen years ago and it has had significant results.

Everywhere we operate we deliberately find ways of localising our supply chain. We remain focused on our role as an economic contributor and will keep our promise to our people inside and outside of the company” he reassured.

Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in Uganda bottles various non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages at its Rwenzori and Century Bottling plants in Namanve and Mbarara. The beverages include carbonated soft drinks (sodas) juices under the Minute Maid brand Rwenzori Pure Natural Mineral Water and Predator and Power Play Energy drinks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25yb2Vsb2NhbC5vcmcvb2JpdHVhcnktYW5kLWZ1bmVyYWwtc2VydmljZS1oZW5yeS1kYXZpZC1wb3R0cy03Ni1vZi1tb25yb2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary and funeral service: Henry 'David' Potts 76 of Monroe,"Henry (David) Potts age 76 passed away on September 1 2021. He was born on February 19 1945 in Atlanta GA to the late John D. Potts and the late Lucille George Potts.

David grew up in Metro Atlanta and graduated from Rockdale County High School. He married his sweetheart Yvonne in June of 1968 and was drafted into Vietnam just 4 months later where he served in the Army until 1970.

The non-alcoholic soft drink was unveiled on Saturday during a virtual event that featured addresses from Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in Uganda Regional Managing Director in charge of Uganda Tanzania and Ghana Conrad van Niekerk Managing Director Melkamu Abebe and other CCBA directors.

Bushera is typically made and consumed in western Uganda where sorghum a cereal grain is grown.

But in recent years bushera has gained popularity among Kampala residents who say it is healthy because of the natural ingredients.

The first step in making bushera is to mix hot water with sorghum flour which is a source of B vitamins iron zinc and proteins.

While research shows that sorghum may be useful in managing cholesterol and reducing the risk of diabetes bushera manufacturers say that the nutrients found in sorghum also provide energy.

The drink has gained popularity across the country with consumers and manufacturers.

The launch represented the company’s commitment to invest in initiatives that drive the ‘Buy Uganda Build Uganda’ agenda while pursuing its business goals.

Farmers

Melkamu Abebe Managing Director Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in Uganda stated the significance of the launch of Ades Nutri-Bushera not only to the company but also to the millet farmers at the grassroots and other supply chain partners.

He also spoke about the company’s commitment to its purpose of refreshing the world while making a significant positive impact on people communities and the planet.

“The launch of Ades Nutri-Bushera is part of our larger strategy to grow sustainably by creating shared opportunities on our journey to becoming a total beverage company. We are therefore extremely excited for what this opportunity means to us as a company and more importantly to the Ugandan farmers who are involved in growing the millet and the employment opportunities that come with setting up a new line” he noted.

“Ades Nutri – Bushera is perfect evidence of our Customer Obsession. We listened to our Customers our Consumers and our Community and developed a drink that YOU wanted. We have crafted it to suit YOUR tastes and preferences; and we have packaged it to ensure we meet YOUR standards of health quality and for YOUR convenience as you consume it at home or on the go. We are constantly innovating to give people more of what they want while actively encouraging informed choices and balanced lifestyles” Abebe added.

Officials said Ades Nutribushera is a great option for those looking for more varied nutrition from plant ingredients as part of a balanced diet and a great-tasting drink.

Bushera is a traditional health drink made in households from millet and sorghum. It is traditionally brewed and consumed at social gatherings such as weddings child naming ceremonies and traditional gatherings.

According to nutritionists Millet is a very healthy cereal which is very high in starch and a good source of vitamins minerals and organic compounds that can significantly boost the body’s immunity in various ways.

It is also loaded with magnesium calcium manganese phosphorus fibre B vitamins and antioxidants.

“We are very happy today as CCBA to have our own Bushera. We made a business decision to focus on local sourcing more than fifteen years ago and it has had significant results. Everywhere we operate we deliberately find ways of localising our supply chain. We remain focused on our role as an economic contributor and will keep our promise to our people inside and outside of the Company” noted Conrad van Niekerk Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Regional Managing Director in charge of Uganda Tanzania and Ghana as he reiterated the company’s commitment to supporting BUBU as a way to support the farmers and suppliers.

Meanwhile Tesco Asda and other major supermarkets have been left with empty shelves as food shortages hit Britain.

Co-Op’s chief executive Steve Murrells described the current food shortage crisis as being at the “worst level he has ever seen.

Here is a list of UK companies struggling to keep up with demand with messages to customers.

Wetherspoons

Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin has played down the role of Brexit-related driver shortages after the pub chain was hit by beer supply issues.

The group apologised to customers on Wednesday after it said supplies of Heineken Carling and Coors beers ran dry in some pubs.

Mr Martin an ardent supporter of Brexit said the shortages were mainly driven by industrial action in recent weeks by drivers and warehouse staff acting on behalf of Heineken.

“Strenuous efforts are being made to link supply issues to Brexit” the executive chairman said.

“In this case the main link relates to industrial action Brexit gave the power to the UK Government to allow more HGV drivers in should it choose to do so.

“There are supply chain issues in many EU countries following the pandemic.

“It has been widely reported that there are shortages of 400000 HGV drivers in Germany France and Spain for example and Germany in particular is struggling with major worldwide supply chain issues.”

Coca-Cola

Shahid Akhter editor ETHealthworld spoke to SVP & Head of Healthcare Cognizant to know more about the digital innovations that are transforming the way healthcare is administered and delivered.The global pandemic has spurred a tectonic shift in health care. Health care providers around the world have embraced telehealth virtual care  and remote monitoring with speed. Consumer preferences have changed and they are demanding more control over health care decisions whether it’s choosing an insurance benefit or a treatment. And health care players are providing meaningful digital engagements to their consumers while crossing boundaries to deliver care anytime and anywhere.The pandemic has accelerated digital adoption; however it cannot be delivered without interoperability secure data management and digital capabilities built on modern IT infrastructure. While recent market studies show that within the first six months of the pandemic the healthcare industry consumed five years’ worth of digital automation future success will depend on how the industry deploys and sustains this pace of digital adoption.As consumers take a more active role in managing their care they will demand a seamless and real-time collaboration with their providers at various touchpoints of their healthcare journey. The biggest challenge for the business is addressing this increasing demand for hyper-personalized consumer experience  enable and deliver value-based care with improved health outcomes.As economies open an efficient and highly digitized ‘healthcare supply chain’ will play an essential role in how healthcare is sought administered and delivered. Providers that adapt to these shifting realities digitize and prioritize the consumer healthcare experience across entities devices and channels will be best poised to gain market share and consumer loyalty. Getting there will require leveraging advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies/models to enable hyper-personalization of consumer experiences and services modernise core systems and pivot to agile and scalable tech infrastructure.The rise of on-demand healthcare has enabled innovation at scale in the industry. In the new normal access to anywhere anytime personalized healthcare is changing the in-person patient-doctor dynamics. AI Cloud and intelligent machines are transforming the way healthcare is administered and delivered. In high-risk demographics for example diabetic patients are being monitored remotely through smart wearable devices. Linked to a centralized platform the doctors can remotely monitor patients through a seamless and secure data exchange on Cloud.Similarly enabling real-time and easy access to doctors and medical specialists has contributed significantly to expanding on-demand healthcare. However seamless and efficient solutions are key to securely enable and link Telehealth platforms to electronic health and medical records while ensuring data privacy in highly regulated environments.Consumers are at the epicenter as digital technologies continue to make sweeping transformations in healthcare. From making rapid strides in remote patient engagement to automating ‘claims processing’ and ‘authorization’ real-time over the Cloud digital technologies have become great enablers making specialized tasks more efficient and transparent.Spurred by accelerated digital transformation the adoption of emerging technologies is also driving exponential data growth. With data siloed across different data warehouses and transactional systems making informed decisions poses a considerable challenge. ‘Data lakes’ can unleash the true potential of consumer data help build a comprehensive view and steer informed business decisions. Furthermore the Cloud is the new heartbeat of Healthcare IT allowing for solutions that address the industry’s current pain points while paving the way for future innovation and faster time to market.Health Care was one of the first verticals incubated in Cognizant around the beginning of this Millenium. Today it is one of our largest business units and with our market-leading Platforms and Services we are showing strong year-over-year growth. As a pioneer in healthcare technology we continue to invest at the intersection of Healthcare and Digital (by modernizing and digitizing our products and building new digital solutions) - to help our clients with their Digital transformations.A recent example of our client momentum is Johns Hopkins Healthcare an internationally recognized leader in healthcare who turned to us to transition their Medicaid (US government health care program) and commercial lines of business from legacy platforms and operations to our leading BPaaS solution. We'll be providing a modern scalable cloud-based platform to enable Johns Hopkins HealthCare to be a more robust flexible organization that can deliver better more affordable patient outcomes.With healthcare remaining a top priority globally we are enabling leading healthcare providers to transform their business models and provide value-based care that improves health outcomes while lowering overall costs.Health Care providers often struggle to access a patient’s medical history scattered across disparate systems. Interoperability can be a game changer enabling seamless data exchange on a unified data platform. Empowering consumers with complete control of their health information requires innovation across key inflection points in the value chain. For instance a 360-degree patient profile will make it easier to predict the risk to a potential health issue and tailor consumer engagement proactively.Population health management will go a long way in building holistic solutions for humanity ranging from improving chronic disease management to improving vaccination rates and providing preventive care. Once linked through AI and ML technologies there will be better outcomes and improved delivery.Finally digital acceleration has also put the limelight back onto security issues. Much of the world’s move to online involves sharing personal or business information remotely with an ever-wider number of entities. With people suddenly wearing masks facial recognition as a biometric identifier has become a conundrum. One solution may be - ‘Cardio ID’ – which will detect an individual’s unique cardiac rhythms using an infrared laser and turn them into something between a password and a personalizer — truly a future with heart.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vYmlndGhpbmsuY29tL3RoZS1wcmVzZW50L2FpLWRlZXBmYWtlcy1hdmF0YXJzLWJ1c2luZXNzLXdvcmxkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AI avatars bring deepfakes to the business world,"This article was originally published on our sister site Freethink.

A financial consulting firm has created AI avatars for its staff which they can use to quickly create deepfakes of themselves for presentations emails and more.

The challenge: During the pandemic remote work became the norm at many companies and meetings that might have once taken place over lunch happened over the internet instead.

This transition was more difficult for some industries than others and those that traditionally relied on face-time with clients to build relationships and secure deals may have struggled to find their footing.

“As opposed to sending an email and saying ‘Hey we’re still on for Friday’ you can see me and hear my voice.”

—JARED REEDER

“[W]hile much has been written about how to collaborate remotely with coworkers … companies still are trying to figure out the best way to connect with clients over teleconferencing platforms” Snjezana Cvoro-Begovic and James Hartling execs at the software company Cognizant Softvision wrote in Fast Company.

Navigating this new online-first world isn’t just a temporary problem either — even if the pandemic ended tomorrow experts predict that the emphasis on remote work would stick around.

AI avatars: EY the firm formerly known as Ernst & Young thinks “artificial reality identities” (ARIs) are part of the solution.

To create the AI avatars you just read a script in front of a camera for about 40 minutes. Software developed by U.K. startup Synthesia then uses that data to create a virtual double of you.

After that the double can be told to say anything you type out even if it’s written in a language you don’t speak.

Personal touch: Synthesia’s AI avatars aren’t perfect but EY employees have embraced them in emails presentations and more.



“We’re using [them] as a differentiator and reinforcement of who the person is” EY employee Jared Reeder told Wired. “As opposed to sending an email and saying ‘Hey we’re still on for Friday’ you can see me and hear my voice.”

Date 05.09.2021 Read time 4 Min As Formula One heads back to The Netherlands for the first time since 1985 Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team is ready to race in front of a famously passionate crowd.

Having first fallen in love with Formula One in 2017 Meike will be one of many fans eagerly watching the return of Formula One to their home country from the comfort of their own home. This is her story in her own words.

Formula One has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. From playing with little racing cars as a kid to hearing the V8 engines playing in the background on the TV to watching the sport gain more and more recognition in my own country.

But I didn't become an avid F1 fan until the end of 2017 after I spent a day or so watching back some of the older races. I immediately fell in love with the sport and the complexity of it. Ever since then I've been following Formula One closely and race weekends are something I always look forward to.

The Dutch Grand Prix will be my first 'home race' and I'm very excited about it. Even though I unfortunately will not be attending this year I'm looking forward to seeing the whole country turn into racing fans for the weekend. September is usually a strange month for us where we go from the warmer summer season into the colder autumn season. There are often days where we experience all four seasons in one day and it can go from sunny to rainy in a matter of seconds.

I think this will only make it more exciting as we don't really know what to expect for the race. There could be wind rain sun… but no matter what I'm sure it will be a good race.

I'd say the best place to watch the Dutch Grand Prix from is any place with other Formula One fans whether it's your living room or a sports café. It's such a special day that needs to be shared with others.

Race Preview Dutch Grand Prix Formula One returns to The Netherlands for the first time since 1985 but the Dutch Grand Prix is back with a twist. The circuit features an incredibly daunting banked corner and a revised high-speed narrow circuit through the sand dunes of Zandvoort... Discover the circuit

The circuit is very exciting. I've seen a few races in other categories at Zandvoort and they were always really interesting. There seem to be good overtaking opportunities which will only add to the excitement.

Zandvoort is a pretty unique circuit. In terms of elevation however it might be a little similar to the Portimão circuit.

I think the biggest challenge will be Turn One. To have a hairpin corner right at the start of the lap can bring great opportunities for some drivers and make it a lot more difficult for others.

The final corner taken at an 18-degree angle will make the race more exciting. Having such a steep corner will add to the challenge and it'll be interesting to see how drivers deal with it.

The Netherlands is a pretty small country but we have a lot of different cultures and landscapes. Zandvoort is on the coast of the North Sea and even though September isn't the perfect time to go for a swim there are a lot of nice beach restaurants and clubs where you can enjoy the sunset.

Amsterdam is a must-visit in my opinion. It's a beautiful city and it's one of my favourite places. I'd definitely recommend tourists try poffertjes (little pancakes) fries with mayonnaise and bitterballen with mustard (a fried snack).

I have always been a fan of Sebastian Vettel's and his move to Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team made me pay more attention to the team.

I love how the team is open and engages in starting conversations about societal issues in the world. I feel Sebastian gets a lot of support for his activism against climate change.

Overall it seems like such a positive environment and as a Sebastian fan I'm very happy he is in such a good place.

There are so many Formula One moments that are special to me but my favourite is Sebastian's first-ever win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix.

Even though I was only seven years old at the time and don't remember watching it live I have watched it back many times and every time I'm impressed.

I think it's incredible how Sebastian managed the weather conditions so beautifully in a Toro Rosso to become a Grand Prix winner at the team's home race especially in such a competitive season.

My favourite moment of this year by far was Sebastian's second-place finish at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. It was incredible to see Sebastian back on the podium and the race was very exciting and action-packed which made the finish even sweeter.

Everyone in the team seemed so happy and it's definitely the highlight of the season for me so far.

For me Rosh Hashanah has always served as the informal start to fall fashion. And so last year as I facilitated Rosh Hashanah services on Zoom I found myself oddly missing the smells of the synagogue sanctuary on Rosh Hashanah — a combination of new suits and musty tallises.

So when I stumbled on a 1945 ad in Minnesota’s Jewish newspaper The American Jewish World reminding readers anticipating an early Rosh Hashanah to “Send your CLEANING NOW to the Modern Cleaners & Dyers” I couldn’t help but grin. The smell of those musty tallises came right back to me and it brought me joy.

In a time when services were all remote and I mourned my missed fall fashion preview perusing Jewish newspapers’ old Rosh Hashanah ads made me feel connected to the excitement of the Rosh Hashanahs of yesteryear — to in a way all the experiences I like many others was so badly yearning for.

This year as we confront a High Holiday season where some in-person contact is once more possible but many services will remain remote I’d like to invite others to experience that connection. The following ads dating from the 1930s through 1970s are a window into how American Jews of a past era prepared for the new year including through bygone traditions like the sending of annual Rosh Hashanah cards. These ads trace the development of new traditions and routines connected to Rosh Hashanah as we know it in America. And for me at least they’re an important reminder of how precious our communal life is and has always been.

Here are a few of my favorites.

Who wouldn’t want to spend Rosh Hashanah a holiday that celebrates renewal in the fresh air by the sea? I was surprised to see that so many Rosh Hashanah ads as early as the 1920s were for hotels located everywhere from the upstate New York area that would quickly come to be known as the Borscht Belt to Atlantic City NJ. If the quantity of ads speaks to the level of demand to get away for the holiday it’s a wonder that any New York Jews remained in New York City for the High Holidays.

Each hotel highlighted the cantors who would be officiating at its services as well as the amenities of the venue itself including kosher food. I particularly enjoyed a 1944 ad in the Forverts for Rosh Hashanah at Malamut’s Breakers Hotel in Atlantic City. The hotel it boasted in English was the “The Aristocrat of Kosher Hotels in America” — “Something to write home about!”

In 1943 an English Chicago paper The Reform Advocate publicized Malamut’s Hotel Astor in Atlantic City a sister to Malamut’s Breakers Hotel owned by the same prominent Jewish hotel family. “Unusually fine services will be conducted both days Rosh Hashanah Kol Nidre and Yom Kippur in the chapel of the Hotel” the ad stated. My great-great-grandparents owned a hotel in Atlantic City in the 1920s and I like to think that perhaps they might have helped to start this High Holiday trend.

Christmas cards took off as a trend at the end of the 19th century and it seemed natural that eventually that new outlet for consumerism would seep into Jewish holiday celebrations as well. In “The Wonders of America: Reinventing Jewish Culture 1880-1950” Jenna Weissman Joselit explained that due to the small size of the Jewish communities in America holiday greeting cards gained popularity more slowly. But once communities grew she wrote “American Jews came increasingly to rely on the mails to convey the appropriate seasonal sentiments.”

I particularly appreciate this 1935 ad in a Minnesota periodical The American Jewish World which offers something of an admonition: “You need not send individual New Year cards to everybody you know. It is too expensive too bothersome and you can’t remember everybody’s name and address.” Their solution? By paying $1.25 — about $24 in today’s currency — readers could wish all of their “relatives friends and associates” a happy new year by placing a “greeting” in the Rosh Hashanah issue of the newspaper.

By the 1930s advertisers began working to convince new immigrants to cook with as many American-produced ingredients as possible. Some ads focused on ingredients from American companies that would be “necessary” for Rosh Hashanah dishes including baking powder flour and sugar. Baking powder in particular didn’t exist in Eastern Europe and would have been a new ingredient to many Jewish homemakers. The more that Jewish immigrants cooked with these American ingredients the ads implied the more “American” they would become in the eyes of their Rosh Hashanah guests.

This 1935 English-language ad for Pillsbury’s all-purpose flour in The American Jewish World tapped into readers’ sense of tradition. “Try it in your Rosh Hashanah challahs noodles and cakes” it urged. The ad also featured a dubious medical endorsement for the flour: “Its absolute purity is unquestioned endorsed by the Committee on Foods of the American Medical Association.”

Advertisers also promoted oil as a healthier ingredient in Ashkenazi Jewish cooking than schmaltz or poultry fat the main cooking fat used in the old country. A 1975 Planters Oil ad in a Chicago Jewish sold peanut oil as the natural companion to two symbolic Rosh Hashanah foods: honey and fish. The copy concludes “So usher in a delicious 5736 with the sweetness of honey and the lightness of Planters Oil!”

As American Jews prepared to host Rosh Hashanah guests papers ran ads for cleaning products families might add to their “Rosh Hashanah Shopping List.” An especially amusing example from Colgate-Palmolive features an attractive woman exclaiming “Be a 4-star housewife!” — with the stars written out as four individual Stars of David. The four stars referred to each of the four signature cleaning products in this Colgate-Palmolive family.

A 1960 Colgate-Palmolive ad strikingly more religious-minded than its predecessor from the previous year depicts the Biblical priest Ezra holding what appears to be the Ten Commandments. The ad quoting from the Book of Nehemiah explains that it was on the first day of Rosh Hashanah in the year 444 B.C.E. that the completed Torah was first publicly read in Jerusalem. The ad marked the start of a dedication to Biblical themes for Colgate-Palmolive: A 1962 Rosh Hashanah ad for the company in the B’nai B’rith Messenger cited Joshua the leader who succeeded Moses.

While it seems that historically the market for buying new clothing in the Jewish community was heavily concentrated around Passover — there were even Passover fashion parades! — sartorial concerns also arose during the High Holidays.

In 1936 an advertisement in the B’nai B’rith Messenger boasted “Just Received! For the High Holidays—100 Beautiful New Fall Frocks.” A 1938 ad for suits and topcoats from The American Jewish World featuring a dapper American gentleman hat-in-hand read: “Only 16 days to ROSH HASHANAH… Make Your Selection Now from our large assortment of the world’s finest woolens…”

Hopefully by next year’s Rosh Hashanah we’ll have traded in our loungewear for good and returned to our regular fashion routine — with the finest woolens around.

Ever wondered how to spend your night after Rosh Hashanah is done? One unlikely 1936 ad had an answer: “After Rosh Hashanah dine and dance at Black Cat Club” a night club located in Bloomington Minnesota. Did two days of sitting in the synagogue really lead to a need for some fun? It turns out that in 1936 Rosh Hashanah led right into Shabbat so it was a three-day holiday. I imagine that the Black Cat Club was buzzing by Saturday night. A happy new year indeed.

That’s a loaded question and I’m going to plead the fifth here.

This season has been one of the most fun seasons of my life regardless of how it ends although a Yankees World Series victory would be ideal.

After taking a whole year off of the most important part of the baseball experience – interacting with the fans we were lucky enough to get back into packed stadiums with our people and enjoy the game it was meant to be enjoyed.

And you talk too much but no one is going to point that out to you. Let’s talk Detroit. “Motown The Motor City Hockey Town USA D-Town and Paris of the West.” This city has a lot of history a lot of spirit and a lot of pain. It’s been up and down and up again and just like the baseball team that plays downtown the city is on an upswing.

Sure 2021 won’t be the Tigers year; Shit 2022 probably won’t be either but they have a young core some young arms that look legit and one of the best managers in baseball. He’s already done more than anyone expected from this team this season. The ballpark is really cool centrally located in downtown right next to Ford Field and a couple of blocks from where the Red Wings play (Little Caesars Arena) in a revitalized and fun little part of the city.

Nelson Prince's oldest brother and one of his heirs has died his sister announced on Twitter Friday.

""It is with great sadness we announce that our beloved brother Johnny R. Nelson received his heavenly wings tonight at 7:47 p.m."" Sharon L. Nelson tweeted Friday. ""Johnny's loving personality and spirit shined brightly and he fought hard to help preserve Prince's legacy.""

John was Prince's half-brother born in 1944 to Prince's father John L. Nelson and his first wife Vivian. His death leaves Sharon and their sister Norrine as the music superstar's major remaining family heirs.

Prince's half-sister Lorna Nelson died in 2006 at the age of 63.

About half of Prince's estate is controlled by Primary Wave a New York music company that owns rights to thousands of popular songs from artists ranging from Ray Charles to Nirvana.

The company bought 100% of the inheritance of Omarr Baker the youngest of Prince's six siblings and 100% of the late Alfred Jackson's inheritance. The company also acquired 90% of sister Tyka Nelson's share of the estate.

John R. Nelson was Prince’s half-brother and oldest brother. He was born in 1944.

In the five years since Prince Rogers Nelson died of a fentanyl overdose without a will or direct descendants his estate has been embroiled in legal disputes. Most recently the IRS and the estate's administrator Comerica Bank & Trust have disagreed over its value. Comerica says it's worth $82.3 million roughly half of what the IRS says it's worth.

In late June the IRS and Comerica reached a partial settlement agreeing on the value of the musician's real estate as $17.7 million. Still unresolved is the value of Prince's music and royalties an issue that may wind up being decided in court.

LocalSportsJournal.com

When Johnny Kane recalls his days as a high school athlete he readily admits there isn’t a whole lot to talk about.

A knee injury during his sophomore year put a halt to any hopes of playing varsity football for the Delta Panthers a small school in northwestern Ohio.

Today Kane is an on-air personality for Bally Sports Detroit. He is commonly seen wandering among the paying customers at Comerica Park during the Detroit Tigers season and Little Caesars Arena during the Detroit Pistons season.

But on Friday night Kane stepped back into the world of high school sports.

Kane provided the play-by-play for the high school football showdown between the host Muskegon Big Reds and the Detroit Cass Tech Technicians. Former Green Bay Packer and Detroit Lion T.J. Lang provided the color commentary for the game that Cass Tech won in lopsided fashion.

So on a night when Tigers were in Cincinnati taking on the Reds Kane was perched high above the artificial turf field of Hackley Stadium in the cramped but cozy confines of the press box watching the Big Reds.

The perfect atmosphere to delve into his prep days at Delta High School.

“I was a band member and then I injured my knee and that ended my football career during my sophomore year” Kane said. “No varsity football and that was disappointing to me. But that’s the way it goes.”

Instead Kane ran track cross country and played basketball. And it was on the hardcourt where Kane found some glory and a memory.

“Late in the game which was typically when I flourished I hit three 3-pointers and the third one put us at 100 points” said Kane. “My mom and dad were there. It was a memorable shot and the student section went crazy. It was a good high school memory that I will cherish.”

These days when he’s not covering the Tigers or the Pistons who start their preseason late next month Kane will be calling the action while high school athletes are hoping to make memories on the gridiron.

Bally Sports televised some games last year but prior to that it was just the state championship games at Ford Field in Detroit. This season it’s a game every Friday night and Kane will be describing the action down on the field on seven of the nine-week regular season slate.

“Doing the lead play-by-play was something I wanted to do since I was little” Kane said. “Having the opportunity on the high school level is pretty awesome.”

Whether it’s the Tigers Pistons or a high school football game he’s covering Kane said he’s living the dream. And there is nothing cliché about that statement for Kane who previously worked in sportscasting in Kansas City Topeka Kansas and Hopkinsville Ky.

“For me I would work every day if I could” Kane said. “I don’t have a family and children so sports is it for me. If I could do 162 baseball game and 82 NBA games and a full high school schedule. That would be the ultimate. I love being in Michigan and I love the group that I am with.”

Part of that group is the Bally Sports team that covers the Detroit Tigers. And Kane is loving every minute of it and it started from the very first day he came onboard.

“I knew from the very first time January of 2015 I was welcomed right away” Kane said. “They don’t have to put your arm around you and welcome you to the club. I was welcomed right away.”

Asked to pick a favorite among his co-workers Kane could not answer.

“I can’t pick a favorite we are all friends who enjoy working together” said Kane who then mentioned Kirk Gibson and John Keating.

“Gibby drops the gloves and makes no apologies for it” said Kane laughingly. “If you would have told me when I was 14 or 15 years old that Gibson would be sharing a few laughs at my expense I wouldn’t have believed you. It’s all good nature ribbing. He dishes it out. And John Keating there is only one. He’s pretty good about setting the table and making sure it’s fun.”

Part of that “fun” is doing laps at Comerica Park.

“I take laps around the stadium” Kane said. “I probably circle the stadium a half a dozen times or more especially on the road. I like to see games from different parts of the park.”

One highlight for Kane during this Tiger season was seeing the Taylor North Little League team that captured the Little League World Series championship in Williamsport Pa. Recently that team was treated like royalty by the Tigers.

“These are baseball kids playing a kids game” Kane said. “But when you win at that level and suddenly people are asking for their attention it’s really cool. There were 10-year-old boys signing autographs for grown men. How cool was that and the kids were soaking it up.”

And then there are the fans who see a guy in a suit and tie with a microphone in his hand.

“Everybody wants to be on television” Kane said. “But once the camera is pointed at them they don’t know how to react. Most people are great. And how refreshing it is from a season ago when there were no fans. It was just you the players the training staff and security in the ballpark. There were no people. It was eerie … it was like you were invited as a special guest to witness a pro game.

“But now the fans are back and you are able to hug the fans and take pictures with them” said Kane. “It reminds me how much of a privilege it is to have this job.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vcmlzaW5nYXBwbGUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMDQvbnktbWV0cy1kYXZpZC13cmlnaHQtMjAwNy1tdnAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NY Mets: Did the 2007 collapse cost David Wright the MVP?,,,,

They were killed in Wednesday’s historic storm.







“We always met them in the park the wife and the baby” said friend Dawson Sherpa. “Real devastating something that we could not imagine.”

The family lived in the basement apartment of a residential building in Woodside. They were three of 13 people in New York City who died as a result of floodwaters when remnants of Hurricane Ida barreled through the five boroughs.

What You Need To Know A family of three who lived in a basement apartment in Woodside was killed this week due to torrential rainfall that barreled through the five boroughs



Eleven of the 13 victims in the city were living in basements



Five out of the six basement apartments of those who died were illegally converted to residential spaces the DOB said

“He’s like a best friend best brother very very nice guy. Amazing woman helpful. Like let’s see if you want to do something for our community” said Angphurba Lama a friend of one of the victims. “Very happy to do it like no problem let’s go. A person like that.”

In all 11 out of the 13 people who died were living in basements. The city Department of Buildings said five of those six basement apartments were illegal.

From what NY1 could see at the scene it appeared there is an enclosed side gate to the apartment.

On Friday the Red Cross was in Woodside helping those affected by the storm and clearing out water that still remained in some homes.

“As we’re talking to residents we’re talking to them about the damage and their needs. We can also provide them with a cleanup kit” said Michael de Vulpillieres a communications officer for the American Red Cross of the Greater New York Region.

The Red Cross has already housed 17 affected families from Queens and said it will continue to help others who have lost so much.

It said this storm has been a traumatic experience for many people and encourage anyone to call 311 so they can be connected to the organization’s mental health volunteers.

“We were very shocked when we heard that news” Lama said. “I couldn’t believe he was the one.”

Members of the Nepalese community on Friday also paid their respects to the family who was from Nepal.

The Red Cross continues to reach out to families who have not yet requested services including medical assistance.

The White House in a Saturday announcement said Biden will arrive six days after Tropical Storm Ida wreaked havoc across the boroughs.

Queens remained the city’s hardest-hit borough as of Saturday with 11 deaths reported in six basement flooding incidents.

The victims included a 14-month-old autistic child an 86-year-old woman and three people found dead in an illegally converted apartment in hard-hit East Flushing authorities said.

The little boy’s parents perished alongside the child.

Five victims remained unidentified on Saturday including the trio killed in the Queens basement. The other two were a 40-year-old man believed to be homeless and found drowned in Sunset Park and a man found burned to death inside his car on the Grand Central Parkway police said.

A spokeswoman for the Office of Chief Medical Examiner on Saturday said 11 victims found in basements in Queens died by drowning and that it was ruled an accident; the cause and manner of two other deaths believed to be storm related were being finalized.

Biden also plans a stop in Manville N.J. where the killer storm forced the evacuation of residents by boat and helicopter as the town of 11000 residents was hammered with 10 inches of rain.

The death total climbed to 27 in the Garden State although several people were still missing — including a freshman commuter student at Seton Hall University. Nidhi Rana was last seen with friend Ayush Rana in her hometown of Passaic.

Also in Passaic a 70-year-old Clifton man was killed Wednesday when his car was deluged by floodwaters.

Three days after the storm pounded the city and its suburbs Consolidated Edison reported fewer than 2000 customers without power Saturday. The utility was handing out dry ice in Mamaroneck for any local residents still without electricity.

But the after-effects continued with the Department of Buildings inspecting more than 1500 properties Saturday where the owners reported damage from flooding to structural issues to problems with retaining walls.

The DOB said Friday that 10 of the victims drowned in basements that were illegally rented out as apartments.

The scene on 183rd Street in Queens New York is pictured Thursday where two people died a night earlier.

Biden made a Friday visit to Louisiana with promises of federal assistance to help the state bounce back from Ida’s devastation. The government has already handed out $100 million directly to local residents in $500 checks to get the recovery effort started he said.

“I promise we’re going to have your back” said Biden whose office provided no further details on his New York visit. The president is due in Manhattan later in the week for the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

""La multimillonaria más joven del mundo que se forjó a sí misma"" según la revista Forbes. La ""próxima Steve Jobs"" la bautizó Inc otra revista de negocios que la puso en su portada.

En 2014 Elizabeth Holmes con entonces 30 años estaba en la cima del mundo.

Tras abandonar sus estudios en la Universidad de Stanford había fundado una empresa valorada en US$9 mil millones por haber provocado supuestamente una revolución en el diagnóstico de enfermedades.

Con unas pocas gotas de sangre la prueba Edison de la compañía Theranos prometía detectar rápidamente enfermedades como el cáncer y la diabetes sin necesidad de usar agujas.

Peces gordos desde Henry Kissinger hasta Rupert Murdoch invirtieron en ella.

Pero para 2015 el proyecto empezaba a mostrar la hilacha y en un año se vio que la idea de Holmes era falsa.

La tecnología que promocionó no funcionó en absoluto y en 2018 la empresa que fundó se había derrumbado.

Hoy Holmes de 37 años enfrenta 20 años de prisión si es hallada culpable de los 12 cargos de fraude que se le imputan.

Nunca antes contó su lado de la historia.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto El magnate de los medios Rupert Murdoch perdió US$165 millones por causa de Theranos.

Su juicio que comienza este mes -EE.UU. vs Elizabeth Holmes et al- será monitoreado de cerca. Se espera que se declare no culpable.

Y en un giro de tuerca se supo este fin de semana que sus abogados argumentarán que su exnovio y socio comercial Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani abusó sexualmente de ella y la controló emocionalmente en el momento de los presuntos delitos socavando su estado mental.

Balwani de 56 años quien enfrenta los mismos cargos de fraude calificó las acusaciones de ""indignantes"".

Dependerá de un jurado decidir con qué compasión o con qué dureza juzgar a la mujer que engañó a todos desde estadistas hasta secretarias.

Presión desde el comienzo

A pesar de ser el tema de un libro un documental de HBO y una próxima serie de televisión y película todavía no está claro por qué Holmes se arriesgó tanto con una tecnología que sabía que no funcionaba.

Holmes se crió en una familia acomodada en Washington DC y era una niña educada pero retraída según personas que la conocían.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto Holmes acusa a su exsocio y pareja Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani de haber abusado sexualmente de ella.

El inventor y empresario Richard Fuisz de 81 años especula que debe haber habido una inmensa presión sobre ella para tener éxito.

Su familia vivió al lado de la de Holmes durante años pero se pelearon cuando Theranos lo demandó por una disputa de una patente en 2011 (se resolvió más tarde).

Los padres de Holmes fueron durante gran parte de sus carreras burócratas en Capitol Hill (es decir el congreso estadounidense y los edificios administrativos en sus sus alrededores) pero ""estaban muy interesados ​​en el estatus"" y ""vivían para las conexiones"" le comentó Fuisz a la BBC.

El tatarabuelo de su padre fue el fundador de Fleischmann's Yeast que cambió la industria del pan de Estados Unidos y la familia era muy consciente de su linaje dijo.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto La profesora Phyillis Gardener le dijo a Holmes que su idea no funcionaría.

A los nueve años la joven Elizabeth escribió una carta a su padre declarando que lo que ella ""realmente quería de la vida era descubrir algo nuevo algo que la humanidad no sabía que era posible hacer"".

Cuando llegó a la Universidad de Stanford en 2002 para estudiar ingeniería química se le ocurrió la idea de un parche que pudiera escanear al usuario en busca de infecciones y liberar antibióticos según fuera necesario.

A los 18 años ya mostraba una intransigencia que al parecer seguiría impulsando la empresa que fundaría al año siguiente.

Phyllis Gardner experta en farmacología clínica en Stanford recuerda haber discutido la idea del parche cutáneo de Holmes y haberle dicho que ""no funcionaría"".

""Ella simplemente me miró fijamente pero era como si no me viera"" le dice Gardner a la BBC.

""Y parecía absolutamente segura de su propia brillantez. No estaba interesada en mi experiencia y fue perturbador"".

Ascenso meteórico

Meses después con 19 años Holmes abandonó Stanford y lanzó Theranos esta vez con una forma aparentemente revolucionaria de analizar la sangre con un simple pinchazo en el dedo.

Muchas personas poderosas quedaron cautivadas e invirtieron en la empresa sin ver cuentas financieras auditadas.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto En el escenario junto al expresidente estadounidense Bill Clinton en 2015. En ese momento Holmes era la multimillonaria por sus propios medios más joven del mundo.

El secretario del Tesoro de EE.UU. George Schultz el condecorado general de la Infantería de Marina James Mattis (que luego trabajó en el gobierno de Trump) y la familia más rica de EE.UU. los Walton estaban entre quienes le dieron su apoyo.

Esto le dio credibilidad al igual que su forma de comportarse.

""Sabía que había tenido esta idea brillante y que había logrado convencer a todos estos inversionistas y científicos"" dice Jeffrey Flier exdecano de la Facultad de Medicina de Harvard que se reunió con ella para almorzar en 2015.

""Ella estaba segura de sí misma pero cuando le hice varias preguntas sobre su tecnología no parecía que entendiera"" agrega Flier quien nunca evaluó formalmente su tecnología.

""Me pareció un poco extraño pero no salí pensando que era un fraude"".

Flier terminó invitándola a unirse a la Junta de Becarios de la escuela de medicina algo que lamenta aunque Holmes fue destituida cuando estalló el escándalo.

Resultados no fiables

Todo comenzó a desmoronarse en 2015 cuando un informante expresó su preocupación sobre el dispositivo de prueba insignia de Theranos el Edison.

El Wall Street Journal escribió una serie de revelaciones condenatorias en las que afirmaba que los resultados no eran fiables y que la empresa había estado utilizando máquinas disponibles comercialmente hechas por otros fabricantes para la mayoría de sus pruebas.

Las demandas se acumularon los socios cortaron lazos y en 2016 los reguladores estadounidenses le prohibieron a Holmes operar un servicio de análisis de sangre durante dos años.

En 2018 Theranos se disolvió.

¿Abusadora o abusada?

En marzo de ese año Holmes llegó a un acuerdo por cargos civiles de los reguladores financieros por recaudar de manera fraudulenta US$700 millones de inversores.

Pero tres meses después fue arrestada junto con Balwani por cargos penales de fraude electrónico y conspiración para cometer fraude electrónico.

Los fiscales afirman que ella engañó con conocimiento de causa a los pacientes sobre las pruebas y exageró enormemente el desempeño de la empresa ante los patrocinadores financieros.

Holmes fue liberada bajo fianza y en 2019 se casó con William ""Billy"" Evans de 27 años heredero de la cadena de hoteles Evans Hotel Group. Tuvieron un hijo en julio de este año.

""No creo que el hecho de que sea ahora madre influya en el juicio pero es probable que el juez lo tenga en cuenta si la declaran culpable"" señala Emily D Baker exfiscal adjunta de distrito de Los Ángeles y comentarista legal que es está vinculada al caso.

El juicio

A medida que se acerca el juicio por el escándalo de Theranos los comentaristas dicen que es notable cuán firmemente se ha aferrado a su historia original y las personas que la conocieron dicen que dudan de que haya cambiado.

Según los documentos judiciales los abogados de Holmes están dispuestos a argumentar que ""ella creía que cualquier supuesta tergiversación"" sobre Theranos era cierta y que se trataba de un ""negocio legítimo que generaba valor para los inversores"".

También es probable que sostengan que el presunto comportamiento controlador de Balwani ""borró su capacidad para tomar decisiones"" incluida su capacidad para ""engañar a sus víctimas"".

Dicen que el exdirector de operaciones de Theranos que será juzgado por separado el próximo año controló cómo se vestía qué comía y con quién hablaba durante más de una década.

También llamarán como testigo a un psicólogo especializado en abuso sexual.

No está claro si Holmes subirá al estrado.

""Lo más difícil en cualquier caso de fraude es demostrar que la persona intentó defraudar"" explica Baker.

""Así que los fiscales tendrán que usar sus mensajes de texto y correos electrónicos y argumentar que ella sabía que la tecnología no funcionaba pero dijo que sí lo hacía"".

La diputada Cenobia Vargas ex coordinadora del programa Encontrando el Camino Correcto señaló que muchos de los jóvenes que fueron formados en esta academia no están siendo aceptados por no tener la estatura que establece el reglamento.

""Con altos índice de criminalidad y ustedes rechazando a población que quizás no son altos de estaturas pero con grandes corazones y deseo de aportarle al país en materia de seguridad"" cuestionó la diputada Vargas.

Al respecto el director de la Policía Nacional John Omar Dornheim Castillo aclaró que el tamaño de una unidad es importante debido a las funciones que desempeña en las calles. 'Una persona con un tamaño muy bajo puede representar un riesgo para él y para sus compañeros"" agregó.

No obstante Dornheim Castillo informó que se han hecho ajustes para captar a ese grupo de jóvenes que desean ingresar a la institución flexibilizando para los varones de 1.68 a 1.65 mientras que la estatura requerida para las damas pasa de 1.60 a 1.58.

Sobre este mismo tema el diputado de la bancada independiente Edison Broce cuestionó al ministro de Seguridad sobre la restricción para el ingreso a la Policía Nacional de personas tatuadas.

Broce recomendó al titular de Seguridad reconsiderar ese tipo de requerimientos debido a que la juventud de hoy no es la misma que la de hace algunos años.

El ministro de Seguridad dejó claro al diputado que las personas tatuadas no están dentro del perfil para el ingreso a los cursos de formación en las academias de los estamentos de seguridad.

Pino afirmó que esto también es parte del respeto hacia la sociedad porque la imagen de una unidad es la imagen de la institución en general dejando clara su posición de respaldo a dicho requerimiento como 'indispensable' para el ingreso a los estamentos de seguridad.

""No podemos imitar o compararnos con otras culturas el reglamento ya está establecido y los muchachos se adaptan y cumplen con este régimen"" insistió Pino.

Muchos muchachos optan por quitaese gradualmente los tatuajes y ellos son acogidos con voluntad en los cursos de formación aclaró.

Broce también cuestionó la condición física de algunas unidades de la Policía Nacional. ""Veo a veces videos o en las calles personas que deben estar en forma para defendernos y yo no creo que puedan dar un pique de aquí a la esquina"" señaló Broce.

Ante este cuestionamiento el ministro Pino señaló que desde el año 2020 se implementó el primer reglamento de ascenso normado para cada estamento de seguridad y entre los requisitos para ascender está la prueba física y médica de las unidades.

En tanto el director de la Policía Nacional John Omar Dornheim Castillo también lamentó que no todas las personas tengan la ventaja de contar con una contextura atléticas.

Agregó que dentro de su institución existen muchas unidades que han desarrollado enfermedades entre ellas tiroides que les hacen ganar peso. 'Muchos de ellos se sienten hasta marginados"" señaló el director de la Policía Nacional asegurando que existen planes para mejorar la salud de sus compañeros.

""La capacidad de trabajar de un hombre tampoco se puede medir por la masa corporal hay que ver su capacidad metal para enfrentar los retos que encontramos en nuestra institución"" concluyó Dornheim Castillo.

In the image Centaurus A which is located more than 12 million light-years away from Earth in the southern constellation Centaurus (the centaur) ripples across space. The galaxy which was first identified in 1826 is among the best studied in the southern sky because it is so bright and relatively close to Earth .

In the image although stars glow swaths of the galaxy are hidden by dust tendrils looping around the galaxy's center where a supermassive black hole containing 55 million times the mass of the sun hides and spews out a jet of matter that acts as a bright source of radio light.

Among the dust are reddish hydrogen clouds where new stars are forming and faint blue stars outlining the corners of the dust cloud. The galaxy's strange shape is the result of a long-ago encounter with another galaxy that left Centaurus A shrouded in dust.

The image comes from the Dark Energy Camera based at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile and is part of a project designed to identify rapidly changing objects like supernovas occurring in key galaxies of the southern sky .

But what if I told you that you could save even more money on what you put in your bulging shopping cart?

Here's the trick: Scan the product signs for an asterisk and prices that end in seven. The symbol – affectionately referred to as the “death star” in Costco groups on Facebook and Instagram – signals the item is about to exit the wholesaler's inventory. The seven often means the item has been marked down.

When you see both it’s time to swoop in for some savings.

“It’s like a treasure hunt and you need to buy it when you see it” Mhyla Borkowski one of the administrators at the Costco Fans Facebook group told me about the coveted clearance items.

►Labor Day 2021:What stores and restaurants are open Labor Day? Here's a list of businesses open or closed Monday

►Sephora at Kohl's grand openings:More locations open ahead of Labor Day and throughout September. See which stores are getting a makeover.

Here are my top three tips for making the most of clearance shopping at Costco. Learn more of my Costco adventures in my recent column.

Join Costco fan groups: I follow Costco Fans groups to see what death star deals other members are finding. Markdowns and selection can vary by location. Aside from the main account there are regional groups a travel account a lifestyle group and even a Keto group.

Be on the lookout for prices ending in .97 and .00: The items with .97 are usually the death star items and the others are called manager specials or manager markdowns and often also have an asterisk on the price tag. Most of the price tags at Costco are on white paper but sometimes these specials are printed on color paper or are highlighted in neon on the price tag.

Watch for further price drops: If the item is discounted again within 30 days ask for a price adjustment at customer service. Borkowski said she's heard of some clubs that only make adjustments within 14 days and some require receipts to refund the difference. Other clubs request members bring the product back in too. Costco.com also offers price adjustments within 30 days through an online form.

Ready to shop? Remember Costco is closed on Labor Day just like it is on Thanksgiving Christmas New Year’s Day Easter Memorial Day and July 4th. Also take note of twice-weekly senior hours and temporary limits on select items amid the delta variant rise.

According to Harvard Health inflammation occurs when white blood cells flood a particular part of your body that needs protection from infection damage or unfamiliar substances. Smoking or building up fat from eating inflammatory foods causes your immune system to think your body is under attack and if your body is constantly in this state it can lead to chronic inflammation which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.

While this condition sounds terrifying it can be preventable. By focusing on your diet and how you treat your body you can stop inflammation in its tracks. Red meat and soda can cause greater chronic inflammation but the nutrients found in tomatoes olive oil fatty fish and nuts can all help prevent and reverse the effects of inflammation. The best way to tackle this issue starts at the doors of Costco when you go on your next grocery run. While it might feel difficult to figure out with Costco products fight inflammation you can always look for some standbys that have your back.

After consulting with a handful of nutrition experts we assembled the one-stop shopping list for anyone looking to eat right and cut down on any chronic inflammation. By stocking up on these goods you can do your body right. After be sure to also read up on our list of the 30 Best Anti-Inflammatory Foods.

Nature's Lab Turmeric Curcumin

You can take the first step towards beating inflammation by making sure you stock your spice cabinet up with turmeric.

""[This product] contains the compound curcumin from turmeric which researchers have shown reduces inflammation in humans"" says Bryan Quoc Le Ph.D. and author of 150 Food Science Questions Answered. ""Curcumin works by binding to a protein in our cells that activates a series of cellular signals to the nucleus. These signals trigger the cellular machinery to release a number of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory defenses and enzymes.""

""Curcumin is a relatively potent anti-inflammatory molecule and several clinical trials demonstrate that the compound has the potential to reduce chronic inflammation from several conditions"" he continues.

Salmon can take your eating plan to great heights and it even helps reverse the effects of inflammation.

""Salmon is known for its omega-3's and anti-inflammatory benefits so be on the lookout for Kirkland's Sockeye Salmon on your next shopping trip"" says Jay Cowin NNCP RNT RNC CHN CSNA and ASYSTEM's registered nutritionist said.

Once you grab a Costco salmon you can whip it up into a Honey-Mustard Glazed Salmon With Roasted Asparagus for a delicious way to feel great.

That's It

""One of my favorite Costco finds are these That's It fruit bars"" says Marissa Meshulam MS RD CDN and founder of MPM Nutrition. ""Unlike many bars that are filled with inflammatory ingredients these bars are made only with real fruit which provides a ton of antioxidants that work to keep our cells healthy and fight inflammation. They are a perfect convenience item for days when you haven't made it to the store yet but want to add some fruit to your snack or lunch bag.""

""They contain no added sugar or inflammatory oils"" adds Meshulam. ""Instead they rely on the natural sweetness from fruit to taste great!""

Costco's Stir-Fry Vegetable Blend

You can't go wrong with getting some more vegetables in your life and Costco does it again with this frozen stir-fry topper.

""Frozen veggies are just as nutritious if not more nutritious than fresh vegetables because they are picked at the height of ripeness"" says Lisa R. Young Ph.D. RDN and a member of our medical expert board. ""I love the stir fry blend which can help round out your meal. The veggies are antioxidant-rich—particularly high in vitamin C which can fight inflammation.""

Kirkland Mixed Nuts—Unsalted

A variety of nuts can help you get to any health goal and these Costco snacks keep you feeling great.

""Nuts are rich in heart-healthy fats which may help to fight inflammation while also protecting your heart and keeping blood sugar steady"" says Young. ""I prefer the unsalted varieties. Tip—because the calories in nuts add up quickly scoop out a 1 oz portion (around a handful) and put it in a dish instead of eating from the container.""

Along with nuts here are 20 Healthy Fat Foods That Won't Make You Fat.

Kirkland Signature San Marzano Whole Peeled Tomatoes

""Tomatoes are loaded with carotenoid antioxidants"" says Jill Weisenberger MS RDN CDCES CHWC FAND author of the free guide Change Your Habits & Ditch Restrictive Eating. ""Canned tomatoes are an even better source of them than fresh tomatoes. The antioxidants work to quiet or inactivate free radicals that can increase inflammation.""

Kirkland Signature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil

Olive oil can do some great things for your overall health and Kirkland's Signature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil doesn't disappoint when it comes to alleviating inflammation.

""Extra Virgin Olive Oil contains oleocanthal a powerful antioxidant that has anti-inflammatory properties similar to ibuprofen"" says Lindsey DeSoto RDN LD. ""It also contains oleic acid which has been studied to reduce markers of inflammation.""

nib mor Dark Chocolate

No one needs an excuse to eat more chocolate but this delectable treat can get you that much more excited for dessert.

""Dark chocolate contains antioxidant compounds called flavonoids that help prevent and reduce inflammation in the body"" says Leah Johnston RDN LDN at SRW. ""A recent study sought to determine the effect of eating dark chocolate on inflammatory biomarkers in participants with type 2 diabetes. Researchers found that the group that consumed dark chocolate along with a specific diet regime had lower levels of inflammatory markers including CRP and interleukin 6 when compared with the group that did not accompany the diet with dark chocolate.""

To be fair while many areas make their own types of cheddar cheese the Wisconsin variety is both a distinct and also highly versatile cheese (via Wisconsin Cheese) — definitely something to be proud of. True natives of the state don't take kindly to a watered down version of their local favorites. As original poster and taster MikeDorty said ""As a Wisconsinite all I can say is: my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.""

And user NoDownsideToOutside added ""Any fried cheese curd that doesn't come from a bowling alley or carnival in WI is a waste."" Although they hedged their advice with an edit noting someone could make ""a strong case can be made for MI MN and maybe IA as long as the cheese is sourced from Wisconsin.""

The Hawaii Police Department’s Community Policing Unit was called to Costco Friday not for a crime but to collect non-perishable food for The Food Basket Hawaii Island’s lone food bank.

The food drive was the brainchild of Officer Dwayne Sluss with the intention of filling a police cruiser with donated food. He approached Costco and The Food Basket with the idea which was enthusiastically embraced. On Friday a police cruiser parked at the entrance of the store overflowed with donations of cash canned goods rice and other non-perishable items exceeding expectations. At the end of the four hour event 4053 pounds of food and $1381.83 were collected.

“We plan on doing more and hope the other districts on the island will pick up on the idea and expand it to help out other organizations” he said. “The timing was perfect on a three-day weekend. There are people in our community still in need.”

Kristin Frost Albrecht executive director of The Food Basket said it was the first food drive since Kahikina’s Feed-A-Thon in February 2020.

“We are grateful for this event” she said adding the shelves at their warehouses were getting sparse.

The Food Basket has paused its Ohana Drops which began in April 2020 because the COVID funds used to purchase food has dried up. Frost Albrecht said the nonprofit is assessing the situation but is still in need of food and donations to supply their partner food pantries and soup kitchens.

“Finally we have a happy event” she said. “People here are happy to donate.”

Frost Albrecht said Costco has been a constant supporter of The Food basket. On Friday management went so far as to put signs up around the store recommending items suitable for donation.

Costco’s merchandise manager Ryan Mattern said it took a group effort to make Friday’s drive a success going above and beyond to feed needy families during these challenging times. He believes the Kona Costco is the only store in the chain to participate in this type of endeavor.

“The Food Basket comes here every morning to pick up baked goods and other items that are still usable but not sellable” he said so it was a natural fit to hold the event supporting Hawaii Island’s food bank.

Sluss said he would like to do future events to support the organization.

“We want to keep on doing it and see it grow” he said.

Seriously we’re ready to shop for — and start wearing! — cute sweaters jackets scarves and boots. And while we’re not always a fan of the rainy cold weather that fall brings we are excited for fabulous fashionable footwear that’s actually practical and keeps our feet dry. So when we heard that Hunter boots were back at Costco just in time for the colder weather to hit we were seriously pumped up.

Our mission at SheKnows is to empower and inspire women and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do. Please note that if you purchase something by clicking on a link within this story we may receive a small commission of the sale.

This isn’t the first time that Hunter boots have been on sale at Costco — but they tend to go fast so we sat up and took notice when we saw popular Instagram account @costcosisters post about the find. The Sisters found Hunter Ladies’ Original Tall Matte rain boots in both black and green colors in stores for the bargain price of $85. The boots are also available — in green only — online at Costco for a slightly higher price: $89.99. (That’s still a bargain considering that the boots usually retail for $160!)

Why do we love Hunter so much? Not only are their boots sleek and stylish compared to more athletic waterproof footwear options but they also really work to keep your feet dry. In fact the brand is so revered that it holds two Royal Warrants of Appointment to the royal family in England meaning that they provide cozy waterproof footwear to the Queen of England herself. And if they’re good enough for literal Queens they’re good enough for us!

If you don’t have a Costco near you never fear — you can also find the Hunter boots on Amazon albeit with a slightly higher price tag.

Pair them with a designer face mask and you’ll have the chicest (and most practical) fall fashion around.

These are the first pictures of thug James Davy back on the streets after he successfully had his conviction for the murder of 64-year-old Thomas 'Toddy' Dooley overturned.

We snapped Davy - who aided in an attempt to burn the grandfather's body after the murder - back in Celbridge Co Kildare following his release from Mountjoy Prison.

Approached by the Sunday World as he hefted bottles of water out of the back of a car Davy (30) refused to discuss either his crime or the recent developments in his case.

A woman who was travelling in the front of the vehicle then got out and said: ""He's not saying anything.""

Davy who had his conviction for Toddy's murder replaced with one of assisting an offender was told this week he will not have to go back to prison for his role in the attempted cover up of Toddy's murder.

Mr. Justice Michael White at the Central Criminal Court sentenced Davy to nine years but said he had served his sentence and should be released having gone into custody in November 2014.

Davy has 21 previous convictions which include burglary assault criminal damage and possession of a knife.

Grandfather Toddy suffered eight blows to his head which shattered his skull disfigured his face and left fragments of bone lodged in his brain during an attack at his home at Sr Senan Court in Edenderry on February 12 2014.

Two blows to his torso had fractured three of his ribs.

Matthew Cummins (27) of Edenderry Co Offaly his co-accused Seán Davy (26) of Edenderry and James Davy (30) of Celbridge Co Kildare denied his murder.

However a unanimous jury found each man guilty of murder following a Central Criminal Court trial in 2016.

Thomas 'Toddy' Dooley was brutally beaten to death.

Trial judge Ms Justice Margaret Heneghan said the killing was a ""brutal motiveless attack on this defenceless elderly man"" before she sentenced each to life in prison on October 10 2016.

The trial heard that the three men got into Toddy's home through a window at about 5.30am on a cold snowy morning.

Matthew Cummins had been in Toddy's house before and knew him as a kind man who would always say hello.

Cummins climbed in a window and then opened another window to let the other two in.

Toddy who was described as ""soft"" by one garda witness was used to having young visitors at irregular hours and it appears he did not object.

He sat down in his armchair opened a can of Budweiser and drank with the intruders.

The three drank with Toddy for a time but at some point he was beaten to death and attempts were made to set his dead body on fire.

The State argued that all three men were equally guilty and were involved in a ""joint enterprise"" to murder.

The three men gave different accounts of what happened in the house.

Matthew Cummins claimed that ""out of the blue"" Seán Davy walked up behind the 64-year-old and beat him on the back of the head with the bat before coming around the armchair to continue the beating from the front.

James Davey was spotted in Celbridge Co Kildare after he got out of prison

Seán Davy claimed that James Davy was responsible for most of the blows and that he himself struck Toddy once but ""not full force"".

James Davy denied laying a hand on Toddy saying that Seán Davy beat him with the bat and Matthew Cummins kicked Toddy but not with much force.

Seán Davy failed in a bid to have his conviction overturned in 2018.

He had argued that he should have been tried separately rather than jointly with his co-accused.

James Davy and Matthew Cummins made applications to the Court of Appeal in May to have their convictions overturned.

Our reporter approaches James Davy who refused to speak with the Sunday World.

Caroline Biggs SC for Cummins had argued that at no stage during the trial had the DPP ""pinned her colours to the mast"" to say whether the case was one of joint enterprise or aiding and abetting.

""It was just throw enough mud at this case and it will stick"" she suggested. She also argued that the judge should have severed the indictment.

Counsel had said Cummins's presence when Mr Dooley was attacked was not enough to make him guilty of murder and added that the things the prosecution had accused him of - cleaning the scene and being present for the burning of the body - happened after Mr Dooley's death.

""You cannot convict a man for murder for an act he did when the person was already dead"" she said.

In her appeal submissions she argued that the judge should also have made it absolutely clear to the jury that if a person's act and 'mens rea' (guilty mind) occurred after the killing the person would have been guilty of impeding the apprehension of another.

""Nowhere was that made clear"" she said.

James Davey at Tullamore District Court.

James Dwyer SC who represented James Davy told the appeal court: ""I agree that this was one of those rare cases where they all blamed each other.""

However he noted recent rulings that every application for severance of an indictment must be treated with care by a trial judge.

""There was resistance in this case"" he said.

He also argued that there were aspects of the judge's direction which were confusing and misguided.

Patrick Treacy SC had responded on behalf of the DPP.

He said the prosecution case was that ""all three men were intrinsically involved in the savage murder"".

""I'm asking the court to have regard to the fact of how brutally this man was actually murdered"" he said. ""They say it's not of consequence that they were present to watch the brutality.""

He noted that there was blood on the walls floor and ceiling and that the victim's head was misshapen ""such was the savagery of the beating"".

""They say that you can be there as either James Davy or Matthew Cummins and watch the brutality and in some way you are not a participant in that"" he said.

In overturning the murder convictions of James Davey and Cummins the COurt of Appeal ruled that the two were not in a 'joint enterprise to kill' but did behave in a 'reprehensible manner' in a later attempt to burn the deceased's body and dispose of the murder weapon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbXVuc3Rlci9hcmlkLTQwMzczMDkzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fionn's parents told he wouldn't cope with mainstream schools — now he's off to college,"His parents were told when he was three years old that he was unlikely to cope in mainstream education — but next week Fionn McCarthy will be a university student.

Fionn 18 and his family were celebrating at home in Whitechurch Cork last night after he achieved 430-points in his Leaving Cert — more than he needs for the engineering course he hopes to pursue at Munster Technological University (MTU).

Fionn was diagnosed with autism aged three. He was non-verbal and his “communication skills were zero”.

His parents Elaine and Glynn were told a special school was his best option.

Fionn blossomed at school

They instead arranged home therapists and tutors who focused on Fionn rather than his autism and after he attended Montessori school he went to St Patrick’s NS in Whitechurch where he blossomed.

He went on to Scoil Mhuire gan Smál secondary school in Blarney where again thanks to the support of teaching staff and his special needs assistant (SNA) he thrived.

""I was slightly nervous before I got the results but once I got them I felt happy for myself and proud of myself because of the work I put in"" said Fionn yesterday after receiving his Leaving Cert results:

I’m looking forward to going to MTU. It’s going to feel a bit weird after years in secondary school. But I just hope to keep moving forward.

Mum Elaine said: “We’re emotional and ecstatic we are just over the moon and so so proud of Fionn.

“We believed in him he did the work and he amazes us every single day. He has had incredible support from teachers and SNA from his friends in school who always included him — that has meant the world.

We’ve always told Fionn that autism is a part of you it doesn’t make you different to anyone else you just see things differently and learn differently. We’ve always told him that you can achieve whatever you want. And he’s shown us. He’s shown us all.

Fionn studied technology design communications graphics construction studies agriscience and maths at honours level and English at ordinary level for his Leaving Cert and got grinds from TJ Hegarty at Breakthrough Maths.

And despite the disruption of Covid and the challenge posed by online learning Fionn had bagged enough points to study his engineering course at MTU.

""To be told when he was three that he would never go to a mainstream school to a point now where he’s going to university next week it’s just been an incredible journey"" Elaine said.

• Meanwhile students parents and schools all over Ireland have been celebrating Leaving Cert results including Millstreet Community School in Co Cork where twins Daniel and James Buckley along with fellow students Diarmuid Cronin and Darragh Kelleher all achieved 625 points."

In the 60-10 route the Tigers did a lot of things really well on both sides of the ball.

For the past several years I made an Auburn football gif thread that has been on Twitter every Sunday after the Tigers had a game. Well now that I’m the editor here at The Auburn Wire I want to put those plays here where I can write a little bit more than a few sentences about a play if I want to.

I want to look at some of the top plays from Saturday’s elite offensive performance from the Tigers.

Bo Nix had an incredible first half and Auburn appears to have three legitimate options at the running back position with Tank Bigsby Shaun Shivers and Jarquez Hunter.

Let’s take a look at some of the top plays from Saturday night.

Tank is going to be hard to stop this season

We all saw this play a million times on Saturday. Here you see some great blocking by the left side of the line. Brandon Council's move to left guard is already paying off. The star running back finished the deal. Bigsby celebrating at the 15 is the pure raw emotion that having fans back in the seats brings to college football.

Linemen staying on their blocks

Here's another run by Bigsby. Sure he's hard to bring down but I want you to look at right tackle Brodarious Hamm (59). He doesn't give up on his block. That was a common theme last night. Offensive linemen never stopped blocking. Discipline. Looked like a different team because of these little things.

Poise in the pocket

Here's my favorite play from Bo Nix from the game. He has every chance in the world to leave the pocket. He could have gone anywhere with the football. He took his time and looked through his options. He went with the check down to Bigsby. The correct play.

Passing to the running backs

We can expect to see more passes to the running backs this year. Great downfield blocking by Caylin Newton (25) John Samuel Shenker(47) and Malcolm Johnson Jr(16). Man Shivers in space is fun to watch.

Winning off of play-action

I love the play-action movement by the offensive line. The line did a great job selling the run. When Nix turns around he goes with his first read. The ball is a tad underthrown. Ja'Various Johnson was wide open so no harm done. Something to look at moving forward.

Shedrick Jackson deserves to be a starter

We have a similar play here. Once Nix looks downfield he goes with the first read. This time it is Shedrick Jackson. The ball is a tad underthrown but a great play by Jackson. The veteran receiver showed the world why he is a starter last night. Great news for the Auburn Tigers.

An all-around great play

This is pass and catch is absolute money. Kobe Hudson had his ups and downs during fall camp. He executed well on this route finding space and pulling in the pass. On another note watch Tank in pass protection. The guy can do everything including making sure Nix's blindside is protected.

Shivers can do it all

The way Shivers uses his power and his speed is such a valuable part of his game. He runs with a purpose. I saw someone say that he runs towards the back of the end zone not the goal line. So true. Also love the subtle cutback when he saw the hole. Shivers is a complete SEC back.

A special freshman

Jarquez Hunter had an awesome run here. I love the patience that he shows as he has to slowly work outside. Great block by Elijah Canion to help get Hunter to the outside.

He sends emergency assistance to callers when he’s at work at Isabella County Central Dispatch.

He’s also the Deerfield Township fire chief a job in which time is of the essence.

But sometimes Martin the day supervisor at the dispatch center likes to slow things down.

Way down.

Martin will be among the roughly 1500 tractor enthusiasts who will creep across the the span between Mackinaw City and St. Ignace for the 14th annual Mackinac Bridge Antique Tractor Crossing the weekend after Labor Day.

This year marks the fifth that Martin who will drive a 1953 John Deere 60 has participated in the tractor parade across the bridge.

Martin’s father-in-law Ron Koch and Koch’s father Earl Koch invited Martin to cross with them in 2016.

He’s been hooked since his first crossing.

“It is a weekend of fun for our family who spends five days in Mackinaw and St. Ignace” Martin said. “Ron and I have helped in the staging area for five years and we enjoy seeing everyone come in and help them find their parking spots.

“Besides being an annual family event we get to see people from all over the United States and even other countries make the trek to Michigan for the event.”

Most of the conversations at the event are centered around how others farm stories about participants’ antique tractors and the various equipment farmers use Martin said.

How antique tractor owners started the cross began with Robert Baumgrass the owner of Owosso Tractor Repair and Parts.

While camping with family Baumgrass pitched the idea to the Mackinac Bridge Authority about hosting an antique tractor show and crossing the weekend after Labor Day.

During the first crossing about 600 people participated Martin said.

Every year a grand marshal is selected to lead the others across the five-mile span starting at the staging area in Mackinaw City and ending at Little Bear Arena in St. Ignace moving at a pace of about 10 miles per hour.

In addition to driving his tractor across the bridge Martin was selected last year as the first honorary first responder participating in the crossing because it was scheduled for Sept. 11 2020 but the event was cancelled because of COVID-19.

Last year’s cancellation was also bittersweet for Martin because Earl his grandfather-in-law died in May 2020 and had been selected by the Baumgrass family to be last year’s grand marshal.

Martin who has more than 21 years in firefighting service said crossings in previous years were on held on the Friday after Labor Day but the bridge authority allowed the group to cross on Sept. 11 this year because it falls on a Saturday.

When the tractors get to the arena in St. Ignace the event isn’t over.

Participants and their families take part in tractor games an ice cream social and a raffle.

There is also a merchandise tent and thousands of people spend time looking at the tractors shop and go sightseeing in St Ignace Martin said.

“The weekend comes to an end with another tractor parade through downtown St. Ignace where we all say goodbye until next year” Martin said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc2l0aXZlbHluYXBlcnZpbGxlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzA1L3JpdmVyd2Fsay1yZWZsZWN0aW9ucy0xMS0yMC1oZWxwLXRlbGwtYS00MC15ZWFyLW9sZC1zdG9yeS8xMjI4NTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Riverwalk Reflections 11-20 help tell a 40-year-old story,"Above / No matter what the season the Naperville Riverwalk welcomes all ages to discover a natural treasure along the West Branch of the DuPage River just steps from shopping and dining in downtown Naperville.

Happy 40th Birthday to the Riverwalk!

The Naperville Riverwalk turns 40 on Labor Day 2021 and the Riverwalk Foundation in partnership with the Riverwalk Commission and Downtown Naperville Alliance will host a brief “rededication” to celebrate. The monumental event is set for 2PM Mon. Sept. 6 aiming to be a simple tribute to the “can-do” spirit that created the Riverwalk for the City’s sesquicentennial in 1981 in the heart of downtown.

This post is the second of four posts.

Riverwalk Reflection #11 / The Riverwalk 2000 fundraiser that extended the brick path from Washington to Hillside led to the establishment of the Riverwalk Foundation in 1997. Also in 1997 talk became more public to “gift” the Fredenhagen property (Naperville Creamery/ Prince Castle/Cock Robin Ice Cream Store) for use as a gateway park setting along the Riverwalk near the Washington Street Bridge. The gateway would lead to downtown Naperville and North Central College.

When plans were ready to go with architect’s renderings for Fredenhagen Park volunteers Ed Channell and John Schmitt stepped up to serve as fundraising chairmen for another Riverwalk amenity.

“One of my proudest moments came when Rita asked me to chair the fundraiser for Fredenhagen Park. I received a call from her one day inviting me out for breakfast… When we met at the Colonial Café she was especially cheerful and glowing. Her enthusiasm for life was simply infectious” wrote Channell back in 2012.

“As she laid out her plan for the fundraiser I raised my hand and said “Rita I’m still tired from the Riverwalk 2000 fundraiser. Every time I walk down the street and see a friend approaching they clutch their wallet and change to the other side.”



Rita Fredenhagen Harvard and Ted Fredenhagen are pictured under the signature landmark sign as plans were put in place to develop Fredenhagen Park named to honor their parents Grace and Walter Fredenhagen.

Determined to be good stewards of all donations for commemorative bricks and stones as well as park benches native trees etc. since 1997 the Riverwalk Foundation has accepted private dollars for enhancement projects in collaboration with the Riverwalk Commission the Naperville Park District and the City of Naperville.

Anybody remember Prince Castle ice cream before Cock Robin?

Mary Robinson Klingbeil wrote “The first girl on the left is my Mother-in-law (Virginia Seitz Klingbeil).”

Fredenhagen Park is now located where the Naperville Creamery and Prince Castle (later Cock Robin) used to sell ice cream. Before Fredenhagen Park the Naperville Creamery was among businesses that occupied the property.

Thanks to all friends of the Riverwalk! Thanks for the memories!

Riverwalk Reflection #12 / To help commemorate the turn of the millennium during an event known as “Celebrate 2000” a stone labyrinth was planned for the floor of the Riverwalk Amphitheater. One of PN’s favorite photos at the labyrinth features North Central College students supporting and trusting each other in August 2018.

The Riverwalk Amphitheater was enhanced for the turn of the millennium in 2000. Visit the wall to see names of individuals subdivisions businesses and other donors that supported Celebration 2000. The large plaque helps tell the story too.

The labyrinth design was created by using two colors of custom-cut stone to replicate the floor of Chartres Cathedral in France the world’s most famous medieval labyrinth.

FYI: Anyone who takes the meditative path in the Riverwalk Amphitheater will have walked the length of a football field or 360 feet.

During the 2020 September 11 Observance the Naperville Municipal Band performed in the Riverwalk Amphitheater while the annual remembrance was held across the DuPage River at the Commander Dan Shanower September 11 Memorial along the Riverwalk.

(For 2021 the September 11 Observance is planned to begin with music by the City band at 8:15AM followed by a program at 8:46AM. Note that’s morning.)

Other times wedding ceremonies and children’s programs hosted by the Nichols Library are among activities that happen in the Riverwalk Amphitheater just east of Eagle Street along Jackson Avenue.

Riverwalk Reflection #13 / In 2016 the location of the “Tribute” to Cliff Preston was recommended by Chuck Papanos North Parks & Riverwalk Operations Manager who had recognized Preston’s passions and favorite spots along the brick path during the 16 years he’d known him. For more than 20 years Preston had assumed responsibility to keep the antique farmer’s plow atop the Farmers Monument varnished and painted. Plus Preston loved fishing!

Commemorative bricks help tell the story of Cliff Preston’s commitment to volunteerism and can-do spirit.

The Navy Seabee served in World War II then came to Naperville and joined the Naperville Jaycees in the mid-1950s. Later he joined the Evening Kiwanis. He also built the display shelves at the VFW. For many years Preston was recognized for his service in the annual Naperville Memorial Day Parade always riding in a red vintage Corvette driven by Tom Priz.

The garden created as a Tribute to Cliff Preston was designed by Monica Goshorn-Maroney of Gary R. Weber Associates Inc. via approval by the 13-member Riverwalk Commission. The special garden was funded with private donations by the Riverwalk Foundation in recognition of Preston’s active community service in Naperville for 35 years 16 years of which were dedicated to the Riverwalk Commission.

In fact Preston served as Chairman of the Riverwalk Commission for a decade the period when the path was extended to Hillside Road then to Jefferson Avenue.

Riverwalk Reflection #14 / No matter the time of day or the season the Farmer’s Plaza at Eagle Street with Moser Tower in the distance is a place to pause & reflect about this city’s past present and future.

The Earl Meisinger Family donated the antique John Deere Highlander Plow (1897) atop the Farmer’s Monument in the Farmer’s Plaza located near the Eagle Street Bridge. (PN File Photo 2012)

In 1988 the Farmer’s Plaza was donated by the farm families of the Naperville Area. Ever since in all kinds of weather the plow has stood for the city’s proud rural heritage.

Throughout the city many farm families also are recognized as names of streets—Meisinger Diehl and Darfler to name a few.

At night Moser Tower in the distance is illuminated throughout the year to reflect special events and holidays.

When plans were developed to extend the Riverwalk west of Eagle Street Naperville resident Gene Darfler recalls assisting early Riverwalk devotees Jim Moser Harold Moser and Ken Koranda by connecting with the farming community to create the monument a tribute to the community’s rural heritage.

Patti Weissinger wrote “Modaffs & Meisingers are my family names on there.”

Riverwalk Reflection #13 / Cliff Preston is recognized for his long-standing commitment to the Riverwalk Commission at a “Tribute” garden located near the Farmer’s Plaza by the fishing pier.

Riverwalk Reflection #15 / Naperville civic leader Alfred Rubin was among the speakers at the Harold & Eva White Plaza during the Naperville Riverwalk dedication on Labor Day 1981.

Later as Naperville Park District and Riverwalk Commissioner in the mid-1990s Rubin came up with “Riverwalk Renaissance” a public presentation event to create interest for the extension of the Riverwalk from the Washington Street Bridge to the Hillside Avenue Bridge.

Also note that the Alfred Rubin Riverwalk Community Center located at 305 W. Jackson Ave. is named to honor the active community leader with such a big heart for downtown Naperville.

Alfred Rubin served on the board of the Naperville School District 78 from 1964 to 1969 before the public school systems were consolidated as Unit School District 203 in 1972.

Rubin also served on the Naperville City Council from 1971 to 1977 as well as on the Naperville Park Board from 1987 to March 1997.

The Alfred Rubin Riverwalk Community Center is located on Jackson Avenue at the corner of Eagle Street across from the red Landforms sculpture and the Riverwalk.

Soon after the Riverwalk Renaissance meeting in 1996 the Riverwalk 2000 Campaign was organized under the co-leadership of Ed Channell and Glen Ekey to raise funds to extend the winding brick path from Washington Street to Hillside Road.

The extension included features such as the Jaycees Gazebo and the Moser Covered Bridge. Ever since 2000 the Naperville Park District has kept the extended path cleared after a snowfall!

Riverwalk Reflection #16 / Begun in 1997 the “Buy a Brick” campaign to help fund the path from Washington to Hillside known as the “Riverwalk 2000 Campaign” welcomed everybody to support the initiative with commemorative brick sales. Today it’s fun to walk the extension and read the messages with appreciation for all friends of the Riverwalk.

Riverwalk Reflection #17 / Day is done at the Riverwalk Dandelion Fountain. Enjoy the memories!

Riverwalk Reflection #18 / Check out the Century Walk sculpture titled “Riverwalk Visionaries” a work of art that depicts art creating a permanent tribute to people places and events of this city.

The plans in Jim Moser’s hand designate that the renderings are by architect Charles Vincent George. Note that Mayor Rybicki’s tie is emblazoned with the City of Naperville logo.

Many ideas were considered to commemorate Naperville’s 150th birthday in 1981. Yet plans for a brick path along the DuPage River attracted the most volunteers and private donors. Today the Riverwalk continues to be the City’s pride and joy. And the Century Walk sculpture “Riverwalk Visionaries” helps tell the story even when the DuPage River floods over its banks.

And the sign says “Do not feed geese ducks and other waterfowl.” That sign means let all wildlife be wild without harming the animals by feeding them human snacks.

During the late 1970s Naperville visionaries with can-do spirit looked forward with ideas to commemorate Naperville’s 150th birthday in 1981. All considered restoration of the banks of the DuPage River in the heart of Naperville’s central business district rose to the top. Since 2006 no matter what season a Century Walk sculpture has stood to help tell the story.

“Riverwalk Visionaries” depicting businessman Jim Moser with Mayor Chet Rybicki is one of 51 Century Walk locations where stories of Naperville’s history are featured in public art creating a permanent tribute to people places and events of this active city.

Riverwalk Reflection #19 / A large rock west of Eagle Street where the Riverwalk winds around toward the Paddleboat Quarry rentals recognizes the Centennial Park Dedication on June 6 1931. Note local history by observing commemorative messages step by step along the winding path that help tell the story of what’s been celebrated in Naperville and remembered along the DuPage River for nearly 190 years.

Riverwalk Reflection #20 / This post almost marks half-way of 40 Riverwalk facts shared in advance of Labor Day when the Riverwalk begins its 40th year. Thanks to crews from the Naperville Park District for recent efforts to remove invasive growth and restore groundcover along the riverbanks beginning at Eagle Street.

Three staircases within short distances are available along the Riverwalk to take folks down to the low-flow walk along the DuPage River just west of the Eagle Street Bridge.

Help restore the riverbanks with groundcover. Avoid cut-throughs that create paths in the landscape. Use staircases that lead to the low-flow walkways. Help prevent unsightly and unsafe paths. Thanks!

(Somebody suggested putting up signs. We’d like to keep the landscape free of unsightly signs.)

Find a staircase right at the Eagle Street Bridge and two others spaced before the Paddle Boat Rental House. All three lead to the low-flow walk. Help keep the Riverwalk beautiful with clear sights and soft sounds of the DuPage River.

Use one of three staircases beginning on the south side of the Eagle Street Bridge whenever traipsing down to the low-flow walk. Find this one on the way to the Paddle Boat Rental House. Keep off the groundcover. Help keep the Riverwalk beautiful with clear sights and soft sounds of the DuPage River.

Walk this way to the low-flow walks.

Note… All ages are known to fish across the rushing DuPage River from this staircase…

NEW AUTOMATION ASSISTANT FOR FENDT

AGCO Corp. has released a new automation feature for Fendt. The TeachIn (TI) Turn Assistant delivers ""hands-free"" turning in the headland. Turn Assistant joins Fendt's TI Headland package which is a defined sequence of automated steps that completes a turn.

TeachIn automates a string of functions normally performed by the operator at the turn -- raise the implement slow the tractor and make an accurate turn at the right place and time.

Now when the tractor reaches a field's headland boundary Fendt TI Headland activates the steps to prepare for the turn by slowing the tractor and raising the implement. Fendt TI Turn Assistant then turns the tractor and implement hands-free.

Fendt TI Turn Assistant has two modes. First is manual start. The operator pushes a button to activate the turn left or right onto the next wayline. Second is automatic start which automatically turns the tractor on the wayline without operator assistance.

In this article:

What is Delta business class?

Delta uses a variety of terms to describe the travel experience on board its flights.

Main Cabin is regular economy Delta Comfort+ is economy with extra legroom and Delta Premium Select is premium economy.

Then ""first class"" describes the front of the plane on many Delta domestic flights (being simple reclining seats) while Delta One is the branding for the airline's flagship business class experience on both domestic and international flights.

As such Delta One equals business class and delivers a fully-flat bed on board combined with upgraded service and airport lounge access.

Three reasons we love Delta business class

1. Relax in privacy on selected aircraft

Delta puts privacy front and centre on its newest and newly-refurbished aircraft offering a sliding privacy door at your modern business class suite.

You'll typically find these on selected Boeing 777 Airbus A330-900neo and Airbus A350 flights including Delta's Sydney-Los Angeles services.

2. Consistency in business class

When a flight is sold as Delta One that's your clue that you're getting a fully-flat bed on board.

This includes both international and domestic flights and key routes such as Los Angeles to New York. If you see ""first class"" when booking your ticket you can expect a simple reclining seat – but if you see Delta One expect a bed.

Even if your aircraft is changed – such as between a Boeing 757 and a Boeing 767 on US domestic flights – Delta One still means just that.

3. Delta One includes airport lounge access

Many journeys in the United States including both domestic and international flights don't include airport lounge access as standard: even when flying in business class or first class.

Fortunately any flight booked as Delta One guarantees this perk.

Jetting from Los Angeles to New York for instance you'll have access to the same Delta Sky Club lounges as welcome passengers jetting further afield to the likes of Sydney.

Three tips before you fly business class on Delta

1. Different Delta One planes have different seats

Depending on when and where you're travelling you may have a choice between several different flights – and when those flights are served by different aircraft types it pays to know which has the best business class.

Where available your first pick should be a flight operated by an Airbus A350-900 Airbus A330-900neo or a refitted Boeing 777. These are the planes with Delta One Suites offering those helpful privacy doors.

As these aircraft are most often seen on international flights you're unlikely to encounter them regularly when travelling within the US which renders Delta's Boeing 767s Airbus A330s and older-style Boeing 777s the next-best pick.

These twin-aisle planes pair a fully-flat bed in business class with direct aisle access from every seat: ideal when there's work to do or when sleep is the goal.

There are also the Delta One-equipped Boeing 757s: single-aisle planes offering fully-flat business class beds in a 2-2 configuration:

Given the layout this requires the window-side passenger to step over or past their aisle-side neighbour although passengers travelling together may prefer these seats given the ability to socialise more easily.

2. Earn miles in a range of frequent flyer programs

Of course flights taken with Delta can earn frequent flyer points in the carrier's own SkyMiles program but its membership in the global SkyTeam alliance means you can also choose to credit your flights elsewhere.

That's particularly handy if you're already sitting on a small stash of SkyTeam miles and want to build on that tally to book your next free flight: such as by crediting your Delta flight to a program like Korean Air Skypass or Air France/KLM Flying Blue.

Delta's other bespoke partnerships with non-alliance airlines such as Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic also open the door to earning frequent flyer points in Velocity and Flying Club respectively.

3. Take home your TUMI amenity kit

Amenity kits in Delta One are provided by designer brand TUMI and come stocked with a range of products to make your flight more comfortable.

This kit is yours to take home and could be repurposed as a pencil case razor bag cable case mobile first aid pouch or a useful place to keep all your international travel adaptors together.

It can also continue its life as an amenity kit of course but be mindful that at many security checkpoints you'll need to separate all your liquids and gels into a separate clear bag.

Getting an upgrade on Delta

Delta offers unlimited complimentary upgrades to its own elite frequent flyers on many flights including US domestic routes where Delta One is sold.

These upgrades are subject to availability – and of course are only offered where a paying passenger hasn't already booked the seat. These complimentary upgrades don't cover international Delta One flights however.

Another alternative for Delta Platinum and Diamond Medallion members is to use a Regional Upgrade Certificate to confirm their domestic Delta One upgrade or for Diamond-tier guests to use a Global Upgrade Certificate to secure an international Delta One upgrade.

One other method is to use frequent flyer points or miles. Delta's own SkyMiles can be used to secure an upgrade when availability permits.

Lounge reviews for Delta One flyers

Delta Sky Club New York JFK T4

Considered one of Delta's flagship lounges when it first opened the Sky Club at JFK Terminal 4 caters to most long-distance Delta flights including cross-country treks with a standout feature being an outdoor terrace where guests can unwind.

Beyond the expected Sky Club amenities a la carte dining is available here too: but for that you'll have to pay.

Delta Sky Club Washington D.C. (DCA)

Following a refurbishment in 2018 Delta's Sky Club at DCA Airport offers views towards notable icons like the Washington Monument and the Capitol as well as bartender service and buffet dining.

The lounge isn't easy to find but once you're inside it's easy to relax.

Delta business class FAQs

Do you get pyjamas flying Delta business class?

Pyjamas aren't offered on any Delta flight.

Does Delta business class have WiFi?

Yes: most Delta flights feature inflight Internet access and the use of messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger WhatsApp and iMessage is complimentary for all guests including Delta business class flyers.

Broader access such as for emails and web browsing comes at a charge and is not included in your Delta business class fare.

Does Delta business class include lounge access?

Lounge access is included where available to business class passengers on flights sold as Delta One including domestic and international routes.

However lounge access is not included by default with your business class ticket when travelling in Delta ""first class"" (being business class by another name on flights with reclining seats) or in other cabins such as Delta Premium Select.

This is where the right frequent flyer status credit card or airport lounge membership comes in handy to get you through the door.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS91cy1tYW1tb3Rocy11bml0ZWQtZGVsdGEtYW5kLWFtZXJpY2FuLXdoYXQtYWlybGluZS1pcy1iZXN0LWZvci1wYXNzZW5nZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Mammoths: United Delta And American.

Airline employees have access to non-revenue travel meaning you'll only get a seat if there's space available. For those who like a good gamble showing up to the airport without a confirmed seat can be thrilling yet incredibly nerve-wracking.

Back in summer 2019 — also known as the golden year for air travel — I was an intern at JetBlue Airways. One of the perks was standby travel and during those 10 weeks I wanted to take full advantage of my (short-lived) benefits. Overall it was a success as I flew more than 30 times that summer with seven of those flights on the coveted JetBlue Mint business class.

During my internship I learned a lot about standby travel and the airline industry as a whole. While standby travel is certainly not for the faintest of hearts there are ways to get good at it and mitigate stress from all of the uncertainty.

How standby travel works as an airline employee

I was an intern in JetBlue's headquarters in Long Island City New York. (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy)

Whether you're a pilot flight attendant gate agent or even an intern you may have standby travel privileges that get you free flights on the airline you're working for and (potentially) on partner airlines. While you can travel for free within the 50 U.S. states any international taxes and fees will apply if you're flying out of the country.

While most airlines rank employees based on seniority and role JetBlue full-time and part-time employees were ranked on a priority list based on their check-in time. Occasionally JetBlue employees could get one-time priority passes and jump to the top of the standby list bypassing other employees on the ranking.

However as an intern I was on the same priority level as seasonal employees which meant that we were grouped under all full-time and part-time staff but above partner airline employees. Regardless of your place on the list all non-revenue travelers must show up at the gate and wait to be issued a ticket. If the flight was considerably empty the gate agent may go ahead and ticket you at the start of the boarding process. But if the flight only had a few seats left — or was completely full — all non-revenue passengers must wait until the end of the boarding process for standby seats to clear.

With this much uncertainty it's essential that you only travel with a carry-on or personal bag as you never know which flight you'll end up taking that day. Since I only had free time to travel on weekends this wasn't a problem as I never needed to check a bag in the first place.

All summer I made sure to travel light with nothing bigger than a carry-on bag. (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy)

Since JetBlue only offers paid upgrades to its passengers it was easy for non-revenue flyers to snag Even More Space (EMS) seats or even Mint seats on qualifying routes. Interns only had access to JetBlue-operated flights but full-time employees could fly standby on partner airlines as well widening the opportunities for international trips.

Finally in terms of dress and behavior you're supposed to blend in with the rest of the crowd while looking neat and polished. For example you're not allowed to wear flip flops or sweatpants as a non-revenue passenger.

Your standby benefits extend to immediate family

At JetBlue your standby benefits as a full-time employee extend to your immediate family (spouse dependent children and parents). Airline employees will also get buddy passes throughout the year handing them out to extended family or friends.

My mom and I went on some cool trips that summer including to San Francisco. (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy)

As an intern I could extend my travel privileges to my parents and one designated travel companion. I brought my mom with me on several trips that summer and I think she enjoyed the standby privileges as much as I did.

How to work the odds in your favor

Now that I've given a brief rundown here's how you can work standby travel in your favor. While some of it's luck there's actually more strategy involved.

First I had access to a separate website where I'd book non-revenue tickets and monitor flight loads in real time. For example my new intern friend Peter and I wanted to start easy. That means we weren't interested in flying a competitive route such as New York (JFK) to Los Angeles (LAX) from the get-go.

Instead we picked New York (JFK) to Nantucket on the first flight of the day — 7:10 a.m. We checked the flight loads the night before and since there were 60+ empty seats we knew we could hop on this flight with no issues. We were ticketed as soon as we arrived at the gate.

There's no better feeling than getting your seat confirmed when you're on standby. (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy)

A perk of standby travel that I hadn't considered before is that you have flexibility in your travel plans. We did a quick day trip in Nantucket and there were plenty of flights going back to New York that day (JFK and LGA). While we were initially intending on leaving around dinnertime we decided to hop back on the flight around 4 p.m. so we could get back to Manhattan earlier.

On my way home from San Diego I wanted to try out Mint for the first time but there were only a few seats left and a long list of standby passengers. Instead I decided to book a flight to Boston-Logan International Airport (BOS) to snag a Mint seat and then jumped on a flight from Boston to New York (LGA).

What happens when there's not a seat available

Out of the 30+ flights I took that summer I was denied boarding only once. Those are some pretty good odds especially since the summer is the busiest travel season and full of bad weather delays.

My mom and I wanted to fly to Los Angeles so we picked the first flight of the day that had about 15 seats the morning of. With other higher priority employees on the list there was only one seat left. My mom took the last seat while I hopped on standby for the next flight that left just an hour later and we finally met up at the airport.

There are several other instances where seats may fill up last minute. For example delays and cancellations can lead to rebooking on later flights during the day — so that flight with 30 seats available might be snatched up by revenue passengers. That's why it's important to monitor the flight loads religiously check the forecast and see where the aircraft is coming from or going since numbers can change last minute.

Standby travel is also a game of exercising patience as gate agents are often overworked when it comes to delays and cancellations. We were advised to never go up to the gate until boarding has finished as you'll want to stay out of the way as much as possible.

Several interns and I flew to St. Martin at the end of the summer. To ensure that we'd all get back to New York some of us took the earlier flight home while the others took the later flight. No matter how many seats are available it's always stressful not to have a confirmed ticket so splitting up helped us travel together without leaving one of us stranded.

Spontaneity is the spice of life

Thanks to JetBlue offering free in-flight Wi-Fi I could then plan the rest of my trip once I got a confirmed seat and was en route to my destination. Depending on where I was going I would only bring enough clothes for a day trip. I would look at last-minute hotels or Airbnbs on the flight.

On the ground I would spend most of my time walking spending time on the beach or exploring restaurants in the area. Standby travel is an entirely different way to travel than I've ever experienced.

Bottom line

As someone who's quite spontaneous already I loved the thrill of non-revenue travel and exploring a new destination for a fraction of the cost. However as I returned to a ""normal"" paying passenger I also enjoy the peace of mind that comes with a confirmed booking and the ability to earn points and miles and work toward elite status.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2FsYXNrYS1haXJsaW5lcy12YWNjaW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Courage Or Cowardice? Alaska Airlines Takes Middle Road On Employee Vaccinations,"Alaska Airlines will not require its existing employees to be vaccinated or fine them for choosing to forgo the jab. However those employees will be subject to “regular” testing and other restrictions. In leaving it up to employee is Alaska taking a courageous position or a cowardly one?

Alaska Airlines Takes Cautious Approach To Employee Vaccinations

In one corner are carriers like United Airlines and Frontier which require all employees to be vaccinated. With full FDA authorization granted for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (now known as Comirnaty) United employees have until September 27th to be fully vaccinated of face termination.

On the other end American Airlines has encouraged its employees to get vaccinated but left it totally up to them with no mandate or even testing requirements.

Between the two Delta Air Lines will not require existing employees to be vaccinated but will fine them $200/month if they take part in company-sponsored healthcare and withhold COVID pay if they contract COVID-19 and are not vaccinated.

Alaska Airlines is taking a slightly different approach. Employees who choose not to vaccinated will:

face “regular” mandatory testing

participate in a vaccine education program

not receive special COVID pay

Employees who are vaccinated will receive a $200 bonus. Furthermore all new hires must be vaccinated.

One Mile At A Time calls the policy “disappointing” and asks:

“I don’t really get the message that Alaska Airlines is trying to send here either. The company states it’s committed to protecting employees and guests agrees vaccination is the best way to do that the vaccine now has full approval yet the airline won’t require vaccination? I don’t understand the disconnect here…”

Those are reasonable concerns and his logic is sound. I think the missing issue is the litigation that Alaska does not want to deal with. U.S. federal law actually leaves room for tremendous personal autonomy when it comes to vaccines and religious exemptions need only be sincere not even necessarily reasonable or proven through past practice.

During the pandemic we have seen certain churches push back against neutrally-applicable restrictions to gathering on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment free exercise clause. Los Angeles County has spent millions of dollars paying legal fees for churches its sued to stop indoor worship during the pandemic. The Supreme Court has said to stay “hands off” religion. My hunch is that the same legal logic will be applied to employer-initiated vaccine mandates for those who push back on religious grounds.

(In that sense I think United is eventually going to roll over to employees who refuse even on vague religious grounds or face many lawsuits.)

Thus I don’t see the Alaska position as courageous as much as it is realist and practical. That said I do think that Delta’s policy has a lot more teeth while still falling within the current First Amendment jurisprudence.

CONCLUSION

Alaska Airlines will only hire new employees who are vaccinated and will subject current employees who refuse the COVID-19 to regular testing. While such a policy appears weak for an airline that voices full support for the vaccine it likely recognizes the practical legal boundaries that we are only beginning to see.

Packing your portfolio with rapidly growing stocks is key but it's all too easy to buy growth stocks that fizzle out after a couple of quarters. If you want to become more wealthy over the next few years and beyond you'll need to identify companies that are supported by a handful of different trends and capabilities that reinforce their consistent and meaty growth.

All three of the healthcare companies I'll discuss today are highly successful and they're also escalating their revenue-making potential by building on their difficult-to-imitate products. While the largest gains will go to investors who hold these innovative companies for years they're also moving quickly enough to make the time between now and 2024 quite exciting so let's dive in.

1. Intuitive Surgical

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.32%) sells robotic surgery units to hospitals around the world and business is booming. Even amid the economic disruption of the pandemic the company increased its base of installed systems by 10% between June 2020 and the same period in 2021. That's a strongly positive sign for Intuitive's future as every installed robotic surgery system implies significant future revenue from maintenance and sales of fresh tools and accessories. In 2020 a stunning 77% of its revenue was recurring.

And the more procedures that the robots perform per year the more the hospitals end up spending. From the second quarter of 2019 until Q2 2021 the number of procedures performed by Intuitive's robots increased by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.5%. In terms of revenue that works out to a CAGR of 15% -- despite the near-total stoppage of elective surgical procedures amid the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

Moving forward Intuitive will be looking to increase the rate of new system installations to make up for lost time in 2020. All the while it'll be working on making new surgical tools and instruments to expand the range of procedures that its robots can perform. That will lead to higher revenue from existing customers and it might serve to attract new buyers too.

While competitors may be starting to make inroads into the robotic surgery market investors probably don't need to worry very much. Once hospitals have spent time and money training surgeons on a given surgical system there's a high cost to switch to a competing product so Intuitive can continue to make long-lasting headway even as competitors become more established.

2. Align Technology

Align Technology (ALGN -3.10%) makes invisible removable teeth straighteners that are comparable in function to braces. But the company's Invisalign-branded products are arguably much more aesthetically appealing than braces which is no small ingredient in its recipe for success.

By solving a key problem with a formerly dominant legacy product Align has had an easy time finding prospective customers and gaining market share. Internet searches for doctors capable of fitting patients for Invisalign increased by 82% year over year in Q2.

Align also sells imaging technology to dental care professionals which they can use to fit their patients for the company's straighteners. So it makes money first when customers want to have the ability to sell its main product and then again when customers buy cases of straighteners to distribute to patients. And sales are hot: In the second quarter of 2021 revenue from imaging systems rose by a whopping 20% sequentially and income from cases of aligners rose by 11.6% sequentially making for more than $1 billion in total revenue for the period.

Finally Align is slated to reward its shareholders by initiating an accelerated stock buyback program worth $75 million to speed up its existing buyback program that's budgeted for $1 billion. The accelerated buyback should be finished by late October so expect some upward pressure on the stock price between now and then.

3. DexCom

DexCom (DXCM -0.85%) develops continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for people with type 2 diabetes. Unlike the traditional finger-stick method for measuring a person's glucose level DexCom's CGMs use a disposable under-the-skin sensor that patients wear for 10-day intervals. Then the sensor uploads data to a smartphone app where patients can see their glucose levels in real time. That means patients can recognize when to take corrective action earlier thereby better protecting their health and comfort -- and without needing to prick their finger multiple times per day. And when patients exhaust their supply of wearable sensors they'll need to put in an order for another case. So there's a recurring component to DexCom's revenue base which helps it grow more consistently.

Much like with Align Technologies DexCom's product practically sells itself just because it doesn't have the fundamental flaws of the traditional option. Thus it's no surprise that the company's total revenue grew by 32% year over year to reach $595 million in the second quarter of this year. What's more management expects its gross profit margin to rise to 67% an even larger increase than it initially predicted for 2021.

Before the end of the year DexCom expects to launch the seventh edition of its CGM device. Meanwhile management will be proceeding with international sales efforts in new major markets including France Turkey and India. Its stellar product expanding revenue and strengthening margins provide quite a lot for investors to like and the next few years should be exciting for shareholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the story of what Majesco was born to do (insurance-technology services) how it traversed a global pathway as a publicly-listed company in India—and why it is on a whole new mission under a new name.





""We are shaping the future of insurance by bringing about the next big change"" said Majesco in its annual report for financial year (FY) 2020.





But six months ago property developer Aurum Group bought the promoter's stake in Majesco through its subsidiary Aurum Platz IT. It now owns 35.07 percent stake in Majesco listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange which it plans to develop as a property technology—proptech—company. PropTech ventures develop technology solutions for the real estate market.





For most of its life Majesco has been a provider of insurance software consulting and services for global enterprises.





It began in 1992 as a subsidiary of Mastek a multinational software company in India that helps global enterprises in digital transformation. Mastek clocked an income of Rs 1750 crore and profit of Rs 252 crore in FY 2021.





Majesco served as Mastek's insurance business to leverage the opportunities in the growing global market. Its main business was in the United States where the company was known as MajescoMastek. It provided core technology solutions and services that help modernise and bring change to property and casualty (P&C) life and annuity (L&A) and group and employee benefits insurance carriers.





In 2014 Mastek decided to demerge its insurance products and services business to Majesco.

""While the insurance business offers us tremendous growth potential it has high investment requirements in terms of R&D brand-building and sales"" Mastek said in a demerger presentation in September 2014.

Mastek provides technological solutions to businesses to help them in digital transformation. Majesco—the insurance products and services business—was largely Intellectual Property (IP) centric and domain sensitive. It contributed about 55 percent of Mastek’s revenue then.





With different business models and growth opportunities Mastek said the insurance business required different kinds of investments and a larger talent pool.





Mastek had already invested $90 million in research and development between 2009 and 2014. It needed more capital to grow faced challenges in raising funds independently because of its business structure.

“The US insurance industry is in the midst of a once-in-a-generation modernisation cycle providing an excellent opportunity for Majesco to gain a large share in the growing market"" said Ketan Mehta Director and Co-founder of Mastek back then.

""This restructuring will enable creation of a strong platform to pursue the next stage of growth” he said in the statement. Mehta was CEO of Majesco and later its chairman.





The demerger led to the transfer by Majesco of the offshore insurance operations business in India to Majesco Software and Solution India a wholly owned subsidiary of Majesco Software and Solution USA.





And Majesco focused solely on products related to the insurance industry. It launched products such as Majesco DigitalConnect Majesco Business Analytics and Majesco Testing Services in 2016. In the previous year it increased its R&D investments by 57 percent that year according to its annual report.





Majesco clocked revenue of Rs 1040.5 crore in financial year 2020 with a five-year compounded annual growth rate of 6.56 percent.





In 2020 Majesco was still growing as an insurtech—technology innovations in insurance—company with more than 200 global customers according to its annual report in 2020. It was innovating with solutions based on cloud and using data to leverage the opportunities.

It had begun transitioning from a services business to a product company specialising in cloud-based solutions. In fact Majesco was ready for a new suitor in the year of the pandemic.





On July 20 2020 Majesco agreed to sell its US arm to a private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $594 million. Post deal Thoma Bravo would take Majesco US private. The valuation represented a premium of 74 percent above its average closing price in the 30-trading day period ended July 17 2020.





Majesco's valuation jumped even higher after it received another proposal from an unaffiliated third party to buy its business.





On August 8 2020 Majesco signed an amended agreement with Thoma Bravo which agreed to buy it for $729 million. The deal concluded in September 2020.





“Majesco India (the listed company in India) holds 74.07 percent stake in the US entity (Majesco US). Hence based on the stake the company will now receive cash of $513.8 million” ICICI Direct said in a research report dated August 10 2020.





In Indian rupees considering capital tax gain and cash on the balance sheet this meant Majesco India got about Rs 3144.7 crore analysts said in the note. The US entity now owned all of Majesco's global operations. And all the subsidiaries including Europe belonged to Thomas Bravo.





Still Majesco was listed on Indian stock exchanges. In an earnings call on August 14 2020 Farid Kazani—then Majesco's Managing Director—said the company would distribute the cash it got to its shareholders.

“The ultimate process will be in doing the compulsory delisting and dissolution” Kazani said referring to Majesco's Indian entity. But “there are other ways to structure it so that it effectively puts more money in the hands of the shareholder.”

Majesco's shareholders received the money from the deal through share-buyback and dividend. It bought back 7470540 shares for Rs 631 crore on December 18. Its board approved the dividend of Rs 974 which was about 195 times the face value of its share.





The company had said in a stock exchange filing that the balance cash reserves estimated at Rs 103 crore were to be distributed depending on approval from company’s board and regulators.





Majesco also owned real-estate assets—a seven-storey building with 120000 square feet—in Mahape in Navi Mumbai Maharashtra according to its management in an earnings call. Majesco planned to sell this Kazani told The Economic Times.





But this did not go as planned.





In March this year property developers Aurum Platz IT acquired the promoter’s stake of 14.78 percent in Majesco. It extended an open offer to shareholders to acquire 26 percent more stake in the company. As of June 2021 Aurum Platz IT has 34.57 percent stake in the company.

“Majesco is an excellent strategic fit to transform the real estate value chain” Ashish Deora CEO of Aurum Group said in Majesco's latest annual report. Aurum says it's a technology-driven real estate company in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.

Technology will make it efficient to build create monetise maintain capital in real estate Deora said.





Majesco had found a new core business. Aurum wants to leverage technology in real estate which is going through a “paradigm shift” with digital solutions for project management supply chain marketing sales and asset management it said in its annual report.





“Our vision entails building an integrated real estate ecosystem that can be automated with the API framework while supporting its integrated contact-centre capabilities” Deora said. The company is partnering with technology companies that offer products and services in real estate in the country.





“The plan is to integrate their products and solutions within our ecosystem” said Deora. In July the Aurum Group took the first step in that direction. It acquired 51 percent equity stake in a Pune-based startup called K2V2 Technologies in line with its strategy to build a digital ecosystem for real estate.





Aurum Group will pay Rs 40 crore in cash to K2V2. The startup builds CRM technology services and enterprise solutions for the real estate industry in India.





K2V2 is the market leader in real estate CRM (customer relationship management) software. It generated Rs 12.68 crore of revenue in FY 2021 up 11 percent over the previous year.





In one year Majesco had evolved from an insurtech business to Aurum Proptech.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0ZWNoLmNvLnphL25ld3MvcHJvcGVydHkvNTE3NTY2L2Jld2FyZS10aGVzZS1wcm9wZXJ0eS1zY2Ftcy1pbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beware these property scams in South Africa,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://businesstech.co.za/news/property/517566/beware-these-property-scams-in-south-africa/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0ZWNoLmNvLnphL25ld3MvcHJvcGVydHkvNTE3NTY2L2Jld2FyZS10aGVzZS1wcm9wZXJ0eS1zY2Ftcy1pbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

J.D. Power recently released its 2021 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study. For the last 15 years the consumer intelligence company has ranked card issuers on a 1000-point scale. This year national card issuers received an average score of 809.

Even though most consumers aren't contacting their credit card companies too often it's nice to know you won't spend hours on hold or deal with subpar service if you do need to get in touch. If you're looking for the best credit card options in terms of customer service you'll find the top five national issuers below along with how well they scored.

1. American Express (838)

When it comes to providing an excellent customer experience American Express is hard to beat. This is the 11th time it has been number one according to J.D. Power's rankings.

Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards

It's clear that American Express prioritizes customer satisfaction. Wait times are generally on the shorter side it has plenty of special offers and events for its clients and it provides a quality mobile app.

Another notable perk is the complimentary protections many American Express cards offer. These can include:

While other card issuers have similar protections they typically offer them through third-party companies. American Express offers these protections itself which often results in a smoother claim process.

2. Discover (837)

Discover is also a mainstay near the top of these rankings and it was second here by a razor-thin margin just like in the 2020 study. It finished first in the 2019 study.

This is another card issuer that has invested in customer service. Discover offers 24/7 assistance and U.S.-based agents are available by phone live chat and messaging.

Quality service isn't the only part of Discover's winning formula. Discover credit cards are well-liked because they have valuable benefits their rewards are easy to use and they've gotten rid of common fees. None of Discover's cards charge an annual fee or a foreign transaction fee and Discover automatically waives your first late fee.

3. Capital One (815)

After a seven-point improvement Capital One went from slightly below average in the 2020 study to a little above average in 2021.

That's somewhat surprising considering that Capital One had lengthy hold times early in the COVID-19 pandemic. It also reduced some cardholders' credit limits during the pandemic. The J.D. Power study mentioned that credit limit issues were a big source of consumer frustration.

Capital One credit cards may have helped balance out those problems. The card issuer offers a variety of quality card products that can fit just about any consumer's needs.

4. Chase (807)

Even though Chase was fourth it was two points below average. As a whole national credit card issuers didn't have a great year for customer satisfaction.

If these rankings were based solely on each issuer's credit cards Chase would have an argument for first place. Chase credit cards are extremely popular and most of them score highly in reviews. It has fantastic rewards cards in particular including for cash back and travel rewards.

Unfortunately some consumers have found Chase's customer service lacking. It would be nice to see Chase improve in this area and score better next year.

5. Bank of America and Citi (805)

These two credit card companies tied for fifth place with a score four points lower than average. They took two different paths to get there though.

Bank of America fell by seven points from the 2020 study. This card issuer doesn't have quite as many options as some of its competitors. It does however offer bonus credit rewards to clients in its Preferred Rewards program. Those who qualify can get much more value from Bank of America credit cards.

Citi scored four points higher in 2021 than it did in 2020. While it's still below average it has been making small steady improvements. And even though it isn't the most popular card issuer several of the best Citi credit cards are top options in their categories.

The best of the rest

The rankings above are for national card issuers that met J.D. Power's study award criteria. There were also a few notable card issuers that didn't fit into that group.

Goldman Sachs the card issuer for the Apple Card received a score of 864. It's considered a midsize card issuer and it was far ahead of that group's average score of 796.

USAA received a score of 860. It's a national card issuer that didn't meet the study award criteria.

Navy Federal Credit Union received a score of 866. It's a midsize card issuer that didn't meet the study award criteria.

It was a down year overall for customer satisfaction with credit card companies but there were still card issuers that excelled. American Express and Discover did well as usual. Although other national issuers had their issues it was a challenging year because of COVID-19. With any luck scores will improve next year.",,,,,,,,,

“I was just coming in to get a few things honestly … ”

He committed one of the kindest deeds the manager of the Dollar General store at Hwy. 51 and Tracy Road in Atoka has seen.

“People pay it forward sometimes but we’ve never seen it like that” Terann Fisher said.

During a quick stop at the store on Aug. 18 a customer in front of Caleb was struggling with paying for something onlooker Lou Wright said and Caleb wanted to help.

“Caleb wanted to pay for her things but he did not want to embarrass her so he did something very kind and clever” said Lou Wright who was also in line.

And so he did what few people have done.

“There was a line behind me and everybody had a few things so I just told the lady to ring up everybody behind me” Caleb said.

He said the man behind him in line seemed as if he were going to bow out of the gesture but Caleb wouldn’t let him.

“I said ‘Oh no it’s going all the way back there.’

He planned on just paying and leaving but Lou caught up to him in the parking lot.

“I flagged him down as I was leaving and told him what a wonderful gesture that was and I knew exactly why he did what he did” she said. “In fact a man that was walking in witnessed what he did and proceeded to pay for the lady behind him!”

She took his photo and shared the story of his kindness on Facebook which quickly garnered a lot of attention.

“I’m a real shy person it’s a lot of attention but it’s positive attention” the 22-year-old Tipton County native who works in construction with Mississippi State said.

The well-circulated post got the attention of the Dollar General Corporation. On Saturday morning the store manager two local district managers and the region director presented Caleb with two gift cards – one for him and one to encourage him to continue paying it forward – as well as a donation to the Bread of Life Food Pantry in his honor.

“One of the things we do is we celebrate acts of kindness at Dollar General so if any of our employees go above and beyond we’ll usually find that employee and make a donation to a charitable organization in that area” said region director Mark Person. “We don’t usually do that with customers …”

They decided Caleb’s good deed was worthy of an honor usually limited to those employed by the Goodlettsville-based corporation. He was also given the Walk the Walk recognition from Dollar General.

“One of the things we commit to is giving back to areas that are underserved that are food deserts so we made a donation because of that act of kindness” Person said.

After the donation Caleb handed customers in line the gift card and paid it forward again.

“Look at that …” Person said as the customers were being photographed with district managers. “We were hoping he’d do that and he did.”

“A lot of people are just thanking me for … being me I guess” Caleb said. “And a lot of people are seeing that and paying it forward as well. That’s all I wanted. Especially since it’s where I grew up I love to see it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZG9sbGFyLXN0b3JlLWNoYWlucy1sZWFkLXJldGFpbC1zdG9yZS1vcGVuaW5ncy11c9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZG9sbGFyLXN0b3JlLWNoYWlucy1sZWFkLXJldGFpbC1zdG9yZS1vcGVuaW5ncy11cy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar store chains are leading retail store openings in US: report,"Dollar stores appear to be having a renaissance in the U.S.

Three of the country’s leading dollar store retail chains – Dollar General Dollar Tree and Family Dollar – are opening up more stores than most big-box retailers in 2021 according to data from Coresight Research.

The retail analysis company looked at nearly 60 big-box brands and recorded the number of store openings and closings that have been announced to the public year-to-date.

As of Friday Aug. 27 the three dollar store chains made up more than a third of all the big-box retail openings Coresight Research analyzed.

Combined the three dollar store chains make up 1626 out of the 4616 announced store openings Coresight Research reported on.

""Dollar stores are leading store openings so far this year continuing a trend we’ve seen for the last few years as this sector exploits a market opportunity and it’s being driven in part by the longer-term bifurcation in the economy where higher income customers are doing well but lower income consumers are still on tight budgets"" Coresight Research’s Head of Global Research John Mercer told FOX Business.

He went on ""Dollar stores opening up in convenient locations including rural and suburban locations have positioned themselves well to serve that end of the market.

“We call ourselves a dollar store boutique” Roscoe said. “We’re like a boutique because we have unique things. We differentiate ourselves from the average dollar store because every week we have different unique things either home decor or kitchen items or whimsical items. Quality items for less basically. We have the essentials but then we also have the everyday items that come in that may be unique.

“Like we may have that phone jail that everybody goes crazy about when you put your phone (in the jail) and lock it because all the kids aren’t paying attention at family time so you lock their phone up.” Sure enough when Roscoe looked on a shelf to give an example of a phone jail she learned that they had been sold out.

Dollar Essentials 5404 Mayfield Road (at Commodore Road just east of the Brown Derby restaurant) opened in August 2020 during a time when many existing stores were finding it difficult to operate because of the pandemic.

“Everyone was advising us not to open then but we did it” Roscoe said. “And we did real real well.

“I like it here. It’s a perfect location off of a main street and we get a lot of people from the community who walk here. And there are people who are driving by even from out of town they’ll just stop because we’re on a main street and say ‘I just wanted to check you guys out.’”

The store co-owned and managed by Roscoe’s sister Nellie Hudson is extremely neat and clean. It is a favorite stop of Lyndhurst Mayor Patrick Ward who calls the owners “great people.” Business has gone so well at Dollar Essentials that expansion is in the works. The wall that separated it from the former office storefront to the west has been removed and is being stocked increasing the store’s size from 3100 square feet to 5200 square feet.

Hope Roscoe who co-owns Dollar Essentials in Lyndhurst with her sister Nellie Hudson.

Speaking of what will fill some of that new space Roscoe said “We’ll have unique popup weekly treasures. We’ll have different things for a week so you see them now and get them before they’re gone. And we’ll expand our multi-crafts into the new area we’ll expand our baby (related items) and definitely our party (merchandise) too.

“Our party items and balloons are becoming our niche” said Roscoe like her sister a University Heights resident. “We do a lot of (party) business so we’re expanding our party line.”

The store has rows of items devoted to among other things cleaning supplies school and office supplies kitchen items health and beauty home decor hardware snacks and tech products.

Roscoe took a big career turn in deciding to open a retail store. Prior to opening Dollar Essentials she worked two years for the law firm Squire Patton Boggs in Cleveland as an HR recruiting coordinator recruiting for the firm law school students. Prior to that her job for 15 years was with the law firm Vorys Sater Seymour & Pease operating its mediation and arbitration program.

Before being laid off by Squire Patton Boggs Roscoe found and read a management paper she had written on dollar stores as part of her work for the firm.

“I wrote about them because I was going to dollar stores and I wasn’t happy with the experience. They were junky you were shopping out of boxes they were dirty. So I thought ‘We’re going to create a dollar boutique where we want the shopping experience to be extraordinary.’ Even though you’re shopping where you can penny pinch you can still have that experience that you have when you’re going to Target.”

The family business which includes other relatives among its seven employees is also making it a point to be a contributor to the local community. Dollar Essentials is partnering with Brush High High School and its ATCV program a vocational program that trains and assists students with disabilities.

“We give them training and teach them work ethic and teach them how to do everything in the business” she said. “It gives them a step up so that when they enter the world they’ll have real-life experience training when they try to get a job because it already sets them back with the challenges they face.”

Dollar Essentials is open for business from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Fridays; 9 a.m. to 8p.m. Saturdays; and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays. Call 440-566-0146.

It has been earmarked as the “comfort food” of the pandemic.

In the first nine months of 2020 when the pandemic was raging across the world when other restaurants were falling like ninepins in America pizza chains Domino’s and Papa John were doing roaring business. Their combined revenue skyrocketed to the extent that it was roughly equivalent to both companies selling about 30 million more large cheese pizzas than they had the year before said a report in News18.

Pizza sales recorded a 4 per cent growth last year said the report quoting Technomic a food industry research and consulting firm. Pizza and chicken were the only food categories that grew in the pandemic said media reports.

Even as most pizza chains saw an uptick in sales Domino’s had the biggest slice of the US market when the world entered the pandemic. According to Bloomberg Intelligence last year Domino’s captured 19 per cent of total pizza sales in the US thanks to its dominance in delivery.

The Michigan-based company which had invested heavily in technology had introduced innovative contactless delivery systems like Carside (the delivery person would place the pizza in the trunk of the car) and Pizza Pedestal. The pedestal is a small cardboard foldout structure on which pizzas are placed to avoid contact with customers or potentially infected surfaces said a Deccan Herald report.

In Houston the company was testing out an autonomous vehicle delivery system in partnership with Nuro said a CNBC report in April this year.

As demand surged during the pandemic Domino’s quickly hired 30000 people; ramped up its production of dough though it faced challenges like lack of meat supplies during coronavirus outbreaks at meat production facilities. But the company persevered and even went to the extent of re-shooting their TV commercials to show drivers wearing masks during deliveries.

The Kentucky-based pizza chain Papa John’s too recorded a 28 per cent increase in sales at its North American restaurants in the second quarter of 2020 as compared with the year before said a Fortune report. To cope with the demand the company had hired 20000 additional employees between March and June and its shares started spiking by 55 per cent. This boom came during the pandemic after years of underperforming.

The penchant for pizza was not ignored by others in the restaurant industry which has been severely impacted by the pandemic. To cash in on this trend many eateries started including pizzas in their menu.

But it was Domino’s that bagged the “biggest slice” of the US market. According to Bloomberg Intelligence the company grabbed a 36 per cent share in US delivery sales in 2019 as compared to the combined total of 26 per cent of other major chains. While regional chains and independent restaurants had garnered 38 per cent said the Fortune report.

Domino’s generated $240 million in net income through the first half of 2020 a 30 per cent increase over last year despite slower growth in international markets.

A more recent CNBC report stated that Domino’s reported results from the first quarter of 2021 showed that global retail sales were up 16.7 per cent from a year ago while same-store sales in the US grew 13.4 per cent. The stock is up 8.48 per cent so far this year added the report.

While experts don’t know how long the pandemic pizza boom will last consumer behavior is expected to stay on course on these lines as people have adjusted to the new ease of ordering online and will stick to their new habits.

But Domino’s seemed to have hit the mark to meet the consumers’ increased demand for pepperoni-and-cheese–topped pizza – the comfort food of our troubled times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VzLW5ld3MvbWFuLWx1cmVzLWV4LXdpZmUtZGVhdGgtMjQ4OTQ1NjbSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJyb3IuY28udWsvbmV3cy91cy1uZXdzL21hbi1sdXJlcy1leC13aWZlLWRlYXRoLTI0ODk0NTY2LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jilted man lures his ex-wife to her death with fake Domino’s pizza delivery order,"Ashley Biggs 25 was trying to build a relationship with her daughter but her ex and his new partner would stop at nothing to ensure she didn't

Jilted man lures his ex-wife to her death with fake Domino’s pizza delivery order

The order placed at Domino’s was for a half-pepperoni half-mushroom pizza to be delivered to a business address at midnight. It was 20 June 2012 and the driver who would fulfil the order was Ashley Biggs.

The 25-year-old had been in the US army and now worked for the pizza chain in New Franklin Ohio.

She needed the money as she was in the middle of a custody battle with her ex Chad Cobb with whom she had a seven-year-old daughter.

Ashley had met Cobb at a roller rink in 2003 after he’d returned home following a six-month stint in the military.

They developed a relationship but Ashley left Cobb after their daughter was born later joining the military herself and starting a romance with a woman.

Cobb was awarded full custody of his daughter in 2007 but Ashley decided she wanted to play a part in her child’s life.

By October 2011 they were fighting each other through court orders.

Ashley complained that Cobb had changed his phone number which violated the court agreement while he said Ashley was trying to alienate him from his daughter.

Ashley accused Cobb of taking their girl out of the state – also against their agreement – but he said that was a lie. It was getting messy.

Cobb was now married to Erica who he’d met online and they had started a family of their own having two children. Cobb also had another child from a previous relationship and of course his daughter with Ashley.

But after raising her Cobb now feared he was going to lose his little girl.

Meanwhile Ashley continued her job at Domino’s and fought to see more of her daughter.

When the order for the half-pepperoni half-mushroom pizza came in Ashley headed off to deliver it.

The destination would turn out to be a closed business in Akron with a deserted car park.

It was an incredibly unusual place for a pizza to be delivered but customers often had unusual requests.

Only this time Ashley didn’t return from the drop-off and when colleagues couldn’t get hold of her they filed a missing person report at 12.45am.

Police traced Ashley’s steps to the remote area and found evidence of a struggle with large amounts of blood on the ground. They started to fear for Ashley’s safety.

It seemed she had been lured to that deserted spot and then ambushed. But where was Ashley – and her car – now?

A search began and Ashley’s girlfriend was frantic with worry. Tragically just a few hours later her body was found in the boot of her car abandoned in a cornfield.

There was evidence of Tasering and once incapacitated she had been strangled. The killer used a 4ft zip tie – and straight away that gave investigators a clue. Cobb owned a cable installation company that regularly used zip ties.

Officers found him hiding in a nearby woodland area and arrested him.

In February 2013 Cobb 38 pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping. He was sentenced to life in jail without the possibility of parole.

His wife Erica divorced him while he was incarcerated and married one of his friends in 2015 becoming Erica Stefanko.

Perhaps the wedding angered Cobb because he started to change his story. At the time of his arrest he didn’t implicate his wife – but now he was.

For seven years police watched Erica. They suspected she knew more about Ashley’s murder than she was letting on.

Then it transpired that Cobb’s mum Cindee had recorded a phone call with Erica during which she’d allegedly admitted to placing the pizza order and covering up the murder.

“Every time I hear a siren I think ‘They’re coming for me’” she was recorded saying. “I carried out my part. I did exactly what he told me to do.”

Erica also said the murder was to stop Ashley getting custody of her daughter.

“Do I feel bad about what happened to her?” Erica said. “No I really don’t.”

Erica even said that Cobb had talked about keeping Ashley’s skull “as a trophy”.

Cindee made the recording in 2014 but didn’t give it to the police until 2018. In November 2019 Erica was arrested.

Investigators were confident that Erica had assisted with the murder – that she had lured Ashley to the car park then helped Cobb dump the body.

They believed she then returned home with Cobb where they washed away evidence. Erica received multiple charges including murder and kidnapping.

Her trial last year dubbed the “pizza delivery murder” received national attention and was streamed live. The prosecution said she played a vital role in Ashley’s death and was in fact the brains behind the plan. She’d been the one to place the fake pizza order.

They said Cobb had Tasered Ashley then beaten and strangled her. Erica had then followed Cobb as he’d driven Ashley’s body to the cornfield near his parents’ house then she’d driven him home. It was all because of the contentious custody battle.

Cobb and Ashley’s daughter now 15 testified in court – and it was damning. Identified simply as “GC” she recalled how when she was seven and sitting in the back seat of a car she heard Erica place a fake pizza delivery order to an empty parking lot.

The teen said she couldn’t remember the alias used or where they were as it was “pitch black”.

She had then fallen asleep and woken the next day at her grandparents’ house. GC admitted that she didn’t have any memories of her murdered mum and that although there were times when she got on with her stepmum Erica she said she “didn’t treat me right and nobody really knew”.

She said Erica was jealous of her relationship with her dad and was mentally and physically abusive.

“She would tell me if I told my dad what she was doing to me she’d do worse” GC testified. “She’d hold me on the ground and hit me and then make me eat dog faeces.”

The defence argued that GC was too young at the time of the murder to take the stand.

But the court allowed it – and her testimony matched that of Cobb who insisted that Erica had placed the bogus call for the pizza and he had then lain in wait dressed in camouflage.

“Ashley did not leave that parking lot alive did she?” the court put to Cobb. “No she did not” he replied via video link from prison.

Cobb said that after killing Ashley he’d taken a shower to wash off the blood and then he and Erica went back to the crime scene to clean up the blood there – with all four of their children in the car – but saw the police were there and kept driving.

Erica’s defence argued that Cobb was trying to implicate her in an attempt to get out of prison and that he was annoyed she had married a man he considered to be a best friend.

“Here’s a person who’s admitted his guilt admitted that he beat admitted that he strangled Ashley Biggs… and yet now he’s trying to get out of it” they said. “How credible is that kind of person?”

But the jury believed him.

In the November Erica was found guilty of murder and aggravated murder. She looked visibly shocked. Her legal team requested a new trial because of a procedural error and due to pressure on the jury to reach a decision amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

The bid delayed sentencing but it was ultimately denied. In July this year Erica 38 was sentenced to life in prison. She was told she would only be eligible for parole after serving 30 years.

Finally both of Ashley’s killers were behind bars. Tragically her quest to be part of her daughter’s life again had sealed her fate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhc3Npb25hdGVpbm1hcmtldGluZy5jb20vY29tZWRpYW4tZGFuaXNoLXNhaXQtZGVsaXZlcnMtY2hlZXN5LXB1bnMtZm9yLWRvbWlub3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comedian Danish Sait delivers cheesy puns for Domino’s,"Stand-up comedian and actor Danish Sait spit out multiple puns to promote Domino’s new range of cheesylicious pizzas.

Domino’s new philosophy is “There is no such thing as too much cheese” which seems quite relevant with its latest offerings. The world-famous pizza company recently announced the launch of its cheesylicious pizzas which of course means a lot of cheese as you thought. Pizza fans would definitely get it.

Talking about the ‘Cheese Dominator’ it is a large size pizza that contains around 0.45 kg or a pound of cheese which is 100 percent legit mozzarella and vicious liquid cheese. That sounds amazing!

Then there is the ‘4Cheese Pizza’. It is a combination of mozzarella American cheese feta cheese rich creamy cheese and a bit of ghost pepper-flavored cheese.

Now rolling with the people’s favorite ‘Cheese Burst’ pizza. The name itself suggests that how it is going to blow up your mouth with its overloaded creamy cheddar cheese and its smoky BBQ sauce. Sounds delicious right? But if you think you have had enough cheese then you’re wrong. Watching stand-up comedian Danish Sait do multiple roles and say cheesy puns and dialogues for Domino’s is due to lack of a better word cheesier. What caught our attention is that the previous brand collaboration which Sait did was with Zomato where he did the role of a delivery executive for a day. Why did we mention Zomato here? Well the interesting fact here is that Domino’s only allows you to order its pizzas in Swiggy and Zomato. But the delivery? Dominos has made sure that it delivers the pizza to your home through its executives only.

Basically there are two reasons for this act. Firstly it lets Domino’s get access to consumer data for more effective targeting and marketing. Second the blue T-shirt-wearing Domino’s delivery person could be a brand billboard in itself which the pizza QSR won’t be abandoning. Domino’s Pizza won a reputation for its speedy delivery and customer satisfaction which took their company nationwide. Even in recent times it doesn’t fail to deliver quality pizzas at a cheap and affordable price to its customers and win their hearts.

New York University researchers discovered scathing new data on the spread of misinformation on Facebook despite the site curtailing their research even going so far as deplatforming them.

The study found that from August 2020 to January 2021 misinformation got six times more clicks on Facebook than posts containing factual news. Misinformation also accounted for the vast majority of engagement with far right posts — 68% — compared to 36% of posts coming from the far left.

Facebook blocked the researchers’ personal accounts and site access last month. The company said their decision to deplatform the researchers was related to a separate study on political ads that involved using a browser extension that allowed users to anonymously share the ads they saw on Facebook with the researchers.

“NYU’s Ad Observatory project studied political ads using unauthorized means to access and collect data from Facebook in violation of our Terms of Service. We took these actions to stop unauthorized scraping and protect people’s privacy in line with our privacy program under the FTC Order” Mike Clark Product Management Director said in a statement.

But Laura Edelson lead researcher on the project Cybersecurity for Democracy at NYU said this didn’t make sense because the browser extension is still up and downloadable. However the restrictions on their access to Facebook has hindered the group’s research into political ads and misinformation.

“We couldn’t even replicate this study ourselves right now if we tried” Edelson said on “Reliable Sources” Sunday.

Facebook paid a $5 billion penalty in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission on privacy and data sharing in 2019.

The company could not be immediately reached for comment on Sunday.

Additionally thousands of posts relating to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack went missing on CrowdTangle a popular research tool. Edelson said her team reported the bug to Facebook but the platform didn’t seem to be aware that the posts were gone.

“It took several rounds with them to get them to acknowledge the full scope of this” Edelson said. “Frankly I’d be worried that they don’t understand what’s going on their own systems.”

Facebook said the bug has been fixed.

The spread of misinformation on Facebook is partisan agnostic meaning that the platform does not favor or reward falsehoods coming from one side or the other. But the far right and far left media ecosystems are “fundamentally different” Edelson said with 40% of the media sources cited on the far right actively spreading false information. In other corners of the media ecosystem and other partisan groups this number doesn’t go above 10%.

Mercedes gave details on a number of new electric cars ahead of next week’s Munich transportation show. They include two SUV concepts -— one a rugged off-roader and the other an opulent ultra-luxury model — as well as a high-performance sedan.

Mercedes EQG concept SUV takes its style from the famously boxy Mercedes-Benz G-class SUV. Mercedes-Benz AG

The Mercedes-Benz EQG concept SUV is an all-electric interpretation of the Mercedes G-class SUV. The SUV shares the G-class’s boxy shape. Engineers even copied the G-class’ jutting door handles and meticulously recreated the same “thunk” made by the G-class’ doors when they close. Instead of a spare tire mounted on the EQG’s tailgate there’s a storage box that can hold a charging cable.

Mercedes plans to produce a vehicle based on this concept and announced that it will even drive it through the same Austrian mountain off-road course where the internal combustion-powered G-class model is tested. Each wheel of the EQG is powered by its own electric motor according to Mercedes to allow for maximum four-wheel-drive control.

The Mercedes-Maybach EQS is an opulant large electric SUV. Mercedes-Benz AG

Mercedes also revealed the Mercedes-Maybach EQS a large luxury SUV intended mostly for on-road use. Mecedes-Maybach is the automaker’s ultra-luxury sub-brand with models and prices that compete against brands like Bentley.

Like the Mercedes-Benz EQS sedan the Maybach EQS SUV has a glass panel that covers the entire dashboard giving the impression of a single enormous touchscreen. On the outside it has a two-tone paint job an option on Mercedes-Maybach models. As in the EQS electric sedan the doors can open automatically as the driver approaches. Mercedes has announced it intends to put a large electric SUV the Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV into production in 2022. The Maybach SUV would be based on that.

The Mercedes-AMG EQS has specially designed high-performance electric motors. Mercedes-Benz AG

The Mercedes-AMG EQS also revealed Sunday is a high-performance version of the Mercedes-Benz EQS sedan. Mercedes-AMG is Mercedes’s high-performance sub-brand. Not just a concept car this will be the first fully electric AMG production model.

It has two high-performance electric motors one each for the front and back wheels producing at total of 649 horsepower. Power output can briefly reach 751 horsepower using a special Race Start mode. The car’s electric motors were specially designed for high performance use performance demands according to Mercedes.

Mercedes designers also created special sounds for what would otherwise be a largely silent driving experience. The sound which is generated both inside and outside the vehicle can vary depending on the driving mode such as Comfort Sport or Sport+. In Sport it’s a gentle hum with an added jet-like overtone during acceleration. In Sport+ it takes on a subtle rumble suggestive of an internal combustion engine."

By: Jacob Kessler

Bracy Gold Bison in Swanton is continuing to thrive thanks to great leadership and a dream. Brent and Stacy Nofziger started their bison farm in January of 2018 when they purchased the land they now own.

Fast-forward a year after all the hard work it took to get the farm in shape and the couple purchased their first 18 bison. 2 months later a total of 8 new calves had been born to take the population up to 26. Since then the population has increased to 54 with all but the original 18 being born here in Swanton.

Brent is an accountant with DTE energy. He is also an Archbold native who grew up on a farm and always had thoughts of owning his own farm.

“I always wanted to be a cowboy. All my life my dream was to have a bison ranch for the past 10 years” said Brent. After a while he met his wife Stacy who is from the Waterville area and now has a zoology degree and is currently a vet tech.

Stacy explained that she worked with Brent’s goal to fulfill a dream of hers too.

“I have always wanted horses. So one day I told him if you want to have a bison farm that’s fine but I would like to get my horses. We still don’t have them yet but I still plan too” said Stacy.

The two moved to Holland Ohio and were married in 2016 before moving to Swanton.

Brent went on to explain that he had been seeing the market going towards healthier alternatives for a while now.

“Bison is a very lean meat even leaner than chicken. We decided the market was going towards the healthier side and that people would like to know where their food comes from. They want local and they want healthy” said Brent.

Each bison produces around 400 pounds of meat and this year the farm plans to have 10 to send off for butchering. Types of meat to be sold will range from ground to burger patties to steaks.

In addition to the selling of the bison’s meat the Nofzigers also provide tours for people. People can pay $3 to take a ride in a wagon out to the pasture to get up close and personal with the animals.

The average tour will result in you getting within 20 to 30 feet of them but sometimes closer if they are going by. Meat can be purchased from the Nofzigers but request that you call ahead and make an appointment.

The farm itself is located at 11616 County Road 4 in Swanton and if you would like to make an appointment you can call 419-360-3395.

This time PNG hasn’t selected just one potential route; it has provided three alternatives. But the one the company says presents the fewest challenges to build would cut through a rural residential area across farmland and forest and close to a rock quarry according to a rough map the company provided and the known addresses of residents who received letters from a contractor notifying them of the project.

The company said it is too early in the planning process to determine what type of line would be constructed where it would be built who it would service or how much it would cost ratepayers.

“The infrastructure will be designed to meet customer demands but that design has not yet been started as we are early in the process of requesting and receiving stakeholder input regarding infrastructure placement” said Jennifer Sharpe a spokesperson for Duke Energy which owns PNG.

But stakeholders and residents that live along at least one of the proposed routes said the company should provide more information than it has so far about why it needs the project at all in an environmentally sensitive area of the county where residents have consistently opposed the type of dense development new natural gas infrastructure would potentially serve.

Last week a contractor for PNG mailed letters to property owners along each of the potential routes and invited them to a virtual meeting to learn more about the proposals. In those letters PNG said it wants to start construction in 2023 with completion by spring or summer of 2024.

Piedmont a public utility and subsidiary of Duke Energy serves 92000 customers with natural gas in Greenville County.

The northernmost route would start at Wade Hampton Boulevard and run northwest along the Enoree River watershed cross Highway 290 south of the Sandy Flat Convenience Store wrap around Hanson Aggregates quarry cross Rabbit and Mush Creek roads south of Highway 253 and connect to existing pipeline along U.S. 25.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvd2VyLWVuZy5jb20vb24tc2l0ZS1wb3dlci9jb2dlbmVyYXRpb24vbWFycmlhZ2Utb2YtY2hwLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXNvdW5kcy1oZWF2ZW5seS1idXQtZXhwZW5zaXZlLWNoYWxsZW5naW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marriage of CHP & Hydrogen: Sounds heavenly but expensive & uncertain,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.power-eng.com/on-site-power/cogeneration/marriage-of-chp-hydrogen-sounds-heavenly-but-expensive-challenging/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvd2VyLWVuZy5jb20vb24tc2l0ZS1wb3dlci9jb2dlbmVyYXRpb24vbWFycmlhZ2Utb2YtY2hwLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXNvdW5kcy1oZWF2ZW5seS1idXQtZXhwZW5zaXZlLWNoYWxsZW5naW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndmYWUub3JnL2VuZXJneS1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIxLTA5LTA0L2VsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGUtc2FsZXMtYXJlLWJvb21pbmctaW4tdGhlLXUtcy1idXQtdGhlLXNvdXRoZWFzdC1sYWdz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric Vehicle Sales Are Booming In The U.S. But The Southeast Lags,"Last year was a big one for sales of electric vehicles. The number of EVs on the road continues to rise nationwide including the Southeast. But our region lags the national average in growth. What's going on here?

The Positive News

Every month sales of electric vehicles or EVs have been rising across the Southeast and the pace is not slowing. A total of 206000 electric vehicles have been sold in the six states as of July(21). That's 46% more EVs on the road than a year ago double the number of 2018 and four times 2015.

""The momentum is there"" says Nick Nigro of Atlas Public Policy which compiled the report for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. ""Similarly charging deployment is up considerably. About a third or so of all charging stations in the Southeast have been deployed in the last year or so.""

Atlas EV Hub / Southern Alliance for Clean Energy

Growth Lags

However even as sales numbers rise in the Southeast they're not keeping pace with national trends says Nigro. The U.S. as a whole has 6.1 electric vehicles per 1000 people. But none of the six southeastern states in the report is close to that. Georgia (4.8 per 1000) and Florida (4.74) lead the region in adoption. North Carolina is at 2.85 and South Carolina is at 1.57 per thousand.

And installation of electric vehicle chargers is not keeping pace either. As of July the U.S. had 0.36 charging ports installed per 1000 people. Among the six southeastern states in the Atlas study only Georgia with 0.35 per thousand comes close. North Carolina is 0.25 and South Carolina is 0.16.

Why Does It Matter?

The federal Environmental Protection Agency says the transportation sector is the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. accounting for 29% of emissions. Putting more electric vehicles on the road is an important way to reduce emissions. So federal and state leaders have set targets for expanding the use of EVs.

On Aug. 5 President Biden issued Executive Order 14037 that sets a voluntary goal of having 50% of all new vehicles sold in 2030 be electric or plug-in hybrid. Right now only about 2% of cars sold are EVs. And North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has said he wants 80000 electric vehicles on state roads by 2025. That would be a big leap from July's total of 29270.

Atlas EV Hub / Southern Alliance for Clean Energy

Why The Lag?

Sales of EVs are helped in part by federal tax credits of up to $7500. There's also a $1000 tax credit for installing a charging station. But if you live in another part of the country the incentives don't stop there.

State tax credits and other incentives are likely behind faster sales elsewhere. California for example has its own tax credits (up to $7000for electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) and a $1500 ""clean fuel reward"" to spur adoption of EVs. And there are local incentives too: Some cities around the country offer local rebates for buying EVs or installing chargers.

Tesla has a handy state-by-state chart.

But in the Southeast no state offers any tax credit or financial incentives for buying EVs. And incentives from utilities or local governments are scarce.

Stan Cross electric transportation policy director at the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy said if southeastern states want to expand the use of EVs they need to adopt incentives that have been proven to drive sales elsewhere.

""We're beginning to see best practices and case studies emerge from other places in the country that we can begin to deploy here in the Southeast"" he said.

So far legislatures and policymakers across the Southeast haven't jumped on the bandwagon even though their states have ambitious climate goals that require actions like expanding electric vehicle use.

What States Are Doing

Most southeastern states are doing one thing to help: Spending money from their states' multimillion-dollar settlements with Volkswagen over software that helped vehicles cheat on diesel emissions tests. Over the past 12 months Southeastern states (except Georgia) spent $102 million from the Volkswagen settlement on EV-related initiatives. According to the Atlas report states spent the largest portion of the funds over the past year to buy electric school buses and most of the rest to help expand vehicle charging networks.

Meanwhile electric utilities are offering their own plans to expand vehicle charging and fund other EV programs. In North Carolina Duke Energy in June proposed a $56 million program.

But Will Everyone Benefit?

Stan Cross of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy says equity among racial and income groups is an issue as states decide how to spend money on EVs. ""What does equitable distribution of charging infrastructure even mean?"" Cross asked. ""Understanding that and making sure that it's done in a way that this transition to electric transportation doesn't just get us out of internal combustion engines and into EVs but also overcomes some of the historical inequities that are baked into our transportation system so that everybody has access to the benefits of driving EVs

Manufacturing Grows Too

One area where the Southeast doesn't seem to be lagging is in recruiting EV-related businesses. That includes manufacturers such as British electric vehicle maker Arrival which is building two plants in the Charlotte area. And a consortium of Korean companies is building a $2.6 billion battery plant in Georgia. Nick Nigro of Atlas notes that the six Southeast states account for 18% of the U.S. population. But they've attracted ""37% of the investment that we've tracked for manufacturing of vehicles and batteries"" Nigro said.

He thinks the same energy should go toward expanding use of the products those factories produce. ""What the Southeast has done to attract manufacturing and jobs from different parts of the country and other parts of the world they have to do for the products too"" he said.

People Want EVs

Incentives could be the key to turning our interest in EVs into more sales. And there is interest. A survey of U.S. consumers last month by ValuePenguin which is owned by Charlotte-based loan marketplace LendingTree found that more than half of respondents either already own an electric vehicle or want to buy one in the next five years. Skeptics were in the minority said Andrew Hurst a data writer for ValuePenguin.

""We asked whether or not people either want to buy one or wanted to buy another one within the next five years. Only 37% of people said they absolutely do not want an electric vehicle"" Hurst said.

""So the enthusiasm is certainly there"" he said. ""Over the next five years I anticipate that that will scale up as electric vehicle models become more ubiquitous become more affordable for consumers.""

Atlas EV Hub / Southern Alliance for Clean Energy

The poll found that the higher up-front price of EVs versus gas-powered vehicles is a barrier to sales. So are worries about vehicle range and the availability of charging stations. That's where local tax breaks or other incentives could help.

Hurst also points out that most people don't realize another important point about buying electric - their insurance likely will cost more (up to 39% more for some of the more popular models.) That's a function of the higher cost for electric vehicles and the insurance industry's struggle to price new technologies like smart-driving systems that could lead to more expensive damages.

The online survey of 2050 U.S. consumers was conducted by Qualtrics on behalf of LendingTree.

Stephanie Lorraine Seabury 29 on Friday registered her parents’ address at 362 Alteza Lane in the Village of La Belle North with local law enforcement according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. She was released the previous day after posting $10000 bond at the Sumter County Detention Center.

The former Delaware middle school teacher in 2019 moved in with her parents. Later that year Seabury was classified as “absconded” after she apparently went on the lam. She was apprehended last month in Georgia. At the time of her arrest her hair was much darker than it was in 2019.

Seabury had been an English teacher at Fred Fifer III Middle School in Camden Del. when she was arrested in 2014.

Seabury lived in an apartment complex in Dover Del. where she had sex with a 13-year-old student. The boy told authorities that he had begun a sexual relationship with his teacher at her home. The relationship included sexual intercourse.

Seabury and the student met numerous times at a pre-determined location then went to her apartment. They exchanged several explicit phone messages and photographs during the inappropriate relationship according to news reports at the time.

Seabury was charged with one count of sexual abuse of a child by a person in a position of trust or authority a felony in Delaware. She was ultimately sentenced to 18 months of probation sparking some outrage in the community. Many complained that if she would have been a male teacher she would have received a harsher sentence.",,,

Porsche has been a world-renowned automaker for decades and though great modern Porsche vehicles abound some older Porsche models are iconic. In fact the Porsche 911 was so good three decades ago that it dominates a list of the best ’80s cars that you can buy today. Here’s a look at these four Porsche 911 models.

The best ’80s cars you can buy today per the duPont Registry

When it comes to cars the ’80s were a unique decade. Some of the most famous cars from that era include the 1981 DeLorean DMC-12. The Back to the Future movies popularized the car. That being said like the great cars from the ’60s and ’70s many of the great cars from the ’80s are no longer purchasable. But some still are.

In fact according to the duPont Registry you can still buy that famous DeLorean model today. But that’s not the only amazing car from the ’80s that you can get your hands on.

In fact the car that dominates the duPont Registry’s list is the Porsche 911. Four of the 11 vehicles on the list are 911s and it’s easy to see why they’re so great.

The 1980 Porsche 911 Carrera Targa is the oldest and rarest of the bunch

The oldest of the four Porsches on the list this 1980 911 is ultra-rare the duPont Registry reports. This is because its option code “never existed officially.” The automaker designed it for speed more so than its other models at the time. Despite that it was still the ’80s so its engine isn’t that impressive compared to modern Porches.

It has a 3.1-liter inline-six making 210 hp and 206 lb-ft of torque. This allows it to go from 0 to 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds and it can also hit a top speed of about 143 mph. Of course though speed is a desirable trait in a high-performance car many people simply like how this Porsche looks.

It has leather seating but otherwise the interior is sparse compared to the gadgets and gizmos of modern cars.

That said pricing varies widely for a 1980 Porsche 911 Carrera Targa. The duPont Registry says this model is listed for about $135000. Similar Porsches with a different trim could be a bit cheaper.

1989 was a great year for the Porsche 911 with Carrera Turbo Cabriolet and Speedster models

The other three ’80s Porsche 911 models that appear on the duPont Registry’s list are all 1989 models. These three models are similar in many ways but different in others. For example the automaker reintroduced the 911 Speedster that model year and it’s unique.

On the other end of the spectrum the Carrera was probably the most common version. It packs a 3.2-liter inline-six engine and totally ’80s amenities such as a cassette tape player. But it also has more useful modern equipment such as an A/C and heated mirrors. It also has leather upholstery and a convertible top. The best part though is the price. It costs about $79000 which isn’t too bad compared to its siblings.

By comparison the 1989 Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet has a 3.3-liter flat-six. But in many other ways it’s similar to the Carrera. The Turbo Cabriolet is rarer though so the duPont Registry says it costs about $187000.

The Speedster is a bit pricier. Car and Driver says Speedsters are going for over $200000 at auction. In terms of specs the Speedster isn’t very different from the Carrera. But the former is rarer and more unique and retro-looking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yYmlzY3VpdC5jb20vMTk4Ny1sYW5kLXJvdmVyLWRlZmVuZGVyLWxvb2tzLWNoZXJyeS1tYWpvci1yZWQtZmxhZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This 1987 Land Rover Defender Looks Cherry but Has a Major Red Flag,"Everyone has that dream car they've always wanted and it isn't always the newest model on the lot.

Everyone has that dream car they’ve always wanted and it isn’t always the newest model on the lot. In many cases it’s a classic like the 1987 Land Rover Defender. As it happens there is one currently available for sale on duPont Registry for anyone who can afford to buy it. Should you really be sinking a lot of money into an older vehicle however?

Land Rover Defenders has a complicated history

A Land Rover Defender V8 Heritage model | Jaguar Land Rover

The Land Rover Defender wasn’t actually the ‘Defender’ until 1983 according to Motor Trend. Before that it was a part of the Land Rover Series. The first Series known simply as Series I ran from 1948 to 1958. The Series II took up the mantle from 1958-1971. The Series III was released in 1971 and ran through 1985.

While the Defender saw much initial success Land Rover decided not to sell it in the U.S. until 1993. However it was a short-lived love story as the Land Rover pulled the Defender from American soil because national safety regulations were updated and the model didn’t quite meet those standards.

In 2016 the Defender was retired from production. Its popularity was too great to ignore however and Land Rover has since brought it back. A new Land Rover Defender is being sold in America and its fan base couldn’t be more delighted. However if you’re looking for an older model one is available from duPont Registry that was never sold on U.S. soil.

1987 Land Rover Defender

The 1980s are often considered to be a great decade for movies music and of course cars. The 1987 Land Rover Defender 110 was one of them. Its tough-looking exterior and gorgeous interior were more than enough to make it a popular vehicle in its prime and that hasn’t changed.

It’s now available for sale on duPont Registry. The sales site reports “Options on this special customized 1987 Land Rover Defender 110 include Masai Roof Rack with Rear Ladder Fold-Up Steps at All Doors Safari Snorkel Single Din Sony Receiver with CD Player Outlast Rear Seats Gloss Black Fender Flares Defender Signage AND MORE! This special fully custom 1987 Land Rover Defender 110 is a Metallic Red exterior with a Black Leather interior and is waiting to take you anywhere in style! You will also have peace of mind as this 1987 Land Rover Defender 110 is a 100% CarFax certified vehicle with no accident or damage history!”

While this may seem like a rare find you should jump on you might want to proceed with caution. The mileage is listed at 181982 miles. For anyone looking for a daily driver this is definitely not a good vehicle to invest in. If this is something you’re just looking to show off in on the other hand that’s a little different.

duPont Registry has more cars from the 80’s

Fans of cars from the eighties will be delighted to learn that duPont Registry has more vehicles on its list that come from that most gnarly of decades. Some of them are from automakers that have long shut down their doors such as DeLorean. The DeLorean DMC-12 is extremely rare as it is the only vehicle produced by DeLorean and is a 1981 model.

A more familiar name is the 1983 Ferrari 512 BBi. While Ferrari isn’t exactly fond of its used vehicles being sold outside its own dealerships given the fact that this one is 38 years old it might be a good way for those not on Ferrari’s most valued list to own one.

Other vehicles from the eighties still available include a 1980 Jeep CJ-5 – Golden Eagle Theme a 1989 Porsche 911 Carrera a 1981 Datsun 280ZX a 1989 Porsche 911 Speedster a 1986 Ducati TT1 and a 1989 Nissan Skyline R32 GTE.",,,,,,,,,

Jonathan Eaton continues to provide top level criminal representation from clients recently ranging from Talleys’ Foods the Christchurch City-owned Citycare to the headline-making murder and kidnapping cases along with the murder of Amber-Rose Rush by a former Dunedin doctor.

Eaton has provided a leading role as a mentor and has at different times also stepped in to defend judges when criticised by comments over sexual offending sentencing as vice president of the NZ Bar Association.

“Some of the information circulating in the news media seeded by politically motivated lobby groups is either outright wrong or misleading through lack of context. The most obvious example is that the media reporting referred to this as a case of rape when it was not.This sort of misinformation has the potential to seriously undermine the independence of judges and damage the integrity of our justice system” he said in a statement.

Eaton began his career as a lawyer in 1988 before becoming a barrister in 1998 and was made a Queen’s Counsel (QC) in 2013. He has practised predominantly as a defence lawyer but dabbled in prosecution for three years.

His name is associated with some of the country’s highest-profile cases – the murder prosecutions of Gay Oaks George Gwaze Rex Haig and Mark Lundy and most recently Dunedin doctor Venod Skantha.

Standing directly across East Street from Boots the Chemist on the opposite corner of St Peter’s Street it was one of Derby’s most iconic buildings.

The first purpose-built independent department store in the town a grand four-storey affair that was perhaps the most striking feature of the main shopping street.

Now only Derbeians of a certain vintage recall the Midland Drapery. But they do so with great affection remembering those familiar canopies that shaded vast windows filled with all manner of enticing goods.

The store’s name was emblazoned in huge letters to both street fronts of the building. The trademark magnet sign was fixed to the frontage high on its very corner. It was to use the company’s own slogan “The Magnet that Draws the People”.

The store had begun as the name suggests as a simple drapery shop employing only five people. But it grew rapidly.

By the time it celebrated its first decade in the 1890s the Midland Drapery’s departments stretched over two sites – one on St Peter’s Street and the other on East Street. Its owner Edwin Ann had become mayor of the town.

Two years later he was knighted. He later served a second term as mayor.

In only ten years the Midland Drapery grew to employ 230 members of staff all of whom were transported by train to Chatsworth House for a special celebration.

As the business continued to grow so its store expanded to occupy most of the corner which required the demolition of several small buildings including two popular inns.

Even this did not prove big enough and an additional furniture department operated closer to the Cornmarket.

The census of 1911 shows a great number of Midland Drapery employees living above the store. Most of them were women working as shop assistants. Other residents worked as clerks and some as servants.

The two men living on site were a draper’s assistant and a caretaker. Many of the workers originated from outside of Derbyshire and one was born in the United States.

While there must have been disadvantages to living “above the shop” those employees were certainly at the very heart of the town centre only yards from Boots the Chemist and Thurman and Malin and with the Derby Co-operative Society stores just around the corner.

By the time of Sir Edwin’s death in 1913 his company had several other branches including those opened at Long Eaton Stapenhill and Worcester.

So beloved was he that during his final illness regular updates on his condition were published in the local newspaper. His funeral was attended by most of the great and good of the town and many onlookers lined the route of his cortege.

By the 1920s the Midland Drapery while still stocking drapery goods had become a true department store. It had a large fashion department. “We hold the largest stock of Knitted Wear in the Midlands” ran one advertisement.

In 1925 the store placed a newspaper advertisement announcing its “New Arcade which is acknowledged to be the finest shopping improvement in Derby. Here you may walk in comfort and inspect the Largest Window Displays at your leisure.

""These Window Displays are a veritable Exhibition. Get the Habit of Always Walking through the Midland Drapery Arcade East Street”.

The company had become the town’s “go-to” shop for anything and everything. In 1950 the Derby Telegraph carried countless advertisements for its wares.

Whether you wanted the “latest in Baby Carriages” or a new vacuum cleaner you would find it at the Midland Drapery. It even boasted of its role as a “Hoover Dealer” declaring: “Your housework is made easier the modern way!”

By way of an example of its diversity another advertisement on the same page told shoppers about the “Six Varieties of Gladioli Bulbs” that were in stock.

Inexplicably the splendid Midland Drapery building was demolished in 1970 to make way for the altogether more brutal Audley Centre.

One can only imagine what a magnificent feature of St Peter’s Street it would today have made – and the outcry if anyone had suggested razing it to the ground in the 21st century.

When new the Safarikar cost between $19600 and $25600 USD a vast sum in 1972 dollars. Due to the high cost unusual looks and exceedingly small potential market the car wasn’t a success and it would be the last car offered by Mohs.

Fast Facts – The Mohs Safarikar

The Mohs Safarikar is based on an International Harvester Travelall 4×4 chassis with a bespoke “dual cowl phaeton” body designed for hunting off-road in Africa.

The body of the Safarikar is made from aluminum and it has an outer covering of soft polyurethane foam covered with black Naugahyde – a waterproof synthetic leather.

Power is provided by the Travelall’s 392 cubic inch (6.4 liter) V8 and it’s sent back through a 3-speed automatic transmission.

Seating is divided into two sections with the safari guides up front and the shooters in the rear. The rear seats can also fold down and become a bed if needed.

The Amazing (and Eccentric) Bruce Mohs

It’s impossible to tell the story of the Mohs Safarikar without first talking a little about the company’s wildly eccentric founder Bruce Mohs.

Not only did Bruce Mohs become an automobile manufacturer but over the course of his life he was also a specialist mechanical prop maker for Hollywood working with the likes of Alfred Hitchcock.

He would also become a restaurateur and a hotel operator he was the inventor of the instant milkshake he was a big-game hunter and photographer who travelled to 110 countries he did infrared photography for NASA’s earth satellite program to help calculate satellite trajectories he was a museum curator and he was the inventor of the Reflecto-strip a reflective material used on highways and guardrails around the world.

That’s not all he did in his life but it’s enough to give you a general idea of what kind of person he was.

“Concentric people go around in circles; they never fly off in a tangent and get anything done. Many concentric people are simply going and doing their 8-to-5 jobs and coming home and sitting in front of the TV tube and opening a can of beer and going to bed and doing the same thing the next day. I think everybody should have some little eccentricity.” – Bruce Baldwin Mohs

The first car developed by Bruce Mohs was believe it or not even more outlandish than the Safarikar. It was called the Ostentatienne Opera Sedan and it was essentially an uber-luxurious way of driving to the opera.

The only way to enter the passenger compartment was through a single rear door that opened upwards this was to allow ladies in ballgowns to get in and out of the car elegantly in front of the waiting media. The sides of the car were steel reinforced to keep the occupants safe in an accident and the air-conditioned interior was awash with rich carpeting and plush upholstery.

Only one example of the Ostentatienne Opera Sedan was ever made however this left Bruce Mohs entirely unperturbed and he immediately set to work on his next creation – the Safarikar.

The Mohs Safarikar

As a big game hunter Mohs was doubtless familiar with the off-road vehicles typically used in Africa in the 1960s and 1970s – usually Land Rovers with very rudimentary interiors that had lived rough lives.

This led him to his eureka moment he would build a luxurious vehicle like a Rolls-Royce with an off-road four-wheel drive chassis and a body that could be used as a shooting platform – with rifles being rested directly on soft foam-covered body panels to help hunters aim.

The Ostentatienne Opera Sedan had been based on an International Harvester chassis and drivetrain and Bruce would choose the same automaker as the supplier of the chassis and drivetrain for the Safarikar – each would begin with a rolling International Harvester Travelall platform.

Power would be provided by the IH 392 cubic inch (6.4 liter) V8 mated to the company’s 3-speed automatic transmission. Upon this platform a new aluminum body would be built incorporating two distinct seating areas Bruce liked to call it a “dual cowl phaeton” after the elegant pre-WWII cars with the same layout but truth be told he was stretching the term so thin it became translucent.

There idea was that the driver and guides would sit up front and the hunters would sit in the back with their rifles binoculars and probably brandy. If needed the rear seat could fold down into a bed to keep everyone comfortable overnight.

Perhaps the most interesting bit of trivia about the Safarikar is the source of the three bucket seats in the front – they were apparently designed by Steve McQueen and his team for desert racing in Southern California and sold under the Solar Automotive brand – Solar Productions was the name of his film production company.

The aluminum body was covered with soft polyurethane foam which was upholstered with black Naugahyde a type of waterproof synthetic leather that had proven highly-resistant to the elements. It’s believed that that purpose of this was to give shooters a stable platform to rest their rifles on without risking damage to the car or the firearms (as mentioned above).

After its introduction to a bewildered general public in 1972 the Safarikar went on to sell a grand total of three units. Just two have survived to the modern day including the car you see here which believe it or not has just popped up on eBay with a Buy It Now price of $197000 USD. Interestingly this is considerably less than the $350000 it was listed for on another platform last year.

Greedy eBay sellers are attempting to cash in on charity Billy Connolly Lego figures - with some listings priced as high as £900.

Shoppers queued round the block at Glasgow’s Buchanan Galleries to get their hands on the limited edition Big Yin figures ahead of the one-day sale yesterday morning.

Around 750 figures of the Scots comedy great were quickly sold out with five different versions produced to showcase the funny man's different stages of his illustrious career.

A total of 500 individual figures could be snapped up for a minimum donation of £10 while a further 50 full sets of all five could be picked up for as little as £50.

All of the proceeds from the sale went to Glasgow Children’s Hospital which provides care for Scots kids in need of life-changing treatment.

A number of the sets have now appeared on eBay with punters hoping to make vast sums of money from the limited edition figurines.

Around 10 sets have emerged on the online marketplace over the past 24 hours with prices going as high as £900.

Others are going for more than £300 and £600.

Sellers have also slapped a ‘rare’ tag on the figurines in an attempt to maximise their profits from the charity collectors item.

One listing has so far received 34 bids with the auction price currently standing at £310.

It is unlikely that the figurines will go on sale at the shopping centre again as organisers warned that they would be sold at a first-come-first-served basis.

The sets have been created from genuine Lego bricks which has been an iconic toy for children and adults across the globe for many decades.

Glasgow Children’s Hospital Charity has been approached for comment.

A bizarre accommodation sees tourists sleeping on the top deck of a green double decker bus.

Bob Johnson bought Olive a Dublin double decker bus on eBay one evening and spent three years transforming it into one of Hampshire’s most unusual staycation homes.

The vintage bus most recently used for school transport is fully kitted out with a kitchen sitting and dining area and full wet room.

But visitors can find a separate toilet in the bus driver’s cab which has been described by visitors as the ""best bit"" of their whole holiday.

One reviewer said: “It totally exceeded our expectations with the amount of space how cosy it was and how many creature comforts are packed into this awesome bus!

“We all slept so well in the very comfy beds and little touches like the heated towel rail and delicious fruit loaf left out for us all really made it so memorable.

“The driver's cab toilet was possibly the best bit of the whole weekend.”

The bus is perched in a field just outside Bramshott Hampshire offering amazing panoramic views of the countryside.

Bob said: “This is the ideal holiday spot for visitors to North East Hampshire who want to stay somewhere a little different. With every high end amenity you need for a trip to the countryside Olive is a great alternative to the usual hotels and cottages.

“Every day feels like an adventure from inside Olive great for younger families and older friend groups and anyone with a spirit of creativity.”

While sleeping on a bus is usually frowned upon or leaves you missing your stop Olive’s top deck sees an open plan sleeping space which can accommodate up to five guests.

Outside guests have the run of the paddock with a patio fire-pit and barbecue for al fresco dining.

Beyond the accommodation there are secluded country walks around three lakes and a wishing well and the popular Prince of Wales pub to a pitstop!

Guests can stay in Olive for a minimum of three nights from £160 per night.

Lisa Markham stayed in Olive in February last year and said: “Absolutely loved my stay on Olive she's an utter beauty deceptively spacious Bob is a total star nothing is too much trouble. It's a very peaceful location.

“I have a young family with two toddlers. Bob was very honest with me before I booked and warned me about the log burner but I decided to book and was glad I did.

“The kids loved the bus and the country walks or bear hunts! My teen loved watching the horses and I was well at home getting my cave man on with the fire. Hope to see you again one day Olive.”"

If you want to have a higher chance to discover companies that are in good shape from a financial standpoint you may want to consider the following four stocks as their trailing 12-month (TTM) Ebitda margins are topping the S&P 500's 20.4% as of the writing of this article.

These decisions refer to the recognition of amortization and depreciation which may differ significantly even among companies that operate in the same industry.

Inspired by the traditional four Battlefield classes Specialists will be equipped with their own unique Specialist Trait and Specialty and will have fully customisable loadouts. Battlefield will release with 10 specialists on day one.

The specialists featured in DICE’s latest trailer include Webster Mackay who can use a grappling hook Wikus ‘Caspter’ Van Daele who’s equipped with a recon drone and Pyotr ‘Boris’ Guskovsky who can deploy a sentry gun.

You can watch the video via the embed below:

The Battlefield 2042 beta release date has been set for September 22 it’s been claimed.

That’s according to information shared by both credible leaker Tom Henderson and GamesBeat journalist Jeff Grubb. Grubb said during a Giant Bomb show (paywall) this week that he had corroborated the date shared by Henderson with his own sources.

Electronic Arts has previously confirmed that Battlefield 2042’s open beta will launch in September but has yet to give an official date. EA Play members and customers who pre-order any version of the game will receive early access to the open beta.

The standard edition of Battlefield 2042 is set to release on October 22 2021 priced at $59.99 for Xbox One PS4 and PC and $69.99 for Xbox Series X/S and PS5.

However players who choose to pre-order the Battlefield 2042 Gold Edition for $89.99 on PC and $99.99 on consoles or the Battlefield 2042 Ultimate Edition for $109.99 on PC and $119.99 on consoles will receive early access to the game beginning on October 15.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9lYS1qb2ItbGlzdGluZy1tYXNzLWVmZmVjdC01LXVucmVhbC1lbmdpbmUtZnJvc3RiaXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EA Job Listing Suggests Mass Effect 5 Switch To Unreal Engine,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9lYS1qb2ItbGlzdGluZy1tYXNzLWVmZmVjdC01LXVucmVhbC1lbmdpbmUtZnJvc3RiaXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84MTQ1MS9zb255LWNoYXJnaW5nLWV4dHJhLWZvci1wczQtdG8tcHM1LXVwZ3JhZGVzLW5vLW1vcmUtZnJlZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sony charging extra for PS4 to PS5 upgrades no more free upgrades,"Sony will no longer offer any free PS4 to PS5 game upgrades Jim Ryan confirms all first-party cross-gen upgrades will cost $10.

Sony confirms it will no longer offer free PS4 to PS5 upgrades of of future cross-gen first-party games.

Today Sony reversed its massively unpopular next-gen pricing scheme and will now offer a free Horizon Forbidden West PS4 to PS5 upgrade. In the same announcement PlayStation boss Jim Ryan says Horizon Forbidden West is the last free upgrade. From now on any PS4 to PS5 upgrade of a first-party cross-gen title will cost $10.

""I also want to confirm today that moving forward PlayStation first-party exclusive cross-gen titles (newly releasing on PS4 & PS5)-both digital and physical*-will offer a $10 USD digital upgrade option from PS4 to PS5. This will apply to any exclusive cross-gen PS4 & PS5 title published by Sony Interactive Entertainment"" Ryan said.

The reality is Sony has already been charging extra for PS5 upgrades of previously-released PS4 titles including:

Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut - $30 upgrade includes PS5 optimizations and Iki Island expansion

Death Stranding Director's Cut - $10 upgrade from PS4 to PS5 includes PS5 optimizations and next-gen exclusive features

Gamers are still irked that Sony is monetizing cross-gen upgrade paths however major players like Electronic Arts are starting to do the same with expensive $99 versions of games that bundle PS4 and PS5 copies. Free next-gen upgrades are starting to phase out as the PS5 and Xbox Series X install bases fill out.

Sony confirms that both Gran Turismo 7 and the new God of War game will have a $10 PS4 to PS5 upgrade cost ensuring that last-gen gamers aren't exempt from the new $69.99 next-gen pricing plan.

Battlefield’s mobile version of the shooting game EA (Electronic Arts) was officially announced in April earlier this year and a full reveal was expected to come soon after. Now EA DICE has announced more details on the upcoming game that tells us more including the game’s first playable betas.

A Google Play Store listing suggests that the Android users will be in the lead for trying out Battlefield Mobile. Betas for the game are expected to roll out on a region-to-region basis and hence not all users will be able to play at once.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd3lhdC5uZXQvMjAyMS8yNTE4MDAvZWEtaGFzLWEtYmF0dGxlZmllbGQtbW9iaWxlLWZvci10aGUtZ29vZ2xlLXBsYXktc3RvcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EA Has A Battlefield Mobile For The Google Play Store,"The Battlefield series being a first-person shooter is something you’d expect to see on PC and consoles. But with the explosion of popularity of battle royale games on mobile it should be no surprise to see these games being more popular on mobile as well. And that’s exactly what we see with EA putting up Battlefield Mobile on the Google Play Store.

Its description reads just about the same as any other game in the series. You get a large selection of weapons and a sprinkling of vehicles to make use of. There also looks to be four classes to choose from in Battlefield Mobile: Assault Recon Medic and Support all four being staples of the series. There is also mention of heroes with “unique narratives” which is similar to the main draw of Battlefield 2042.

In an FAQ page EA says that it is starting with a series of small play tests for Battlefield Mobile. Starting with Indonesia and the Philippines. Trying to access the game’s page on the Google Play Store via mobile at the time of writing will get you the disappointing line of “This item is not available in your country”. Though EA does say that as the testing goes on the publisher will add new regions to the test.

In many ways this can be seen as EA wanting something similar to Activision’s Call of Duty Mobile. Though right now it’s obviously in its very early stages still. Based on a previous report by AppleInsier it’s likely the full release version of Battlefield Mobile will only be released sometime next year.

Leggett 53 vice president of global manufacturing excellence at General Mills is a 25-year veteran who has managed plants packaging and supply chains. He earned graduate degrees in industrial technology and business and was a three-time Academic All-America football player at Purdue University.

The married father of four children who grew up in Key West Fla. considers himself fortunate and called to serve.

""I always knew that God blessed me with academic and athletic ability and parents who [encouraged me] to take advantage of opportunities"" he said. ""My mentality was always to strive to be my best. And I knew I had to use my gifts to do positive things.""

Leggett is chairman of Twin Cities Rise the business-supported North Side-based nonprofit that works mostly with low-income people of color. Many of the participants have been raised in broken families without much support or focus on education or careers. They arrive at the nonprofit — sometimes on probation and sometimes simply trying to improve their chances — seeking self-empowerment training skill development and the mentoring many missed during their formative years.

""I also knew that I could be a role model"" Leggett said. ""To help others who may not have had the gifts the family support and the mentors.""

Leggett the youngest of four children and the first to attend college was raised by a mother who was an office worker and then ran a preschool. His father was a janitor who rose to power-company linemen for Southern Bell over 43 years. His parents have been married 65 years.

""We were not rich"" recalled Leggett who is Black. ""Lower-middle class. My great-grandma was a wet nurse for the children of rich white people. Her daughter my grandmother was a maid. [My parents] instilled in me that 'we struggled to put you in position to take advantage of your gifts.'

""They told me that nobody is better and you're not better than anybody. It's how hard you work.""

There always has been a financial and human connection between Rise and General Mills. Leggett joined Rise's board five years ago after talking to Steve Rothschild a former Mills executive who started the nonprofit in 1993. It's fitting TCR's board is led by an African American.

""Donzel is very active sincere and passionate about the mission to build the organization"" said Rothschild now an emeritus board member. ""And he is a role model. Nothing was given to him. He's made the most of his talent and experience. I admire Donzel.""

And Leggett is not the only Mills alumni at Rise.

Alex Merritt an 18-year Mills supply-chain manager joined this year as vice president of program operations for an outfit that has an expanding footprint as its empowerment and train model is adapted by more organizations.

Merritt was raised in St. Louis by foster parents who adopted her as well as several other children. And she had a supportive grandmother.

Merritt was a good student encouraged by her Normandy High School counselor to study engineering. She won an Emerson Electric scholarship and persevered through the rigorous mechanical-engineering curriculum to graduate from Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Merritt wasn't looking for another job. But she took a pay cut to join Twin Cities Rise.

""My personal passion is giving back and making the world a better place"" she said. ""Here I get to empower people through training and personal empowerment. I get to do all that in one space and know the impact is immediate. And I see the scalability of this.

""There are a lot of people who need what we offer. It's about fanning the flame in the human spirit. A nod from God … a gift that is dormant in most humans. Most don't know it. They get a verdict from parent or teacher or someone and they spend their lives accomplishing that prophecy of failure. We try to [help] one person at a time.""

Ever the engineer she said her job is to ensure the ""secret sauce"" of Rise is captured ""through a repeatable processes and clear metrics that allow us to trend track and deliver outstanding results for participants"" and other stakeholders.

And when a person benefits we all benefit from a healthier community and economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiHGh0dHBzOi8vcmEuY28vZXZlbnRzLzE0NTU3NTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric Island Labour Day Festival at Ontario Place West Island Toronto,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://ra.co/events/1455751 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiHGh0dHBzOi8vcmEuY28vZXZlbnRzLzE0NTU3NTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

After Friday's night's detonation on the east bank of the Mississippi River the seven cables were severed Saturday on the other side of the river at Bridge City - and allowed to slide to the bottom of the river. That allowed the Coast Guard to reopen ship traffic on the lower river which had been shut down since the storm Saturday morning.

""They're just too heavy to be removed onto land"" said regional director Nicholas Cali of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-West who was part of the team coordinating removal of the lines.

The cables ended up hanging low across the river when Hurricane Ida crumpled an Entergy tower at Bridge City into a heap of rusted metal on Sunday night. They blocked river traffic for six days as a queue of commercial barges awaiting passage piled up downriver while Entergy the Coast Guard State Police the state Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness and demolition contractors worked out the removal process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthdGMuY29tL25ld3MvY292ZXJpbmctbG91aXNpYW5hL2VudGVyZ3ktaWRhLXdhcy1tb3N0LWRlc3RydWN0aXZlLWh1cnJpY2FuZS1ldmVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Entergy: Ida was most destructive hurricane ever,"Hurricane Ida caused more damage to Louisiana’s distribution system than Hurricanes Katrina Delta and Zeta combined Entergy said on Sunday.

According to the company after making landfall as a Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 150 mph Ida ""devastated"" Louisiana’s power grid damaging more than 30000 utility poles close to 35000 spans of wire and 5600 transformers. The historic storm knocked out power to more than 900000 Entergy customers across southeast Louisiana the company says.

Here's a graphic from the company illustrating the damage for several storms:

“We’re seeing twice as much damage as what we had with Laura” said Joe Book senior manager of distribution engineering for Entergy in Louisiana. “We’ve never seen anything this large. Even with Katrina the damage was extended to multiple states. With Ida nearly all of the damage is here in Louisiana.”

Even without the electric system being completely assessed Ida’s damage to distribution utility poles is nearly double that of Laura which devastated southwest Louisiana just one year ago. Compared to Hurricane Katrina Ida has seen more than 5000 spans of wire (the length of wire from one utility pole to another) damaged.

“Ida had the devastating impact like Laura in a specific region plus it impacted three neighboring regions including the two largest metropolitan areas in Louisiana” said Chip Arnold Louisiana operations and safety senior manager. “So the infrastructure damage totals are larger and in addition to that the breadth of our service territory that was impacted was much greater.”

Company officials say the biggest challenge Entergy crews face is replacing more than 24000 utility poles which support the power lines that deliver electricity from substations to homes and businesses. Replacing poles can be difficult especially considering the geographical challenges presented by the impacted region they say. Distribution poles can be found in and around marshes swamps rivers heavily wooded areas and a variety of hard-to-reach locations.

Entergy officials say they came prepared to meet these challenges using vehicles and equipment like helicopters and drones to locate damaged infrastructure air boats and marsh buggies to access waterways and rear-ally machines to maneuver tight spaces in residential areas.

In some cases lineworkers are forced to climb utility poles without the assistance of heavy machinery at all as factors like muddy terrain and limited space only allow for trained employees to mount poles with special boots safety ropes and the assistance of crew members they say.

""While our workforce is trained to assess each situation operate the proper machinery and execute work that safely and effectively replaces damaged electric equipment the unique impact of Ida initiated a call for outside help. Nearly 27000 restoration workers from 41 states have come to aid Entergy’s efforts to restore power"" company officials say.

After less than a week since Ida’s historic impact on the state nearly 350000 customers are back online.

“The widespread damage and impact inflicted by Hurricane Ida was felt by so many across Louisiana” said Phillip May CEO of Entergy Louisiana. “We are overcoming new challenges each day and our storm team will march forward until we’ve brought the lights back to all of the communities we serve.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L3doeS1odXJyaWNhbmUtaWRhLWNyaXBwbGVkLW5ldy1vcmxlYW5zLXBvd2VyLWdyaWQtMjAyMS0wOS0wNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Insight: Why Hurricane Ida crippled the New Orleans power grid,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/why-hurricane-ida-crippled-new-orleans-power-grid-2021-09-04/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L3doeS1odXJyaWNhbmUtaWRhLWNyaXBwbGVkLW5ldy1vcmxlYW5zLXBvd2VyLWdyaWQtMjAyMS0wOS0wNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3RoZWxlbnNub2xhLm9yZy8yMDIxLzA5LzA0L3dlLWFyZS1ub3ctZnVsbHktc2VjdXJlLXRocmVlLW1vcmUtdHJhbnNtaXNzaW9uLWxpbmVzLXVwLWluLWNpdHktZW50ZXJneS1yZWxlYXNlcy1lc3RpbWF0ZXMtZm9yLXJlc3RvcmF0aW9uLWluLWhhcmRlc3QtaGl0LWFyZWFzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'We are now fully secure': Three more transmission lines up in city; Entergy releases estimates for restoration in hardest ...,"Six days after Hurricane Ida knocked out power to hundreds of thousands in the region service has been restored to three additional transmission lines bringing electricity into the New Orleans area bringing the total to six out of eight Entergy executives said in a Saturday morning press call.

“We are now fully secure” Entergy New Orleans CEO Deanna Rodriguez said Saturday.



As of Saturday morning 55000 customers in the city of New Orleans have been restored to power about 27 percent of the city. That’s an increase from 20 percent on Friday morning. Around the region about 282000 customers have been restored but more than 600000 remained in the dark. Damage assessments are now 100 percent complete for the city and 97 percent complete for the region impacted by Ida.

The power company has also released restoration estimates for some of the hardest hit parts of the state which experienced catastrophic damage during the Category 4 storm. Those were not available on Friday morning when the company released its first firm estimates for power restoration in the New Orleans metro area the Baton Rouge metro area and other parts of the state. Most of the city should have power by the middle of next week Entergy estimates. A small number of areas on the eastern edge of Orleans Parish outside of the levee protection system will likely have to wait longer. The current estimate for full restoration there is Sept. 25.

According to the newly released estimates some of the most damaged areas in Louisiana will have to wait more than a week and in some cases several weeks for full restoration. St. John the Baptist Parish and St. James Parish are expected to be fully restored by Sept. 17. Assumption Parish should be online by Sept. 22. Lafourche Parish Terrebonne Parish St. Charles Parish and Plaquemines Parish outside of Belle Chasse will be fully restored by Sept. 29 though the company says those are “no later than” dates. Belle Chasse is expected to be restored by Sept. 10.

On Saturday Entergy Louisiana CEO Philip May described the damage to the system in southeast Louisiana as “staggering.” More than 5200 transformers failed and more than 22000 poles were damaged and destroyed.

“This storm is clearly one of the most devastating things we’ve seen in Louisiana” May said. “No storm even comes close to this.”

New Orleans lost service to all eight of its major transmission lines during the storm. Those are the large lines connecting the area to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid which runs through 15 states and part of Canada. Power began to flicker back on in New Orleans on Wednesday when Entergy was able to bring back one transmission line coming into the city from Slidell and route that power through the new New Orleans Power Station gas plant in eastern New Orleans.



The NOPS plant which is only able to generate a small fraction of the city’s normal power needs opened in 2020. The 128-megawatt natural gas plant was approved by the New Orleans City Council which regulates Entergy New Orleans in 2018 over fierce opposition from neighbors and environmental groups. The Lens later reported that an Entergy subcontractor paid actors to come to council meetings and voice support for the plant.

The council fined Entergy New Orleans $5 million over the scandal. While the company said the plant’s primary purpose was to provide additional electricity when demand is extremely high. But Entergy officials also said the plant would be able to provide some needed power quickly and without the need to connect to the grid in the event of a massive transmission failure such as one that happened this week. Entergy has faced scrutiny over the past several days over why the plant did not begin serving the area until after the transmission line was repaired.

With 75 percent of the city’s transmission lines now operational and all 27 of the city’s substations ready to serve homes and businesses the company can focus on repairing damage to power poles and internal distribution lines. Nearly 1100 poles in New Orleans were damaged in the storm. Entergy has released neighborhood-by-neighborhood estimates for full restoration in New Orleans.

Entergy customers — particularly those who evacuated and are waiting for power to come back before they return — should not rely on the Entergy outage map which has been experiencing technical problems throughout the week to determine if electricity is available in their homes. Company officials instead urged them to sign up for text updates by texting REG to 36778.

If a property is flooded or the power line connecting it to Entergy’s distribution lines was damaged residents and business owners should turn off the circuit breaker and call an electrician to perform an assessment. Do not step in water to reach the circuit breaker Entergy officials said Saturday. If it’s not possible to safely reach a circuit breaker or fuse box call an electrician they said."

What happens when rates rise?,"New numbers from Equifax this week confirmed what housing market watchers have known for a while now: Canadians are addicted to mortgage debt.

Canadians took out 410000 home loans in the second quarter. That's the biggest quarterly jump on record up 60 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier.

Despite fears in the early days of the pandemic that COVID-19 could be a bucket of ice on Canada's housing market the opposite happened. Interest rates slashed to record lows coupled with millions of Canadians cooped up at home suddenly needing more living space acted more like gasoline on the housing market than water.

The average price of a Canadian resale home topped $716000 in March. While average prices have come down a little since then they're still well ahead of where they were before the pandemic.

Prices that go up forever may make homeowners sleep soundly in their heavily leveraged bedrooms but many of those paper gains are built on a foundation of debt.

There aren't just more mortgages than ever out there — they're also bigger than ever too. The average new home loan was for $355000 during the quarter Equifax says. That's also the highest level on record and an increase of 20 per cent compared with where we were a year ago.

All in all Canadians now owe more than $2.15 trillion in consumer debt more than the value of Canada's entire economy.

Rebecca Oakes with Equifax told CBC News that this surge of new home loans could become a problem if and when rates rise.

""A small movement in interest rates can actually do quite a large increase in what a consumer needs to [come up with] in terms of those payments"" she said. ""That's kind of why we're a little bit concerned.""

The rent vs. buy conundrum

Adam Eljerbi owns a number of homes in London Ont. half of which he bought in the past year alone. In an interview he said he thinks buyers in some markets may be getting in over their heads because of a need to ""keep up with the Joneses"" as he put it.

""There's a lot of speculative behaviour"" he said. ""There's a lot of hey homes only go up in value.""

Eljerbi has roughly $2 million in mortgage debt to his name on his properties but he isn't particularly worried about rising rates — or falling prices for that matter — because he doesn't live in any them or depend on them going up in value.

He's a landlord and makes his money fixing up homes in disrepair and renting them to reliable tenants: students.

He lives frugally in his parents' home in Barrie Ont. about 250 kilometres from his stable of income properties. Despite never having taken in a six-figure income from his job in the tech sector he's amassed a real estate empire worth about $4.5 million.

Even before he lived with his parents he rented a basement apartment in Toronto while working in finance on Bay Street.

""I was very frugal. I'd pack my lunches. I'm very very cautious [with] the money that I spend"" he said.

WATCH | Why Canadians need to get over their aversion to renting:

Rent vs buy? Duration 0:30 Real estate investor Adam Eljerbi says more people should consider renting their primary residence since prices in many markets simply don't add up as an investment.

Even before the current run-up in prices buying in Toronto never made sense to Eljerbi but he's comfortable with debt on his properties in more affordable markets because the numbers work: buy a fixer-upper improve the housing stock find reliable tenants repeat.

""I'm a big proponent of renting where you live and owning what you can rent"" he said.

Eljerbi knows his way of life isn't for everyone but he wishes more people would break free of the cycle of borrowing more and more for something that will make them very little money if all they do is live in it.

""When you look at real estate in general and you look at mortgage debt a lot of Canadians have taken on a substantial amount of debt and aren't aware of the fact that most of ... it is variable"" he said. ""Once they start creeping up those interest rates even if it's a fraction it starts to weigh on your cash flow.""

In over their heads?

But not everyone thinks Canada has a mortgage debt problem. Sherry Cooper chief economist with Dominion Lending Centres thinks the alarmism over growing mortgage debt gives a warped view of reality.

Delinquency rates are near all-time lows she notes which suggests the vast majority of people haven't gotten in over their heads. She also notes that nearly half of all Canadian homeowners don't have a mortgage on their homes and recent changes to the stress test rules which make it harder to qualify for a home loan have raised the safety bar for everyone else who's managed to buy in.

""Most Canadians are forced to qualify under even more stringent stress testing than before substantially above their actual mortgage rate"" Cooper said. ""Even if rates were to rise 2.5 percentage points they are qualified to pay them at that level.""

Cooper says on the whole she's not too worried about new buyers who are contributing to that eye-popping $2 trillion debt figure because they've proven their finances are more than healthy enough to withstand it.

She said the pandemic has been an ""extraordinary period"" for Canada's economy and ""the proportion of the population that has been able to qualify for loans those are the people that still have jobs.""

""It's not the people that are living on government employee compensation"" she said. ""So I don't see this as a problem going forward.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Eatery last week opened its second Atlanta location marking the 50th Snooze to debut in the United States a spokesperson told What Now Atlanta in an email this week.

The breakfast and brunch restaurant known for serving “Breakfast but Different” is housed in West Midtown at 980 Howell Mill Road in the Osprey development — which was recently acquired by Equity Residential. Its first day open to the public was Wednesday September 1 joining the market’s first Snooze in Sandy Springs.

The 153-seat indoor and outdoor restaurant teamed up with local Atlanta artist Kendall McCann to design a mural that will be the centerpiece of the space. Inspired by Snooze’s ongoing “Everyone is Welcome at Our Table” initiative the mural celebrates diversity inclusion and acceptance the spokesperson said.

“Snooze’s mission extends far beyond serving delicious food and drinks and places emphasis on supporting each of their communities” the spokesperson said. “Every pre-opening weekend Snooze hosts ‘Community Days’ and partners with local non-profit organizations to host breakfast benefits for each as a way for Snooze to show their dedication to local causes and meet their new community.”

In August guest contributions and proceeds raised over $3700 which was directly donated to Lost-n-Found Youth and Atlanta Ronald McDonald House Charities. In celebration of the 50th opening Snooze is donating an additional $5000 split between each organization to further its commitment to the Atlanta community.

Founded in Denver Colorado in 2006 by brothers Jon and Adam Schlegel Snooze currently has 50 locations throughout Arizona California Colorado Georgia Kansas Missouri North Carolina and Texas.

The restaurant’s fall menu will include options like the Pumpkin Pecan Pie Pancakes with a vanilla cream cheese filling topped with caramel sauce a drizzle of sweet cream candied pecans and powdered sugar and the L.E.O. Scramble with three cage-free eggs scrambled with lox-style salmon yellow onions and topped with fresh dill served with toasted rustic bread a side of green goddess cream cheese and fried capers.

Menu mainstays include the Funky Monkey French Toast with griddled slices of bananas white chocolate chips caramel sauce candied pecans and topped with whipped mascarpone and a bruleed banana and the Breakfast Pot Pie a riff on a classic chicken pot pie with a breakfast twist featuring Snooze’s homemade rosemary sausage gravy topped with a cage-free sunny side up egg and served with hash browns.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Amanda Gorman Inks Deal With Estée Lauder

Although this is Gorman’s first multi-year partnership contract with a publicly-traded company she isn’t new to the world of brand deals.

Following Amanda Gorman’s rise to stardom at U.S. President Joe Biden’s inauguration the endorsement contracts started piling up. The 23-year-old signed a contract with IMG Models but turned down $17 million in advertising deals.

“I didn’t really look at the details because if you see something and it says a million dollars you’re going to rationalize why that makes sense” Gorman told Vogue after turning down a major deal. “I have to be conscious of taking commissions that speak to me.”

The Harvard grad has confirmed that she’s looking forward to her new opportunity with Estée Lauder.

“Together we will advance equality and social impact through supporting literacy globally” Gorman shared on social media. “I can’t wait for us to get started!”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Horse racing betting proposed in Sturbridge

A longtime racehorse owner wants to build a $25 million equine center with horse racing and sports betting in Sturbridge.

The Sturbridge Agricultural and Equestrian Center proposed by Armand Janjigian would include a dirt track and a turf track on 223 acres The Telegram & Gazette reported.

Janjigian predicts $1 million in annual revenue and benefits to the town and the creation of 100 jobs.

The New England Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association and Massachusetts Thoroughbred Breeders Association both support the project he said.

Neither of the Saturday morning leaks are believed to have posed a risk to the public Maynard fire Chief Anthony Stowers said in a news release.

The first leak was reported thanks to the smell of gas about 9 a.m. near Thompson Street behind Building 5 of the Mill and Main office complex fire officials said. While firefighters were there they were called to the smell of gas on nearby Chandler Street.

In both cases Eversource was called. Their representatives found gas leaking from a regulator and repaired the leak after isolating it the department said.

While gas readings indicated there was no danger to residents in the leaks discovered Friday morning fire officials said they urged residents to always call 911 to report the smell of gas or a gas-related emergency.

In a statement Saturday Eversource called the two gas leaks ""minor"" committed to continued inspections and referred to Thursday's deadly fire:

Eversource crews have remained in the Maynard area since Thursday afternoon’s event working with state and local agencies as we investigate what happened. During our check of the system our crews discovered and repaired two minor gas leaks and they will continue inspections throughout the area.

We are deeply saddened by the loss of a resident in the Park Street fire on Thursday and thank the first responders for their heroic efforts.

We will continue reaching out to neighbors and customers to update them as we complete our check of the system over the coming days.

A man is dead after a home explosion in Maynard Massachusetts.

On Thursday afternoon firefighters had been called about the smell of gas coming from a home on Park Street. Crews who arrived at the building found smoke coming from its front and side windows and in the basement a man dead Stowers has said.

Two Maynard police officers and a firefighter were also injured in the blaze but are expected to survive the fire chief said.

Dozens of Eversource workers were on scene Thursday night and Friday morning digging a hole in front of the home. Fire officials said Friday evening the utility was inspecting supply lines throughout the town as a precaution. The state fire marshal's office is investigating.

""We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of a resident and the injuries suffered by the emergency responders in the Park Street fire yesterday"" Eversource said in a statement Friday. ""We will remain in the area to continue monitoring and will work with state and local agencies as we investigate what happened.""

The Maynard Fire Department told town residents that Eversource would be making precautionary inspections to look for gas leaks.

In a Facebook post the department noted the approach from Eversource was precautionary adding ""This is not the same type of problem that occurred in the Merrimack Valley.""

The post was referring to a series of gas explosions that devastated Lawrence Andover and North Andover in 2018 killing one person injuring dozens and displacing thousands.

But EVs aren't flawless. One common complaint folks have about EVs is that they don't seem to have much cargo capacity. Here's a look at why EVs might generally have less cargo space than gas-powered cars do.

EVs are more popular every year and they will be the cars of the future. But EVs aren’t flawless. One common complaint folks have about EVs is they don’t have much cargo capacity. Here’s a look at why EVs generally have less cargo space than gas-powered cars.

How much cargo capacity do EVs have?

EV cargo space | Getty Images

Bigger segments will have bigger cargo capacities. Like the Tesla Model Y electric SUVs are almost guaranteed to have more cargo capacity than smaller compact EVs. The hard numbers back this up. With its rear seats folded down the Model Y has a max cargo capacity of about 68 cubic feet.

Similarly the Volkswagen ID.4 has just over 64 cubic feet of cargo capacity with its rear seats folded down. Both electric SUVs are compact SUVs. Compared to gas-powered compact SUVs the popular Model Y and ID.4 do actually fall behind in cargo capacity. However the gap isn’t actually that massive.

For example the Toyota RAV4 has just under 70 cubic feet of max cargo capacity. This puts the RAV4 at an arm’s length away from the Model Y’s max cargo capacity. Similarly the Honda CR-V has almost 76 cubic feet of max cargo capacity. This is significantly more than the Model Y and ID.4. But it’s still not a double-digit difference.

Why EVs seem to have less cargo capacity

As the Model Y demonstrates EVs can have as much cargo capacity as many of their conventional peers but EVs will still lose out to the best in the segment. Like Green Car Reports wrote it’s a balancing act between a lot of factors. Batteries are heavy and to get a good enough range the car will need many batteries.

However batteries aren’t cheap. To get the best value in an EV automakers have focused on building smaller EVs. It’s no surprise that small EVs will have a small cargo capacity. Like Green Car Reports wrote until cheaper batteries come along automakers will need to find a good balance between all those things.

The batteries themselves have to take some blame. Batteries aren’t small in terms of dimensions. Due to that cars with battery packs will tend to have less room than the same car without battery packs. That’s exactly why PHEV versions of a car will have less cargo capacity than the regular gas-powered version.

The frunk is nice though

But many EVs have some extra space to play with by taking out the gas or diesel engine. Many automakers have converted this extra space where the engine used to be into a trunk. However since it’s on the front of the car it’s called a frunk. This is not something every EV has but many popular ones have this feature. The Ford F-150 Lightning will definitely have a frunk.

The frunk will add cargo capacity to a car without forcing people to fold their seats down. This will allow families to sit on every seat while also carrying around more stuff than usual. However since the frunk is a relatively new idea automakers have been playing around with it. For example the F-150 Lightning’s frunk should be capable of doing some useful stuff especially at tailgate parties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZXllb2Z0aGVmbHllci5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8wNS9hcmUtYnVsa2hlYWQtc2VhdHMtYmV0dGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,To Bulkhead or Not to Bulkhead: That is the Question!,"Advertiser Disclosure: Eye of the Flyer a division of Chatterbox Entertainment Inc. has partnered with CardRatings for our coverage of credit card products.

Here’s a topic that Chris and his wife hotly debate. Chris is generally a bulkhead fan. He likes that many have extra legroom. And even when they don’t no one can recline back into him.

But his wife hates bulkheads. She prefers to have her carryon bag at her feet instead of in the overhead bin.

So let’s check out some of the bulkheads on Delta planes. And then you tell us your thoughts!

You would think if you get a first class upgrade all seats are created equal – after all it is first class right? Not so fast! On the Delta 737-900er the left side A&B gives you almost no leg room with only a tiny 50% cut out for feet on B. The C&D side are a little better but if you are tall you will not be pleased. Gone are the days of nice large footwell cutouts like you see just above.

And even when it comes to Delta One seats where yes even bulkhead seats are generally the same as the rest of the cabin many feel very claustrophobic with the “wall” so close to them. I do not get airsick (or at least have not since I was a kid) but sitting in this row in Delta One I got a little queasy once. Maybe you are the same so keep that in mind.

Lastly when it comes to being this far front you may be bothered by the galley area either from light intrusion or noise or cooking smells or crew talking and all the other things that happen that far forward. Enough about first class.

Now in coach (or some domestic first class) cabins there are several pros and cons with the bulkhead. The main one is you may against your will have to move. Delta even warns you about this when you book it (well most times anyway) that you could be asked (i.e. forced) to move if a bassinet has to be attached to the wall or someone with a disability requires that seat. Moving from a great seat to maybe a middle seat in the back is not much fun!

Next as is often the case with bulkhead rows is your seat will be less wide due to the fixed armrests that sometimes include the IFE on an arm inside the seat (also further making it smaller). You may or may not like fixed (and smaller) space or you may like this to ensure your own space is your space.

Lastly notice where the tray table is. Yep in the armrest not in the seat in front of you since there is not a seat in front of you. For some who have ah hem a larger mid area the tray may not move far enough away from you for comfort (normally not an issue in 1st but on some jets even here).

Well so far it sounds like I am telling you bulkheads are all bad and to be avoided. Not really I just want to cover the negatives before the positives and why I almost always choose the bulkhead myself when I can.

I am a tiny bit claustrophobic as I have already mentioned. I really hate it when someone reclines into my face. Additionally especially in 1st class I want to have room to work on my laptop and someone reclining into me means work will not happen.

Next depending on the jet you may nor may not have to get up when your seatmate needs to get up. I always try to get up anyway. But when I’m with my wife she can crawl around me with no problem on almost any Delta bulkhead seat.

Then we have space. Some coach bulkhead rows especially on international birds have some of the most generous legroom in main cabin seating. If you are tall you may really like this as it yields as much or more than exit row without being as cold as an exit row seat.

Then as maybe a minor final plus if you are in the bulkhead you are likely going to be getting off the jet sooner (with the exception of some rear ones clearly). Depending on your connection time this can make a difference.

So there you are. There really is a lot to consider before you click that bulkhead seat. Are you like me who tends to choose this if open or do you avoid these at all costs? You tell me! – René

I read with astonishment and disbelief that Conservation International (CI) Guyana had returned a US$10 million grant to ExxonMobil. Conservation International claim for the return was because of ExxonMobil environmental record. So CI was not aware for that prior to accepting the grant? ExxonMobil have that bad environmental record for ages. What world is the leadership in CI living in? I believe that CI like the rest of Guyana suffers from mediocrity and incompetence. They likely propagated this by hiring someone with similar traits who just could not even get the project moving. The return of funds is one thing. The cop out excuse is backward. ExxonMobil should take them to task for this. Imagine the amount of good that money could have done to implement strategies to help correct the destruction to the environment.

Executives are celebrating booming sales as the US stock market sets record high after record high: The words “great quarter” and their synonyms were mentioned during earnings calls a record 327 times in August according to call transcript data compiled by Sentieo. “Congratulations” also had a strong showing.

Corporate executives and analysts aren’t wrong. A record percentage of companies in the S&P 500 Index of large US stocks have said revenue came in higher than estimates during the second quarter according to FactSet. Profits have smoked expectations—87% of enterprises in that index reported a positive surprise in earnings-per-share. Investment banks think profits will grow more than 20% in the second half of the year.

Companies in healthcare communications services consumer staples and information technology led reports of revenue exceeding estimates. In all four of those sectors more than 90% of the firms blew away sales expectations.

Cyber security firm CrowdStrike whose stock price is up about 30% this year got a ""congrats on a great quarter"" from Tal Liani at Bank of America Securities. An analyst at Stephens congratulated medical device company Cooper Companies up 26% in 2021 ""on the record quarter."" Both firms are outpacing the broader S&P 500's 21% gain.

The CFO of team-management software maker Asana whose stock has more than tripled this year gave kudos to his own company: ""We're very excited to report another great quarter.""

Why the stock market is at a record high

Several factors are underpinning the buoyant results and a heady stock market. Lawmakers in Washington have splashed trillions of dollars of spending to propel the economy leaving companies banks and consumers relatively flush with cash. The Federal Reserve has played a key role by balancing inflation worries with robust economic expansion said Randy Frederick managing director of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Fed chair Jerome Powell has been gradually signaling policy changes for months to avoid unnerving investors and short-term interest rates are unlikely to increase for another year Frederick said.

That said there are signs that Covid-19 could take another bite out of the economy. The average number of new daily cases in the US has climbed to about 150000 as infections from the delta variant surge. The US added far fewer jobs last month than economists expected a development widely attributed to the spread of the highly-contagious variant. The job market stumbled just as a lifeline for millions of unemployed comes to an end leaving more than 7 million Americans without jobless benefits.

For now the stock market is taking those risks in stride perhaps because investors think policy makers would step in with more support if it was needed.

In the meantime the best performing company in the S&P 500 was bereft of ""great quarter"" mentions in its latest call with analysts. Moderna's revenue shot up to $6.3 billion in the first half of 2021 compared with $75 million during the same period a year ago. The pharmaceutical firm's stock has rocketed nearly 300% in 2021.

Corinne Le Goff chief commercial officer of the company behind the widely used Covid-19 vaccine merely called it a ""productive quarter.""

And the stock of Zoom Video Communications a big winner during lockdowns last year has fallen 12% in 2021. The video-calling software company posted second-quarter earnings that exceeded analyst forecasts but its results also signaled slowing growth.

Nonetheless an analyst was enthused about Zoom's latest results: ""Great quarter again guys"" said Oppenheimer's Ittai Kidron.

On the off chance you did not already see this marvelous work of cinema we offer it below in its purest form with a “holy crap”-like caption from a swooning film critic and an enormous watermark in the center. Put your seat backs and tray tables up. We’re going in.

X content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

So what exactly is happening in this slowed-down 52-second clip this Zapruder film of Eros which has been viewed over five million times as of Sunday morning? Let’s get our bearings.

Chastain and Isaac were arriving at the premiere of Scenes From A Marriage which isn’t a movie but a television series debuting on HBO on September 12. The Venice Film Festival screened all five episodes (just shy of five hours) so anyone willing to sit for that long in a theater is certainly deserving of a special pre-show spectacle like this.

If Scenes From A Marriage sounds familiar that’s because it’s based on a provocative television series from 1974 written and directed by Swedish auteur Ingmar Bergman. It was later abridged and released theatrically and became something of an art house success in the United States. (The abridged cut at a measly two hours and forty-nine minutes is currently available to stream on HBO Max. If you want the original the mighty Criterion Channel has all six 50-ish minute episodes of complex matrimonial distress for you to sink your teeth into.)

This new Isaac-Chastain version is adapted by Hagai Levi an Israeli writer director and producer who is best known for creating the series In Treatment. As Levi told me in a soon-to-run interview here on V.F. Isaac and Chastain who have been good friends since their days at Juilliard kept it light on set with “their own private jokes” during the pandemic-era shoot on a soundstage in Mount Vernon New York. This comfort with one another is evident in other images from the Scenes red carpet.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jason and Angela Kranz once could have been considered the poster couple for young professionals in Florida’s Friendliest Hometown. Both were knocking down six-figure annual incomes selling dream homes for Properties of The Villages and they had four children enrolled in The Villages Charter School.

However Jason Kranz and Christopher Day in December 2019 announced in a bombshell email to their Properties of The Villages colleagues that they were leaving to start their own real estate venture setting off a chain of events that led to a federal trial earlier this year resulting in a $603700 judgment against them.

In an effort to collect that money Properties of The Villages is seeking to garnish the assets of Kranz Day and their associates.

Documents filed this past week by Jason and Angela Kranz offer a peek into the couple’s finances.

In 2019 Jason Kranz earned $430000 from Properties of The Villages while Angela Kranz earned $130000. In 2020 he earned $330000 from his new firm KD Premier Realty. In 2020 she earned $5000 from KD Premier Realty and $2837 working as a hostess at Nancy Lopez Legacy Restaurant in The Villages. She took the country club job to keep their children enrolled in the charter school.

In 2020 the couple began liquidating their local assets:

• On Jan. 9 2020 they sold a home at 1681 Nelson Terrace in The Villages for $285000.

• On May 13 2020 they sold a home at 596 Audrey Lane in The Villages for $276000.

• On June 19 2020 they sold property at 10441 NE 104th Circle in Oxford for $130000.

• On Aug. 14 2020 they sold a home at 1887 Pengrove Pass Court in The Villages for $201000.

In addition on May 31 of this year they sold a 2006 Nissan for $8000 to a Summerfield man.

Jason and Angela Kranz have relocated with their two youngest sons ages 17 and 15 to a home at Lakewood Ranch in Bradenton. Court documents show they have a $500000 mortgage on the new home and a monthly mortgage payment of $2931. The couple’s oldest daughters ages 22 and 20 are living in Atlanta and Tampa.

Properties of The Villages sought balances of the couple’s bank accounts and Angela Kranz’s responses show a number of accounts the couple has held over the past three years including accounts at Citizens First Bank in The Villages but none of the accounts today has in excess of $1000. Most show a balance of zero.

The couple has $2.3 million in life insurance through Northwestern Mutual; $4000 in home furnishings; Mrs. Kranz’s wedding ring; a 2019 Tesla Model 3; a 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe; and a 2013 Hyundai Elantra.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cantlay who won the BMW Championship in a six-hole playoff over Bryson DeChambeau just last week captured back-to-back events to end the 2020-21 PGA Tour season and is now the leader in the clubhouse for player of the year honors.

The figures up for grabs Sunday were startling. The winner of the Tour Championship Cantlay netted $15 million. If you make it to the final event at all you're guaranteed $395000 even if you finish 30th or withdraw like Brooks Koepka. Everyone who made it to the BMW Championship was guaranteed at least $140000. Heck everyone who finished in the top 125 was guaranteed at least $101000. And all of that is on top of what the tournaments themselves pay out. Add it all up and FedEx is giving out $60 million in bonus funds to the best players in the world.

Here's a breakdown of the prize money payouts for the top 30 golfers at the end of the Tour Championship. When Cantlay and Rahm were competing on the 72nd hole Sunday there was a $10 million differential hanging on every shot they took.

Notes

Cantlay took a two-shot lead after 16 holes following his clutch birdie on the par-four 16th.

However Cantlay struggled through the 17th hole after his drive found the rough. His approach missed the green and he eventually found himself with a 5'11"" putt just to make bogey.

Rahm unleashed a great approach shot to give himself an 11'1"" birdie putt that would have led to a two-shot swing and tie.

Rahm's putt did not connect but he tapped in for par.

On the 18th hole Cantlay unleashed a 361-yard drive before nailing his approach shot giving himself a look from 11'4"" for eagle.

Meanwhile Rahm bombed his own powerful drive and gave himself an eagle look from the left intermediate.

He gave it a good effort but did not connect. In response Cantlay just missed his eagle before tapping in for birdie and the win.

The 29-year-old Cantlay won his first Fed Ex Cup championship following the win.

Cantlay and Rahm dueled over the last three days as Rahm kept whittling away at his initial four-shot deficit but could never draw even with Cantlay.

Cantlay’s lead was only one stroke after Rahm converted a par after missing an 11-foot putt for birdie on the 17th hole and Cantlay saved bogey from 6 feet. With $15 million and the FedEx Cup on the line both players took dead aim at the flag on the par-5 18th hole.

British infrastructure manager Network Rail (NR) says the £7.5m extension of the station is “the first carbon positive upgrade of its kind at a station in Europe.”

The British government funded the majority of the project via the Department for Transport with the aim of relieving station crowding.

The BIPVco Flextron thin film is fitted to the station roof and returns the energy into the electricity grid. It is 3mm thick weighs 3kg per m2 and require no extra weight support. NR says the solar panels are shatterproof and have a self-cleaning Teflon-like top sheet that requires no ongoing maintenance. NR says the technology also generates a higher energy yield in shadow and shading conditions than conventional solar panels.

NR plans to use the technology at other stations in the future.

“Making this new extension to Denmark Hill the first ‘carbon positive’ upgrade by utilising innovative solar technology also demonstrates our ambition to ensure our rail network is greener for passengers and better for our environment” says rail minister Mr Chris Heaton-Harris.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjA5Mzk4My9zb2xhcndpbmRzLWNlby1zdWRoYWthci1yYW1ha3Jpc2huYS1jeWJlci1hdHRhY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna on 2020's Massive Hack,"(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers click here.)

The 2020 SolarWinds hack is considered one of the worst cyberattacks in recent years. Not exactly the sort of problem that an incoming CEO might want to confront on his first day on the job.

On Dec. 9 2020 Sudhakar Ramakrishna was named the CEO of SolarWinds an NYSE-listed company that provides IT infrastructure monitoring and management software to many government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. Days later a celebratory birthday dinner with his family was interrupted by a call from SolarWinds’ general counsel informing Ramakrishna that the company’s software was used as a vehicle in a massive hack.

Regulators found that a breach of SolarWinds’ software by a foreign actor gave hackers access to the data of the companies and government offices that used its products. SolarWinds was sued by investors following the breach. Although early reports said 18000 companies were possibly impacted SolarWinds’ most recent estimate is that the breach hit approximately 100 private companies and nine federal agencies. The attack was linked to Russian intelligence services a charge denied by the Russian government.

Ramakrishna was not due to start the job until January 2021 and wasn’t even on the company’s email system yet. Given the magnitude of the attack which made headlines for exposing the company’s blue-chip clients to an intrusion by piggybacking on a SolarWinds software update a number of Ramakrishna’s family and friends questioned the wisdom of taking the position.

“I got two categories of input at that point” Ramakrishna recalls. “One set of people said ‘Look you have nothing to prove. You’ve had a very successful career. So don’t go deal with this mess that you did not create.’ The other set of people said and they were probably being nice ‘Out of all the people we know we know you’re probably the best person to solve this problem. You have the background you have the demeanor. So go for it.’”

His two sons were divided but ultimately the argument of his younger son carried the day.

”My second son reminded me of what I remind them all the time which is If you make a commitment you try to follow through on it” Ramakrishna says.

Cybersecurity has emerged as one of the critical challenges facing business leaders. The day I interviewed Ramakrishna President Joe Biden had summoned a group of tech and financial CEOs to the White House for a summit on the issue calling it “the core national security challenge we are facing.”

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

So your kitchen cabinet was divided on whether you should take the job after the hack became public. Did you ever seriously consider not taking it?

No. My rationalization was “What if I had started on Jan. 4 and this came to light on Jan. 6?” I wasn’t probably going to turn around and run from it. No. 2: I have experience dealing with security issues. There is an opportunity to learn there is an opportunity to create an impact and most importantly there’s an opportunity to serve your customers. You can probably accuse me of being a foolish optimist but that’s how I thought about it.

You had just sold a company right? Is it public how much you made?

It’s not public because it was a private company transaction. I can safely say that I probably need not have worked for a paycheck.

What were those first meetings with staffers like?

[One employee] told me there were bets going on within SolarWinds whether I would show up or not.

What was dealing with customers like those first months? Were they pissed off?

Some definitely were there’s no question. Customers have the right to get pissed off. Your job as a vendor as a supplier of software is not to create excuses. Your job first and foremost is to face them tell them what happened take your punches if you have to but show them what you’re doing about it. So the first few months—January February March—were very intense in that regard in terms of both meeting with federal government customers and commercial customers.

What was the toughest conversation you had with a customer? Do any stand out?

There was one. Here’s where it hurts the most because when your customer buys your product they are in essence trusting their career in your hands. There was one chief information security officer who basically attributed for him and his team potentially getting fired due to SolarWinds. That just came out raw. That was the toughest because it was less about the issue and more about the human.

Do you know what ultimately happened in that instance?

I believe they are still there.

President Biden just met with tech and business leaders to talk about cybersecurity. What is the most important thing the federal government can do in this regard?

No matter whether you’re a cybersecurity company or not there has to be a community vigil model. Everybody has to share information freely with the government and the government with us to make our defenses that much more secure. In cyberwars timeliness matters almost more than anything else. So if you create an environment where victims are ashamed to come out and say that they got breached you’re actually making yourself weaker not stronger. So get into a world where victims feel confident coming out and sharing. The second thing people like Senator [Mark] Warner [of Virginia] have been talking about [is] providing some level of indemnity because everybody gets sued in situations like this rightly or wrongly.

How much has the attack cost the company?

We have come out and said that we are spending to the tune of about $25 million to support the Secure by Design initiative [which enhances the company’s security posture and establish new standards in secure software development].

What did you learn about crisis management starting a new job in the middle of all this?

I consider myself to be a situational leader—you adapt your actions depending on what the situation demands not so much what you want to do. Oftentimes you’re going in thinking I want to do A-B-C but it’s almost irrelevant.

From a crisis-management standpoint the more that we as leaders can tune our brains to set aside our egos and our personal preferences and focus on the situation at hand the more useful we will be. The second thing I would say is that there are always a lot of incredibly dedicated people in every situation. It is not their fault that something is inflicted upon them so your job as a leader is to serve them to help them realize their full potential and support them through the journey—and not judge them just because they may have been inflicted by this situation.

You don’t need a separate space for installing it and the best part is you don’t even need much money for this. The Solar Panel can be installed on the vacant roof of the house. The government is also giving a lot of subsidies for this.

If you wish to have more profit in little investment then you must install Solar Panels. You don’t need a separate space for installing it and the best part is you don’t even need much money for this. The Solar Panel can be installed on the vacant roof of the house. The government is also giving a lot of subsidies for this.

Solar panels will not only save the electricity cost of your house but will also make you earn good money. Use only the electricity you need and sell the rest. By installing solar plants of different capacities an income of Rs 30000 to 1 lakh can be earned.

Solar panels can be easily mounted on the roof. If there are 10 hours of sunlight then a solar plant of 2-kilowatt capacity will generate about 10 units of electricity daily in a month. The plant will generate 300 units of electricity. Apart from the required electricity you can also sell the remaining electricity to the government or company through the grid. That means you are earning & also getting free electricity.

Know how many kilowatts Solar Panel would be right for you. In simple language if your electricity bill comes up to Rs 1000 per month then 1-kilowatt Solar Panel is right for you.

Earning up to 1 lakh per month

The Central & State governments give a lot of discounts for Solar Panels. The loan is also available from the bank. You can get complete information from the Renewable Energy Department of the district to take advantage of subsidy schemes of the government. This means you can earn huge profits by investing less money.

According to the people earning from Solar Energy you can easily earn Rs 30000 to 1 lakh per month from solar panels of different kilowatt capacities.

Cost of Solar Panel

The cost of 2 kilowatts on-grid Solar Panels is around Rs 1 25000. This includes Solar Panels their installation meters & inverters. You can get a subsidy of up to 40% on this from the Central Government (Ministry of Renewable Energy) while the UP government is giving a discount of up to Rs 30000.

In such a situation it will cost you about Rs 50000 to 70000 to install the Solar Power Panel of up to 2 kilowatts. For more details you can contact UPNEDA (Uttar Pradesh New & Renewable Energy Development Agency).

Donning a Browns jersey with the number 21 (worn by cornerback Denzel Ward) Gerard Berroteran 21 performed the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" prior to the kickoff of the Browns' preseason contest against the New York Giants Aug. 22. The Browns won 17-13.

Berroteran is the son of Raquel and Louis Berroteran of Silver Lake and has a sister Isabel 17. The family has lived in Silver Lake since 2006.

Berroteran a junior political science/pre-law major at The Ohio State University said while he ""felt really good about"" his performance he noted there's ""always room to improve.""

Berroteran first performed at a Cleveland Cavaliers game when he was 11 years old. Since then he sang the national anthem a couple times each at Cleveland Indians and Akron Rubber Ducks contests but this was his first performance at a Browns game.

Noting that the Browns are ""definitely my favorite team"" Berroteran said it was meaningful to perform the anthem before the squad's only home preseason contest of 2021.

How he got the chance

Berroteran's former Cuyahoga Falls High School football coach Shane Parker alerted him to the opportunity of performing the national anthem at a Browns game.

Berroteran said he was selected after he submitted a video of himself singing the ""Star-Spangled Banner."" The Browns also required that the performance occur in no more than 90 seconds. Complying with the time limit was not a problem since Berroteran said he likes to take a traditional approach to the piece. In addition as a sports fan himself he said his mindset is to ""get it done and let's go right to the sporting event.""

The performance

Berroteran rehearsed on the FirstEnergy Stadium field earlier on game day and the stands were mostly empty. When he later stood on the field before the main performance he felt some nerves coming on as he saw players doing pre-game drills and spectators filling the seats.

""That's when you know it's showtime"" Berroteran said. ""…I think I was more excited than nervous.""

He noted seeing players such as Baker Mayfield Myles Garrett Nick Chubb Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr. up-close created an exciting atmosphere.

""Just being on the field was amazing…Being on the field and singing in front of them is a totally different experience"" he said. ""They don't notice you when you're standing in the crowd but when you're standing right in front of them singing they're actually looking at you. It's kind of crazy.""

Background

Berotteran said he started off singing because people told him he was talented and because he saw vocal performance as a way to differentiate himself from his group of friends who played sports.

As a second-grader at Holy Family School in Stow Berroteran's vocal talent caught the ear of a teacher named Sandy Michaels and she told Raquel and Louis about their son's singing ability.

""She gave me the start"" Berroteran said

Berroteran went to Akron's Miller South School for the Visual and Performing Arts starting in fourth grade and said he's worked with Sue Wallin at the West Side Vocal Academy in Akron since he was in middle school.

Berroteran acknowledged he didn't gain a passion for the craft until he was in high school performing in all-city musicals at the Akron Civic Theater. As a sophomore he portrayed Gaston in ""Beauty and the Beast"" and then played Pontius Pilate in ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" his junior year.

He then took a break from singing as a senior while he focused on taking a shot at playing college football.

""I love football"" said Berroteran who added he knew he had a ""short window"" of time to try playing in college.

After being a defensive end for Coach Parker at Cuyahoga Falls High School he shifted to defensive tackle during his one year at Westminster College. The team had a 10-3 season and won a bowl game and while Berroteran said the experience was ""valuable"" playing at the next level was ""tough."" He also observed the small school setting was not the best fit for him and said he's enjoyed being in Columbus to attend Ohio State particularly since he is also a big fan of the Buckeyes.

Berroteran said he sang more this past summer than he had since his junior year at Falls High.

He sang at Holy Family Parish as well as at weddings and funerals and recently performed at the Akron Civic Theater's Great Gatsby Gala.

""That was actually my first professional gig"" Berroteran said. ""This summer's been really good to me singing-wise. It's the busiest I've ever been singing in my life probably. I hope it continues.""

At Ohio State Berroteran said he sings in a quartet at the St. Thomas More Newman Center and is hoping to get more involved with the music department through finding an accompanist and participating in groups such as the jazz club.

While courtside celebrity fan Chance the Rapper lit up the Amp across the grounds the Miller Lite Oasis was the true home of yet another well-deserved victory lap. DJ Shawna the Bucks' in-house DJ served as the stage's opener pumping the crowd up with the help of free Bucks t-shirts #BucksInSix chants and special guests Vo Williams – the man behind the ""History in the Making"" rap from the player intros at Fiserv Forum – as well as Ben Tajnai the team's big-lunged anthem singer and lucky charm. I would've never thought I'd see the Sinatra classic ""Feelin' Good"" and the National Anthem successfully pump up a young EDM-craving summer festival crowd but I never thought I'd see the Bucks win the NBA Finals too so truly 2021 has been full of surprises.

Another sight I never expected: the looming presence of NBA hall-of-famer Shaquille O'Neal lording over a rave in Milwaukee. But that too came to fruition Friday night as ""DJ Diesel"" took the Oasis stage – and unlike some other unfortunately memorable novelty celeb DJ attempts at the Big Gig actually threw quite the enthrallingly entertaining party. No one would call Shaq the second coming of David Guetta or Steve Aoki but he wasn't the second coming of DJ Paris Hilton either as he took a page from his on-the-court NBA career and effectively muscled bombarded and overwhelmed his way to success on Friday night. X

Taking the stage at 10 p.m. with a surprisingly large on-stage posse (that would only get larger as the night went along plus guests from the crowd) Shaq pressed play on a 75-minute relentless onslaught of crunchy EDM beats and bass-thumping top 40 remixes. And I do mean ""pressed play"" as the NBA superstar didn't appear to do much behind his large deck beyond flick the occasional switch and slap the smoke jets button. At one point in the early going one of his posse members even had to crank the volume up for him. If you wanted to see noteworthy DJ work from Shaq you'd have been better off trying to find a highlight of him making a free throw.

Still he faired respectably as the head coach of the party getting the crowd motivated and moving with his booming setlist of distorted hits – Olivia Rodrigo DMX Kanye West and many more all made appearances – and satisfyingly ferocious bass drops. Every now and then he made a misstep with some retro or rock interludes like ""I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight"" Red Hot Chili Peppers or t.A.T.u's ""All The Things She Said."" The only one that worked was ""We Are The Champions"" for obvious Bucks-related reasons but otherwise these odd genre detours brought things to a head-scratching halt and didn't cohere with the clubby atmosphere whatsoever. Save for those moments though it was all popular bangers and buzzy beats all the time blasting with all the bass too contagiously catchy and propulsive to resist. X

Plus as one of the bigger personalities in modern sports Shaq kept in touch and engaged with the crowd throughout the show. In front of his screen of giant Shaq heads with red lazer-shooting eyes and lightning-covered basketballs that looked like a live-action ""Static Shock"" Diesel did the standard-issue fist-pumping and finger-gunning (as well as some jumpshot poses that were amusingly corny in that very Shaq way) but also would smilingly point into the crowd at ravers that caught his attention and regularly shouted out Milwaukee – and particularly the Bucks – on the mic. He opened the show asking for ""that Deer District energy"" stole DJ Shawna's Giannis jersey to wave on stage and demanded ""Giannis muscles"" poses from the crowd. Near the end he called even more people onto the stage to dance get a handshake and – in one fan's case – stand next to him behind the table without a shirt on. X

For a mega-star playing in a small market to a likely smaller-than-expected crowd he had every reason to be aloof. Instead Shaq felt present personable and occasionally playful helping keep the good vibes going. Only complaint: I was hoping that he would take a page from Steve Aoki's book and instead of cake chuck Papa John's pizzas into the crowd. Missed brand synergy opportunity in my opinion.

Otherwise the night went about as well as hoped delivering a fun and frenetic party that knew how to get people up knew how to pander and crowd-please and – maybe most important of all – knew when to get out. (An hour and 15 minutes may seem short but even just a few minutes longer would've overstayed its welcome.) Of all of Shaq's dabblings into the world of entertainment – from ""Shaq Fu"" to ""Kazaam"" and ""Steel"" – Friday night's DJ show ranks easily amongst the most successful of the bunch. A low bar for sure but a bar cleared nevertheless.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3Jlc3RsaW5naGVhZGxpbmVzLmNvbS93d2UtYW5ub3VuY2VzLW1vcmUtbWF0Y2hlcy1mb3ItbW9uZGF5LW5pZ2h0LXJhdy_SAVNodHRwczovL3dyZXN0bGluZ2hlYWRsaW5lcy5jb20vd3dlLWFubm91bmNlcy1tb3JlLW1hdGNoZXMtZm9yLW1vbmRheS1uaWdodC1yYXcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE Announces More Matches For Monday Night Raw,"WWE has announced an additional two matchups for this Monday’s episode of Raw which takes place Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee Wisconsin.

In an excerpt from his book Forging Global Fordism Stefan J. Link offers one possible explanation.

Editor’s note: The current debate in economics seems to lack a historical perspective. To try to address this deficiency we decided to launch a Sunday column on ProMarket focusing on the historical dimension of economic ideas. You can read all of the pieces in the series here.

The rise of automotive mass production in America at the turn of the twentieth century then was without doubt a major watershed in economic history. It paved the way for a consumption-based pattern of growth and it created new imbalances in the international economic order. From a global perspective this was unexpected: The automobile after all was an invention of French and German tinkerers and the United States was a copycat adopter.

Yet by the eve of World War I the factories of southeastern Michigan were spewing out tens of thousands of automobiles while European carmakers continued to build expensive and stodgy models by hand. Seen from another angle the automobile industry decisively set apart the United States from development patterns elsewhere in the Americas. Argentina and Brazil for example had expanded into their Western hinterlands over the course of the nineteenth century just like the United States. But the economic patterns of these countries remained tied to raw materials resource extraction and transatlantic commerce. The automobile industry in short marked a pivotal shift in the “second great divergence”—the move of the United States away from its Atlantic orientation toward domestically anchored industrial preponderance in the twentieth century.

And yet the annals of American economic history barely register that mass production was a momentous departure. Rather they assimilate mass production into what might be called narratives of natural emergence: halfway between the end of the Civil War and the rise of the New Deal automotive mass production issues as though by necessity from the forward momentum of capitalist transformation. The two opposing modes in which the history of this era is generally told fully coincide in this regard. One is a sanguine narrative of progress: technological and organizational innovations converged to form large corporations whose professional managers came to preside over a more efficient more rational and less rapacious capitalism.

The second variant is told in a minor key: here the very same processes of corporate consolidation and rationalization are seen to defeat more emancipatory alternatives of grassroots populism and labor self-organization. In these latter narratives mechanized mass production—Fordism— often features as a weaponized strain of Taylorism as a tool used by management to conquer shop floors and to usher in the bleak open-shop industrial landscape of the 1920s. Both versions are overdetermined: In the first vein mass production results from the imperatives of modernization. In the second mass production results from the iron mandate of capital accumulation. To be sure this second mode narrated the transformation as one of intense conflict. Strikingly however these narratives too seem unable to imagine the story as ending in anything other than corporate hegemony: struggle there was but doomed it was too.

What is lost in these perspectives is an idea that contemporaries of the Thirties would have regarded as self-evident: that mass production could be the engine for creating political economies very different from the corporate capitalism that emerged in the American interwar years. The shape that automotive mass production took in America in the first decades of the twentieth century was not preordained: it was the outcome of concrete struggles over the terms of economic development.

The economies of scale unleashed by mass production harbored immense potential for growth. What did this imply for the social and economic order at large? Whose norms and values would govern the distribution of material rewards? What was the proper way to run that momentous new institution—the mass-producing corporation? Buried under the familiar narratives then is a political history of mass production—one that includes but goes beyond the familiar analytic of capital and labor. To be sure mass production occasioned fierce and consequential conflicts between workers and management. Yet the shop floor was only one site of contestation and there is no reason to overburden it with an ontological primacy that relegates all other conflicts to a secondary or epiphenomenal status. Doing so would mean missing what was a much larger arena of political struggle and class conflict surrounding the rise of mass production in which skilled mechanics and unskilled migrants middling proprietors and privileged investors a new managerial class and old financial elites battled out the terms of a new economic order.

Automotive mass production spawned widely diverging normative views of social order and economic development. These clashes decisively shaped how the industry matured. We need to understand these conflicts if we want to fully appreciate what attracted interwar modernizers like William Werner to Ford Detroit and the American Midwest what they found there and what they took back home across the Atlantic.

Mechanics and Financiers

The history of automotive mass production begins with a puzzle. Why did Detroit of all places pioneer the industry that would shape the twentieth century like no other? Historians and geographers have long picked at this question without pulling out fully satisfactory answers. The question matters because initially it seemed that an arc of carmakers from southern Germany to northern France to New England would dominate the new industry. In 1900 European manufacturers as well as those in Connecticut Massachusetts and New York were building stately horseless carriages for the leisure class. Yet only five years later Detroit turned out the greatest number of cars and boasted the greatest number of automotive factories on the globe with the Ford Motor Company notably among them.

Was this coincidence as automotive historians blithely maintain? Was Detroit simply lucky as it were to count a Henry Ford and a Ransom Olds among its citizens—incarnations of the American genius for innovation and entrepreneurship? Such notions remove the early tinkerers from the historical context that produced them. Figures like Ford and Olds acted within the political economy of the Midwest and shared the characteristic populist commitments that suffused the region. These two factors—political economy and political ideology—go a long way toward explaining why at the turn of the twentieth century southeastern Michigan was in an auspicious position to get ahead of rapid technological developments and to spread its fruits widely.

First the automobile industry benefited from the Midwest’s distinctive pattern of industrialization. The larger Great Lakes basin had seen an “agro-industrial revolution” since the mid-nineteenth century in which the machine shops and foundries of middling cities connected with commercially oriented farms. In such an environment industry and agriculture were not seen as belonging to successive stages of development; rather they were regarded as complementary indeed symbiotic. Midwestern growth in short did not conform to the spatial logic by which the global “great specialization” separated agricultural surpluses from industrial production by vast distances. That meant that farmers had the resources and mechanical savvy to buy a moderately priced gadget such as the runabout—“a horseless carriage with an engine mounted underneath”—turned out by Detroit car builders in the early years.

Second the economic geography of the Midwest occasioned distinctive political sensibilities. Populist farmers famously rallied against the increasing integration of independent producers into the circuits of money and capital dominated by the East. Less well known is the equally pervasive populism espoused by the middling manufacturers and machine-shop proprietors so characteristic of the Midwest. Less concerned with agricultural prices and railroad freight rates than the farmers the manufacturers nevertheless shared their producerism. That is they insisted that the ultimate source of the nation’s increasing wealth and of the civilizational progress it engendered was productive labor. Material affluence was held to be a prerogative of the productively working whether they be farmers laborers or proprietor-mechanics—closely aligned occupations in the worldview of Midwestern producer populists. As Henry Ford said of his profession: “Machinist and engineer—farmer first.”

Experts with machines and metal Midwestern mechanics gave their producerism a characteristic technological spin. Advances in technology they argued served as the motor of increasing prosperity. Through technological progress productive workers would expand the nation’s wealth in turn furnishing them with increasing time and means for self-cultivation. Because it emerged from collaborative work technology was a collective good. The technical innovations of the era—electricity gasoline engines automobiles—did not belong to the privileged few but rightfully should be available to enhance the lives of the producing classes.

This kind of producer populism permeated Detroit politics. Hazen Pingree Detroit mayor in the 1890s exemplified a certain type of Midwestern manufacturer—his shoemaking business employed seven hundred workers—whose relative wealth did not prevent him from fiercely contesting financial elites and the powerful corporations they dominated. This pitted Pingree not only against price-gouging railroads. Pingree also alienated the elites of Detroit by bringing the local gas and power utilities into public ownership. The goal was to offer “cheap gas for the masses” and to “take electric lighting out of the luxuries of life only to be used by the wealthy and place it within reach of the humblest citizen.” When confronted with the charge that he was dragging politics into the market sphere Pingree countered pithily: “Corporations are in politics.”

At the time Henry Ford was chief engineer of the city’s largest electricity provider Detroit Edison so he was surely well familiar with the political fights over urban utilities. Was it a coincidence that Ford applied for the position of chief engineer at Pingree’s newly inaugurated municipally owned City Electric Lighting Plant? We cannot know; Ford did not get the job. But it is evident that his milieu—the city’s tinkerers machine builders and skilled mechanics who soon piled into the fledgling auto industry—were steeped in the kind of populist sentiment expressed by Pingree. Soon Detroit’s early carmakers—with Henry Ford in the vanguard—decided to abandon the narrow market of elite purchasers and make in Ransom Olds’s words “the automobile the child of luxury instead the child of necessity.”

Such sentiments put the mechanics who had the know-how at odds with the local elite who had the capital. The copper magnates stove manufacturers and city bankers who formed the Michigan upper crust were very keen on nurturing an automobile industry. They hoped to rival the Northeast with its pricey handcrafted luxury vehicles. While Olds and Ford sought out investors so they could build sturdy runabouts the local elites hoped to fund outfits that would flatter their own sense of social standing. Displaying a penchant for what one automotive historian has cleverly called “conspicuous production” the urban elites of Michigan pressured the mechanics they financed to build status symbols not utility vehicles. They hoped for in the words of Detroit patrician Henry Joy “a gentlemen’s car built by gentlemen.” Ransom Olds was soon fired by his investors. Henry Ford’s early ventures too failed amid conflicts between the tinkerer and his backers. After Ford quit the investors recapitalized the Henry Ford Company and changed its name in honor of Detroit’s founder to Cadillac.

“Experts with machines and metal Midwestern mechanics gave their producerism a characteristic technological spin. Advances in technology they argued served as the motor of increasing prosperity.”

With access to local capital now blocked Ford had to pull together a “rag-tag band of investors”—a group of middling merchants and wheeler-dealers who were willing to back his next venture. The significance of this new outfit the Ford Motor Company was this: it was the single Detroit startup that managed to survive on a shaky initial capitalization and generate enough profits to perpetually refinance itself. Ford therefore gained independence from the city’s elites which allowed him to realize the vision of populist motorization that other builders like Olds had tried but failed to push against the will of their investors. For more than fifty years the Ford Motor Company remained closely held and free of bonded debt. The company only went public in 1956 almost a decade after Henry Ford’s death.

Given the class politics and populist groundswell of the Midwest imagining a car for commoners was more than a business proposition. It was a social provocation whose bite only sharpened with the Ford Motor Company’s increasing success. Ford exploited the social distance that separated the thin economic elite from the farmers and manufacturers populating the Midwest. In private as his associates recalled Ford scoffed at the notion that the automobile should be reserved for “the moneyed people.” Instead he insisted “the workingman should have some pleasure out of it.” In public the Ford Motor Company cultivated the image of a manufacturer engaged in feisty opposition to corporations and the wealthy. When the Model T was introduced in October 1908 an ad announced: “This car sounds the death knell of high prices and big profits.” In 1913 another ad quipped: “If there were no Fords automobiling would be like yachting—the sport of rich men.”

These clashes suggest that we should be careful to ascribe automotive mass production to intrinsic economic necessity or technological imperative. Building luxury vehicles as the elites wanted could be solid business. In 1905 for example Henry Joy’s Packard sold 503 vehicles profitably. Northeastern carmakers would continue to build high-priced models well into the 1920s. Neither modernization nor capital accumulation compelled the rise of automotive mass production; it took deep-rooted producerist commitments and the sting of mutual class resentments to launch the mass production era. By 1913 riding the success of the Model T the industrial district of southeastern Michigan commanded 80 percent of American automotive production.

Gas leak that likely originated at Ford plant prompts evacuation recommendations in Michigan: Officials

A gas leak that likely originated at a Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Michigan has prompted health officials to recommend that residents evacuate as the fumes from the fuel drift to nearby neighborhoods.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Wayne County Health Department have urged people living east of Interstate 75 in Flat Rock Michigan about 30 miles southwest of Detroit to leave their homes until further notice due to the possible presence of hazardous fumes from the fuel spill according to a joint news release from the agencies.

The chemical of concern is the carcinogen benzene a flammable and colorless liquid used to make other chemicals and can be hazardous to humans according to the Michigan state health agency. Benzene is typically found in gasoline crude oil and tobacco smoke.

Breathing in large amounts of Benzene which has a sweet odor can cause sleepiness dizziness headaches vomiting or rapid heart rate. Long and short-term exposure can increase the risk of cancer cause blood problems and harm the immune system state health officials said.

More than 6 parts per billion of Benzene has been measured in sanitary sewers and some homes but not every home officials said.

""We don’t believe there is any imminent danger to residents at this time"" Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Elizabeth Hertel told reporters at a news conference Sunday. ""However we are acting out of an abundance of caution at this time.""

On Friday the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy identified the Ford Motor Company assembly plant at Flat Rock as the fuel source of benzene found in Detroit sewers.

Initial estimates indicate that between 1000 and 3000 gallons of fuel leaked from the plant said Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy spokeswoman Jill Greenberg the Detroit Free Press reported. Firefighting foam is being used to suppress the vapors.

A representative for Ford did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

It is unclear when the leak occurred but Ford discovered ""what originally looked like a small leak in a pipe that carries gasoline used to fuel vehicles built at the plant"" on Wednesday afternoon Bob Holycross vice president of sustainability environment and safety engineering for Ford said in a statement Friday.

""We shut down the fuel pipe called in experts to remove gas from a containment tank and the primary storage tank and notified officials of what we found"" Holycross said. ""We believed then that the leak was contained to our property.""

Personnel are ""urgently"" working to address the fuel spill at the plant which was closed over the Labor Day weekend Holycross said apologizing for the leak.

Although the evacuations are contained to a specific region a larger area is expected to have been impacted by the gas leak health officials said.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency last week in response to the spill.

""My top priority is ensuring that every resource is available to the city of Flat Rock Wayne County and Monroe County to determine where the odor originated so that we can clean up the affected area and prevent further harm"" Whitmer said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2ZvcmQtcGxhbnQtYmVuemVuZS12YXBvcnMtbWljaGlnYW4tc3VidXJiLWV2YWN1YXRpb27SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9mb3JkLXBsYW50LWJlbnplbmUtdmFwb3JzLW1pY2hpZ2FuLXN1YnVyYi1ldmFjdWF0aW9uLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford plant determined as cause of benzene vapors that caused Michigan suburb evacuation,"Michigan state and Ford company officials have determined a Ford plant as the source of benzene vapor in sewers that forced almost a dozen homes and a school in a Detroit suburb to evacuate.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS9mb3JkLWxhdW5jaGVzLW5ldy1wdW1hLWRlc2lnbi10cmltLWxldmVscy13aXRob3V0LWFkYXMtZHVlLXRvLXRoZS1zZW1pLWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1zaG9ydGFnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Launches New Puma Trims With Fewer Safety And Tech Features Due To Chip Shortages,"UK buyers that want to reduce waiting time on their new Ford Puma will miss out on some safety systems

The Ford Puma is one of the most popular subcompact SUVs in Europe offering quirky styling great handling and all of the tech-related features you would expect from a modern car. However UK buyers of the new Puma Design trim levels are going to miss out on several of those features as Ford is trying to meet demand amidst the global semi-conductor shortage.

As reported by Autocar and confirmed by our own visit to the official website of Ford UK the company has added the base-spec Titanium Design and ST-Line Design trim levels of the Puma sold alongside the existing Titanium ST-Line ST-Line X and Vignale X variants. The cheaper models use fewer semiconductor chips which results in them coming with fewer standard features.

What Exactly Is Missing?

More specifically starting from £20745 ($28661) in the UK the Puma Titanium Design costs £1550 ($2141) less than the regular Puma Titanium. In return the standard equipment doesn’t include the following features: Auto High Beam Navigation Ford SYNC 3 (it has 2.5 instead) Electronic Air Temperature Control Rear Parking Sensors Lane Keeping Aid Lane Departure Warning Pre-Collision Assist with Autonomous Emergency Braking Pedestrian/Cyclist Detection and Post-Collision Braking.

Apart from the basic Hill-Start Assist auto headlights and auto wipers this pretty much sums up all of the ADAS systems that came available with the Puma in the first place. As a result the Design variants won’t be eligible for the Puma’s five-star EuroNCAP rating achieved in 2019 as the tests are heavily relying on the standard safety equipment.

Similar features are missing from the Puma ST-Line Design starting from £22345 ($30853) which is £900 ($1243) less than the equivalent ST-Line although this one keeps the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and the SYNC 3 infotainment. Ford followed the same strategy with their EcoSport B-SUV that is also available in a cheaper ST-Line Design trim.

The good thing is that buyers that are willing to live without the aforementioned features will be able to get their car after a short waiting time of one or two months compared to a longer period if they are determined to get a full-spec trim level.

A spokesperson from Ford UK told the British magazine: “The global semiconductor chip shortage has affected almost all vehicle manufacturers around the world including Ford In order to meet the needs of our customers for Puma and EcoSport Ford is realigning the content of a small volume of vehicles to mitigate the impact of the chip shortage.”

The mandatory AEB and Lane Departure Warning equipment will apply from May 2022 but only for the new type approvals which means that if the semi conductor shortage continues Ford will be allowed to keep selling the type-approved Design trim levels until May 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9oZW5uZXNzZXlzLXN1cGVyY2hhcmdlZC04MDgtaHAtZm9yZC1tdXN0YW5nLWd0LXNvdW5kcy1udXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hennessey's Supercharged 808-HP Ford Mustang GT Sounds Nuts,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9oZW5uZXNzZXlzLXN1cGVyY2hhcmdlZC04MDgtaHAtZm9yZC1tdXN0YW5nLWd0LXNvdW5kcy1udXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

After Joko (Manuel Chua) abandoned his task of killing Tupe he confessed to the doctor that Peterson was the one who planned to kill him and is also the reason for the death of Tupe’s father. Joko also explained that Peterson asked him to scare Tupe away from Rita.

Bothered by his conscience Joko offered to testify against Peterson. But when Tupe demanded that he name the other accomplices Joko could not bring himself to do it saying the others are not yet ready to admit to their involvement. Little do they know that Lab (Boom Labrusca) has a piece of important evidence with him – a recording of the conversation between Joko and Peterson the day after they killed Tupe’s father.

Tupe lost no time in filing a case against Peterson and proceeded to tell everything to Rita. Rita was overcome with anger because she did not see how she was manipulated all these years by her own husband.

Will Tupe and Rita be able to make Peterson pay for all of his crimes? Will Lab or Kiko (Gab Lagman) have the courage to side with Rita and Tupe?

Normally an interview with a college football legend during a college football pregame show wouldn’t be news. But not when that player is current Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker and the person doing the interview is Fox Sports’ Clay Travis who has made a career out of criticizing others for mixing sports with politics.

Walker a staunch ally of former president Donald Trump is running to unseat Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock in 2022.

Travis’ segment which aired on both “Fox & Friends Weekend” and Fox’s “Big Noon Kickoff” was soundly criticized with most of the complaints calling out Travis for having his own double standard.

“I’m old enough to remember when Clay Travis told ESPN not to mix politics and sports. Wait….so you’re telling me Clay is nothing more than a blowhard MAGA hypocrite? huh….who would have thought” one Twitter user wrote.

Added another one: “Fox News merging with Fox Sports was probably inevitable and in retrospect every year that hadn’t happened we were on borrowed time.”

Travis has spend years criticizing rival ESPN for wading too much into politics and taking up so-called liberal causes. Travis’ conservative-slanted sports media company Outkick was bought by Fox Corp earlier this year.

Outkick positions itself as the conservative answer to ESPN which Travis has frequently described as being too liberal (despite no evidence to support that claim). Travis frequently goes after left-leaning athletes and politicians and has been heavily criticized for consistently underplaying the COVID-19 pandemic.

Murdoch who also co-chairs publisher News Corp will return to his desk at the Fox head office in New York from Tuesday the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch was spotted at Sydney Airport on Saturday afternoon ahead of the flight to the US.

It marks six months since Murdoch left the headquarters and moved with his wife Sarah and their three children Kalan 17 Aidan 15 and Aerin 11 to Australia in March arriving on another private jet.

His family will remain behind at their sprawling $50million Bellevue Hill estate Le Manoir in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

Murdoch will return to the office along with 9000 employees who have been working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic.

It will also be the day before Murdoch turns 50 on September 8.

Murdoch made the decision to move to Australia amid claims that Joe Biden's election made things 'rough' for his family given Fox Corp's reputation as catering to the GOP.

Things 'got pretty rough' for their children at school in their final weeks in Los Angeles SMH reported at the time.

During his brief stay in Australia Murdoch is believed to have snapped up a $37million boat shed at Point Piper.

The two-storey boat shed is a stone's throw from former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's home and was once the private playground of the wealthy O'Neil family.

It was sold on to Paul Scharrer Scotts Honda Motors former owner and a local property investor in 2017 before it sold for the eye-watering price of $37million in March.

The Wunulla Road property on Sydney Harbour is certainly Australia's most expensive boat shed.

""The interest amounting to Rs 148.75 crore due from Vodafone Idea Ltd on September 3 2021 for the security...(Non-convertible debenture /NCD) held in the segregated portfolio of five schemes has been received"" a Franklin Templeton MF spokesperson said.

Of the six debt schemes of the fund house which were wound up in April 2020 five schemes Franklin India Low Duration Franklin India Short Term Income Plan Franklin India Credit Risk Fund Franklin India Dynamic Accrual and Franklin India Income Opportunities funds had made investment in the telco.

The fund house created side pockets in the five schemes holding bonds issued by Vodafone Idea in January last year before the winding up and various securities issued by the telecom player in the schemes were segregated from the total portfolio.

The decision was taken after the Supreme Court rejected the telecom player's review plea related to over Rs 40000 crore adjusted gross revenue (AGR)-related dues to the government.

Creation of segregated portfolios is a mechanism to separate distressed illiquid and hard-to-value assets from other more liquid assets in a portfolio.

The interest amount received from the telecom player will be distributed to unitholders of the segregated portfolio.

""This payment will be made by extinguishing 8.77 per cent of the outstanding units of each unitholder in the segregated portfolio. The proportion of units to be extinguished has been derived by assuming a total repayment of Rs 1695.84 crore (principal + interest) from the issuer"" the spokesperson said.

Investors in side pocketed units are repaid money as and when it is recovered from debt issuers.

""For units held in physical/ statement of account mode 8.77 per cent of the outstanding unitholding as on September 3 2021 will be extinguished towards payment and will be distributed to unitholders by September 8 2021"" he said.

For units held in demat mode the proportionate amount will be distributed by September 15 2021 he added.

Earlier Franklin Templeton MF had said that SBI Funds Management (SBI MF) will distribute the sixth tranche of over Rs 2918 crore to unitholders of its six shuttered schemes from September 1.

Post the payout the total disbursement will reach to Rs 23999 crore amounting to 95.18 per cent of assets under management (AUM) as on April 23 2020 when the schemes were closed down.

Under the first disbursement in February investors received Rs 9122 crore while Rs 2962 crore was paid to investors in April Rs 2489 crore in May Rs 3205 crore in June and Rs 3303 crore in July.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsdGNvaW5idXp6LmlvL2NyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5LW5ld3MvdG9wLWNyeXB0by1uZXdzLTA5LTAzLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Crypto News: 09/03 - Cryptocurrency News,"After making a daily low of $48480 Bitcoin is now trading at $50307. Meanwhile the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum is trading close to $3929.

Let’s find out some interesting crypto news for the day.

World’s largest independent asset managers Franklin Templeton is planning to hire crypto trading and research professionals. As per the latest job posting by the American asset manager the team is looking for two medium-senior level experts to lead these roles.

The latest job post stated that the crypto research analyst will be responsible for designing and managing valuation models. The person should also take care of emerging business opportunities and keep portfolio managers and senior executives informed on this. The analyst will be expected to help Franklin Templeton grow and manage new products in the crypto industry.

For the trader position the team is looking for an expert who can timely execute Franklin Templeton’s crypto trades portfolio rebalancing and support reconciliation and settlement.

Atari Chain has announced that it will use Fantom’s DeFi platforms to trade stake and play games with ATRI tokens. As per the tweet this integration will solve the Ethereum blockchain’s challenges. These challenge include the processing of transactions more efficiently as compared to Ethereum. Users can trade ATRI tokens in under a second on Fantom.

In addition Fantom’s super-low transaction fees allow users to swap even a single ATRI token without worrying about transaction costs. Atari is one of the first and biggest video game creators in the world. Consequently this will help the Atari token and its dApps to improve their performance and costs.

PAID Network has declared it will launch more gaming projects on the Ignition and Apollo-X platforms. The team emphasized gaming as a key element to boost the adoption of blockchain technology. Hence the project has plans to become leaders of the metaverse.

PAID Network’s famous launchpads Ignition and Apollo-X create opportunities for users to participate in exciting future decentralized projects. To jumpstart this new approach the team has recently launched Star Atlas on Apollo-X. Star Atlas is a grand strategy game of space exploration political domination and more. Additionally the team also has plans to partner with strong regional trading platforms for providing easy localized access to the $PAID token.

Zilliqa has announced the launch of its first smart contract wallet on its blockchain. As per the tweet the team has launched DIDxWallet with did.tyron technology. With this technology if the account gets compromised the user can lock their digital identity and recover it through social recoverers.

In addition DIDxWallet helps to transfer tokens swap/trade tokens provide liquidity on Zilswap and allow users to take part in staking $ZIL without any intermediaries. Interestingly did.tyron smart contract technology allows users to set a decentralized digital identity which is equipped with DIDxWallet.

In the last bit of crypto news for today we have Unbound Finance integrating with Harmony blockchain to accelerate inter-blockchain operability and profitability. Moreover Unbound Finance is a non-custodial protocol that aims to unlock liquidity. With this integration network users can borrow UND by collateralizing liquidity across AMMs on the Harmony blockchain without compromising on the incentives gained from those funds.

Further this would empower UND to be used across Harmony-based DEXes such as Mochiswap Openswap ViperSwap and SushiSwap. In addition this would help users to earn extra without affecting their investments in liquidity pools. In turn users can also utilize the liquidity pool tokens as collateral to accumulate UND stablecoins on Unbound.

Franklin Templeton is negotiating with Vodafone Idea over an interest rate reset clause in the Vodafone paper a person aware of the matter said requesting anonymity. The asset manager has an exposure of around ₹1250 crore to the telecom firm.

The debt has a provision for ‘interest rate reset’ on September 3. However in a notice to unitholders on August 16 Franklin Templeton dropped the reference to the put and call portion citing implementation of a change effected by valuation agencies under the guidance of the Association of Mutual Funds in India’s valuation committee. It is unclear whether Franklin Templeton will be able to force Vodafone Idea to exercise the put option if the company cannot pay the interest rate.

Text messages to a Franklin Templeton spokesperson seeking clarity were not answered at the time of going to press.

The Vodafone Idea exposure is present across the six debt schemes that were wound up in April 2020. However it was side-pocketed (placed in a separate portfolio) in January 2020 by Franklin Templeton before the winding up of these schemes. Investors in side-pocketed units cannot enter and exit at will. They are repaid money as and when it is recovered from debt issuers.

This week Franklin Templeton began payment of a fresh tranche of ₹2918.5 crore to unitholders in the six schemes under winding-up. With this the schemes will have cumulatively returned ₹23998.84 crore or 96.18% of the net asset value of the six schemes that were wound up on April 23 2020. The winding-up of the schemes is being implemented by SBI Funds Management Pvt.

Top Features Tough build Bright display Long battery life

Smartwatch brand

recently brought the Forerunner 55 smartwatch in the market at Rs 20990. It is the successor to the Forerunner 45 and has been specifically targeted at runners. The watch comes in three colour variants: Black Aqua and Monterra Grey. We got a hold of the Black variant and here is our review of the smartwatch.

: Design

The Forerunner 55 comes in a classic round dial and the design is mostly simple to look at with a bright watch face in the centre even without switching on the in-display light. There are a total of five buttons on the watch three on the left and two on the right side of the dial. The left side buttons are for the light and scrolling up and down while the right side has a ‘Start/Stop’ and ‘Back’ buttons. The wrist straps fit comfortably and can be made to really grip the skin tightly if you want. The smartwatch weighs around 37gm and feels light on the wrists.

A charging cable comes with the smartwatch and we must say that the connection is very strong. You will have no worries about the smartwatch detaching from the cable at all even if you swing the cable with the watch attached to it like a pendulum.

Garmin Forerunner 55: Display

Garmin Forerunner 55 comes with a 1.04-inch round display with a screen resolution of 208 x 208 pixels. The display is scratch-proof though it does register smudges.

If you want to illuminate the display there is a small button on the top left edge for that very purpose. Press it once and the display will be bathed in a faint glow; the lighting does not look that bright but surprisingly helps you see in any type of weather condition be it cloudy or sunny.

Garmin Forerunner 55: Performance

We used to watch to record physical activities regularly and can say that Garmin Forerunner 55 is meant for recording your workout in a no-fuss way by just relying on two or three button presses. Before beginning with the workout press the Start/Stop button. It will open up the list of activities you can access; the most common type of physical exercises will be listed there from which you find the one you are going to do. You can add more types of workouts by selecting the ‘Add” option.

Run Yoga Treadmill Bike Walk Cardio etc. are the usual workout options that you will see upon opening the workouts menu. Indoor track Virtual run Bike Indoor Walk Indoor Pool Swim are some of the other workouts that can be added by selecting the ‘Add’ option.

The rule is straightforward. Use the Up and Down buttons to navigate through the options and use Start/Stop button to choose that setting or workout. We must remind you that all the functions on the smartwatch can be accessed only with the help of the buttons; it is not a touchscreen watch and you cannot swipe up or down the display and hope a menu slides up.

I used the smartwatch mostly for outdoor running and Yoga sessions. The grip is not too tight on the wrists and the smartwatch strap comes with holes to help the sweat dry off and prevent chafing which the watch managed to do quite well. The watch looked for the GPS signal before I was about to start with the run and located it within half a minute.

You can pause the workout in between and start recording it again with the help of the record and stop symbols that appear in the middle of the screen. They are big enough and hence actually help you pause stop and record with minimum hassle when you are in the middle of running or other workouts like Yoga and calisthenics.

The smartwatch allows you to set running goals and also gives you an idea about the number of hours your body is going to take to recover from a long run depending upon how much distance you have covered. Daily running suggestions will also be there on the display before you start with another running session.

While the smartwatch manages to record the activities fairly well it is not able to sense when the workout has ended and you have to manually press the necessary buttons to stop the workout. Garmin should look into this. The smartwatch should be able to sense when the wearer has stopped doing the workout.

The smartwatch took about 20 minutes to charge to 30% via a laptop. One might call it to be a tad slow. A full charge takes about an hour but the longevity of the battery is there. With one full charge the watch can go on for about 7-10 days if you use it to record daily workouts of 90-100 minutes.

Long pressing the Up button brings up a list of additional activities like Watch Face Alarm Clock History and other settings like Wrist Heart Rate User Profile Activity Tracking etc. Use the Garmin Connect app to keep track of your workouts.

Garmin Forerunner 55: Verdict

This is a Garmin product and comes with all the seriousness needed for fitness enthusiasts especially runners. It has got a sturdy lightweight design is comfortable to wear and has long battery life. It also comes with an adequately bright display. You should make use of Garmin Coach for a better training experience with the product. The design may not appeal to some users because of its plainness but as for the functionality the watch performed well in our tests. All in all this is a dependable smartwatch from the house of Garmin which you cannot go wrong with.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dHNpZGVvbmxpbmUuY29tL291dGRvb3ItZ2Vhci9ydW4vdWx0cmFkaXN0YW5jZS1yYWNlLWdlYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Our Gear Guy Used to Run 50 Miles,"Heading out the door? Read this article on the Outside app available now on iOS devices for members! Download the app .

One of the reasons I love ultra-distance objectives is the preparation it takes to get everything right. Accounting for all of the things that could go sideways on race day—from blisters to chafing to an upset stomach—and finding ways to avoid those mistakes adds a layer of challenge to running that I find addicting.

I ran a 50-mile race in the following kit last month and despite 90- to 100-degree heat I had the best race of my life (I’ve had plenty of bad ones). It was by no means fast or heroic but it was surprisingly comfortable and fun in no small part due to having a totally dialed gear and food system. Every choice was the result of at least dozens—and in some cases hundreds—of miles of testing and tinkering. For once everything delivered on race day.

Ultraspire Momentum 2.0 Race Vest ($90)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

This is the most breathable and ergonomic race vest I have ever tested. The lightweight mesh build disappeared on my chest and the positioning of the two 550-milliliter water bottles on the backs of my hips made refilling and consuming water easy. The Momentum 2.0 also swallowed gear. It held 14 gels (I used two drop spots at aid stations to refill) half a pound of gummy bears half a box of Fig Newmans TP and a plastic transport bag my iPhone and an extra water bottle.

Reigning Champ X Ryan Willms Shirt ($125) and Lined Running Short ($145)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

You don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars on running clothing to start or thrive in the sport. Many runners who crushed my finish time wore less expensive kits. I ran in and heavily endorse these two items because they are the most comfortable running pair I have ever used. The supremely stretchy Italian nylon top was remarkably supple and did not chafe me over dozens of miles of testing and racing. The shorts were equally comfortable and their liner kept my thighs from chafing. Both breathed exceptionally well in the intense heat.

Runderwear Men’s Running Briefs ($25)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

I appreciated the extra layer of support that these briefs delivered. The high level of support does not come at the expense of any comfort or breathability despite it being a second liner in a high-friction area. After over 500 miles in this specific pair I have nothing but positive things to say about these.

Spring Energy Gels (from $8 for two)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

I have a finicky stomach and a horrible track record with gastric distress at ultra races but I consumed 23 Spring Energy Gels during this race and did not get sick—or sick of them. I ate something every 30 minutes throughout my run and while I threw in a pack of gummy bears and some Fig Newman’s the majority of my fuel consisted of these. I enjoyed eating them so much that I consumed one while I was in sight of the finish line. The real foods (like fruit salt and rice) that Spring Energy uses in each pack agreed with my stomach unlike anything else I have tried in nearly a decade of endurance racing.

Black Forest Gummy Bears ($4)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

This giant bag of gummy bears was on sale at my local Rite Aid and I ate them in training and on race day to diversify my calories. They are delicious and make me happy every time I eat them. I kept them in a special “happy pocket” and used them like dog treats to incentivize myself to keep moving.

Fig Newman’s Strawberry ($4)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

I wanted something that was neither gummy or gooey to chew on. Fig Newman’s aren’t cloyingly sweet are easy to digest and are easy to transport.

Ultimate Direction Clutch Handheld Bottle ($40)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

I left an Ultimate Direction EDC bottle in a drop bag at an aid station at 31.6 miles to make sure I wasn’t rationing water when it was close to 100 degrees. I refilled my other two bottles and carried this while I soldiered on. This model is discontinued but I recently tested the very similar UD Clutch and loved it.

Hoka Clifton 8 Running Shoes ($130)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

The Clifton 8 is a road shoe but I can get away with a light cushy pair in a serious race in southern Oregon because our trails are remarkably well built and maintained. I used them for training and race day and I felt completely confident in the support they gave me. They remained fantastically comfortable throughout and I never so much as rolled an ankle in hundreds of miles in them.

Swiftwick Yosemite National Park Socks ($20)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

I’ve tested over 100 pairs of athletic socks during my time working as Outside’s Gear Guy. I have extremely strong opinions about fit moisture wicking blister mitigation and durability. The best socks for blister prevention over long distances are Swiftwicks. I chose to race in this specific pair because the six-inch cuff helped keep rocks out of my socks and the Yosemite print added a little flair to my kit.

Body Glide Balm ($10)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

I used the same stick of Body Glide for this race that I have been using since 2013. I bought it nearly a decade ago wrote about its insane staying power over two years ago and then used the same stick to apply massive amounts of lubricant to my nipples and undercarriage for this race. One application was all I needed to feel zero chafe for over 13 hours of running.

Coal Provo UPF 5-Panel Hat ($32)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

The polyester shell of this stylish UPF 50-plus hat is lightweight and breathable. That coupled with a stretchy elastic and toggle-tightening system make this my most comfortable running hat.

Garmin Forerunner 745 Watch ($500)

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

I am currently testing the Forerunner 945 and I love it but I’ve worn the 745 for hundreds of miles and trust it. The latter is small comfortable on my wrist and extremely easy to use. I set it to a low-power mode and was able to track my mileage pace and heart rate throughout the entire race. It also helped me stay on my schedule of eating every 30 minutes.



Bandana

(Photo: Sarah Jackson)

A buddy gave me this generic cotton bandana and it was my secret weapon for remaining cool in the triple-digit heat. Volunteers filled it with ice at three different aid stations and I wrapped it around my neck so that the ice dribbled down my back while I ran.

This is the one piece of gear that I brought with me that I did not have to use. Taking a field poop following LNT practices and packing out the TP to an aid station trash can is non-negotiable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpa2VyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy90cmFpbmluZy9nYWRnZXRzL3NtYXJ0d2F0Y2hlcy9wb2xhci12YW50YWdlLXYyLXJldmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Polar Vantage V2 review,"Polar’s Vantage V2 smartwatch is packed with features to improve your cycling performance. Yet this is really a multisport watch so a fair few features might not be applicable (the swim metrics for example).

There is however much to impress for the data-crunching cyclist. Let’s start with what you don’t tap into with the ‘basic’ package and that’s Recovery Pro.

It’s a self-assessment of state-to-train based on HR variability data but requires a Polar chest strap (extra £40). The more you use it the more accurate it is and it’s a pretty reliable indication of whether you should hit the hills or stick to a flat commute.

There’s plenty that comes as standard including a range of fitness tests.: leg recovery (a jump test) measures fatigue; the orthostatic test does similar.; but the most useful is the cycling test which measures your Functional Threshold Power (FTP) output from which you can calculate customised training zones on the Polar Flow app (you’ll need a Bluetooth power meter for this because the V2 doesn’t connect via ANT+).

The results also feed back your max HR – useful to set zones – and an estimation of your VO2 max. Throw in your power-to-weight ratio and this test is a comprehensive feature.

As is Fuel Wise which tells you when and how much to drink and eat. This can be automatically done by the V2 assessing previous sessions or set manually reminding you to consume your carb of choice via a buzzing sound.

Reminder frequency depends on ride intensity – its optical HR sensor is as good as any I had on test – and it’ll even tell you not to fuel with carbs if the session length doesn’t demand it.

The Polar Vantage V2 also possesses navigational capabilities via a link-up with Komoot. The problem is despite the vivid Gorilla Glass lens visual guidance is rudimentary.

Strava fans will be pleased to see this watch integrates Live Segments plus you can control your phone’s playlist from the V2.

Touchscreen tactility with gloves isn’t bad though generally you can negotiate your rides using the robust buttons only.

Battery life came in at 38 hours in full GPS mode (40 hours claimed) while GPS pick-up retention and accuracy are impressive. There’s a ‘Serene breathing’ feature and a sleep feature to gauge the quality of your shut-eye too.

Smartwatches for cyclists Are smartwatches truly essential for cyclists when an all-singing bike computer such as a Garmin Edge 1030 will give you all the two-wheeled features you’ll ever need… and probably some that you don’t? A smartwatch can do a lot though: provide 24/7 data; comprehensive cycling stats; sleep pattern recovery status and physical fitness analysis; and some can even tell you how well you’re acclimatising to altitude and give real-time advice on when to fuel your rides. Combined with data from any other sports you’ll have a holistic view of your training and can create training plans and analyse your routes/rides in detail. There is a lot to choose from though and some of these features you simply won’t need so beyond our test of six popular options make sure you do your own research too. We've also got a guide to choosing the best cycling watch with our top-rated options. Also on test Coros Pace 2

Gregory known as “Daddy D” by the countless firefighters he mentored was the father of current TVFD Fire Chief Paul Gregory and former Tarkington firefighter Dalton Gregory. He served as fire chief for Tarkington VFD during three different stints and for a while was the department’s longest-serving fire chief a record surpassed only by his son.

Alan Gartner fire chief for Woodville Fire Department was among Gregory’s pallbearers. Gartner first met Daddy D 35 years ago when Gartner was a young man learning the ropes of fire service at the Livingston Fire School.

Firefighters load the casket of Dalton Laffie Gregory former Tarkington VFD chief into the back of a fire truck for the short trip to a cemetery in Cleveland.

“He taught me a lot about fire service. Back then with him it was either be tough or get out of the way. He told us what we were supposed to do and if we didn’t do it the right way then he might send us down the road” Gartner said. “He was a good man who will be greatly missed.”

Gregory was well known for his tough demeanor but he also showed great kindness to the people he loved and those who had earned his respect according to TVFD Asst. Chief Ben Burnett.

“My father passed away early and Daddy D became a mentor for me. We became very close over the years. I met him when I joined the fire department in 2017. He was a big ol’ grouch but we had a great friendship” Burnett said. “He was a man who appreciated straight talk. There is no doubt about that. If he liked you you knew it but if he didn’t like you you knew that too.”

Gregory’s funeral was held at Rural Shade Baptist Church with interment afterward at Pace-Stancil Memorial Rest Gardens in Cleveland. His casket was carried atop an antique fire truck to the cemetery with numerous fire apparatus serving as escorts along the way.

Thursday was to be a celebration of Horizon Forbidden West and the amazing team at Guerrilla working to deliver it on February 18 2022. However it’s abundantly clear that the offerings we confirmed in our pre-order kickoff missed the mark. Last year we made a commitment to deliver free upgrades for our cross-gen launch titles which included Horizon Forbidden West. While the pandemic’s profound impact pushed Forbidden West out of the launch window we initially envisioned we will stand by our offer: Players who purchase Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 4 will be able to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version for free. I also want to confirm today that moving forward PlayStation first-party exclusive cross-gen titles (newly releasing on PS4 & PS5)–both digital and physical*–will offer a $10 USD digital upgrade option from PS4 to PS5. This will apply to the next God of War and Gran Turismo 7 and any other exclusive cross-gen PS4 & PS5 title published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. — Jim Ryan President & CEO Sony Interactive Entertainment



*To upgrade an eligible PS4 game on disc to the digital PS5 version you will need a PS5 console with a disc drive. PS4 game discs can’t be used with the PlayStation®5 Digital Edition.

Horizon Forbidden West is coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles on February 18 2022! We were ecstatic to finally be able to share the release date with you last week during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live and to see everyone’s reactions to our news.

Pre-orders for the game are available now across the globe so we wanted to share more details about the various editions that you can get your hands on.

The procurement and supply chain management industries are no exception but next-generation technology provides trends worth watching.

With time the supply chain has shifted from the back-office function it once was to a strategic driver of business growth. Contemporary business models technological advancements and innovative processes have made supply chains efficient and agile.

Supply chains will become more complex and internationally dispersed. Procurement leaders need to build on newer capabilities to help them navigate the changing business landscape and adapt quickly.

At this rate what will supply chains look like in the year 2030? Big data cloud computing artificial intelligence (AI) robotic process automation (RPA) and the internet of things (IoT) will help procurement leaders contractors and supply chain managers meet future demand.

While big data in logistics is still in its infancy it’s the foundation on which AI cloud computing and RPA become more accurate and effective in simplifying tasks and relegating them to automated systems. Big data expands the dataset for analysis beyond the traditional internal data in supply chain management systems and software. It also applies statistical processes to new and existing data sources. Now most companies lack the tools and knowledge to explore and utilize big data in their supply chains. In the future these tools will be more accessible.

Cloud Computing and AI

Supply chains generate big data and cloud-based AI turns that data into insights. Cloud computing coupled with AI has transformed how supply chains operate and its abilities will only increase in complexity over the next 10 years. Through predictive analytics cloud and AI systems can use past trends and market indicators to facilitate the following processes:

powering process automation

informing supplier selection

improving customer support

streamlining supplier onboarding and automating supplier management

providing real-time information on shipments

analyzing carrier performance

anticipating trends in operational issues

Progressive companies already utilize supply chain knowledge management systems to respond to supply chain difficulties in real-time. With a cloud-based mobile-enabled solution supervisors input information from the worksite immediately notifying operators.

Companies can build transparent supplier relationships by automating the information exchange between an organization and its suppliers and contractors. Organizations can easily manage their vendors down to each individual worker across geographically dispersed worksites. Workers can complete site-specific orientation and training online before they set foot on site. Operators can track the completion status of the training curriculum and assess knowledge retention through online evaluations.

Analytics can help companies monitor supplier/vendor capabilities and track data on a supplier’s compliance or performance. Traditionally different departments compiled this information through paper records. Decision-makers had to sift through piles of papers or electronic files to find this information. Today advanced analytics allows operators to define supplier attributes to categorize them into logical profile sections. Detailed supplier profiles make it easier for operators to quickly retrieve process and validate supplier information in a matter of seconds.

Once a new supplier is onboarded collecting verifying and storing supplier data will ensure responsible supplier risk management. A high-end analytics engine can analyze this data to generate supplier performance insights in real-time. Such insights empower sourcing professionals to easily monitor the supplier and vendor pool their credentials such as certificates of insurance (COIs) and their compliance status.

Delivering tangible cost savings has always been a critical task for procurement and will continue to be a high priority in the next decade. Considering this procurement leaders will have to look for newer ways to achieve cost efficiency. One way is through supplier analysis. Critical supplier information is often trapped in varying data management systems. Consolidating that data into one common repository helps operators get better visibility into spending across the entire value chain. A centralized data framework complemented by an analytics engine for example can help decision-makers identify expensive or low-performing suppliers. A new central data management system can be seamlessly integrated with the legacy system through application programming interfaces (APIs).

Robotic Process Automation

Robots are expected to see ""strong growth over the next five years particularly within supply chain operations that include lower-value potentially dangerous or high-risk tasks” according to Deloitte. With the massive growth in e-commerce this should not surprise anyone in the logistics world. Robotic technology applications include automated vehicles like drones trucks and trains last-mile deliveries and storage and retrieval systems (ASRS).

The increased usage of autonomous robots can achieve the following objectives:

increase efficiency and productivity

reduce re-work and risk rates

improve employee safety

perform mundane tasks so humans can work more strategic efforts

increase revenue by improving order fulfillment and delivery speed leaving customers satisfied

New pricing structures will enable companies to invest in automation making the leap into robotics much more feasible. Using a RaaS-type model (Robotics as a Service) providers lease units through a monthly service contract instead of customers paying an up-front capital expenditure.

Internet of Things

An emerging trend for supply chain managers is asset tracking through IoT to save time and money and enable data-driven decision-making.

The IoT is made up of interconnected physical devices that can monitor collect and send data to cloud-based software for analysis via Wi-Fi. IoT devices have improved quality management in supply chains through GPS tracking of shipments and monitoring parcel conditions. RFID chips smart devices and mobile sensors can track and authenticate products measure temperature humidity light levels movement handling speed and other environmental factors of shipments.

The growing pace of technological innovation propels digital supply chain management solutions. Thankfully embarking on the technical journey will become more accessible and cost-effective as more technologies emerge. Organizations that rapidly adopt these emerging solutions while incrementally replacing legacy systems will better navigate this decade with greater insight and efficiency.

Kevin Jiang president of China’s e-commerce giant JD.com talks to STYLE about the country’s digitisation of shopping for luxury products and on forging a relationship with LVMH.

While the pandemic has hit the global luxury market hard China is actually seeing rapid growth. In the meantime we also see trends that luxury consumers are becoming younger buying more full-price products and sales are gradually reaching the lower-tier markets. During JD’s “618 Grand Promotion” Gen Z customers buying luxury products increased 231 per cent year-on-year.

The pandemic has revealed just how important e-commerce is to the future of luxury goods. When many stores were forced to close brands have to transform and focus on digital sales – and often relied on more established platforms like JD.com to reach digital customers especially in lower-tier cities and in the absence of international travel and shopping.

This year luxury giant LVMH has inked a series of partnerships with JD for iconic brands including Givenchy Berluti Guerlain Sephora and Zenith with more on the horizon.

What drove LVMH and JD.com to form a partnership?

Luxury brands have very high requirements and pay extremely close attention to the brand image while pursuing the ultimate customer experience. Top luxury brands like LVMH the world’s largest luxury goods conglomerate  focus even more on these aspects. They value their own sales channels such as the brand’s official websites and are cautious about working with third-party platforms. Top brands rarely cooperate with e-commerce companies. With the continuous development of e-commerce luxury brands also see great potential especially in the Chinese market.

JD is keen to better understand brands’ needs and also offer more flexible digital solutions to our brand partners especially the top luxury ones. JD introduced a unique model when Louis Vuitton launched on JD in April 2021. Through the model consumers can type “LV” in the search bar on the JD app and enter LV’s official mini program to enjoy the brand’s exclusive shopping experience.

Will selling luxury watches and high jewellery online be the next big thing?

As millennials and Gen Z consumers are growing to be the major consumer group for luxury products and with the pandemic accelerating the development of e-commerce we’ve seen an increasing online penetration of luxury brands.

In terms of categories in addition to fashionable leather goods and beauty and make-up there will be great potential for the market of watches and jewellery. There will be more lifestyle and cultural trends in the future and brands will be more focused on content marketing and creating interactive experiences with consumers.

High-end watches and luxury jewellery are also benefiting from the general trend in self-gifting. The Chinese consumer used to buy jewellery for the weight of gold; now they’re buying it because it’s a wonderful way to show their personality. As more and more consumers move online to buy luxury products watches and jewellery are indispensable choices as gifts.

In China’s highly digitised society how important are physical stores for luxury retail?

Luxury brands entered China by opening flagship stores in high-end offline department stores and malls in first-tier cities addressing the store image and shopping experience. Digital transformation combined with the new shopping habits of the younger generation and the impact of Covid-19 has seen growing online penetration.

Technology and logistics infrastructure enable online platform JD.com to provide similar luxury shopping experiences as offline through AR/VR and JD Luxury Express for example.

In addition enormous demand from lower-tier markets cannot be met with limited [numbers of] luxury shops in big cities so the trend of online and offline synergy is ready to go ahead.

What’s JD’s focus for the next three to five years?

We look forward to providing e-commerce capabilities for more luxury brands and to provide an even more premium e-commerce experience for shoppers through JD.com’s reliable supply chain and logistics abilities high-quality consumer base innovative business models and technology solutions.

Choosing a smart speaker isn’t just about picking a model with the best sound quality or the color that matches your living room. Smart speakers also have major smart home control properties and can play nicely with some music services streaming TV channels (if you opt for a speaker with a screen) or home security systems.

A smart speaker opens the door for expanding your smart home portal. Since most of us won’t buy a smart home speaker to work with a Ring Video Doorbell and another to manage Apple’s HomeKit via your iPhone you’ll want to choose carefully. For a lot of buyers that comes down to a choice between Apple HomePod or Amazon Echo (and if you’re short on space it might just be HomePod Mini versus Echo Dot).

Recommended Videos

If you’re thinking of grabbing one of these smart speakers read on for a side-by-side of the Apple HomePod and Amazon Echo (4th Gen).

Design

Apple HomePod

Apple’s HomePod seems a bit dated now and the entire package hasn’t been updated since its launch in 2018 making it positively antiquated. After all the Echo evolved from a cylindrical shape into a stylish sphere so the stoutness and bulk of the HomePod stands out by comparison.

Amazon Echo 4th Gen

It’s usually easy to say Apple prioritizes design and end the conversation there but Amazon has been stepping up its game. The new model features a daring new design according to Digital Trends’ smart home editor John Velasco in his 4th Gen Amazon Echo review. He says the new look has him “smitten.” Indeed the new spherical shape in black or white is ultra-modern and can practically disappear into your space. With subtle controls on the top of the speaker you’ve got easy adjustments at your fingertips too.

This round goes to the Echo 4th Gen for its modern appeal.

Sound quality

A smart speaker is only as good as its primary purpose and for most of us that’s the sound.

Before we get to that there’s a serious problem to deal with: If you don’t have an iPhone you’re not going to hear a peep from the HomePod. To operate HomePod you must have an iOS device capable of running at minimum iOS 11.2.5 — no other phone will do. You must have an iPhone 5s or later iPad Mini 2 or later or iPod Touch 6th gen or later. The HomePod is for the Apple faithful and Apple faithful only. Outsiders need not apply.

Apple HomePod

Apple put a lot into making the HomePod sound great and it truly does. Music aficionados will appreciate the smart speaker’s outstanding fidelity punchy tuneful legitimately tight bass and clear vocals. You can find more detail about the audio quality in our Apple HomePod review.

Amazon Echo 4th Gen

The Echo 4th Gen by comparison isn’t as detailed and doesn’t sound quite as good as the HomePod in a side-by-side comparison but who’s doing that aside from tech writers? That said the Echo 4th Gen doesn’t disappoint in overall audio quality and it’s incredibly capable of appeasing audiophiles. If you’re looking for something with even more high fidelity from Amazon the Echo Studio stands up well. Read more about Echo Studio vs. HomePod if you’re considering going that route.

If you do have an iPhone you can do either option. The Amazon Echo by comparison will work with almost any phone tablet or device making it a smart speaker for the masses. This is a close one but Apple does come out slightly ahead in the sound department.

Music Services

If you’re one of the rare few who still keeps a vast audio library on your phone the ability to use streaming music services will be less of a concern for you.

Apple HomePod

Apple Music is the only service that works with voice commands on the HomePod. You can’t ask Siri to play your Spotify or Pandora playlists on the HomePod. You can however use AirPlay to stream Spotify and some other music or video apps via Wi-Fi. Unfortunately the speaker lacks a Bluetooth connection and an auxiliary input jack so you can’t connect non-Apple devices to the speaker.

Amazon Echo 4th Gen

With the Amazon Echo you’re in control and you can connect it to a variety of music streaming services (including Apple Music by the way) while enjoying handsfree control.

This category is a no-brainer: It goes to Amazon Echo 4th Gen for pure ease-of-use.

Controls

Apple HomePod

Apple’s subtle minimalism carries through to the controls on the HomePod; they’re invisible tap and touch modules that you’ll never see unless you need them. If you favor tech gadgets that don’t look obvious you’re all about the HomePod.

Amazon Echo 4th Gen

The Amazon Echo by comparison has actual buttons. If you want to be able to see what you’re doing with the controls it’s the Echo for you.

How you feel about these controls may very well have to do with your home’s design esthetic. Since both devices essentially offer the same controls we’re calling this one a tie.

Price and availability

Apple HomePod

This is where the rubber hits the road for a lot of folks. If you’re a die-hard Apple convert you might not bat an eye at spending $349 (regular price) on this gadget. But that’s if you can find one. Apple is retiring this product.

Amazon Echo 4th Gen

Echo 4th Gen by comparison has a list price of $100 and is ready willing and able to arrive at your home.  and Amazon is more than happy to take your money at any moment in almost any country.

The clear winner in this category is the Amazon Echo 4th Gen because it’s more affordable and easy to find.

The Verdict

Pretty much any way you slice it Amazon Echo 4th Gen is the clear winner here. While either speaker will be a solid addition to your home or office the choice you need to make will depend on which voice assistant Siri or Alexa you prefer and which music streaming service you rely on most. Even so from price to availability sound quality to versatility there are really no downsides to adding the Amazon Echo 4th Gen to your smart home.

VIRGINIA — The 2021 Forbes list of the best employers has been released with specific rankings for Virginia as well as the other 49 states and the District of Columbia.

To determine the rankings market research firm Statista surveyed 80000 Americans working for businesses with at least 500 employees. The respondents were asked to rate their employers on factors like work environment safety compensation opportunities for advancement and openness to telecommuting. Respondents were also asked how likely they would be to recommend their employers to others. Surveys were conducted from October 2020 to June 2021 accounting for some changes companies have made due to the coronavirus pandemic. The best employer in Virginia is Lockheed Martin according to Forbes' list issued recently. Microsoft NASA the Federal Reserve System and Wegmans Food Markets round out the top five in the rankings for Virginia.

Microsoft was ranked the top employer in DC. These are the top employers in Virginia according to Forbes:

Bank of America Home Depot and the U.S. Department of Defense are ranked in 29 states Walmart in 27 FedEx in 26 and UPS in 25. The full rankings are available online.

Although the pandemic hit the health care education and retail industries among the hardest employers in those fields dominated the rankings according to Forbes. They combined to account for 41 percent of the full 2021 list compared with 38 percent when the 2020 list came out. Microsoft for one has moved to adopt a hybrid work model even after the pandemic ends according to Forbes' report. The tech giant founded by Bill Gates had the No. 1 spot in four states on the lists. Costco Wholesale tied with Microsoft in states where it holds the top ranking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS9haXItc2hvdy1hZnctMjAyMS1kYXktMS1zdGF0aWMtZGlzcGxheXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Air Show – AFW 2021 Day 1: Static Displays,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | September 4 2021

The author just visited the AFW (Athens Flying Week) 2021 Tanagra International Air Show. This is a pictorial account of the planes on display.

Air shows saw many cancellations in the pandemic. Even in 2021 we saw the cancellation of the Paris Air Show. At least Sun N’ Fun and Air Venture went ahead in the US. Other events in the next few months in Europe at least could go either way.

So the author and his wife were thrilled to visit the 2021 AFW air show about an hour’s drive north of Athens Greece. It takes place in Tanagra Air Base (LGTG). Usually it has a good mix of both civil and military displays both static and flying.

Alas travel restrictions are still affecting many would-be participants. So this year foreign entrants involved mainly military display teams from friendly countries. But there certainly were some interesting private/civil exceptions!

2021 AFW Air Show – The Participants

This article follows our Saturday AFW 2021 visit and is the first of two articles about the air show. Here you will see the aircraft on static display minus any not available on Saturday. We will later post an article about the flying display adding any static displays only put up on the second day.

Obviously since the 2021 AFW air show takes place in Greece and it’s in an active air base the Hellenic Air Force features quite heavily. All active HAF fighters featured in the show along with trainers and other aircraft. They included the Mirage 2000 F-16 F-4E Phantom (still flying) and trainers like the T-6A Texan II and T-2 Buckeye.

The only missing HAF fighter was the Dassault Rafale. Greece bought a number of these fighters but they only got delivery of the first one this summer. But visitors to the 2021 AFW air show got to see a French Air Force example of the jet. And after people had admired it enough its pilot performed a stunning flight display with it. More on that in the second article!

Other Visitors

Static displays also included a Danish F-16BM (two-seat) aircraft German and Saudi Tornados German Eurofighters (single and two-seat) and more.

Elsewhere at the 2021 AFW air show helicopters of the Hellenic Army and Navy were also on display. Alongside them and the fixed-wing aircraft polite crews were explaining their features to wild-eyed kids – and quite a few adults too.

Other exhibitors at the 2021 AFW air show showcased local aviation industry flight schools and related activities. The aircraft of these flight schools were among the few non-military aircraft in view. Enjoy!

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal Mr. Bruce said the Minneapolis-based maker of Cheerios and Betty Crocker enlisted approximately 200 contract manufacturers prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown in March 2020. As demand for its products ramped up the company signed up an additional 50 new contract manufacturers he said.

The plan Mr. Bruce told the WSJ is for General Mills to cut back on contract manufacturing as quickly as possible as the process costs more and cuts into a product’s gross margin.

“If demand starts to taper off that is the capacity that we will shed first” Mr. Bruce said. “There is a fair amount of flexibility.”

Mr. Bruce told the WSJ that General Mills also has its eye on other costs such as rising commodity prices and other inflation. Industry also has experienced an uptick in costs related to packaging materials energy and transportation in recent months.

He said higher freight costs are “costing us extra” primarily because General Mills doesn’t have fixed rates for the shipments it is receiving from external suppliers.

The company could raise prices to offset the increase in inflation but at this point doesn’t have plans to do so Mr. Bruce said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9ibGFjay1nZW5lcmFsLW1pbGxzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1ncmF0ZWZ1bC1mb3ItaGlzLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaGVscHMtb3RoZXJzLW1ha2UtZ29hbHMvNjAwMDk0MjcwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black General Mills executive grateful for his success helps others make goals,"Donzel Leggett is an accomplished guy with a heart for others.

Leggett 53 vice president of global manufacturing excellence at General Mills is a 25-year veteran who has managed plants packaging and supply chains. He earned graduate degrees in industrial technology and business and was a three-time Academic All-America football player at Purdue University.

The married father of four children who grew up in Key West Fla. considers himself fortunate and called to serve.

""I always knew that God blessed me with academic and athletic ability and parents who [encouraged me] to take advantage of opportunities"" he said. ""My mentality was always to strive to be my best. And I knew I had to use my gifts to do positive things.""

Leggett is chairman of Twin Cities Rise the business-supported North Side-based nonprofit that works mostly with low-income people of color. Many of the participants have been raised in broken families without much support or focus on education or careers. They arrive at the nonprofit — sometimes on probation and sometimes simply trying to improve their chances — seeking self-empowerment training skill development and the mentoring many missed during their formative years.

""I also knew that I could be a role model"" Leggett said. ""To help others who may not have had the gifts the family support and the mentors.""

Leggett the youngest of four children and the first to attend college was raised by a mother who was an office worker and then ran a preschool. His father was a janitor who rose to power-company linemen for Southern Bell over 43 years. His parents have been married 65 years.

""We were not rich"" recalled Leggett who is Black. ""Lower-middle class. My great-grandma was a wet nurse for the children of rich white people. Her daughter my grandmother was a maid. [My parents] instilled in me that 'we struggled to put you in position to take advantage of your gifts.'

""They told me that nobody is better and you're not better than anybody. It's how hard you work.""

There always has been a financial and human connection between Rise and General Mills. Leggett joined Rise's board five years ago after talking to Steve Rothschild a former Mills executive who started the nonprofit in 1993. It's fitting TCR's board is led by an African American.

""Donzel is very active sincere and passionate about the mission to build the organization"" said Rothschild now an emeritus board member. ""And he is a role model. Nothing was given to him. He's made the most of his talent and experience. I admire Donzel.""

And Leggett is not the only Mills alumni at Rise.

Alex Merritt an 18-year Mills supply-chain manager joined this year as vice president of program operations for an outfit that has an expanding footprint as its empowerment and train model is adapted by more organizations.

Merritt was raised in St. Louis by foster parents who adopted her as well as several other children. And she had a supportive grandmother.

Merritt was a good student encouraged by her Normandy High School counselor to study engineering. She won an Emerson Electric scholarship and persevered through the rigorous mechanical-engineering curriculum to graduate from Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Merritt wasn't looking for another job. But she took a pay cut to join Twin Cities Rise.

""My personal passion is giving back and making the world a better place"" she said. ""Here I get to empower people through training and personal empowerment. I get to do all that in one space and know the impact is immediate. And I see the scalability of this.

""There are a lot of people who need what we offer. It's about fanning the flame in the human spirit. A nod from God … a gift that is dormant in most humans. Most don't know it. They get a verdict from parent or teacher or someone and they spend their lives accomplishing that prophecy of failure. We try to [help] one person at a time.""

Ever the engineer she said her job is to ensure the ""secret sauce"" of Rise is captured ""through a repeatable processes and clear metrics that allow us to trend track and deliver outstanding results for participants"" and other stakeholders.

And when a person benefits we all benefit from a healthier community and economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvc2VwLzA1L2NhcmluLXNjaG9wcG1leWVyLWJveXMtZ2lybHMtY2x1Yi1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carin Schoppmeyer: Boys & Girls Club celebrates 30 years with Sip & Savor on Aug. 19 | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Boys & Girls Club of Benton County supporters gathered Aug. 19 for Sip & Savor in Rogers.

The group's mission is ""to inspire and enable all young people especially those who need us most to reach their full potential as productive responsible and caring citizens."" The three pillars of the mission are academic success healthy lifestyles and character and citizenship.

Academic success programs include Power Hour for homework assistance STEAM (science technology engineering art and math) activities and Girls Who Code.

Character and citizenship development programs include Torch Club for boys and girls ages 11-13 in which members ""elect officers and work together to implement projects in the four focus areas: service to club and community; education; health and fitness; and social recreation."" Keystone Club for 14- t0 18-year-olds provides leadership development by focusing on academic success career preparation and community service.

This year marks the club's 30th anniversary in Benton County. ""We're very proud of what we've been able to accomplish. We started with a couple hundred kids and one unit and have grown to 3000 kids at five units"" says Matt Taliaferro chief executive officer.

The H mill for durum wheat processing will have a capacity of 360 tpd while the I mill for hard wheat will have a capacity of 250 tpd.

For the existing 250-tpd D mill a conversion from durum wheat to hard and soft wheat is foreseen with an increase in capacity and the integration of the latest machines from Ocrim.

Particular attention will be paid to sanitation rules in the H and I mills as a series of particularities are envisaged including the installation of all the process machines the pneumatic system and the pipes in stainless steel. In both mills cutting-edge cleaning technology is provided also through the use of the latest generation color sorters. In the H mill the debranning section for durum grain will include diamond technology.

All three mills will see energy savings through the installation of innovative systems that allow for considerable energy optimization Ocrim said.

“We have chosen Ocrim because it has always proved to be a loyal and supportive partner” said Vance Taylor president and general manager of North Dakota Mill. “We demanded very short delivery times and Ocrim accepted this challenge precisely because it is aware of its organizational management and strategic skills.

Full-size pickups equipped with diesel engines totaled a little more than 140000 sales in 2020 over in the United States of America. Last year came to a close with new-light vehicle sales of 14.46 million units according to the National Automobile Dealers Association which goes to show that compression ignition is a very small player in this part of the world.As far as the biggest of the Big Three in Detroit is concerned General Motors currently offers three diesels in the United States. These are the LWN four-cylinder Duramax LM2 six-cylinder Duramax and L5P eight-cylinder Duramax. As for the LH7 four-cylinder lump in the Chevrolet Cruze Equinox and GMC Terrain that one had to be discontinued over abysmal sales attributed to the price difference over the gasoline-fed alternatives.Chevrolet Low Cab Forward workhorses don’t count either because they’re based on the Isuzu Elf also known as the N Series. To whom it may concern these commercial vehicles can be had with a four-cylinder turbo diesel that flexes 520 pound-feet (705 Nm) from a displacement of 5.2 liters.The smallest Duramax available today is the 2.8-liter LWN . General Motors introduced this lump in 2015 for the 2016 Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon mid-size pickups and be warned that it wasn’t developed by the Detroit-based automaker. Believe it or not it’s a VM Motori design that was previously used by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in the Jeep Cherokee Wrangler Chrysler Grand Voyager and badge-engineered Lancia Voyager.SAE-certified at 181 horsepower at 3400 revolutions per minute and 369 pound-feet (500 Nm) of torque the “Baby Duramax” uses a variable-geometry turbocharger for greater efficiency across the RPM band as well as a balance shaft for improved smoothness. The block is made from iron the cylinder head is aluminum forged steel is utilized for the crankshaft and connecting rods and ceramic glow plus reduce heat-up times. Compatible with B20 fuel which is a blend of 20-percent biodiesel and 80-percent mineral diesel this engine is rated at 23 miles per gallon (make that 10.2 liters per 100 kilometers) on the combined cycle for the 2021 model year.The Silverado and Sierra rely on the 3.0-liter Duramax  which is a clean-sheet powerplant developed in collaboration with Opel the German automaker that General Motors owned until 2017. As a brief refresher Opel and Vauxhall were both purchased by Groupe PSA the French automaker that now goes by the name of Stellantis due to the 2021 merger with Fiat Chrysler.A straight-six engine rather than a V6 like the Power Stroke in the Ford F-150 the LM2 boasts 277 horsepower and 460 pound-feet (624 Nm) from 1500 through 3000 revolutions per minute. Indeed it’s just as torquey as the 6.2-liter small block and it needs fewer RPMs to crank out peak torque. Only available with a 10-speed automatic transmission that features a centrifugal pendulum absorber torque converter for reduced vibrations this fellow is gifted with a durable cast aluminum alloy for the block and head.Ceramic glow plugs eliminate the need for a block heater until -22 degrees Fahrenheit (-30 degrees Celsius) and customers are further treated to an exhaust brake available in tow-haul mode. An electronically variable intake manifold no balancing shafts nodular iron main bearing caps and a deep-skirt block design also need to be mentioned along with hypereutectic aluminum pistons thick piston crowns and a flywheel-side camshaft drive.Very smooth and understandably efficient the first-ever I6 turbo diesel offered in General Motors’ half-ton pickups is available on every 2021 model year Silverado except for the 2WD Regular Cab Long Bed Work Truck. In the case of the Double Cab Standard Bed LT the Duramax carries a $2370 premium over the 2.7-liter turbocharged mill known as the L3B. L5P is how the handle of the most Duramax of all Duramax engines. The 6.6-liter powerplant available on heavy- and medium-duty trucks is produced in Ohio by DMAX Ltd. a joint venture between the Big G and Isuzu. The latest and the greatest Duramax of them all traces its roots back to the LB7 introduced 20 years ago in the Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC TopKick.Starting with a strong foundation the L5P became available in the 2017 model year Silverado HD and Sierra HD with 445 horsepower and 910 pound-feet (1234 Nm) on deck. These ratings apply to 2021 models as well and be warned that GM isn’t sincere about the six-speed automatic tranny.Here’s a quote from a five-year-old press release: “The proven Allison 1000 six-speed automatic transmission is matched with the new Duramax 6.6L.” If you dig a little deeper into the 2500 HD and 3500 HD you’ll find no information whatsoever about the Indianapolis-based engineering firm's involvement except for the name. In other words it’s a General Motors gearbox badged as an Allison for marketing purposes. Peeps who can’t do without a true Allison can get the 4500 5500 and 6500 trucks which are available with a power take-off option that enables the user to run a winch water pump hydraulic tools garbage compactor buckets and so forth.When properly equipped for the job the force-fed V8 diesel enables a maximum tow rating of 36000 pounds (16329 kilograms) as long as you get a Regular Cab 2WD with dual real wheels and a gooseneck hitch. The payload tops 6523 pounds (2959 kilograms) which is a little short of the 7442 pounds (3376 kilograms) offered by the L8T pushrod gasoline V8.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2F1dG8uaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2F1dG8vbmV3cy9nbS10by1oYWx0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24taW4tZWlnaHQtZmFjdG9yaWVzLWluLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2EtZHVlLXRvLWNoaXAtY3Jpc2lzLTQxNjMwNjYzMDYxMTA4Lmh0bWzSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9hdXRvLmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9hdXRvL25ld3MvZ20tdG8taGFsdC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWluLWVpZ2h0LWZhY3Rvcmllcy1pbi1ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhLWR1ZS10by1jaGlwLWNyaXNpcy9hbXAtNDE2MzA2NjMwNjExMDguaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM to halt production in eight factories in North America due to chip crisis,"General Motors will decrease production at most of its North American factories due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage.

However it also added that production of the Equinox has been down since August 16. GM informed during production downtime it will repair and ship unfinished vehicles from many impacted plants including Fort Wayne and Silao.

The production capacity of automakers such as Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp have also been impacted due to the ongoing chip crisis. The former's sale went down by 33 percent in August while the latter slashed its global production by 40 percent in September.

The 2022 Wakesetter 21 LX is available with two engines: the Malibu Monsoon M5Di engine or the Malibu Monsoon M6Di engine. The Monsoon M5Di is based on a GM 5.3L V8 engine and makes 360 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque while the M6Di is based on a GM 6.2L V8 and makes 430 horsepower and 460 pound-feet. Both of these engines were co-developed by Malibu Boats and GM Marine with boat-specific applications in mind.

It’s worth noting that other higher-end offerings from Malibu Boats are available with a supercharged 6.2L LT4 V8 which produces 607 horsepower and 606 pound-feet of torque however the Wakesetter 21 LX is an entry-level offering in the Wakesetter model lineup and thus only offers the M5Di and M6Di. Like the naturally aspirated motors the marine version of the 6.2L LT4 V8 was engineered by Malibu Boats and GM Marine was first deployed in certain Malibu Boats models for the 2020 model year and serves as the range-topping engine option across its product portfolio. The LT4 is a road car engine that was first offered in the C7 Corvette Z06 and remains the go-to powerplant for the Chevy Camaro ZL1 and the 2022 Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing.

Apart from the engine the Wakesetter 21 LX has a large 21-foot hull capable of producing a pro-level wake or wave. The standard “G5” tower can also hang board racks and speakers while an available folding TXi tower is available for owners who want to store the boat in their garage. A wraparound lounge provides seating for 12 and is joined by other comforts like Malibu Soft Grip flooring eight-inch speakers and cupholders.

The 2022 Wakesetter 21 LX is available to order now. Check out the video embedded below to learn more about Malibu Boats and GM’s relationship with the Loudon Tennessee-based company. company.

The group was established by the W.H.O. in 2015 to create a priority list of dangerous viruses — specifically those for which no vaccines or drugs were already in development. The consensus at least among those in the room was that as populations and global travel continued to grow and development increasingly pushed into wild areas it was almost inevitable that once-containable local outbreaks like SARS or Ebola could become global disasters.

“The meeting was in a big room with all the tables arranged around the edge facing each other” one of the group’s members Peter Daszak recalled recently. “It was a very formal process. Each person was asked to present the case for including a particular disease on the list of top threats. And everything you say is being taken down and checked factually and recorded.”

Daszak who directs the pandemic-prevention group EcoHealth Alliance and is also chairman of the Forum on Microbial Threats at the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine had been given the task of presenting on SARS a lethal coronavirus that killed roughly 800 people after it emerged in 2002. (SARS stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and is officially known as SARS-CoV-1.) “We’d done a lot of research on coronaviruses so we knew they were a clear and present danger” he told me. “High mortality no drugs or vaccines in the pipeline with new variants that could still be emerging.”

The discussion he said was intense. “Everyone else in the room knows the facts already — they’ve read all the research” Daszak said. But for each pathogen the speaker had to convince the room that it presented a significant threat — “that this disease really could take off and that we should concentrate on it rather than on Lassa fever or something else. So you argue the case and then people vote. And sometimes it gets quite heated. I remember that monkey pox was an issue because there are outbreaks but there’s really nothing we can do about them. It was a really rigorous really excellent debate — and then afterward we went and had fondue.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoYW1lcmljYS5jb20vaG9ub3JlZS9kYW5pZWwtb2RheS01L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Daniel O’Day,"Daniel O’Day is the Chairman and CEO of Gilead the biopharmaceutical company which has more than 11000 employees around the world.

Millions of Somalis have suffered for the preceding two decades as a result of insufficient economic infrastructure. The combination of economic distress due to widespread counterfeiting displacement as a result of climate-related pressures and the ensuing threat of al Shabaab an al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist organization has left Somalia decimated. The national payments system in Somalia presents a glimmer of hope in the fight against widespread poverty in Somalia.

National Payments System

A national payments system simply refers to the infrastructure within a specified country or locality that allows for commercial and financial transactions to occur. This includes a network of banks and a messaging and routing system. The system protects the information and transactions of the public secures their finances and acts as an avenue into the global economy. A national payments system is essential to the efficacy of national economies and their involvement on a global financial scale.

Until recently Somalia existed without a national payments system. Domestic financial transactions largely used the U.S. dollar given the prevalence of counterfeit currency in the use of Somali shillings and that little to no domestic financial infrastructure was in place. This financial foundation hamstrung the Somali people and economy to the whim of exterior powers that provided such infrastructure in its most rudimentary form. During this period Somalia has been in civil war riddled with environmental decay and stifled by the threat of al Shabaab.

All of the aforementioned conditions created an economic situation in which 64% of the population lives in absolute poverty in Somalia. The national payments system presents a monumental step toward economic progress.

What the Future Holds

With the introduction of a national payments system in Somalia the Central Bank of Somalia Governor Abdirahman M. Abdullahi stated that “the impact on the economy will be unprecedented. It will boost trade and business… and will enable more financial inclusion in a secure and safe manner.”

The Central Bank of Somalia has also issued its first Visa card and its first mobile phone-centered financial system. During this time the government has additionally increased its regulation and production of the Somali shilling. All these financial advancements have boosted the IMF’s predictions of Somali economic growth to 2.9% in the next year.

Further Humanitarian Developments

In addition to the progress brought by the national payments system in Somalia the Somali government has recently passed election and healthcare reform bills to increase equity in their political and social infrastructure.

The National Elections Security Committee a newly founded governmental body has begun work on a new initiative to guarantee that at least 30% of the electorate consists of Somali women. The committee has additionally begun numerous programs to protect election integrity and voter privacy.

Support from international bodies ranging from the World Bank to the IMF is essential to the efficacy of domestic progress in Somalia. On the other hand it is important to note from where the motivation for such changes has arisen.

It was not international groups that began the charge for Somali advancement. Rather the impetus for this progress came from domestic pressure not foreign assistance. Through the example that Somalia set one can easily grasp the potential for self-sufficient humanitarian growth. All the changes are recent and will hopefully be immediately impactful in the global and domestic effort to end poverty in Somalia.

On this date in Texas Rangers history the career of Juan González began with the first hit of his career.

On September 4 1989 the Rangers faced the Minnesota Twins at Arlington Stadium. The Rangers called up González from Double-A Tulsa after the rosters expanded to 40 players. At the time González was one of the game’s most prized prospects. He had been a Texas League All-Star and was No. 5 in Baseball America’s list of top prospects behind Ray Lankford Andy Benes and José Offerman.

But at the time González was just looking to make any kind of impact he could.

González had played in the three previous games with seven plate appearances and no hits. Against the Twins he hit in a spot that was unfamiliar to him — ninth — and played center field. Facing Minnesota starter Shane Rawley González netted the first hit of his career going 1-for-3 and scoring twice as he also walked once in the contest. The Rangers won 8-5.

If González was hoping to make an immediate impact it ended up being a rude awakening. He hit just .150 with one home run coming on September 18 against Seattle.

Sensing that González needed a little more time the Rangers started him at Triple-A Oklahoma City in 1990 where he led the American Association in home runs (29) RBI (101) and total bases (252) rising to No. 1 in Baseball America’s ranking of top prospects.

The Rangers called him up again in September of 1990 and González’s improvement was evident. His batting average rose to .289 and hit four home runs with 12 RBI.

The next season 1991 González made the Opening Day roster and by 1992 he led the American League with 43 home runs.

The wildly popular Mexican fighter added another super middleweight title belt in front of a huge crowd in another fight in Texas. Not only did Saunders have his first loss as a pro the English fighter might have a broken eye socket.

Alvarez set up another victory in his latest Cinco de Mayo bout with a staggering right hand in the middle of the eighth round sending 73126 already-screaming fans at the home of the Dallas Cowboys into a frenzy as we waved his arms to encourage the noise while the round continued.

Saunders' corner waved in defeat before the ninth while treating a cut under his right eye. Alvarez (56-1-2 38 knockouts) added Saunders' WBO belt to his WBA and WBC straps in his third fight in less than five months and second in Texas.

It was the first loss in 31 fights for the 31-year-old Brit who was taken to the hospital with a suspected broken orbital bone fight spokesman Anthony Leaver said.

""I knew the fight was going to develop around the eighth round"" Alvarez whose only defeat was to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2013 said through an interpreter. ""It wasn't as difficult as I expected. I know my preparation is good and I improve day-by-day.""

While the wild celebration dragged on in the ring - to match a wild scene that included two fights in the crowd not far from it - Saunders eventually walked off booed loudly every time he was shown on the huge video board above the canvas.

""He couldn't see"" Saunders promoter Eddie Hearn said. ""I spoke with (trainer) Mark Tibbs and he wouldn't let him go out. I thought he boxed beautifully. Canelo took his time Billy is so tricky but Canelo busted him up.""

With pandemic restrictions on attendance long gone in Texas the festive crowd at 80000-seat AT&T Stadium was the biggest to date for a sporting event in the pandemic. Organizers have said it would break the U.S. indoor boxing attendance record of 63352 set in 1978 at the Superdome in New Orleans when Muhammad Ali beat Leon Spinks.

It came a little more than a month after baseball's Texas Rangers had their home opener in the first full pro sports stadium since the COVID-19 shutdown early last year right next door at Globe Life Field.

The distinction shouldn't last long with the Indianapolis 500 planning for about 135000 or 40% of the track's capacity on May 30. But the pro-Mexico crowd enjoyed the moment dumping decorum by booing in the early moments of the national anthem for Great Britain and singing along to the Mexican anthem.

The wildly popular Mexican fighter joined the folk singers and dancers during his ring walk after emerging from the Cowboys' locker room which made sense for what amounted to a home fight for the redhead.

Thousands of fans waved Mexican flags some with ""Vamos Canelo"" or ""Let's go Canelo"" written on them.

Two current champions were in attendance in heavyweight Tyson Fury a vocal supporter during fight week of his fellow Brit Saunders and welterweight Errol Spence Jr. who lives in the Dallas area.

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones watched from his suite in the $1.2 billion showplace that had the retractable roof and huge sliding doors closed. It was Alvarez's second win in the huge venue five years after his knockout of Liam Smith.

""It's difficult to explain"" Alvarez said when asked about the crowd. ""I don't have the words. All the emotions I feel they give me the motivation to continue on.""

After a tentative first round the 30-year-old Alvarez took control before Saunders had his best rounds in the fifth and sixth when the southpaw landed his best left hand of the fight.

Still Alvarez was in control even before the devastating right in the eighth. The crowd roared when he landed the blow prompting Alvarez to raise both arms above his head then waving his right arm before the round was over.

""I was winning round-by-round"" said Alvarez who was ahead on all three scorecards. ""I knew this would be final outcome. I knew it. I think I broke his cheek and knew he wasn't coming out of the corner.""

The only missing belt for Alvarez now in the 168-pound division is Caleb Plant's IBF strap. That was the obvious post-fight question for Alvarez and Hearn.

""Ultimately Canelo will fight absolutely anybody"" Hearn said. ""You know who he wants to fight he told me who he wants to fight Caleb Plant. It's all up to Caleb Plant. It has to happen.""

In the co-main event Elwin Soto defended his WBO junior flyweight title with a ninth-round technical knockout of Katsunari Takayama. It was the third title defense for the 24-year-old from Mexico.

Soto (19-1 13 knockouts) almost sent Takayama (32-9) to the canvas in the first round and controlled the fight from there against the soon-to-be 38-year-old from Japan. The fight was called at 2:44 of the ninth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9nbG9iZWdhemV0dGUvbmFtZS9rZWl0aC1hbmRlcnNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0yMjY4MzI0NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Keith Anderson Obituary (1940 - 2021) - Mason City IA - Globe Gazette,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/globegazette/name/keith-anderson-obituary?id=22683244 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9nbG9iZWdhemV0dGUvbmFtZS9rZWl0aC1hbmRlcnNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0yMjY4MzI0NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Unrealistic growth expectations

Since the middle of 2020 strategists have been making comparisons to the dot-com boom and bust cycle as investors speculated in meme stocks SPACs and crypto.

And while the comparison might seem tired Smith thinks it's essential to understand the current outlook and trajectory for the market.

In March 2000 the combined value of the market capitalization of the leading five US companies was valued at a record 24% of the economy based on enterprise value to GDP according to Smith.

Now the current combined top five which are all tech stocks are 37% of the economy based on GDP-to-enterprise value. This is a new record - 54% higher than the tech bubble.

""The whole US equity market is insanely overvalued with the total stock market capitalization relative to GDP far into record territory as we show below"" Smith said. ""Many other broad market valuation measures are also at historic levels.""

The record fiscal and monetary stimulus is unsustainably boosting company revenues free cash flows earnings and profitability Smith said.

""The point is that the largest most profitable and highest market cap companies in any business cycle will have trouble sustaining those high growth rates at least without a major hiccup along the way to be among the top companies in the next"" Smith said adding that leadership amongst the companies will shift over time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbXBhbmllcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDc0NDQvY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtYmlsbGllLXNwaW5zLXlhcm4tdGV4dGlsZS13YXN0ZXMtbmVpdGhlci13YXRlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Climate change: Billie spins yarn from textile wastes with neither water nor chemicals in Novetex's bid to cut emissions ...,"The result was the Billie system a patented “ upcycling ” process that can break down textile waste into slivers for blending with fresh threads before they are spun into yarn for reuse all done without using water or hazardous chemicals. The process co-developed with the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA) with HK$15 million (US$1.9 million) in investment was named “Billie” in honour of Chao’s grandfather Billy who passed away in March aged 101.

Any recycling then involved water and hazardous chemicals which would end up polluting the waterways. Chao turned to the collective wisdom at Novetex Textiles one of the world’s largest single-site yarn spinners founded half a century earlier by her grandfather Chao Kuang-piu. She wanted to create a clean recycling process that could produce high-value yarn.

When Ronna Chao returned to her family’s yarn spinning business in 2010 after stints at Goldman Sachs and Tommy Hilfiger Hong Kong was spewing out about 234 tonnes of textile waste every day most of them either going into landfills or being incinerated.

“My vision and hope is that through innovation we can continue to build our capabilities and offerings so that we can continue to play a role and more importantly have a meaningful presence in this industry” Chao said in an interview with South China Morning Post. “Creating the Billie system was among those steps towards innovation.”

The textile supply chain is the source of multifaceted environmental degradation. Although cotton grows on only 2.4 per cent of the world’s cropland it accounts for 22.5 per cent of the world’s insecticide use and 10 per cent of all pesticide application McKinsey said last year.

Some 2700 litres (713 gallons) of water is required to produce a single cotton T-shirt enough to sustain one person for 900 days based on calculation by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

While recycling is key to improve the sustainability of textile production the process typically involves a lot of water and energy. Nearly 20 per cent of global waste water is produced by the fashion industry which also emits about 10 per cent of global carbon emissions according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.

Every tonne of recycled cotton yarn saves half a hectare (1.2 acres) of agricultural land cuts 6.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions and conserves 2783 cubic metres of irrigation water according to a paper by researchers at the Hefei University of Technology published last year in the International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment.

Billie up and running since 2018 now occupies 20000 square feet (1858 square metres) at the Tai Po Industrial Estate in the north-eastern corner of Hong Kong surrounded by a data centre operator a gas producer and an instant noodle factory facing the Tolo Harbour. It was the city’s first textile mill to open in almost half a century.

The system involves a six-step process starting with using ozone to sanitise discarded apparels. Non-fibre objects such as zips and buttons are next removed by hand before the fabrics are trimmed colour-sorted and broken down mechanically into fibres and slivers. The slivers can then be blended with fresh threads to be spun into high-quality yarn.

Billie can process up to three tonnes of recycled fibres per day which can be blended with virgin materials to produce yarn for various textile products in Novetex’s spinning mill in Zhuhai.

That is enough to make 5000 to 8000 scarves if 50 per cent virgin material is blended into upcycled yarn depending on the design and type of textiles recycled.

While apparel recycling is not new it usually involves “downcycling” that produces low-value fibre that ends up in insulation or rugs and mats said HKRITA’s chief executive Edwin Keh pointing to Germany’s Wolfen SOEX plant which has been mechanically recycling used textiles into insulation material and other secondary raw materials since 1999 as example.

Billie’s uniqueness is that it uses automation colour sorting and robotics to separate the materials in the front end said Keh. The colours of the final products are blended with existing materials unlike conventional methods that need dying and reprocessing which generate waste water and chemicals he added.

Doing away with water in recycling adds an extra dimension to more sustainable textiles production and consumption beyond carbon emissions and materials reduction Chao said noting Novetex’s customers have increasingly been asking for sustainable products.

“Either they look at what we have in our inventory and stock or they ask to develop new things with us” she said. “Those are some of the reasons why we were very seriously looking at a solution that led to the birth of Billie.”

Novetex has helped around 50 organisations from hotels to schools to “upcycle” their wastes and provide new yarns to knitwear brands – such as Cynthia & Xiao and its own KPC Yarn label – which are expanding their offerings in sustainable fashion.

“During our business review we were thinking of ways to capture the value of waste materials and sustainability” said Chao. “We started thinking about coming up with our own recycling system.”

Besides being eco-friendly the system has helped reduce the cost of manufacturing and raise awareness of the huge global problem of textile wastes Chao said.

Globally the equivalent of a rubbish truckload of clothes is burnt or buried in landfills every second according to UK-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation an advocate for recycling and circular economy.

Novetex charges a processing fee for recycling textiles. The system deals mostly with knitted wastes such as cotton beddings and cashmere blankets which can be recycled more efficiently than non-knitted fabrics. The company charges an additional fee for customers who want to use processed fibre in new products by blending it with fresh material into ready-to-use form.

One such customer is the Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels group which has worked with Novetex since 2019 to recycle around 1200 kilograms of retired bed covers from The Peninsula Hong Kong Hotel as part of its sustainable development strategy.

“This project gave us a fresh perspective on the value of waste” said the hotelier’s head of corporate responsibility and sustainability Joshua Wong. “It inspired us to integrate the concept of circularity in our future product design and services.”

Sustainable consumption has been in vogue among global consumer brands due to greater awareness of climate change  water resource resilience and pollution issues. The sustainability focus sharpened as the global fashion industry’s 2020 profit plunged by an estimated 93 per cent due to the severe retail sales slump amid the coronavirus pandemic according to McKinsey.

“Less is more is a realisation that many brands and retailers had” said the management consulting firm’s senior partner Achim Berg in a blog in February. “That means less [offerings] in general because that’s not only easier to predict but also more sustainable for the industry and the planet.”

Novetex is not Hong Kong’s sole textile sustainability advocate. The charity Redress has been collecting fashion waste since 2007 to redistribute to needy communities and repurpose their fabrics as materials for other products.

Companies elsewhere are also doing their part. London-based Ananas Anam announced a partnership on August 19 with California’s packaged fruit giant Dole Sunshine to collect pineapple leaves from farms in the Philippines to produce plant-based leather for fashion and upholstery.

Still the path towards sustainability is not easy. One of Chao’s biggest challenges is cost.

“Hong Kong’s land prices are high and even rent in Tai Po is a big cost component” she said. “Labour [cost] is not so bad because our highly automated system only needs six to eight people to run.”

“It is not a profit contributor yet but we see it as a great opportunity to tell our customers what our capabilities are” she said. “We have been offering recycled yarn for a long time but this is a different way of recycling which is even more environmentally friendly.”

Going green on clothing is more costly initially since a cost-efficient recycling supply chain needs to be set up but it would cost less in the long term to buy garments made with recycled materials said Stanley Szeto Chi-yan another third-generation garment business owner.

“Used materials are already there almost free and recycling technology will improve [to eventually make] the cost of recycling materials lower than virgin materials” said the chairman of Hong Kong’s Lever Style an apparel supply chain manager that serves sustainable fashion brands such as Everlane.

It will take time to transform the industry especially in materials noted Szeto whose grandfather Richard Szeto founded a shirt-making business in Hong Kong in 1956.

Some pioneers are already making early inroads. Renewcell a Swedish start-up backed by Hong Kong property conglomerate Nan Fung Group uses chemicals to generate cellulose pulp from discarded cotton garments. It sees rising demand for its Circulose recycled cotton product said chief marketing officer Harald Cavalli-Björkman.

Besides partnerships with fashion brands like Sweden’s H&M Group Renewcell signed a deal with Chinese viscose fibre manufacturer Tangshan Sanyou Group in Hebei province in October to supply 175000 tonnes of Circulose over the next five years.

“The demand for sustainable and circular materials from consumers feeds through brands all along the value chain back to raw material producers such as ourselves” Cavalli-Björkman said. “Almost all global brands have made commitments to cut waste and increase use of recycled materials in response to pressure from consumers investors employees and policymakers.”

H&M pledged that recycled materials would make up 30 per cent of its needs by 2025 as it works towards the goal of cutting 20 per cent of the indirect carbon dioxide of its products – emitted by its supply chain partners – by 2030 from 2017. Recycled cotton accounted for 1.8 per cent of its 2020 procurement – up from 0.6 per cent in 2019.

For the global textile industry to be sustainable recycling is not enough Chao said.

“While we come up with solutions on handling or repurposing waste...it is more important to reduce waste” she said. “Even if I open 10 Billie factories I cannot process all the textile waste created in Hong Kong. We have to be more mindful about our production our consumption... and our disposals.”

Chao’s family has not pressured the next generation to be successors but has left the doors open should they want to take up managerial roles.

“Given the industry’s realities taking up a 50-plus-year-old enterprise with all its demands and challenges is [neither] easy nor appealing to the next generation” she said. “My children are interested in fashion but they are also very keen on doing their own thing as young adults. My priority is to let them discover themselves explore and develop their own interests and passions.”

With professional management already in place at Novetex she believes the business can go on even if no family member is directly involved in the day-to-day operations.

“I have peace of mind in knowing that I lead Novetex with extremely capable experienced colleagues in our management team who will no doubt mentor the next generation of Novetex employees whether that includes my children” she said."

Advocates are all aboard,"Advocates say a passenger train route from New Haven to Boston through Hartford Springfield and Worcester would invigorate the regional economy.

When Gov. Ned Lamont announced in June that the state would spend $8 billion to $10 billion to (modestly) improve travel times on the busy (if pokey) New Haven Line the reaction was generally favorable. Most understand that the rail connection to New York City is vital to Connecticut’s economy and quality of life and the faster the better.

But if the state benefits from commuter rail to the Big Apple as it clearly does would it not also benefit from similar service to Boston the Hub of the Universe?

A study released in April answered with a resounding yes. Fast and reliable passenger service from New Haven to Boston via Hartford Springfield and Worcester would have a “transformative effect” on the Hartford-Springfield regional economy. The report said an investment of $6 billion to $9 billion could yield between $47 billion and $84 billion in new and direct gross domestic product over 30 years in the Hartford-Springfield metro area and another $15 billion to $21 billion in indirect or induced growth.

The study along with the growing prospect of a major federal infrastructure bill has bolstered efforts to restore full passenger service on what was once called the “Inland Route” from New York to Boston.

“I cannot think of a better time to invest in rail “ said U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal D-Mass. whose sprawling district covers most of Western Massachusetts. Neal has long supported improved rail service in his part of the state and as chair of the influential House Ways and Means Committee he is a formidable proponent of better rail service.

He said in a statement to The Connecticut Mirror that the new study is “welcome news and echoes what we already know – improved rail along the inland route … is good for the entire region. Economic growth jobs and unparalleled opportunity are waiting. It is simply too costly not to act at this moment.”

But despite the strong support of Neal and other members of Congress including Connecticut’s John Larson and Rosa DeLauro getting regular commuter rail service on the inland route remains a challenge.

For openers a project that involves two states is almost invariably more complicated than one that can be done in a single state.

Also while the Commonwealth of Massachusetts owns the tracks from Boston to Worcester now part of the MBTA commuter rail system CSX the freight carrier owns the tracks from Worcester to Springfield and would have to be accommodated. Also as is typical of rights-of-way laid out in the 19th century the route does not describe a straight line.

Finally despite Congressional and public support neither state is exactly fired up about restoring the inland route though for different reasons.

Connecticut took the initiative opening The Hartford Line regular rail service between New Haven Hartford and Springfield in 2018. Though some infrastructure work remains — for example the line north of Hartford to the Massachusetts state line must be double-tracked to support more frequent commuter rail — the state is in no hurry to get to it unless Massachusetts shows some interest in upgrading its east-west line particularly the critical 48-mile Springfield to Worcester section.

“Connecticut has done its part by investing in the Hartford Line. It’s really Massachusetts that has been slow-walking it” said Massachusetts State Sen. Eric Lesser D-Longmeadow an ardent supporter of “East-West Rail” as it is known in the Bay State.

Critics blame Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. “When it comes to the east-west rail link to date he has been passionately uninterested in it” wrote Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi on March 31. She also cited Baker’s “historic lack of enthusiasm for public transit.”

Can train supporters bring him around?

Two ways to Boston

In the heyday of mid-century rail travel trains regularly plied the Inland Route from New York to Boston. But it dwindled in the 1960s and ’70s as the nation took to the new interstate highways. Amtrak ran self-propelled Budd cars and not new ones on the Springfield line for more than a decade.

There was a citizen effort to revive the Inland Route in the early 1980s led by Meriden lawyer and rail enthusiast James M. S. Ullman. Ullman argued that the Inland Route actually served a larger population base than the Shoreline Route and was only two miles longer. He urged Amtrak to provide good service on both routes.

Ullman got people thinking. Gov. Lowell Weicker urged Amtrak to restore the Inland Route. But Ullman’s untimely death in 1994 following serious personal difficulties pretty much ended the effort to restore the route at least for the moment.

Hartford-Springfield is seeing a decreasing share in an otherwise growing market because it is not connected to it. ”— Chris Brewer economist AECOM

Two decades later Gov. Dannel P. Malloy actually got the work started. A former mayor of Stamford who understood the value of commuter rail Malloy in partnership with Amtrak and Massachusetts officials redeveloped the New Haven-Hartford-Springfield line known now as The Hartford Line.

It opened in 2018 and offers 17 northbound trains from New Haven to Hartford all but four continuing to Springfield and 16 southbound trains all but four starting in Springfield. It got off to a strong start carrying more than 1.4 million riders in 2019 though COVID caused a significant drop in 2020.

In 2017 as the work was progressing Malloy wrote to Baker his Massachusetts counterpart “strongly encouraging” him to begin work on the Inland Route section from Worcester through Springfield to the Connecticut border.

Baker didn’t bite despite considerable public support for the project. Polls in 2018 and 2019 by MassInc a nonpartisan think tank found support for east-west rail expansion at 67 and 76 percent respectively. They are left with one slow and unreliable train a day between Springfield and Boston. It takes two and a half hours about an hour longer than it takes to drive in midday traffic.

In January the Massachusetts Department of Transportation released a major feasibility study of east-west rail expansion. That study initially looked at six ways to improve service including the intriguing idea of running a rail line in the Massachusetts Turnpike corridor.

Alas the consultants believed it too expensive and too far from some of the cities it would serve so it was dropped. In the end the study offered three options for improved east-west service. The first would use the existing CSX tracks; the other two call for building new stretches of track alongside the existing track. The estimated costs range from $2.41 billion to $4.63 billion which includes the option of extending the service west to Pittsfield.

The state’s study cites the costs but not the potential economic benefit. That was the point of the study released in April which projected a major return on investment if the Inland Route is revived.

Regional gain

The report commissioned by the Capitol Region Council of Governments and the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission and prepared by the infrastructure consulting firm AECOM makes a case that commuter rail service would greatly benefit the Hartford-Springfield metro area.

The Hartford-Springfield metro — defined as Hartford County Conn. and Hampshire and Hampden counties Mass. — is a “distinct and consequential economic location in the Northeast Corridor” the study says with a combined population of 1.6 million a gross domestic product of $120 billion 20 colleges and universities and New England’s second-largest international airport.

Nonetheless the region is somewhat isolated economically and has not kept pace with the rest of the Northeast Corridor the report states. Since 1990 job growth in the Northeast Corridor as a whole has been 1.1% annually but in Hartford-Springfield only 0.6%.

This translates to about 130000 jobs not created notably in the “key sectors of … information finance and professional services (including insurance in which employment has actually declined)” the report states. Transportation isn’t the only reason for the job lag but it is one reason.

“Hartford-Springfield is seeing a decreasing share in an otherwise growing market because it is not connected to it” said Chris Brewer an AECOM economist who worked on the economic impact study.

Hartford-Springfield is about equidistant from Boston and New York. Fast and reliable commuter rail could over time regain 20000-40000 of the lost jobs the report estimates. Brewer said a 90-minute commute to both big cities would put Hartford-Springfield in play (in 2019 Lamont announced a goal of 90 minutes from Hartford to Manhattan).

With a 90-minute ride to both major cities Brewer said Hartford-Springfield would become attractive to workers on a hybrid schedule who only need to travel to the Big Apple or the Athens of America two or three times a week. And as James Ullman observed 40 years ago commuter rail doesn’t serve only the big cities at the end of the line but the smaller cities along the line as well.

Brewer’s study said if any of the options Massachusetts put forth is chosen “an investment in the $4 billion range would cut nearly an hour off the Springfield-Boston trip” and enable at least 10 round trips per day.

Woostah

New England’s second-largest city offers an example of what might happen. Worcester was connected to Boston via the MBTA commuter rail system nearly a decade ago. Good things have happened since: a number of new residential and commercial projects; the arrival of the Boston Red Sox Triple A farm team the WooSox; and the announcement that a major Chinese biotech firm Hong Kong-based WuXi Biologics would locate its first U.S. facility in Worcester. The $60 million facility is expected to employ 150 people when it opens next year.

Perhaps most remarkably recently released census figures show Worcester’s population increased 14% from 2010 to 2020 to 206518 more than 25000 new residents. By contrast Springfield grew 1.9% to 155 929 and Hartford lost 2.8% of its residents dropping to 121203.

“We’ve all seen what’s happened in Worcester. The same thing can happen in Springfield and Hartford” said Dana Roscoe principal planner and transportation manager for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission.

“If you are connected to Boston by commuter rail your economy is probably doing well” said Lyle Wray executive director of the Capitol Regional Council of Governments.

Wray and other inland route proponents have met with transportation officials as well as Congressional and gubernatorial staffers over the summer to make the case for the inland route. “At least they are listening” he said. He said he’d like to see Connecticut commit to finishing its part of the double-track work and eventually electrify the line.

State Department of Transportation spokesman Kevin Nursick said electrification is a subject for future talks with Amtrak. He said while double-tracking from Windsor to Enfield is “not required for near-term service” and the work is not scheduled it is in the department’s long range capital program. He said the new Windsor Locks Station is being designed to accommodate the second track.

But that second track is not likely to appear until there’s progress on East-West Rail north of the border. Lesser believes there’s a strong argument for it.

He said in state transportation spending there is a “legacy of bias toward Boston and the needs of the Boston core.” But he said East-West Rail is “as good for Boston as it is for Springfield.”

Boston’s issues are congestion and housing prices. “Nobody can afford to live in Eastern Mass housing prices are out of control and no one can get around” because of the traffic and crowded transit he said.

In Western Massachusetts “we have the reverse — lower cost of housing and good quality of life” — but the region has seen a loss of jobs and population. East-West Rail would solve problems if not overnight giving people in Eastern Massachusetts access to lower-cost housing and a calmer quality of life while giving folks in Western Massachusetts access to jobs to the east.

He said connecting Western New England including the Pioneer Valley towns north of Springfield to Hartford and Boston by rail will have a major environment benefit taking thousands of cars off the road and helping clean the air noting that the valley area has a high rate of asthma. Also as Wray noted climate resilience may well favor a route away from the shoreline.

“We need the governor of Massachusetts to make this a top priority” Lesser said. Gov. Baker’s office did not respond to several requests for comment though MassDOT spokeswoman Judith Reardon Riley forwarded a press release citing the need for more study coordination with CSX identification of funding sources and creation of a governing structure to move the East-West rail project off the drawing board and onto the tracks. .

Lesser believes the challenge is not insurmountable. “We built a railroad through the Rocky Mountains during the Civil War. We can do this.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9rcmlzdGluZS1tYWNrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTE3Nzc3NDU50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kristine Mack Obituary (1965 - 2021) - Hartford CT - Hartford Courant,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/hartfordcourant/name/kristine-mack-obituary?id=17777459 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9rcmlzdGluZS1tYWNrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTE3Nzc3NDU50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g2MS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lL2hhcnRmb3JkLWhpdC1hbmQtcnVuLWNyYXNoLWtpbGxzLW1hbi1vbi1hLXNjb290ZXIvNTIwLWJmOGI1YTJjLTIyYWMtNDExYi04MjNjLWY4MWUzMTA3OWQyYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hartford hit and run crash kills man on a scooter,"The crash happened on Maple Avenue early Sunday morning near Hartford Hospital.

HARTFORD Conn. — A man operating a scooter was killed in a hit-and-run crash early Sunday according to Hartford police.

Officers were called to the area of 53 Maple Avenue by the Hartford Hospital campus around 12:45 a.m. for the report of a crash. They found 39-year-old Josue Colon of New Britain in a parking lot with a scooter nearby.

Colon was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police said the vehicle that reportedly struck Colon had left the scene. It was later found by officers unoccupied on Wethersfield Avenue.

The investigation of the crash is ongoing.

Elijah Hilliman and Aimee Chambers both of Hartford founded the shop as a place where Black and brown residents can feel welcome gather and celebrate community and coffee.

Hilliman whose family owned La Paloma Sabanera coffee shop on Capitol Avenue in Hartford has a passion for coffee culture. “Growing up in that environment was life-changing for me. It was where art and culture meshed” Hilliman said. “Everyone was like family. It was inspiring to me.”

Chambers director of planning for the city has a passion for creating spaces for underrepresented communities. “The question was how do I put that into practice?” she said.

Their interests meshed when they met. Hilliman was working as a barista at Story & Soil coffee shop just down the block from where La Paloma Sabanera used to be. Chambers came in regularly for coffee. They made friends chatted and realized both their dreams could come true if they worked together.

“There are not a lot of places in this community that were intentionally created for people to gather in comfort and safety” Chambers said. “I could only think of opening up a café” Hilliman said.

They filed their permit applications with the city calling their proposed shop “a neighborhood living room dedicated to celebrating Hartford Black and brown cultures through coffee.”

Elijah Hilliman and Aimee Chambers are opening Semilla coffeeshop in Hartford on Sept. 11 at 1283 Main St. in Hartford.

The two gathered that community together even before they opened the coffee shop with a successful $10000 Kickstarter campaign to fund the early stages of development. “We have had so much support from friends and family” Chambers said. “People want this intentional space in this community.”

They found the perfect location in the building across the street from Dunkin Donuts Park that was recently improved by a $1.35 million renovation by the San Juan Center a Latino nonprofit that serves low- and moderate-income people in Greater Hartford. San Juan Center’s project created 10 rental units and 2500 square feet of storefront space half of which will be occupied by Semilla.

Hilliman and Chambers have created a “neighborhood living room” whose designer aesthetic they call “grandma chic.” The seating area has traditional tables as well as comfy sofas and rattan chairs. The dishware is intentionally mismatched as if randomly accumulated over decades.

The beverage menu was created with this same homey intent. “We want the coffee to be accessible and recognizable. Coffee shops can be snobby … with the menu in Italian” Chambers said. The offerings include familiar items and many that harken back to Hilliman’s and Chambers’ childhoods.

“La Paloma Sabanera” is a grapefruit limeade. “Crossroads Dairy Shoppe” is named after a shop on Albany Avenue one of the city’s first Jamaican grocery stores which was once owned by Chambers’ grandparents. That beverage is espresso served over rum raisin ice cream. “North End Blend” is another homage to Chambers’ family: Her great grandmother used to drink coffee with condensed milk in it.

The tea is provided by Calabash a Black-owned firm.

Part of the café will be set aside as retail space to sell wares made by local people of color.

Semilla will open on Sept. 11. The hours will be Wednesday to Friday 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and weekends 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. semilla.cafe. Those who want to offer their wares for sale can email drinkcoffee@semilla.cafe.

Judge Presses For Details On Hershey Charity Spat With Board Member,"The mounting feud between Pennsylvania’s wealthiest charity and one of its board members was on full display in a Harrisburg courtroom Tuesday as a judge pressed attorneys for each side on the details of a monthslong fight over internal spending details.

Robert Heist the board member says in court records that millions of dollars have gone unaccounted for at the Milton Hershey School and that he’s been denied access to financial records that would help explain why.

Lawyers for the school counter that Heist “has an agenda” has “no authority to conduct his own investigation” and is wasting school resources in his quest for documents.

The suit is the latest in a series of controversies for the Milton Hershey School the nation’s richest K-12 school whose board members have been investigated over the last decade for buying a golf course with school funds lavish travel and spending millions of dollars investigating each other.

In an unusual move for a sitting board member Heist sued the school earlier this year to attempt to obtain financial documents. Now it’s up to Dauphin County Judge John McNally to decide whether the suit should go forward or be dismissed.

Heist sued the school “reluctantly and only after numerous unsuccessful efforts” to obtain spending details from MHS officials according to court records. Heist says he has been trying to access this information since September 2019 including making no fewer than five requests in early 2021 to the current board chair M. Diane Koken a former Pennsylvania insurance commissioner.

Lawyers for the school say it has already given Heist thousands of pages of documents in response to his requests.

The dispute is all the more surprising given that Heist — a 1982 graduate of the Milton Hershey School — has served on its board since 2011 including several years as board chair. Earlier this year Heist withdrew his vote in favor of the school’s annual budget on the grounds that he didn’t have all the necessary information his attorney said.

Directors of a charity typically have access to financial documents. “A director of a nonprofit corporation in Pennsylvania is fundamentally allowed to see the books and records of the organization to determine whether the funds are being spent properly” Don Kramer chairman of the nonprofit practice at Philadelphia law firm Montgomery McCracken said earlier this year.

Lawyers for the Milton Hershey School argued that Heist was never actually denied access to the records; his lawyer Eileen Ficaro countered the school still has not given him access. Heist did not attend the hearing.

During the hearing McNally appeared skeptical of some of Ficaro’s arguments pressing her on whether the school’s response to Heist was in fact a denial.

“Have they locked the doors? Have they shuffled the documents from place to place so he couldn’t access them?” he asked. And he pressed her several times on whether Heist had requested the records again since filing the suit.

Founded in 1909 by candy tycoon Milton S. Hershey the school educates and houses roughly 2100 low-income students at no cost. For years critics have argued that the school which is funded by a $17 billion endowment including a controlling stake in the Hershey Co. snack giant should spend much more than it does.

Under pressure from the state Attorney General’s office the school last year announced it would use some of an accumulated $1 billion in unspent income to build and operate six preschool centers around the state. In five years the centers will serve roughly 900 impoverished children — a significant expansion of the school’s mission.

Heist is seeking thousands of pages of documents related to MHS’s legal expenses and insurance coverage for legal expenses; one of his concerns court records show is that the school was spending money on legal fees that should have been covered by insurance. Legal and insurance costs increased by 74% between 2017 and 2019 according to the charity’s IRS filings.

During that time the charity defended itself against two federal lawsuits. In one a former student claimed he was expelled after an attempted suicide. In the other the parents of a former student claimed their daughter was not allowed back on campus after being hospitalized for depression. She died by suicide two weeks later. Both cases were dismissed.

The school is also defending itself and its board members including Heist against a lawsuit in New York brought by an activist and alum lawyer F. Frederic Fouad who claims that the charity has harassed him.

Among the records Heist sought were documents with his signature authorizing legal expenses Thomas Leonard a lawyer for the Milton Hershey School told the judge. “He’s trying to figure out what he signed and didn’t sign” Leonard said.

The hearing ended with both parties agreeing to provide the judge under seal a March 24 letter containing confidential information in which Heist laid out why he was seeking the records — perhaps an ironic turn of events the judge mused Tuesday for a lawsuit focused on transparency and openness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvc2VwLzA1L2NhcmluLXNjaG9wcG1leWVyLWJveXMtZ2lybHMtY2x1Yi1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carin Schoppmeyer: Boys & Girls Club celebrates 30 years with Sip & Savor on Aug. 19 | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Boys & Girls Club of Benton County supporters gathered Aug. 19 for Sip & Savor in Rogers.

Global hospitality chain Hilton has just announced a franchise agreement with Alexandros Tourist and Hotel Services Ltd to open the new Sea Breeze Santorini Beach Resort in Exomitis located on the southwest part of Santorini.

A private and relaxing locale Exomitis is at the end of the seemingly endless 3.5-kilometre black sand beach that starts from Perissa and is famous for some of its smaller beaches sprinkled across it’s stretch including Perivolos and Agios Georgios.

With the volcanic black sandy beach on its doorstep the Sea Breeze Luxury Resort is among the most luxurious 5-star properties on arguably Greece’s most famous island instantly recognisable for its picturesque cliffs adorned by whitewashed blue-accented cube-shaped buildings and the tangerine sunsets that light up both sky and sea.

The incredibly beautiful property with dazzling Aegean sea views offers a combination of the beautiful Cycladic architecture resort family-friendly facilities and bespoke services in an intimate setting.

Its interior design draws inspiration from Santorini’s iconic blue and whitewashed architecture incorporating the island’s rugged natural beauty with stone walls and organic wooden textures.

Sea Breeze Santorini Beach Resort will belong to Curio Collection by Hilton an upscale hotel brand within the Hilton Worldwide portfolio.

It will be the latest Grecian Curio hotel following the recent opening of The Royal Senses Resort & Spa Crete Curio Collection by Hilton in June.

Curio Collection defines itself as a ‘soft brand’ meaning its specially selected independent resort and hotels are supported by Hilton whilst retaining their own individual branding.

Together they have developed The Hotel Waste Measurement Methodology which will allow hotels to collect data on waste. This will allow them to create waste reduction targets to keep food waste out of landfills.

WWF was founded in Switzerland in 1961 by individuals concerned about the impact of human activity on vulnerable animals. Now the charity has turned its attention to preventing climate change catastrophe.

Rotting food creates a greenhouse gas: methane

Food waste is a massive contributor to climate change. Rotting food in landfill creates methane a greenhouse gas which is more potent than CO2.

Humanity minimising the volume of methane is as important as decreasing the consumption of CO2.

According to WWF:

One-third of all the food produced in the world goes to waste

It’s important to remember food is not just wasted when customers buy the food cook too much of it and throw the remains away. Food can also be lost or spoiled during distribution

WWF believes that this volume of food would be enough to feed every undernourished person on earth

In the USA 40% of food waste comes from restaurants and hotels something Pete Pearson global food loss and waste lead for World Wildlife Fund feels needs to change.

“The hotel industry has the unique ability to implement changes that will have global impacts when it comes to managing food waste and all waste” said Pearson.

Hotel industry to decrease food waste

As the world gets back to normal the hotel industry will evolve into a more sustainable one.

“Through awareness with our operating teams on how much food waste is generated and by measuring it we believe we can bring behavioral change” said Max Verstraete Hilton’s VP of corporate responsibility. “We can change menus for our restaurants buffets and catering events — how they’re set what we’re buying how we’re buying — which ultimately has a positive impact on food costs.”

The Hotel Waste Measurement Methodology has been reviewed by figures in the hotel industry who feel it addresses the hardest challenges faced by hotels.

“As companies start using it and more data becomes available we will be able to update the methodology to reflect new insights and harness the power of industry benchmarking. This will in turn catalyze action across the hotel sector as companies work towards waste reduction and diversion goals” says Olivia Ruggles-Brise Greenview Director.

Habitat loss overexploitation and illegal trade have hammered global wildlife populations.

The world will get an update Saturday of the Red List of Threatened Species the authoritative catalogue of how many of the planet's animal and plant species are teetering on the brink of extinction due to human activity.

Experts for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) which is holding a world congress in the French city of Marseille have assessed nearly 135000 species over the last half-century and almost 28 percent are currently at risk of vanishing forever.

Habitat loss overexploitation and illegal trade have hammered global wildlife populations but scientists say they are increasingly worried about the looming threats of climate change.

AFP spoke with Craig Hilton-Taylor the IUCN's Head of Red List Unit on the eve of the congress.

Q. Are we in or on the cusp of the sixth mass extinction?

If we look at extinctions every 100 years since 1500 there is a marked inflection starting in the 1900s. The trend is showing that we are 100 to 1000 times higher than the 'background' or normal extinction rates. I would certainly say that the red list status shows that we're on the cusp of the sixth extinction event [in the last 500 million years].

If the trends carry on going upward at that rate we'll be facing a major crisis soon.

Lions have lost more than 90 percent of their historic range and population.

Q: The Red List began in 1964. Has it changed much?

A: The initial list wasn't really based on scientific criteria. It was more of a gut feel: 'We think the species is under some degree of threat'. But as the list started to grow we realised that we needed to make the list scientifically defensible. So we took a big step back and asked: 'What is it we are trying to measure?'

The answer was quite simple: risk of extinction.

Q: Are there species that would have gone extinct without the Red List?

A: There are lots of species around the world that we would almost certainly have lost. The Red List process drew attention for example to the plight of the Arabian oryx and led to conservation efforts—taking the animals out of the wild captive breeding reintroductions. We've seen species very nearly extinct that are thriving now.

Q: Does the Red List make recommendations?

A: The Red List is not policy prescriptive it's really just a statement of fact –- this is what the status of the species is. Then it's up to the decision makers to interpret that and decide what policies should be enacted.

Graph showing the percentage of vertebrate groups driven to extinction since 1500.

Q: Do you ever come under pressure over the listings?

A: There is lots of lobbying. Surprisingly it's not so much about the up-listing to a higher threat level. For some high-profile charismatic species if you want to down-list them because there has been successful conservation actions we often get lobbied very very hard to not do that.

There's real concern that if a species goes down a category that conservation investment will stop. This is where the 'green status' will really help.

Q. What is the green status?

A: After you've done the Red List assessment what are you going to do about it? This is where we started talking about the green status. How do you measure whether your conservation actions are being successful? If we hadn't done anything where would it be now? If we stopped all conservation efforts now what will happen to that species going forward? Those are the metrics in the green status process.

Q: Couldn't that lead to species conservation triage?

A: There's a limited amount of funding available and vast number of species. It does come down to some really harsh realities. You're obligated to just let some species go extinct because we really can't save them.

A maasai giraffe walks in Nairobi National Park Kenya.

But it's not something we tackle head on in the Red List process. We effectively pass the buck on to others to make those very hard decisions.

Q: Climate change is rarely cited as a driver of extinction. Why is that?

A: It is obvious for the polar bears because of the direct link between sea ice cover and global warming but with other megafauna it's a lot harder to detect the impacts of climate change.

There is evidence pointing to climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires. But when experts record threats to a species they may put 'increased fire frequency' not climate change.

The chytrid fungus is wiping out amphibians all around the world and we are pretty sure that its emergence is very much linked to climate change. But with the evidence we have now the category of threat is invasive species not climate change.

Called Hubspace the free app is available in Android and iOS app stores and “enables light bulbs smart plugs and ceiling fans to be controlled from anywhere” according to a press release from Home Depot. It’s compatible with Google Home and Amazon Alexa devices and works with a short list of products that Home Depot sells from its proprietary brands such as Hampton Bay and EcoSmart. “There’s no need for a hub or extra equipment and the platform already works with more than 20 products” the press release explains.

OK so there’s no hub required and you can control third-party devices from one app which seems like it would add some convenience if you’ve got a ton of mismatched smart home brands in your collection but don’t want to set up a hub. But there are plenty of smart home products that users can control via the product’s own smart home app.

We asked a Home Depot spokesperson why consumers should use this app to control their smart home products instead of Alexa or Google Home to be sure we weren’t missing something.

Q. Is Hubspace meant to be a competitor to Alexa and Google Home?

A. Hubspace was designed to be a simple reliable and responsible way to bring products from The Home Depot’s proprietary brands such as Hampton Bay EcoSmart and other product lines into Smart Home. Hubspace-connected products provide customers with a high-quality user experience to control products in the Hubspace app once products are connected to the Hubspace platform it offers the ability to seamlessly integrate their products with third-party platforms in the fastest easiest way possible

Q. Because it appears all of the items on the list of compatible products are already compatible with Alexa or Google Home – why would someone need this third option?

A. At The Home Depot we know our DIYers look for easy-to-install and convenient solutions. Hubspace was created to make the convenience and sustainability benefits of Smart Home products available to anyone with a smart device and an internet connection – with no hub necessary and at an affordable price. Smart Home can be an intimidating space for some customers Hubspace was designed to simplify the experience and to allow all customers the [sic] enjoy the benefits of Smart Home products.

Q. And is it limited to that list of products only?

A. The Hubspace app was designed with the ability to support products from all the aisles of The Home Depot. We have started with products from within our lighting and electrical areas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2hvbWUvaG9tZS1kZXBvdC1odWJzcGFjZS1ib3RoLWV4Y2l0aW5nLXdvcnJ5aW5nL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2hvbWUvaG9tZS1kZXBvdC1odWJzcGFjZS1ib3RoLWV4Y2l0aW5nLXdvcnJ5aW5nLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Home Depot’s Hubspace smart home line has me both excited and worried,"Home Depot has announced its own line of smart home products called Hubspace as the home improvement giant looks to take its place among the ever-growing number of companies looking to make a mark in the rapidly expanding market. The announcement of a new lineup of budget-priced products is exciting especially given the number of them – more than 20 products in total – but it also stirs a tinge of worry.

Store-brand products do not have a great track record

Let’s dice into the source of this anxiety with a question. What happens to smart products if they lose all support? They turn into “dumb” accessories. Sometimes unsupported smart products can still be used as normal lights or speakers but the loss of support often means you are left with a very expensive paperweight. Unfortunately this isn’t just pessimism – this exact scenario played out with Best Buy’s Insignia brand.

The company shut down support on November 6 2019. While the smart plugs still worked as plugs and the lights still provided illumination there was an Insignia-branded smart camera that became a pricy piece of plastic. Best Buy isn’t the only company to shut down support when its products don’t perform as well as expected.

Lowe’s shut down its Iris platform on March 31 2019. The difference between the Iris shutdown and the Insignia shutdown is that Lowe’s provided refunds to its customers. Best Buy only offered partial refunds and only for products that had already been connected and registered. If you had an Insignia smart device that hadn’t been hooked up by the deadline you were out of luck.

With many store-branded smart devices ending support within just a few years of launch including Home Depot’s biggest competitor I can’t help but approach the announcement with a healthy amount of skepticism. The new products will enter a market already thick with competition so fast adoption and continued support from Home Depot will ultimately decide whether the devices succeed or the platform falls flat.

Hubspace is off to a strong start

Despite the obstacles to a new smart home platform entering the market at this time Hubspace has a lot going for it. The platform is designed with compatibility in mind and integrates seamlessly with Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. This means you have the option for smart voice control out of the box.

Hubspace is also compatible with both iPhone and Android right away. Some platforms start initially on one or the other which limits its user base out of the gate. That isn’t the case here. Hubspace lets you pair products through both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi although it defaults to Wi-Fi control. If you have no connection Bluetooth will work instead. This means you can control the platform remotely a key aspect of any effective smart home platform.

Some of the products available at launch include smart LED bulbs smart recessed lighting smart LED tape lights and recessed LED trim. There are also smart ceiling fans and smart plugs. The variety of products sets it apart especially considering the lack of brand-name products in the overall market. If you’ve ever tried to find a smart ceiling fan you know how few options are available from brands you recognize.

The same holds true for recessed lighting. It’s not easy to find name-brand (or even smart) recessed lighting so the fact Home Depot is making it easy to control these lights straight from the Hubspace app is a major win.

Another key element that gives Hubspace a leg up is the ease with which visiting friends and family can connect to your devices. The process isn’t as complex as it is on other platforms and makes controlling smart devices much more approachable even for those that aren’t the most tech-savvy. You can even control multiple homes from the Hubspace app similar to the way HomeKit works.

The ability to build your own network of smart home devices and control them all from the Home Depot app as well as through the two major smart assistants is a great start for this platform. If Hubspace goes on to later include HomeKit compatibility it will really stand out from those that have come before. It has a tremendous amount of promise especially with the different device options that come with it.

Limited reach

Despite all of these strengths I’m still skeptical. Hubspace is trying to grow in an environment where many other platforms have tried and failed especially those that are store-specific. Home Depot is an American institution which automatically limits the customer base of these products. Other brand-name smart devices have global reach like Ikea’s line of smart home devices. I have a lot of hope for Hubspace but I will reserve judgment until I have the chance to try it for myself.

Hardware store Home Depot has launched Hubspace a new smart home app that can be used with a variety of connected items to easily bring them together and control them using a phone. Home Depot says its Hubspace product is simple to use with the key aspect revolving around the scanning of QR codes found on compatible smart home products.

The Hubspace app is free to download from Google Play and the App Store; it can be used with connected products from certain brands that are sold at Home Depot stores including EcoSmart Hampton Bay and Commercial Electric. Products supported by the platform include everything from smart plugs and bulbs to bigger items like ceiling fans.

The Hubspace app is compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant meaning it will likely work with a smart speaker you already own. The idea is to simplify the smart home experience by controlling all of your compatible IoT products through the same platform.

According to Home Depot it designed the app to be 'intuitive' and easy enough for anyone to use. Adding new IoT products involves tapping a '+' icon and then scanning the QR code found on the device. Users are then walked through the setup steps which appear to be a simplified version of manually connecting to your WiFi network and linking the product.

Though these devices are already compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant the big benefit here appears to be for consumers who feel timid about setting up their IoT products. By offering an app that works with the various IoT items sold by Home Depot consumers have a single way to easily scan and connect new home products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA5L2lzLWhvbWUtZGVwb3Qtb3Blbi1vbi1sYWJvci1kYXktMjAyMS5odG1s0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmouY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDkvaXMtaG9tZS1kZXBvdC1vcGVuLW9uLWxhYm9yLWRheS0yMDIxLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Home Depot open on Labor Day 2021?,"Labor Day will be celebrated this year on Monday Sept. 6.

Born out of the organized labor movements of the 19th century and set for Monday Sept. 6 in 2021 it’s supposed to be a celebration of the contributions that workers have brought to America.

It’s also supposed to serve as a reminder of the rights and benefits that labor unions have fought for.

As we lurch through the second year of the pandemic — with an endless number of complaints that employees don’t want to go back to stagnant wages rude customers and insufficient protections — it’s worth looking at how the American worker has had to fight both companies and the U.S. government to win dignity rights and safety while on the clock.

Here are five documentaries that remind us how hard workers have fought and changed things for the better.

‘Blood on the Mountain’ (2016)

During World War I the coal miners of West Virginia realized that the war machine could not run without their help and started to organize. However once the patriotic fervor died down the bosses tried to peel back the workers’ hard-won benefits and reinstitute brutal labor practices. The subsequent fight to get them back is beautifully chronicled in directors Mari-Lynn Evans and Jordan Freeman’s “Blood on the Mountain.”

From the legendary work of activist Mother Jones to the terrible Battle of Blair Mountain (one of the only times the American government has bombed its own citizens) the movie shows the ridiculous lengths that mine owners and their allies in the government and law enforcement went to keep the miners from winning their rights. If you’re looking for the quintessential movie about the national labor movement this is the one to watch.

Watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime Video.

‘Amazon Empire: The Rise and Reign of Jeff Bezos’ (2020)

This PBS Frontline documentary isn’t specifically about the labor movement but it does offer a startling look into what it’s like to work at the Amazon fulfillment centers. Stories of harsh working conditions have circulated in recent years including how employees have resorted to relieving themselves into water bottles to not get penalized for bathroom breaks or the famous vending machines that dispense pain medicine for free instead of allowing workers enough time to rest from backbreaking labor.

The company’s antipathy to unionization led to government hearings which are deftly covered in the documentary. While not the most pro-labor film on this list Amazon’s prevalence makes how it treats its workforce an important issue for all.

Watch it: Available to stream for free on the PBS Frontline YouTube channel.

‘Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj: The Dark Side of the Video Game Industry’ (2019)

The gaming industry is going through a lot of upheavals these days as its long history of rampant worker abuse has become too big to ignore. One example is the accusations of sexual harassment at Blizzard Activision which include allegations of groping sexual proposition from management gender discrimination and one “World of Warcraft” developer who apparently would invite female co-workers to his “Bill Cosby suite.”

So far there hasn’t been one single cohesive documentary made about the game industry but Hasan Minhaj put out the best basic primer on how the companies mistreat their employees in the season four premiere of his Netflix show “Patriot Act.” In the episode he detailed everything from sexism to crunch — a period of intense overwork that companies demand of employees near the end of a game’s development so that they can make arbitrary marketing deadlines. Minhaj gives only a cursory glimpse into the problems but it is a great place to start for those hoping to understand how the industry maintains an exploitative business model by keeping fans and artists dazzled with the product.

Watch it: Available to stream on Netflix.

‘American Dream’ (1990)

One thing to note about the labor movement is that it is an ongoing battle where losses happen. That’s the premise behind Barbara Kopple’s Academy Award-winning documentary “American Dream.” The film follows the unsuccessful strike at the Hormel Foods factory in Austin Minn. in the mid-1980s. The plant’s union struck to fight back after the plant cut wages and worker benefits despite making millions in profits.

Kopple shows the increasing hardship that the workers went through as the plant hired replacements and the national union failed to back them. Hormel had once been a bastion of progressive employment that was corrupted by the anti-labor practices that dominated the ’80s. Systematically dismantling unions is a pervasive attitude that the capitalist class has only become more enamored with. The film should have been a wake-up call for how unions would continue to lose power.

Watch it: Streaming through various add-ons on Amazon Prime Video.

‘Finally Got the News … ’ (1970)

The labor movement has a troubled racial history. One film that highlights this unfortunate failure is the 1970 tale of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers which sought to form an independent union separate from the United Auto Workers at Detroit factories.

Recently unearthed and made available by Icarus Films the movie shows the power of organized labor fully radicalized by Marxist ideas to make changes in an industry where both greed and racism work to deprive workers of their due and dignity. Though the film is cobbled together from some less-than-professional footage it makes up for it in raw power and blistering ideological daring. No one saw the truth of the system that made Labor Day necessary like the League did and “Finally Got the News … ” is a delightful way to find the truth.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Kaneb H.P. Hood chairman and chief executive dies at 86,"Mike Kaneb had just launched Northeast Petroleum to enter the Boston market and the Navy allowed John to leave and take over the family-run company.

John A. Kaneb was a 24-year-old Navy officer with plans to return to his family’s Worcester-based oil business after his military service when he received word that his father had died.

“I had to step into my father’s shoes convince our creditors that I was capable of running the business and then prove it” Mr. Kaneb told an interviewer a half-century later.

His success at doing so was a first step toward becoming one of Greater Boston’s most prominent business executives. He later acquired a controlling interest in Gulf Oil and then purchased the H.P. Hood dairy company reinvigorating and expanding both businesses.

Mr. Kaneb who was Hood’s chairman and chief executive and whose extensive civic work included leading efforts to curb prison rape died Aug. 29. He was 86 lived in Manchester-by-the-Sea and his health had been slipping since heart surgery in May.

“I am so very blessed” Mr. Kaneb wrote in 1996 a sentiment he often expressed.

Determined to use his good fortune to help others Mr. Kaneb engaged in civic activities that ranged from lending his business acumen to major Boston institutions to playing a key role with initiatives that didn’t usually draw Harvard-educated business leaders.

He served on Massachusetts General Hospital’s board of trustees chaired the board at McLean Hospital was vice chairman of the Finance Council at the Boston Archdiocese and was a member of Harvard Medical School’s Board of Fellows.

Mr. Kaneb also served on the board of directors for the Innocence Project which works to exonerate the wrongfully convicted.

And former president George W. Bush appointed him vice chairman of the bipartisan National Prison Rape Elimination Commission an effort Mr. Kaneb helped gain prominence.

“I have long been appalled at the tolerance of rape and other sexual abuse in many of the nation’s jails and prisons” he wrote in 2006 for the 50th anniversary report of his Harvard class.

To prepare federal legislation that established the national commission Mr. Kaneb reached out to a friend from his Harvard days US Senator Edward M. Kennedy who worked with Republican lawmakers to create the panel.

“I have a hatred of bullying” Mr. Kaneb said in an interview for the book “Men Still at Work: Professionals Over 60 and On the Job.”

“Intimidation is rife in prisons” he added “and I simply felt something should be done about it.”

Chairman and chief executive of H.P. Hood until he died Mr. Kaneb was never interested in retiring which he likened to “crossing to the other side” in the “Men Still at Work” interview.

“Have a healthy respect for the consequences of retiring” he cautioned others. “Don’t go there casually or unprepared or you may regret it.”

Until the end Mr. Kaneb balanced work civic endeavors and time with friends many of whom sought his counsel.

“I felt I could turn to him for advice” said Drew Faust Harvard’s former president who valued his insights about Harvard Medical School and the city’s hospitals.

“He was wise and he didn’t push things on you. He really just tried to offer his wisdom and expand your own wisdom as well” she said. “I always felt I learned a lot from him and I appreciated him as a human being.”

Sometimes instead of meeting for lunch she joined Mr. Kaneb at Fenway Park where he was a part-owner of the Red Sox. “I learned a lot about the medical community from John” Faust said “and I learned a lot about the Red Sox too.”

A devoted baseball player in his youth and a dedicated fan all his life Mr. Kaneb was delighted to become part of the Red Sox organization having always longed to don a uniform.

“I am very grateful to have become part of Major League Baseball” he wrote for his 45th Harvard class report. “I would have much preferred to do so as a player but that did not come to pass so I had to pay my way in and become a limited partner in the Boston Red Sox; it’s lots of fun.”

The older of two brothers John A. Kaneb was born in Worcester on Dec. 14 1934.

His mother Rachel Couillard Kaneb was a nurse before marrying. His father Beton Michael Kaneb was known as Mike and ran an oil business in Worcester before forming Northeast Petroleum to take on the Boston market.

John graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Harvard College in 1956 then worked with his father’s business for a few months before entering Navy Officer Candidate School.

“I received my commission and entered the married state on virtually the same date” he recalled in his 25th class report.

Mr. Kaneb and Virginia Pyne who is known as Ginny married in 1957 and had six sons.

Taking over Northeast Petroleum when his father died was a turning point.

“It was a crash course in how to manage a growing family business that possessed very little professional management” he wrote “but after the company and I managed to survive a rather trying first year I was left with feeling that if I could survive that experience I could handle a number of things.”

For a while Mr. Kaneb’s younger brother Al joined him in the business.

“Whatever he was engaged in he engaged with intensity and maybe a strange phrase with loyalty” said Al who lives in Weston of his brother’s work in the business world and his endless involvement with organizations.

“He embraced them with a real passion” Al added “and he was open to engaging with causes and trying to improve what they were trying to do rather than just send a check.”

Among Mr. Kaneb’s friends was Peter Lynch the well-known money manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund who served with him on the archdiocese’s Finance Council.

“He was a devout Roman Catholic but to me he was also a catholic with a small ‘c’ — he had a universal love of everybody” Lynch said.

Though Mr. Kaneb never sought accolades for his business successes — “He was Mr. Low-Profile” Lynch said — he brought unchecked energy to Northeast Petroleum Catamount Petroleum (which Mr. Kaneb founded with his son Gary) Gulf Oil and Hood.

“John had a transmission with two gears: overdrive and off” Lynch said. “John was full of action. He just really wanted to do things.”

In addition to his wife Ginny; his brother Al; and his son Gary who lives in Manchester-by-the-Sea Mr. Kaneb leaves five other sons Stephen of Exeter N.H.; Peter and Jeff both of Manchester-by-the-Sea; Bruce of Newburyport; and Chris of Cambridge; 18 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

A funeral Mass has been said in Sacred Heart Church in Manchester-by-the-Sea. A celebration of his life will be announced.

Though Mr. Kaneb’s life was packed with work and civic duties at home “my mother and father were an absolute team” Gary said.

“He was not a remote father in any sense” Gary added. “For the boys he was a total presence.”

And for Mr. Kaneb having family close by was a treat he never took for granted.

“All of our six sons five daughters-in-law and 18 grandchildren live within 25 miles so we see family often” he wrote a few months after he and Ginny celebrated their 53rd anniversary. “We are blessed.”

Esta es una pregunta que ha motivado múltiples estudios desarrollados por científicos y estudiosos del tema sobre exoplanetas.

Con cierta persistencia es que se menciona a Marte como una posibilidad que en un futuro todavía lejano sería capaz de dar cabida a la especie humana. Otros estudios enfocan sus telescopios mucho más allá de nuestro sistema solar.

Ejemplo de ello es el reciente descubrimiento que realizaron astrónomos de la Universidad de Cambridge quienes presentaron una investigación en la cual se identifican una nueva clase de exoplanetas muy diferentes a la Tierra pero que tendrían las condiciones necesarias para albergar la vida.

El estudio publicado en The Astrophysical Journal detalla sobre la posibilidad de una nueva clase de planetas habitables denominados ‘Hycean’. Estos están cubiertos por océanos con atmósferas ricas en hidrógeno.

“Los planetas Hycean abren una nueva vía en nuestra búsqueda de vida en otros planetas.” Nikku Madhusudhan

Hasta ahora muchas investigaciones de su tipo exploraban la posibilidad de encontrar cuerpos celestes similares a nuestro planeta en tamaño masa temperatura y composición atmosférica.

Sin embargo los exoplanetas que fueron identificados pueden ser hasta 2.6 veces más grandes que la Tierra y sus superficies alcanzarían temperaturas atmosféricas de hasta casi 200 grados Celsius. A pesar de ello reúnen condiciones aceptables por lo que incluso podrían contener algunas formas de vida.

Esto último no ha sido comprobado debido a que la tecnología actual no permite estudiarlos de cerca. No obstante los astrónomos sí pueden buscar ciertas biofirmas para identificar la posibilidad de vida en ellos. Entre estos se encuentran la presencia de: oxígeno ozono metano y óxido nitroso.

“Una detección de biofirma transformaría nuestra comprensión de la vida en el universo” resaltó Nikky Madhusudhan del Instituto de Astronomía de Cambridge quien dirigió la investigación.

Por esta razón la nueva investigación sobre estos exoplanetas arrojaría luz a las probabilidades de encontrar y albergar vida fuera de la Tierra.

Las variedades de pozole van desde batido de trigo y hasta de frijol. Mientras que el origen de este platillo típico mexicano se remonta a la época prehispánica cuando era un plato ritual que se hacía con carne humana; los más comunes se preparan con el maíz cacahuazintle aunque también hay versiones menos conocidas que se preparan con elote y frijol.

El origen del pozole

El uso de maíz cacahuazintle es algo que sobrevive hasta nuestros días desde tiempos prehispánicos cuando se le daba un tratamiento ritual en honor al Señor Desollado según cuentan los cronistas del siglo XVI.

Existe pozole para todos los gustos. | Foto: Getty Images

El ritual incluía el sacrificio de un cautivo para usar su carne en la preparación del pozole. El muslo derecho considerado lo más rico se le daba al Tlatoani. Mientras que el muslo izquierdo y los brazos se destinaban a quien consumaba el sacrificio.

“No era un platillo de consumo diario sólo se utilizaba para ceremonias y estaba restringido para nobles y guerreros”. Yolanda García González del Programa Universitario de Alimentos (PUAL) de la UNAM.

Con la llegada de los españoles se empezó a usar la carne de cerdo en vez de la humana en un mestizaje culinario que también habría servido para reforzar las nuevas enseñanzas como lo que hicieron con los judios de Granada que los obligaron a adoptar el consumo de carne de cerdo por lo que se “puede presuponer que lo mismo ocurrió en México” considera la doctora Yolanda García.

“El orégano yucateco es de un sabor y olor predominante comparado con el que existe en el resto del país” de ahí su particularidad.

“El chile chawa seco cultivado únicamente en Yucatán es otro sabor inusual porque no se consigue muy a menudo pero le aporta un pico sutil al pozole rojo”. Moisés Brito Góngora gastrónomo.

Además existen dos variantes de los pozoles verde blanco y rojo que son el de productos del mar y el vegetariano.

Guerrero

En esta región el pozole se prepara con cabeza de cerdo y carne de res para darle un sabor intenso.

También se puede comer el famoso pozole verde preparado con caldo a base de pepita de calabaza y tomate verde acompañado de trozos de chicharrón y aguacate ¡un agasajo al paladar!

La especialista del Programa Universitario de Alimentos (PUAL) de la UNAM destaca la tradición de los jueves pozoleros en Guerrero siendo Chilpancingo donde el pozole verde es una tradición aún casi ritual.

Sonora

En este estado el caldo de pozole es típicamente rojo y se prepara con chiles verdes como Anaheim o Chilaca pero también se usa el chile colorado además de salsa de tomate. Su carne principal proviene del cerdo su caldo suele ser muy picante.

Aguascalientes

En este estado se suele comer el pozole tanto rojo como blanco pero lo que lo diferencia de las demás regiones en cuanto a la proteína es que este puede llevar lengua de res como ingrediente principal y como se ha mencionado su caldo es particularmente espeso.

Jalisco

El pozole se prepara con chile guajillo o chile ancho y lleva carne de cerdo sobre todo cabeza espinazo y pierna.

Colima Nayarit y Michoacán

En esta parte de la República se puede encontrar pozole preparado con mariscos común de la región del pacífico. En estos estados al igual que en Michoacán como ya lo hemos mencionado se puede encontrar una variante de este platillo hecho con frijol en lugar de maíz.

Puebla

En este estado del centro del país el pozole se suele comer con carne de pollo lo que lo hace el más ligero y reducido en grasa de todos además de que suele ser blanco.

Pozole vegetariano

El pozole vegetariano es una opción que recientemente se ha convertido en una variedad muy popular es el adecuado para las personas que no consumen ningún tipo de carne. Se prepara blanco o rojo.

Para sustituir la consistencia de la carne se le agrega trigo o setas y se sigue la receta original. Al momento de preparar el caldo se agrega una variedad de hierbas de olor para dar más sabor.

Sin embargo este caldo de carne y maíz tiene un origen que puede parecer terrorífico y tiene que ver con el canibalismo prehispánico.

Origen del platillo

Pero hablemos de su origen. La historia del pozole -como muchos de los platillos típicos en nuestro país- se remonta a las civilizaciones prehispánicas según narran algunas crónicas del periodo colonial temprano del siglo XVI como el Códice Florentino o el Magliabechiano.

Aunque la fecha de invención o civilización de origen del pozole ha sido un tema a discusión entre los historiadores a lo largo del tiempo ya que no se han podido encontrar registros contundentes sobre dónde se creó primero esa forma de alimento.

Posiblemente como ocurre con los tamales viene del intercambio cultural entre los diferentes pueblos de la región que tenían el dominio del maíz como cultivo base de su alimentación.

Lo que sí se sabe es que a la llegada de los españoles los mexicas consumían de forma recurrente un platillo llamado “tlacatlaolli” que en náhuatl significa “maíz de hombre” según explica el arqueólogo Enrique Vela en la revista Arqueología Mexicana.

Y lo de “maíz de hombre” era en sentido literal pues la base del caldo era el maíz cacahuazintle y la carne humana de sacrificio. Así es está comprobado que los mexicas practicaban la antropofagia (canibalismo).

El ritual del sacrificio humano y el pozole

Fray Bernardino de Sahagún en la Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva España relata que los mexicas “cocían aquella carne con maíz y daban a cada uno un pedazo de aquella carne en una escudilla o caxete con su caldo y su maíz cocido y llamaba a aquella sopa tlacatlaolli”.

Pero el sacrificio humano y el consumo de su carne era todo un ritual en el que un guerrero capturaba a un enemigo de su mismo rango en el campo de batalla y en el Templo Mayor estos cautivos eran sacrificados y les sacaban el corazón para “alimentar a los dioses”. “Los sacerdotes hacían una incisión por debajo de la caja torácica y por ahí introducían la mano para sacar el corazón” afirma la arqueóloga Ximena Chávez en su libro Sacrificio Humano y Tratamientos Post Sacrificiales en el Templo Mayor de Tenochtitlan.

Una vez que sacaban el corazón el cuerpo de los guerreros era aventado por las escalinatas del Templo Mayor donde caían rodando para luego ser llevados a una zona donde se desmembraban. Luego esta carne “sagrada” se ponía a cocer en agua con maíz después se desmenuzaba y se utilizaba para hacer tamales o lo que conocemos ahora como pozole. La comida era repartida entre los familiares del guerrero y sus vecinos.

Y es que el comer carne humana iba más allá de la supervivencia pues tenía que ver con toda una cosmovisión de supremacía mexica la cuál los hacía sentirse conectados con sus dioses además de poderosos guerreros.

La evolución del pozole hasta nuestros días

Con la llegada de los españoles y la caída del imperio mexica el pozole perduró como platillo entre los indígenas; sin embargo se modificó y comenzó a prepararse con carne de animales traídos de Europa como el cerdo el cuál “tiene un sabor parecido a la carne humana” como afirman algunas crónicas. Esto con la intención de adaptarse al calendario santoral y litúrgico de la iglesia católica.

El nombre del platillo también cambió por la palabra náhuatl “pozolli” que según El breve diccionario de mexicanismos de la Academia Mexicana de la Lengua significa “espumoso” esto debido a la espuma que se forma con la cocción del máiz.

Con el paso del tiempo las distintas regiones del país fueron adaptando el platillo y agregándole ingredientes hasta dar como resultado las variedades que conocemos hoy en día siendo uno de los platillos distintivos más populares de México en nuestro país y en el mundo.

El pozole como platillo típico de las fiestas patrias puede haber surgido debido a que en dicha época del año se cosecha el maíz cacahuacintle ingrediente del guisado original; sin embargo durante todo el año es consumido en todo el país por su delicioso sabor y su profunda historia.

La evolución y origen del pozole nos habla sobre la cosmovisión de los pueblos indígenas y cómo el mestizaje modificó para siempre la gastronomía mexicana la cuál es reconocida en la actualidad como Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial de la Humanidad por la Unesco y de la cuál no podemos hablar sin darle su merecido lugar al pozole. ¡Buen provecho!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ0dmUuZXMvZGVwb3J0ZXMvMjAyMTA5MDQvdG9raW8tMjAyMS1qdWVnb3MtcGFyYWxpbXBpY29zLWRlcG9ydGUtaHVtYW5vLzIxNjc3MjQuc2h0bWzSAWFodHRwczovL2FtcC5ydHZlLmVzL2RlcG9ydGVzLzIwMjEwOTA0L3Rva2lvLTIwMjEtanVlZ29zLXBhcmFsaW1waWNvcy1kZXBvcnRlLWh1bWFuby8yMTY3NzI0LnNodG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tokyo 2020 | La cara más humana del deporte paralímpico,"Los Juegos Paralímpicos de Tokyo cierran este domingo el telón hasta que renazcan en París dentro de tres años.

Los miembros del equipo técnico no sólo están ahí para dar un empujón también son los brazos a los que corren los deportistas cuando ganan el título que llevan años esperando. En las competiciones individuales los atletas cruzan la meta solos pero el último sprint lo hacen para saborear el éxito con los suyos. Detrás de cada logro hay duros días de entrenamiento años de esfuerzo y toda la ilusión. Conseguirlo es un sueño que a veces se cumple. Por eso no hay nada como ver a la tunecina Raoua Tlili abrazarse a su entrenador tras ganar el oro y batir el récord mundial en la final de lanzamiento de bala en la categoría F41.

Normalmente el ser humano se ha acostumbrado a ver el mundo 3D en el que vive reducido a 2D ya sea en el arte la fotografía o el cine. Sin embargo al cerrar los ojos ¿cómo se visualizan las cosas que ya se han visto? Un nuevo estudio dirigido por las universidades de Plymouth y Essex (Reino Unido) ha investigado esta cuestión y ha descubierto que muchos adultos se resisten a imaginar su propia visión como si fuera una imagen plana sino que la ven en su forma totalmente procesada y cargada de conocimiento es decir en 3D.



Los resultados se obtuvieron cuando los investigadores mostraron a 58 adultos dos líneas en una pared ambas de la misma longitud pero una de ellas estaba más cerca del participante y por tanto parecía visualmente más larga.



A pesar de la instrucción de basar sus juicios en la apariencia específicamente (es decir la línea más cercana debería ser más larga) aproximadamente la mitad de los participantes juzgaron que las líneas parecían iguales. Cuando tomaron una foto de las líneas y se les preguntó por su longitud en la imagen sus respuestas cambiaron; ahora la línea más cercana parecía más larga. Sin embargo cuando se les volvió a preguntar por su propia visión volvieron a su respuesta original.



Esto sugiere que incluso cuando los participantes son explícitamente conscientes de cómo podría ser una imagen 2D de su visión tratan la información sensorial real de manera diferente con una resistencia considerable a ver lo que se conoce como ""representaciones proximales"" de la visión esto es cómo aparecen las cosas antes de que el cerebro haya tenido la oportunidad de corregir aspectos como el tamaño relativo y la distancia.



""Es complejo y emocionante descubrir cómo cada uno de nosotros ve y visualiza cosas diferentes y el hecho de que la mitad de nuestra población de estudio no pensara en 2D fue un hallazgo muy interesante"" ha explicado el autor principal el doctor Steven Samuel profesor de psicología en la Universidad de Plymouth.



""La siguiente pregunta que hay que hacerse es ¿por qué pensaban así estas personas? ¿Es que no podían pensar en 2D o que decidieron no hacerlo? No lo sabemos con certeza pero una de las explicaciones es que las personas se resisten al principio de que la visión puede equipararse a una imagen plana siendo la visión 'corregida' el único tipo de visión que podrían concebir razonablemente"" señala el autor. ""Esto implica que los adultos son reacios a considerar la visión como una imagen próxima incluso cuando el contexto es favorable a ese comportamiento. Sin embargo no significa que sean necesariamente incapaces de hacerlo"" concluye el experto.

Freshmen cheering as the Gophers marching band played the ""Minnesota Rouser"" and pyrotechnics shot into the air.

The University of Minnesota's flagship campus came roaring back to life last week as thousands of students returned to town ready for a fall semester they hope will be better than the last. A sense of excitement was in the air as new and returning students settled in at the Twin Cities campus participated in school spirit events and watched the Gophers football team battle the Ohio State Buckeyes in front of a sold-out stadium.

At the same time professors and graduate student instructors continued to raise concerns about the safety of in-person classes and events amid the COVID-19 pandemic with the highly infectious delta variant circulating. The fall semester starts Tuesday.

""We are so happy to see you here today"" U President Joan Gabel told some 6000 masked freshmen during a new student convocation event inside 3M Arena at Mariucci on Thursday. ""Let's all agree to have a great start to the school year and make the next four years the most memorable of your life.""

Scores of freshmen decked out in maroon and gold made campus dormitories their new home earlier in the week. Gabel the Goldy Gopher mascot and even Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stopped by to help students unload their belongings.

On Wednesday night the class of 2025 lined up in the shape of a giant ""M"" on the Huntington Bank Stadium football field and had its picture taken.

Freshmen in stands awaited the start of the Pride & Spirit event at Huntington Bank Stadium on Wednesday night where they learned how to cheer like Gophers before gathering on the field for a portrait in a giant “M” outlined by marching band members.

At the convocation the U's largest freshmen class in more than 50 years — totaling as many as 6700 students — sat shoulder to shoulder and received a ceremonious welcome. Gabel and student speakers urged the freshmen to make the most of their college experience. And the marching band gave a rousing performance dancing in front of the students and urging them to sing along to school songs.

U freshman Addy Yeow said the ceremony only increased her eagerness to be on campus. ""I'm very excited for college football games and being part of the U community"" said Yeow who will study kinesiology.

Pregame festivities began early Thursday ahead of the Gophers' evening game against Ohio State University.

Both Gophers and Buckeyes fans were spotted in Dinkytown visiting local bars and restaurants which beckoned customers with signs supporting the home team. Dinkytown businesses some still understaffed and struggling amid the pandemic embraced the rush of customers.

""Everything is up from 2020"" said Randal Gast owner of Qdoba Mexican Eats and a member of the Dinkytown Business Alliance. ""But [the pandemic] is not over yet.""

Many welcomed the renewed activity at the Twin Cities campus which was much quieter last fall with fewer students living on campus and most classes being taught online. The pandemic's impact on campus life was much more evident then with freshmen having to abide by curfews and restrictions in dorms and student groups fraternities and sororities canceling in-person events.

""Isn't this great? … They're back to the way it was"" said longtime season-ticket holder John Borden 63 as he grilled in a tailgating lot near the stadium. He and his 32-year-old son Grant were excited to attend their first Gophers football game since before the pandemic.

At fraternity houses along University Avenue students wearing maroon and gold overalls played beer pong as music blared from loudspeakers. One group of fraternity students sat near the street with a sign saying ""You honk we drink"" cheering and raising their red cups every time a driver obliged.

An hour before kickoff hundreds of students could be seen partying in front of the fraternity houses most of them huddled together and not wearing masks.

U junior Dakota Heimerl a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity reveled in the pregame activities but acknowledged such events likely ""aren't going to last long."" Heimerl works as a scribe in a local emergency room and is well aware the pandemic isn't over. He said his fraternity is supportive of mask mandates and most members are vaccinated.

""Once those lockdowns start coming again as they will with the delta variant we're going to be shut down"" Heimerl said adding he thinks a forced shift back to online learning is inevitable.

About 80% of the U's fall classes are slated to be taught in person. Last fall about 70% of classes were taught online and all shifted to distance learning after Thanksgiving.

The only restrictions in place this year are indoor masking and COVID-19 vaccination requirements measures U leaders hope will help preserve an in-person fall semester.

Many professors staff and graduate student instructors are concerned the university is not being careful enough.

An open letter signed by hundreds of faculty staff and students called the university's vaccination mandate ""toothless and flimsy"" noting it only requires students to submit the dates they were vaccinated and not the actual documentation.

It also calls for there to be more immediate consequences for those who do not comply. Students have until Oct. 8 to submit their vaccination status. If they do not they will be ""prohibited from registering for classes in the future"" according to the university's website.

""It would be great if we could all just come back to in-person classes"" said Husain Agha a plant and microbial biology Ph.D. candidate at the U. ""But we really need to balance whether or not that is the best thing for everybody.""

GOLDEN VALLEY Minn. — The Minnesota Wild has unveiled the jersey the team will wear in the 2022 NHL Winter Classic.

The Wild made the big reveal at its Minnesota State Fair booth at 10 a.m. Saturday -- and KARE 11's Dave Schwartz got a front-row preview.

While the jersey is out of the bag there's still plenty of time before the game itself. The Wild will host the St. Louis Blues in the 2022 NHL Winter Classic on Saturday Jan. 1 2022 outdoors at Target Field.

This will be the second NHL outdoor game hosted in Minnesota but the first Winter Classic. The Wild hosted the Chicago Blackhawks at TCF Bank Stadium (now Huntington Bank Stadium) in 2016 as part of the NHL's Stadium Series.

According to the NHL this is the league's 13th Winter Classic ever. The Wild is the 10th team to host it and the 14th team to participate.

They presided over the matchup between the fourth-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes and the Minnesota Golden Gophers played at Huntington Bank Stadium in Minneapolis Minnesota. The trio brought excitement to the broadcast but at times overdramatized the action hastily making up their minds about various aspects of the game. (Johnson Taft and Klatt l-r)

Here are my ten observations :

1.Klatt did a good job of preparing for the matchup by bringing in tidbits about how the teams did in 2020. Ohio State finished below program standards with 2.6 sacks per game last season which was good enough for 36th in the nation. I thought it was a good observation to bring up early in the game so that viewers were able to compare how the Buckeyes look this season compared to last when they advanced to the National Championship. (Alabama hammered the Buckeyes 52-24 for the title.)

2. Johnson has good chemistry with both Klatt and sideline reporter Jenny Taft referring to her as “JT” throughout the broadcast. Johnson and Klatt do a good job of interacting with one other during the matchup. This makes sense as Klatt has hosting experience with Fox’ NFL Kickoff which he hosted from 2013-14. Klatt uses his past experience in the lead role to seamlessly converse with Johnson which keeps viewers engaged.

3. Ohio State quarterback CJ Stroud threw an interception part of the way through the second quarter that helped swing the momentum in Minnesota’s favor. Johnson then infused a quote from Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck whose goal was to “make Ohio State’s coaches coach”. Fleck understood Minnesota’s position as an underdog in this game albeit a line of 14 points is commonly seen in college football.

4. After the interception Johnson was pushing the narrative that Stroud might not have been the right choice to be Ohio State’s starting quarterback. Doing this was a bit premature as other recent Ohio State quarterbacks have also had their struggles early on in their careers. In the Buckeyes’ last National Championship-winning season in 2014 quarterback J.T. Barrett went 9-29 with three interceptions in the team’s only loss that season (35-21 at home against Virginia Tech) which was far worse than Stroud who was 7-12 at that point in the game and finished 13 of 22 for 294 yards 4 TDs and an interception. (Ohio State still led 10-7 at this point). Johnson had a preconceived notion based on a quarter and a half of seeing Stroud in action which I found frustrating.

5. Johnson (and to a degree Klatt) tend to sensationalize what they are seeing on the field. Down 14-10 Ohio State faced a third down late in the second quarter. Klatt called the play “the biggest play of (CJ Stroud’s) life. Blanket statements like these contribute to the overdramatization of the game.

6. Both Johnson and Klatt talked about Minnesota’s “belief” that they would have a chance to win the game. They relied on this talking-point throughout the game and it felt like a typical storyline a highly-ranked team against an unranked opponent. The viewer knows that the team believes they have a chance to win because if they didn’t why would they even take the field? Johnson and Klatt were over-reliant on clichés throughout the broadcast.

7. Despite it being a cliché Minnesota’s belief was evident throughout the game in fairness to Johnson and Klatt. Every time Minnesota needed a play Klatt said they were able to come up with that big play and keep the game competitive. He said this after Ohio State took a 24-21 lead in the third quarter. Saying so was smart as Minnesota kept the game within two scores and Ohio State never pulled away in the game.

8. Ohio State defensive-end Zach Harrison forced a fumble on Minnesota quarterback Tanner Morgan that led to a fumble return touchdown for the Buckeyes. Klatt talked about how Harrison needs to impress NFL scouts with this being his junior season. This added context to the role that Harrison may have with the Buckeyes this season and his to show his skillset for the future. Making a highlight-reel play will contribute to so.

9. Johnson and Klatt have called many Ohio State games the past few seasons. (Fox owns the Big Ten rights.) One Buckeye player they have seen a lot of since the Ohio State-Michigan game in 2018 is wide receiver Chris Olave. The duo have watched Olave improve into arguably the top wide receiver prospect in the 2022 NFL Draft. When Olave caught his second touchdown of the game to give Ohio State a 45-31 lead Johnson and Klatt conversed about how impressed they’ve been with Olave’s improvement. “You can just see it what a player” Johnson said.

10. On the possession after Olave’s second score Ohio State safety Lathan Ransom laid a hit on Minnesota receiver Mike Brown-Stephens. Brown-Stephens had to be helped off the field and it was debatable whether Ransom should have been flagged for targeting. Johnson and Klatt had an intriguing discussion about this as Klatt thought there should have been targeting on the play. Johnson disagreed but both agreed that there should be tiers to targeting so Ransom could have stayed in the game while still being penalized for the hit. Targeting was not called on the play.

Johnson Klatt and Taft have obvious strengths as a team. Most importantly they have chemistry. Sometimes they can overreact in the spur of the moment which takes discounts from the broader game story.

The team will also call today’s contest between 19th-ranked Penn State and 12th-ranked Wisconsin on the first Big Noon Kickoff game of the season for FOX.",,,

The sprawling 208-acre campus known as IBM Kingston brought about massive changes to the housing retail and economic landscape of the area. To this day you can still often bump into a former “Beemer.”

Founded in 1911 by Thomas Watson Sr. in Endicott New York the company was originally called the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). Its presence in the Hudson Valley began in a former pickle factory in Poughkeepsie in 1941 with a subsidiary called Munitions Manufacturing Company formed to produce rifles cannons and aircraft fire-control systems during World War II. After the war the facility shifted to manufacturing punchcard calculators and electric typewriters. As the Cold War escalated the U.S. Air Force contracted with IBM to develop a national air defense network known as SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment).

By the early Fifties the Poughkeepsie plant was running out of space. Fred Eisler owner of the Stuyvesant hotel in Kingston had been friends with IBM president Thomas Watson Jr. for more than four decades. He suggested Kingston.

The countryside was growing in popularity especially as urban areas were considered a greater threat to Soviet attack and automobile use was rapidly expanding. The New York State Thruway‘s Ulster County segment was completed in 1954-’55 and the last segment from Yonkers to Bronx a year later. The Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge across the Hudson River began construction in 1954 and opened in 1957. During the two years it took to build the new facility IBM rented space for its first 40 employees in a former bowling alley called Ruzzo Bowlatorium on Grand Street in Midtown.

IBM Kingston opened in November 1956 with one division for the electric typewriter and one for SAGE. The first real-time data processor in existence SAGE took nine years and $18 billion to develop. It was built tested and the personnel were trained at the Kingston facility. One of the company‘s other well-known products the IBM System 360 was a popular and successful mainframe assembled tested shipped and supported in Kingston.

In July 1994. in the middle of a $8.9-billion company restructuring IBM announced it would close its 2.4-million-square-foot facility in Kmgston and transfer operations there elsewhere.

It was the end of an era. Today Ulster County has less than a quarter of the manufacturing labor force it boasted of during the heyday of IBM.

The Trade Assistant with IBM Watson tool has long helped ESPN Fantasy Football players but now IBM Watson's AI technology will help users create ""customizable and simplified trade packages"" IBM explained.

The new features were officially unveiled on September 3 for ESPN Fantasy Football users through the ESPN Fantasy App on iOS and Android.

Within the ESPN Fantasy Football app trades will be easier to understand for users and trade packages will be suggested based on your personalized ""Players of Interest"" watch list.

Watson will also let users know what players they should and should not trade during the season as well as which positions to trade and trade for. Users will also see ""No Brainer"" trade suggestions built to help less experienced players by providing more straightforward trade recommendations.

Watson will even offer players data comparing their weekly scoring averages to other teams in their league before and after potential trades. There will be ""fair trade"" insights provided by IBM's AI and ""boom"" or ""bust"" percentages for a team before and after a trade.

""Trade Assistant with IBM Watson uses IBM Watson Discovery's natural language processing capabilities to suggest trades and provide player insights by extracting translating and reviewing data points like: player stats media coverage (news articles blogs podcast transcripts) and experts' sentiment"" IBM explained in a statement.

Chris Jason senior director of product management within the fantasy sports division of ESPN's parent company Disney said IBM's technologies help to make ESPN Fantasy Football more interactive for fans and differentiated from other products.

""Players of all levels can use the IBM Trade Assistant and Player Insights tools to make more informed decisions and better compete against their friends which creates a more engaging experience"" Jason said.

IBM vice president of sports and entertainment partnerships Noah Syken explained that IBM Watson is helping make sense of complex data while creating interactive customizable experiences using AI and cloud technology.

""The same technologies in the Fantasy Football app that explain trades can also help streamline complexities improve workflows and engage customers for businesses of all sizes"" Syken added.

IBM and ESPN teamed up to make the changes as interest in fantasy football continues to skyrocket. IBM's own studies have shown that during the COVID-19 pandemic there was a 290% increase in the number of US adults playing fantasy football.

John Kent program manager for sports and entertainment partnerships at IBM told ZDNet that since the partnership started five years ago ESPN and IBM have been collaborating on Trade Assistant and new AI features in the ESPN Fantasy App.

""As we've seen the fantasy football audience growing we realize that there are people with different knowledge levels about the game. We want the fantasy football experience to be engaging entertaining and accessible for everyone playing whether it's a seasoned pro or a first-time player"" Kent said.

""ESPN wants to make a more engaging experience and provide tools that differentiate their platform and help the 'average' fantasy player improve. Introducing Trade Assistant with Watson simplifies the process of trading. If it's easy and helps improve your roster it will be more utilized. We also implemented some changes to simplify trade suggestions in Trade Assistant with Watson based on user feedback. We noticed that players were less likely to do more complex '2 for 3' player trades (meaning swap two of my players for three of yours) and were more inclined to do '1 for 1' trades.""

ESPN is now able to streamline the process of constructing and training models while providing in-depth analysis into why certain decisions were made thanks to IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI capabilities and the IBM Research AI Fairness 360 toolkit. Trade Assistant runs on IBM Cloud and ESPN will be able to address bias or unfair predictions along selected attributes such as a player's team.

IBM said the technologies backing both the Player Insights with Watson feature and the Trade Assistant with Watson tool use AI that runs on a hybrid cloud architecture. The features are built on containerized apps using Red Hat OpenShift and run on IBM Cloud IBM noted.

Kent added that the goal of these features is to make the game more engaging and fun for all fans. By using the Trade Assistant with Watson to simplify the process of trading Kent explained that it will be utilized more often by players.

""We've also introduced new features to explain why specific trades are suggested to offer transparency into the data and analytics behind trades"" Kent said.

""Ultimately these updates make for a more active league which is a more fun league. Trading is a dynamic feature of fantasy football that can be under-utilized because it is intimidating. Trade Assistant makes trading more manageable and gives fantasy managers more confidence in their options and trades driving more engagement and upping the fun factor.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbmV3cy9xdWFudHVtLWNvZGluZy10b3AtNS1za2lsbHMtaW5kaWEtam9icy1pYm0tNTQ4NzQ4Lmh0bWzSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9uZXdzL3F1YW50dW0tY29kaW5nLXRvcC01LXNraWxscy1pbmRpYS1qb2JzLWlibS01NDg3NDguaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Empowering Quantum Jobs: Top Five Skills For Quantum Coding That Will Be In Demand,"Over the past couple of years there has been a significant interest in Quantum Computing and the areas in which this technology can be used. Quantum computing offers a great opportunity to get into an exciting new area of technology that will very likely allow humanity to harness science for overall development which will significantly impact many industries and societies.

Quantum computers are getting ready to augment their classical cousins in meaningful tasks achieving what we call ‘The Quantum Advantage’. Further we see hardware development has been growing at exponential speed and software stack and abstractions are in place as well.

While hardware evolves rapidly there is an increasing need to develop software skills to program quantum hardware and to explore applications in areas like finance healthcare life sciences natural sciences and manufacturing. Infact a survey from BurningGlass Technologies notes that the demand for quantum skills is expected to grow 135% in the next five years.

Quantum Skill Development | IBM

The Indian government has called out quantum computing as one of the major technology disruptions that will likely change the entire paradigm of computation communication and encryption. It has announced a National Mission on Quantum Technologies & Applications to focus on quantum technologies. While the mission’s mandate is broader a strong component of it is to develop skilled manpower and to develop the industry ecosystem to prepare for this disruption and for India to lead it.

This is particularly pertinent for India as the software sector generates over $175B of revenue is nearly 8% of GDP and employs nearly 4 million people (investindia.gov.in). Today quantum computing is at a nascent stage and it is an opportune moment for India to take the lead and develop a strong developer workforce that is ready for the quantum era that beckons us.

Preparing for the Quantum World

The Quantum programming paradigm has gained a lot of attention in the last few years with an array of assembly formats programming languages and software development kits. Much like in the classical world quantum programming has now increasingly been done in high-level language with a “transpiler” that transforms and compiles to quantum hardware. An interesting part of quantum computing is that it is a technology born in the cloud and built on today’s hybrid-cloud technologies.

This means that it is going to have to work with classical computers use the same programming languages but in a new design and compilation format. Quantum kernel developers are creating high-performance quantum circuits and have begun to develop new instructions for solving real world problems. The development in the Quantum field is changing rapidly; developers must be adaptable and comfortable dealing with these uncertainties.

Quantum Skill Development | IBM

It is important for developers to understand that quantum hardware is required only at the kernel level and the remaining software stack is largely hardware agnostic; it requires some understanding of quantum computing and deeper knowledge of algorithms and software. Developers are relying on circuits to develop groundbreaking quantum algorithms that might provide an advantage over present-day classical solutions.

Today a lot of the quantum computing software is open source for example Qiskit which is Python based. This means developers can easily pick up these languages and build them according to the needs of the industry domain and ecosystem of which they are a part. These Quantum models developed are used in real-world cases in automotive finance chemicals medical optimization and machine learning.

Top five skills required for Quantum coding:

Programming and algorithms: Developers should have a good grasp of languages like Python Q# Scaffold among many others for quantum programming. Developers need to understand the usage of these new features in new quantum application contexts. AI/ML/DL: Developers can potentially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms like quantum variational algorithms by leveraging deeper understanding of optimisers from classical AI/ML/DL contexts. Open-Source: Quantum Software Development Kits like Qiskit are built on open-source platforms. Developers should understand how to develop test deploy open-source packages design new features or fix issues on the open-source platform.

IBM

Scientific computing: This skill helps identify computational hard portions of the compute which will help the developer identify the kernels of code that can potentially benefit while coding for quantum computing. Analytical reasoning and collaboration: As Quantum is a highly inter-disciplinary domain that requires working in a team with different skills reasoning skills and collaborative spirit are sought after.

Building Quantum Skills through certification

India has one of the largest software developer populations in the world having deep skills in cloud computing AI and Data Science. These developers are well placed to pick up quantum computing skills. As companies look to hire developers to find new quantum-powered workflows that will radically reshape their industry quantum certifications are likely to bring about a level of standardization. Certified skills are likely to be highly valued by the industry and likely to improve career prospects significantly.

Certifications for quantum coding

One can explore the first quantum industry developer certification from IBM where they can explore several free and paid short-term online courses to advance their skills in the Quantum computing area.

IBM

Free learning material in the form of open-source textbooks and videos are also available in Indian languages.

Conclusion

Quantum computers with over 1000 qubits are projected to be available as early as 2023 – just a couple of years away. Given the technology’s disruptive potential the industry has started mobilizing resources to grasp early learnings and start the journey to quantum.

The key to success in the journey is a strong well-skilled quantum workforce. For an individual developer this is a career defining opportunity as quantum programming skills will be highly valued. For India it is vital to grab this opportunity to secure a leadership position in Innovation that is Made in India for India and the World.

Opinion expressed here is authors alone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA5LzA1LzMtdG9wLWFpLXN0b2Nrcy10by1idXktcmlnaHQtbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Top AI Stocks to Buy Right Now,"These companies are still growing -- and have plenty of opportunities ahead of them.

Looking for a great way to invest in artificial intelligence? When scouring the market for great stocks sometimes the best buy is one that's already in your portfolio. According to three Fool.com contributors that's just the case with these three AI stocks: DigitalOcean (DOCN 10.22%) IBM (IBM 0.53%) and LendingClub (LC -2.38%). Here's why we'd buy each of these AI companies again in a heartbeat.

Making tech work for small businesses too

Nicholas Rossolillo (DigitalOcean): I was first drawn to this stock because of its focus on small businesses and aspiring digital entrepreneurs. Cloud computing and all of its ancillary tech like AI (which is often handled at a remote data center and delivered via an internet connection) can be expensive to implement -- and tricky to figure out how to make work.

But DigitalOcean is trying to break down some of the barriers that have held many small businesses back from putting cutting-edge technology to work. In fact this young company has over 602000 customers in 185 countries and it's still going strong. Its key to success? Making it affordable to build and launch a new digital product (as little as $5 a month) and making it easy to get started (code can be written and deployed in minutes).

For those trying to get educated on cloud computing DigitalOcean has an extensive library of online tutorials and blogs that can even be used by developers working on a different cloud service (since DigitalOcean is an open source platform). Included in its educational library: how to put AI and machine learning (a branch of AI in which a computing system learns from experience) to use.

I recently purchased shares and I plan on buying again in the future. Small business spending on the cloud is growing at a double-digit rate and DigitalOcean expects it can grow its sales at about a 30% clip this year and into 2022. It's also profitable a rarity among small fast-growing firms like this. The stock is up 65% since its IPO this past spring. However at 18 times expected current year sales DigitalOcean still looks like a long-term value if it can maintain its momentum.

IBM: Low prices huge dividend yields and a market-leading AI package

Anders Bylund (IBM): Good old International Business Machines is not just a respected name in the field of artificial intelligence but the clear-cut leader in this $156 billion market according to IDC. Big Blue sowed the seeds to its Watson AI engine decades ago and has nurtured that asset into a problem-solving system with serious business chops.

The company's entire business model is now focused on Watson-powered artificial intelligence delivered in a variety of hybrid cloud computing models.

""We fundamentally believe that core to the competitiveness of every company going forward will be their ability to use AI to unlock real-time value from their data wherever the data resides"" IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in a recent earnings call.

The long-term promise of IBM's artificial intelligence strategy is undeniable but investors have lost patience with the company's long-running transformation process. As a result you can pick up IBM shares on the cheap today at just 13 times free cash flow or 12 times forward earnings. Furthermore the low stock price and the company's firm commitment to a strong dividend policy has boosted IBM's dividend yield to a generous 4.7%.

I've said it many times before and I'll gladly say it again: Big Blue is a great long-term investment at these modest prices and I'm seriously thinking about adding a few more stubs to my own IBM holdings someday soon.

This AI-driven lender has tripled this year and still has room to run

Billy Duberstein (LendingClub): One of the biggest industries where AI is making an impact is in the world of fintech. It's a fairly broad catch-all term but AI and automation has become especially front and center in the world of loan underwriting. In just the past couple months two new-age fintechs that each use big data and automation to underwrite personal loans have taken off: Upstart Holdings (UPST -2.94%) and LendingClub up 57% and 93% respectively over the past three months.

LendingClub and Upstart are similar in many ways. Both companies use big data and artificial intelligence to approve more loans while also offering lower rates than most credit card companies which primarily use FICO scores. And both companies also use a marketplace model whereby they resell their loans to partner banks and asset managers based on partner underwriting criteria.

While both companies are similar and each has a lot of promise I'm going to go with LendingClub today. Why? Well it largely comes down to a question of valuation and business model. After all both LendingClub and Upstart had strikingly similar operating metrics last quarter but their market valuations are very very different:

Company Originations Marketplace Revenue Total Revenue Net Income Market Capitalization LendingClub $2722 million $151.7 million $204.4 million $9.4 million $3.1 billion Upstart Holdings $2795 million $187.3 million $193.9 million $37.3 million $18.6 billion

While LendingClub and Upstart have strikingly similar financials Upstart trades at a market cap over six times that of LendingClub!

Not only that but Upstart's higher profitability is also a bit misleading due to a key business model difference. In February LendingClub acquired Radius Bank which gave LendingClub a banking license and allowed it to hold deposits. According to management LendingClub will now be holding 15% to 25% of its loans on its own balance sheet going forward unlike Upstart which is a ""pure"" marketplace as of now.

While LendingClub will receive more total profits over the life of the loans it holds on its balance sheet it also has to deduct current expected credit losses (CECL) from new loans up front which totaled $34.6 million last quarter. Add that back and LendingClub would have actually been more profitable than Upstart.

Both companies are pioneering the exciting field of AI-driven loan underwriting which is leading to impressive results; however given that LendingClub is basically valued at one-sixth of Upstart it's definitely the pick for me even after its recent run.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS90aGVzdW5kYXlzdGFuZGFyZC8yMDIxL1NlcC8wNS9sb3VuZ2luZy1hbmQtd29ya2luZy10b2dldGhlcmZvdW5kZXJzLW9mLWxvdW5nZXdlYXItYW5kLW5pZ2h0d2Vhci1iZWx1eGUtd29ybGQtYW4tdW5saWtlbHktY29tYmluYXRpb24tMjM1NDM4OS5odG1s0gG8AWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS90aGVzdW5kYXlzdGFuZGFyZC8yMDIxL1NlcC8wNS9sb3VuZ2luZy1hbmQtd29ya2luZy10b2dldGhlcmZvdW5kZXJzLW9mLWxvdW5nZXdlYXItYW5kLW5pZ2h0d2Vhci1iZWx1eGUtd29ybGQtYW4tdW5saWtlbHktY29tYmluYXRpb24tMjM1NDM4OS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lounging and working together: Founders of loungewear and nightwear 'BeLuxe World' an unlikely combination,"The Sunday Standard

The tech behemoth is gearing up to host the Microsoft Surface event on September 22. The event will witness the debut of some new products including the Surface Pro Book Microsoft Surface Duo 2 and the much-awaited Surface Go 3. The upcoming tablet has been floating around the rumor mill revealing what it could offer in terms of specs and performance.

Aside from making multiple appearances online the Surface Go 3 appeared on Geekbench last month. As expected the Geekbench listing divulged some key details about the new tablet. It revealed the device is codenamed OEMAL and confirmed that it will be made available with the Surface Go 3 moniker. Two models were tested. One packed the Pentium Gold 6500Y while the other had a Core i3-10100Y processor under the hood. These processors came with an Intel UHD Graphics 615 two processing cores with multithreading support.

Specs & Features (Expected)

A recently surfaced report from WinFuture has shed light on the upcoming device. This will be the third generation convertible PC from Microsoft. The Surface Go 3 will reportedly sport the same design as its predecessors. Furthermore it is likely to come with a 10.5-inch display that offers an FHD resolution. Aside from that the design uses magnesium alloy and features a fold-out stand. If earlier reports are anything to go by the new Surface Go laptop will adopt a fanless design. In other words the device will not pack any moving part under its hood. However this could lead to issues related to overheating.

During an interview with Pierre Ferragu Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and CFO George Davis responded to various questions on the current market situation in which Intel has found itself right now.

While a large number of questions from Pierre was about Pat Gelsinger’s background and what he had learned from working as a CEO for VMWare there were also questions about AMD and NVIDIA and how is Intel planning to compete with both companies on CPU and GPU fronts.

Since Pat Gelsinger took over the seat of Chief Executing Officer at Intel the company had laid out its plans for the next few years including fabrication node roadmaps upcoming products for client and server and also Intel’s grand (re)entry into the discrete gaming GPU market.

Intel will be competing with AMD and NVIDIA in the HPC market with its next-generation Xeon Scalable products but also with its Ponte Vecchio and Xe-HP Arctic Sound GPUs. The company plans to be very competitive in the next 3 to 4 years with a goal to sustain leadership.

Pierre Ferragu (PF): How do you make sure Intel remains central and the number one client in the cloud. Pat Gelsinger (PG): We just say about the AMD threat you know we got to do better products period! So we gonna build better products and they had a period we haven’t executed well. We’re gonna execute execute execute! And with that we see that we are coming into a period where we are going to be very competitive. So we were in a period where we were behind. Now with Ice Lake Sapphire Rapids Diamond Rapids we are in a period where we are going to be very competitive and as we get out to 3 -4 years from now we see that we will be in sustained leadership again. So we are coming into a period where we are going to be much more competitive and with products that you know are much more competitive more pricing dynamics better market share potential better TCO values for the cloud guys so we just gotta compete.

Pat also said that Intel will be competitive with NVIDIA in the GPU architecture market and will for the first time ever be able to put pressure on NVIDIA. With the recent announcement of Intel XeSS supersampling technology and its multi-year plans for Xe-HPG architecture Intel will have not only have to compete with NVIDIA but also AMD who will be releasing its first MCM GPUs with Radeon 7000 series later next year.

PF:- Will there be a Zen moment for Intel? PG: We have a number of things going on over here[…] We are rolling out the heterogenous architecture that is part of Alder Lake where we have big and little cores you know AMD only has one. We’ll have a higher performance and a more energy-efficient version of the core pretty compelling we’ll lay out our major vector enhancement stuff we have our GPU architecture where we are gonna start being in a position to really put pressure on NVIDIA for the first time ever. And we are laying out our IPU architecture when we get to our smart NICs and smart networking fabrics so three major architectural announcements this week that we think are pretty Zen-like. And trust me we have a few that are still cooking back in the labs that we are going to look forward to talking to people about that we think are a pretty dramatic step forward and well beyond anything that was talked about yet and some that might not be talked about for a couple of years but innovation you know the geek is back.

But shock waves hit the market only a few days later. Didi shares fell as much as 25% compared to the closing price from the previous week after Chinese regulators on July 4 ordered app stores to remove the company’s app citing serious legal violations regarding its collection and usage of personal information and the Chinese government announced on July 6 it would tighten oversight of companies listed overseas.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The “Big Bang Theory” actress who is estimated to be worth $100 million has an “ironclad prenup in place” a source told Us Weekly as the actress begins divorce proceedings with estranged husband Karl Cook.

The source added “Her assets are protected.”

According to Us Weekly the court has ordered the pair to disclose all their financial information within 60 days.

Cuoco who has been acting since she was a child was raking in a million per episode for “Big Bang Theory” by 2014. The show was on the air from 2007-2019.

Although it’s worth noting the 30-year-old equestrian’s father Scott Cook founded the tax software company Intuit and is estimated by Forbes to be worth $5.9 billion.

Cuoco 35 filed for divorce on Friday the same day the couple confirmed to Page Six they’re going their separate ways after three years of marriage.

“Despite a deep love and respect for one another we have realized that our current paths have taken us in opposite directions” they said in a joint statement. “We have both shared so much of our journey publicly so while we would prefer to keep this aspect of our personal life private we wanted to be forthcoming in our truth together. There is no anger or animosity quite the contrary.

“We have made this decision together through an immense amount of respect and consideration for one another and request that you do the same in understanding that we will not be sharing any additional details or commenting further.”

The couple began dating in 2016 and tied the knot in 2018. They do not share any children.

A rep for Cuoco did not immediately return our request for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Packing your portfolio with rapidly growing stocks is key but it's all too easy to buy growth stocks that fizzle out after a couple of quarters. If you want to become more wealthy over the next few years and beyond you'll need to identify companies that are supported by a handful of different trends and capabilities that reinforce their consistent and meaty growth.

All three of the healthcare companies I'll discuss today are highly successful and they're also escalating their revenue-making potential by building on their difficult-to-imitate products. While the largest gains will go to investors who hold these innovative companies for years they're also moving quickly enough to make the time between now and 2024 quite exciting so let's dive in.

1. Intuitive Surgical

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.32%) sells robotic surgery units to hospitals around the world and business is booming. Even amid the economic disruption of the pandemic the company increased its base of installed systems by 10% between June 2020 and the same period in 2021. That's a strongly positive sign for Intuitive's future as every installed robotic surgery system implies significant future revenue from maintenance and sales of fresh tools and accessories. In 2020 a stunning 77% of its revenue was recurring.

And the more procedures that the robots perform per year the more the hospitals end up spending. From the second quarter of 2019 until Q2 2021 the number of procedures performed by Intuitive's robots increased by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.5%. In terms of revenue that works out to a CAGR of 15% -- despite the near-total stoppage of elective surgical procedures amid the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

Moving forward Intuitive will be looking to increase the rate of new system installations to make up for lost time in 2020. All the while it'll be working on making new surgical tools and instruments to expand the range of procedures that its robots can perform. That will lead to higher revenue from existing customers and it might serve to attract new buyers too.

While competitors may be starting to make inroads into the robotic surgery market investors probably don't need to worry very much. Once hospitals have spent time and money training surgeons on a given surgical system there's a high cost to switch to a competing product so Intuitive can continue to make long-lasting headway even as competitors become more established.

2. Align Technology

Align Technology (ALGN -3.10%) makes invisible removable teeth straighteners that are comparable in function to braces. But the company's Invisalign-branded products are arguably much more aesthetically appealing than braces which is no small ingredient in its recipe for success.

By solving a key problem with a formerly dominant legacy product Align has had an easy time finding prospective customers and gaining market share. Internet searches for doctors capable of fitting patients for Invisalign increased by 82% year over year in Q2.

Align also sells imaging technology to dental care professionals which they can use to fit their patients for the company's straighteners. So it makes money first when customers want to have the ability to sell its main product and then again when customers buy cases of straighteners to distribute to patients. And sales are hot: In the second quarter of 2021 revenue from imaging systems rose by a whopping 20% sequentially and income from cases of aligners rose by 11.6% sequentially making for more than $1 billion in total revenue for the period.

Finally Align is slated to reward its shareholders by initiating an accelerated stock buyback program worth $75 million to speed up its existing buyback program that's budgeted for $1 billion. The accelerated buyback should be finished by late October so expect some upward pressure on the stock price between now and then.

3. DexCom

DexCom (DXCM -0.85%) develops continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for people with type 2 diabetes. Unlike the traditional finger-stick method for measuring a person's glucose level DexCom's CGMs use a disposable under-the-skin sensor that patients wear for 10-day intervals. Then the sensor uploads data to a smartphone app where patients can see their glucose levels in real time. That means patients can recognize when to take corrective action earlier thereby better protecting their health and comfort -- and without needing to prick their finger multiple times per day. And when patients exhaust their supply of wearable sensors they'll need to put in an order for another case. So there's a recurring component to DexCom's revenue base which helps it grow more consistently.

Much like with Align Technologies DexCom's product practically sells itself just because it doesn't have the fundamental flaws of the traditional option. Thus it's no surprise that the company's total revenue grew by 32% year over year to reach $595 million in the second quarter of this year. What's more management expects its gross profit margin to rise to 67% an even larger increase than it initially predicted for 2021.

Before the end of the year DexCom expects to launch the seventh edition of its CGM device. Meanwhile management will be proceeding with international sales efforts in new major markets including France Turkey and India. Its stellar product expanding revenue and strengthening margins provide quite a lot for investors to like and the next few years should be exciting for shareholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He was 64.

According to his obituary Schwyhart died Aug. 31 at his Dallas residence with his wife Carolyn and son Alex by his side. The obituary included no cause of death but a family spokesman told the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal that Schwyhart died as a result of terminal cancer.

Visitation will be held at Cross Church Pinnacle Hills in Rogers on Tuesday (Sept. 7) at 12:45 p.m. followed by a funeral service at 2 p.m. U.S. Rep. Steve Womack R-Rogers the city’s mayor from 1999 to 2010 will deliver the eulogy.

“I credit Bill Schwyhart for his vision and passion for the rapid transformation of Rogers from a bedroom community to one of destination character” Womack said in a statement. “The relationships he created within the retail and hospitality industry were critical to the city’s development. There wasn’t a more vocal promoter of the Pinnacle Hills vision than Bill Schwyhart.”

Schwyhart made his name in Northwest Arkansas as an automobile dealer before turning his attention to real estate development. He grew up working in his father’s gas station in Stockton Calif.

According to a 2001 profile published in the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal Schwyhart was 20 years old when he loaded his 1967 Mercury Cougar with all his belongings in 1977 and moved from California to Springfield Mo. He invested $10000 he had saved to buy a one-third interest in a Chrysler dealership in nearby Marshfield. His father Joe Schwyhart was already in the Ozarks having moved to Springfield when he retired.

In 1979 Schwyhart attended Chrysler dealer school in Detroit for six weeks. While there he and another student went to visit Lee Iacocca at his home — unannounced. Iacocca invited them inside and spent an hour talking with them. The next day Iacocca went to the federal government to request a loan to rescue Chrysler from bankruptcy.

“I went back to Marshfield ready to slay the world” Schwyhart told the Business Journal in 2001. “But [the Chrysler dealership] just wasn’t a viable operation so we closed the business.”

Schwyhart later moved to Rogers and bought a Pontiac Buick and GMC dealership. His father and Robert Thornton a former Walmart Inc. executive came into the deal with him as partners. At the age of 23 Schwyhart was the youngest Buick dealer in America. He used the last part of his name for his new business eventually incorporated as Hart Motor Co.

Schwyhart owned various auto dealerships in Northwest Arkansas during the next several years including high-end models BMW and Volkswagen.

By the mid-1990s he started focusing on real estate development. The booming auto dealerships allowed Schwyhart to purchase Pinnacle Point a land development that today includes Cross Church Pinnacle Hills Lewis & Clark Outfitters and multiple office buildings. That grew to include land holdings for the more prominent Pinnacle Hills a retail entertainment and healthcare development along both sides of Interstate 49.

Schwyhart was part of the real estate development group The Pinnacle Group a privately held company that included Thornton Collins Haynes Johnnie Bryan “J.B.” Hunt and Tim Graham. The Pinnacle Group also played a role in the development of the Pinnacle Hills Promenade retail center which opened in 2006.

The Pinnacle Group partnership dissolved after Hunt’s death in December 2006 less than amicably. That and the Great Recession were part of Schwyhart’s very public and complex fall from grace. There were multiple lawsuits a Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Schwyhart was even evicted from his home and office near Pinnacle Country Club in 2011.

According to the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette Bill and Carolyn Schwyhart filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in Texas in July 2018 claiming more than $82 million in debt mostly related to business ventures that had failed during the economic crisis from 2009 to 2011. The bankruptcy court granted them a discharge of those debts. Last year a Texas judge denied the objection to discharge that one of the creditors CHP LLC had filed finding that the Schwyharts were honest debtors deserving of a discharge.

According to court filings the Schwyharts moved from Arkansas to Dallas in March 2018 for health reasons.

Schwyhart was involved in various civic groups while living in Northwest Arkansas including the Northwest Arkansas Council and leadership roles with the Rotary Club of Rogers and Rogers-Lowell Area Chamber of Commerce.

Then-Mayor John Sampier appointed Schwyhart to the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport Authority when it was organized in 1992. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee also appointed Schwyhart to serve on the Arkansas Economic Development Commission.

In lieu of flowers the Schwyhart family has requested donations to the Single Parent Scholarship Fund of Northwest Arkansas or Northwest Arkansas Children’s Shelter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGFsa2J1c2luZXNzLm5ldC8yMDIxLzA5L3Bpbm5hY2xlLWNoYW1wLWpvbi13aGl0dGFrZXItcmVmbGVjdHMtb24tZ29sZi10by1iaXotdHJhbnNpdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pinnacle champ Jon Whittaker reflects on golf-to-biz transition,"Many serious golfers set their sights on winning their local club championship as the ultimate goal in their golfing life. For amateur golfers who never played professionally it’s their major.

For former pros? Well it’s still pretty darn fun.

Just ask Jon Whittaker of Rogers. His golf career began as a boy growing up in Little Rock. He was one of the state’s best-ever junior players a multiple high school and state amateur champion a successful collegian and a winning professional during a decade-long career playing various mini-tours across the country.

Whittaker 45 has long since transitioned out of professional golf. He’s worked for several companies in Northwest Arkansas including J.B. Hunt Transport Services and spent the past seven years working in Rogers for the data analytics and retail technology firm Inmar Intelligence.

But he’s still collecting victories on the golf course — and at a notable rate.

In August Whittaker won his fifth consecutive men’s club championship at Pinnacle Country Club in Rogers an unmatched feat since the club founded in 1990 as Champions Golf & Country Club held its first club championship that year.

Whittaker completed the 54-hole tournament at 1-under par (67-72-73—212) and won by 10 shots. He now has six club championships in eight years at Pinnacle tied with Dick McLelland who won the first four years and six of the first eight. McLelland is a retired bank executive who still lives on the property and plays frequently.

Whittaker said he was unaware this year’s victory carried any significance a change in mindset from being singularly focused on winning for most of his golfing life.

“It doesn’t define me like it used to” Whittaker said in a recent interview. “It used to be my true identity. I would bring it home and if I played poorly I wasn’t fun to be around for a while. Now I realize it’s just a game and there will be good and bad days.”

ARKANSAS TO ARIZONA AND BACK

The financial disparities between competing on the lucrative PGA Tour and every other golf tour in the U.S. are stark. In a business analogy playing on the PGA Tour is akin to doing business with Walmart. Playing on the mini-tours is like having your product stocked in a regional grocery store chain with 50 locations.

“I had some success and had some good years but it’s a lonely road” Whittaker said about his time playing on the lower tiers of the pro golf ladder. “It’s weeks at a time on the road grinding it out trying to make a living.”

Whittaker earned a marketing degree in 2000 from the University of Arkansas two years after completing his eligibility with the Razorbacks. As a senior at Catholic High School in Little Rock in 1994 he had a wide selection of colleges to choose from but accepted a scholarship offer from the University of Arizona which won the NCAA Division I national golf championship two years earlier.

For various reasons Whittaker said Arizona wasn’t a good fit and he transferred to Fayetteville where he played on several highly-ranked Razorback teams.

Focused on the ultimate goal of earning his PGA Tour card — something his older brother Ron Whittaker accomplished in 1996 2006 and 2008 — Whittaker gave professional golf a shot starting in 2001. He won his first event in 2003 a Tight Lies Tour stop in Tyler Texas and won three more times as a professional. But by late 2009 after discussing with his wife friends and others for more than a year Whittaker was ready to seek a more stable occupation.

“That was extremely difficult” he said. “I think if you talk to any athlete in any sport professionally it’s hard for them to walk away from the sport.”

TRANSITION TO BUSINESS

Various things can prepare a person for their business career even life as a mini-tour golf professional.

So too can being a family man.

By the time Whittaker ended his pursuit in late 2009 of a PGA Tour card he and his wife of seven years Amanda had two young children. He joked that the initial thing he was looking for in a “second” career in Northwest Arkansas was to start receiving a steady paycheck.

Wherever he landed he was confident that what he learned playing golf for a living would translate to the business world.

“During interviews I kept saying that I might not have the experience on paper they were looking for but in my mind I had run my own company and my own business for 10 years” he said. “If you want to be successful you have to stick to it. And that means being accountable every single day.

“I tried to lean on that and hope that somebody would give me a chance. I knew I was a hard worker and no matter what you put in front of me if I didn’t have the experience I would find a way to figure it out and learn it.”

Through personal contacts Whittaker landed a job in January 2010 at J.B. Hunt as a fleet manager. He spent a year with the company and described the work as eye-opening and challenging.

Whittaker admitted there were days that he struggled usually when it was gorgeous outside and he would be trying to remember why he decided to give up golf and work in an office. But for the most part he embraced the challenge of learning something new.

“I spent a year at J.B. Hunt and it was difficult” he said. “But I look back on it now and think maybe if I’d taken a job that was a little easier who let me learn and gradually get into it I probably wouldn’t be where I am right now. I learned a lot in those times and it helps me in my current role.”

‘ONE OF THE GUYS’

Whittaker’s post-golf career later took him to Shopper Events an in-store retail marketing company in Rogers in 2011 then to Nestlé two years later when the family moved to Ohio.

Whittaker said he didn’t play much golf while he was a Nestlé sales rep. But when the family returned to Northwest Arkansas in 2014 the golf urge returned too. Whittaker regained his amateur status and the Whittakers joined Pinnacle Country Club.

“I had a little burnout after my playing days [ended] but I needed something other than work” he said. “So we joined as [golf] members and I’ve met some great people and made some great friends. We have a large group of guys who play every weekend.”

Whittaker described a bit of hesitancy about joining because he didn’t want the other members to view him as “the pro.” Those concerns have been unfounded.

“I didn’t want that stigma” he explained. “I just wanted to be one of the guys and be out there to have fun. And that’s what it’s become. The time spent away from it and having this group of guys that I play with — golf has become fun again.”

Whittaker said Pinnacle’s club championship events aren’t without a “large” competitive element. He still gets nervous and wants to perform well.

He also uses his competitive experience from golf at Inmar working with various brands to market them to national retailers. And after operating as an individual for so many years as a competitive golfer Whittaker said he relishes being part of a team in a business setting.

“It’s a fun job” he said. “I work on such a great team and that’s why I’ve been here for so long. I’ve been offered other jobs at other companies but for me I want to enjoy what I do and the people I work with. That’s where I get my energy. That’s what gets me up in the morning and going to work — either mentoring or collaborating with others and learning.”

And just like with golf Whittaker’s inquisitive mindset is an asset to his work. Not only is there room for constant improvement but it’s also a necessity.

“You can’t ever think that what you know now is good enough” he said. “Golfers are always trying to work on their craft and get better and learn more and that’s what I’m trying to do [at Inmar]. I want to be good at my current role but I want to learn all aspects of Inmar. It’s going to be valuable in some part of what I do eventually.”",,,,,,,,,

(NASDAQ:JKHY) After Its Third-Quarter ...,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) shareholders because the company has just released its latest quarterly results and the shares gained 4.0% to US$169. It was a credible result overall with revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 both in line with analyst estimates showing that Jack Henry & Associates is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$5.75. Before this earnings report the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025.

The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181 showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Jack Henry & Associates analyst has a price target of US$200 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$170. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Jack Henry & Associates is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 6.7% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 3.6% per year.

When Rep. Sara Jacobs was in her late 20s she decided she wanted time to create a family so she made the decision to one day freeze her eggs.

But then life overtook her plans as she embarked on a demanding career first as a State Department official then policy adviser on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and finally as a member of the House of Representatives for California’s 53rd Congressional District.

Jacobs is part of a growing number of women who are ascending to positions of power and finding they have options that their predecessors could never have dreamed of for having children.

The empowerment for these women has come in many ways not only to pursue their careers but also in Jacobs’ case try to help shape the law around reproductive technology.

“Congress and most workplaces were designed for a time when it was the White man working who had a wife at home who dealt with everything else” Jacobs said. “And so part of it is that we need to make sure that our workplaces and our institutions actually reflect what life looks like now and that they are accommodating for people who have various kinds of domestic situations.”

And in most recent years women have been breaking barriers with having families while serving in office. Two examples include Rep. Elise Stefanik who recently replaced Rep. Liz Cheney as GOP conference chair in the House announcing on Twitter she gave birth to her first child and Sen. Tammy Duckworth who became the first sitting female senator to give birth while in office.

Now Jacobs 32 is juggling recess (which has been made more complicated with the effort by her party to pass an infrastructure bill and $3.5 trillion budget resolution) and trips back and forth between San Diego and Washington DC — as well as the invasive process of her freezing her eggs in between votes on Capitol Hill.

“I thought I had timed this perfectly for August recess with things would be a little bit quieter and I would be home and being able to be out in my community but take it a little bit easier. Obviously that is not what happened” she said.

The process

Egg freezing has become more popular in recent years. It relieves the pressure of a woman’s biological clock by preserving the possibility of getting pregnant later in life.

It’s an invasive process. Jacobs is currently taking hormonal pills that she said make her feel like she’s going through puberty again.

Then after two weeks she began injecting herself with medicines for two weeks as well as visiting her doctor’s office several times a week. Once that process is done doctors will harvest her eggs while she’s under twilight sedation.

It’s also an expensive process. It can cost $12000 to $20000 for a single round of treatment which doesn’t always produce enough eggs.

And that’s not including what women will later pay for in vitro fertilization sometimes shorthanded as IVF which can run between $10000 and $15000 and doesn’t always take.

More and more women are starting to turn to the process for delaying having children including Jacobs.

While there are not a lot of statistics available for 2021 one fertility health care center that has several offices around the country called Shady Grove Fertility told CNN new patients for egg freezing have nearly doubled in 2021 compared to 2020 – outpacing the growth of fertility patients by 2.5 times.

“I’m fortunate that I am able to pay out of pocket to be able to do it” Jacobs said. “But I think the most important thing is not saying ‘Every person should go freeze their eggs.’ It’s that every person should have access to the full range of choices. We know that infertility doesn’t discriminate by socioeconomic status only access to fertility treatments do.”

Legislation to help families

Jacobs who considers herself a progressive Democrat is pushing hard to try to pass the $3.5 trillion budget resolution because of its so called “human infrastructure” proposals that would help working families.

The budget blueprint includes many of the family programs President Joe Biden has championed including establishing a universal Pre-K program for 3- and 4-year-olds and extending the new child tax credit.

It also calls for the creation of the first-ever federal Paid Family and Medical Leave benefit.

The budget resolution recommends reducing the price of prescription drugs as well as adding dental vision and hearing benefits to Medicare and lowering the program’s eligibility age.

The framework additionally calls for “historic” investments in affordable housing as well as many provisions tackling climate change and outlines investments aimed at meeting Biden’s goal for the country to reduce carbon emissions by 50% and for the power grid to get 80% of its power from emissions-free sources before 2030.

“If we’re really going to have an equitable recovery if we’re really going to be able to take the lessons of this pandemic and build the future that we all think we want then we have to invest in the care economy” she said. “We have to make sure we’re providing families the care support that they need to be successful but also making those care jobs good paying jobs.”

She is also a cosponsor for legislation called the Access to Infertility Treatment and Care Act that would expand insurance coverage for the full range of reproductive and fertility health care.

“I heard a male Democratic politician once say that we need to stop talking about wedge issues that divide people and instead focus on things that affect people’s everyday lives” Jacobs said. “And then he went on to say we need to stop talking about things like abortion we need to stop talking about things like racism and we need to focus on things like infrastructure and health care as if reproductive health care isn’t the predominant health care that that me and most women and most people trans men are dealing with right now. I think it’s important that we include it fully in whatever health care reforms health care overhauls we end up doing.”

August recess that wasn’t

When Jacobs decided to go ahead with this process she didn’t realize this summer would be so busy with the crisis in Afghanistan and a debate on the infrastructure bills. But that’s what happens when you’re a lawmaker in the middle of making personal decisions.

Jacobs who serves on two key committees – the House Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee — found herself back in Washington in the middle of August recess because work needed to be done amid the collapse of the Afghan government.

In the middle of caucus calls classified briefings and other meetings she’s found herself working while taking the medication that has been altering her body.

“The pills definitely make you feel like you’re going through puberty again. My body hurts. I feel a little bit bloated. I use Rent the Runway for some of my clothes here and I had to do the bump friendly option to make sure that I had some dresses that could go over my sort of bloated body” she said. “And you get kind of waves of emotion.”

But it’s what she signed up for with her decision to run for office.

“Part of this is making sure one that we’re pushing here in Congress to make this more accessible for more people but also that we’re de-stigmatizing these conversations that people even know to ask their doctor what might be available to them and to know that there are choices and there are options for them and there isn’t just one way to have a family and that’s OK.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9wcm9qZWN0cy8yMDIxL3Zpc3VhbHMvYm90dGxlcm9jay0yMDIxL9IBQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9wcm9qZWN0cy8yMDIxL3Zpc3VhbHMvYm90dGxlcm9jay0yMDIxLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The BottleRock Festival is back.

As Wheaton North volleyball coach Justin Hineman sees it the Falcons' challenging early-season matches are becoming beneficial.

The Falcons got down big early against the host team Saturday at the Jacobs Volleyball Invitational in the third-place match then came back and almost pulled out the first set.

Wheaton North then won two other close sets for a 22-25 25-21 25-23 victory over a team it lost to earlier in Pool 1 play.

""We were a little bit inconsistent today but they really turned it on at the end to battle back after losing that first set to a really good Jacobs team"" Hineman said. ""It was a heck of a job. We've had a really tough start in terms of schedule and really good teams but it's starting to pay dividends in these close matches. We can rely on that experience.""

Belvidere North defeated Lake Forest in the championship match 25-16 11-25 25-10.

The Falcons (6-6) were led by Audrey Brcka with 42 kills and 34 digs in the tournament. Brcka has 11 kills in the third-place match. Mia Benson finished with 32 kills nine in the last match.

Paige Syswerda has 91 assists 26 in the third-place match and Ella Brand finished with 84 digs 20 in the third-place match.

""It was a big step in the right direction"" Brcka said. ""Our team has been working hard in the summer and the preseason. After our last season we wanted to prove something more.

""We're a really energy-focused team so when we fight back and come together we play our best when we're really motivated.""

Jacobs (6-3) led the first set 19-8 but the Falcons nearly came back to steal it. The last two sets went back and forth with neither team leading by more than three until the final margin.

""We are fighters"" Jacobs setter Rachel Kaczorowski said. ""Yeah we're frustrated we lost but we're fighters and we battled every single game no matter what the situation is. We're so great off the court together and on the court it just clicks and we know how to get out of ruts.""

Kaczorowski led the Golden Eagles with 96 assists and also had 37 digs and 15 kills. Jaclyn Poirier topped Jacobs with 33 kills Ireland Van Stone added 27 and Sara Sasner had 20.

Poirier and Kate Wilson led Jacobs with eight serving aces in the tournament and Meredith Giustino had 57 digs.

Jacobs won its first set against Lake Forest in the semifinals and nearly advanced to the title match.

""We really wanted it"" Jacobs coach Mike Depa said. ""It was a bit of a letdown home tournament they really wanted it. A lot of the matches went three and they played really tough.

""We talked about it we know when we have those leads we need to finish. We're coming together as a team and playing well it's just finishing those games when we have those leads.

""It's a tough loss but we can learn from that and it's good to happen in an early tournament like this.""

Former South African President Jacob Zuma has been released from prison on medical parole prison authorities have confirmed.

Zuma 79 was sentenced to a 15-month prison sentence two months ago by the country’s Constitutional Court for contempt after he refused to appear before a judicial commission probing corruption during his nearly decade-long presidency.

The former president began his sentence on July 8 at the Estcourt prison in the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province about 180km (110 miles) northwest of Durban before he was admitted to a hospital where he later underwent surgery.

Two weeks later he was allowed to leave prison to attend his brother’s funeral at his Nkandla rural home.

“Medical parole placement for Zuma means that he will complete the remainder of the sentence in the system of community corrections whereby he must comply with a specific set of conditions and will be subjected to supervision until his sentence expires” the Department of Correctional Services said in a statement late on Sunday.

The department said the decision was impelled by a medical report it received.

“Apart from being terminally ill and physically incapacitated inmates suffering from an illness that severely limits their daily activity or self-care can also be considered for medical parole” it said.

Zuma’s jailing in July led to violent riots in South Africa killing more than 300 people and witnessing looting and vandalism estimated to cost businesses in the billions of South African rand.

His successor Cyril Ramaphosa described the unrest as an orchestrated attempt to destabilise the country and pledged to crack down on alleged instigators.

The Jacob Zuma Foundation welcomed the decision for the former president to serve the rest of his sentence outside prison.

“He is still in hospital right now” said the foundation in a statement adding that more detailed remarks would be issued “in due course after consultation with the legal team of President Zuma”.

Corruption trial looms

Zuma has been hospitalised for an undisclosed condition since August 6 at a health facility outside of prison. He underwent a surgical procedure on August 14.

Prison authorities appealed to South Africans to “afford Mr Zuma dignity as he continues to receive medical treatment”.

Earlier on Sunday a handful of members of a group of veterans of the ruling ANC’s armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe who have staunchly stood behind Zuma in recent years disrupted a eulogy by the party chairman Gwede Mantashe at a funeral of one of the group’s leaders chanting for Zuma to be freed from jail.

Meanwhile Zuma’s long-running corruption trial over an arms deal dating back more than two decades was last month postponed to September 9 pending a medical report on his fitness to stand trial.

Proceedings have repeatedly been postponed for more than a decade as Zuma fought to have the charges dropped.

Zuma faces 16 counts of fraud corruption and racketeering related to the 1999 purchase of fighter jets patrol boats and equipment from five European arms firms when he was deputy president.

He is accused of taking bribes from one of the firms French defence giant Thales which has been charged with corruption and money laundering.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vamV3aXNoc3RhbmRhcmQudGltZXNvZmlzcmFlbC5jb20vcmFiYmkta2F0ei1yZXR1cm5pbmctdG8tamVyc2V5LWNpdHktc2h1bC1mb3ItaG9saWRheXMv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9qZXdpc2hzdGFuZGFyZC50aW1lc29maXNyYWVsLmNvbS9yYWJiaS1rYXR6LXJldHVybmluZy10by1qZXJzZXktY2l0eS1zaHVsLWZvci1ob2xpZGF5cy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rabbi Katz returning to Jersey City shul for holidays,"High Holy Day services at Congregation B’nai Jacob of Jersey City will be conducted this year by CBI alum Rabbi Aaron Katz who is returning to New Jersey for the holiday season.

""Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented"" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said in Thursday's statement. ""The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback he flourished. The notion that a 'lockdown' cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams' quarterbacks even look in his direction and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.""

The 49ers organization also expressed its condolences in a social media post.

And the team released a statement marking his passing.

""The 49ers family is deeply saddened by the passing of one of the NFL's all-time greats Jimmy Johnson. Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er"" the team statement said. ""He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility kindness and loveable demeanor. We send our condolences to his wife Gisela and his entire family at this difficult time.""

While Johnson displayed prowess on both sides of the ball boasting - 47 career interceptions in 213 games with 615 return yards he also hauled in 40 receptions for 690 yards and four touchdowns in two seasons as a wide receiver.

One of the greatest players in 49ers' history especially on the defensive side of the ball Johnson was among the original ""shutdown"" cornerbacks in football. Former 49ers quarterback John Brodie once said that veteran quarterbacks didn't throw Johnson's way because of the fear of being intercepted.

""Jim doesn't receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible"" Brodie said back when they were teammates via the Pro Football Hall of Fame website. ""Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they'll tell you they call a few pass patterns in Jimmy's area.

""The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is he doesn't get the chance.""

When Johnson retired following his 1976 campaign no NFL player had turned in more seasons at defensive back than he had. At that time Johnson's 201 games and 198 starts were each the most for a DB in league history.

His interceptions and INT return yards remain second in 49ers history behind only fellow Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott (51 interceptions 643 yards) the Hall of Fame said.

Jimmy Johnson born James Earl played his college football at UCLA but was also a great track athlete away from the football field but his brother was even better. Radar won a gold medal in the decathlon in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

""Jimmy"" Johnson played college ball at UCLA. But Johnson wasn't just a football standout for the Bruins -- he was also exceptional on the track though not quite as good as his brother. Jimmy Johnson won All-American honors and an NCAA 100-meter championship while his brother Rafer garnered a gold medal in the decathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

Jimmy Johnson was the 6th overall pick in the 1961 NFL Draft and made his presence felt right away in his rookie year with 5 catches in his first dozen games. He achieved Pro Bowl status from 1969 to 1972.

Johnson died Wednesday evening the Hall of Fame and 49ers announced.

""Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented"" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said in Thursday's statement.

An Arizona woman accused of attempting to kill her husband by poisoning his coffee has been sentenced to three years probation.

Melody Felicano Johnson was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to two counts of the lesser felony charge of adding poison or a harmful substance to food or drink in April.

Johnson could have faced a maximum of 2 years in prison for each count.

Her attorney requested the sentence be time served saying Johnson had already been in custody for nearly a year due to her inability to post a $250000 bond. Her sentence also included mental health treatment.

Judge Javier Chon-Lopez noted even the victim her estranged husband Roby Johnson had told the court he did not want Johnson to end up in prison.

The defendant’s husband told investigators he “believes she was trying to kill him to collect death benefits” according to a criminal report obtained last year by CNN affiliate KVOA. Roby Johnson said he first noticed a foul taste to his coffee in March 2023 while he was an airman stationed in Germany the document says.

The Johnsons were still living together with their child but were in the process of getting divorced. Roby and Melody Johnson’s divorce is still pending her attorney said.

Roby Johnson told detectives he used pool testing strips to determine his coffee pot “showed high levels of chlorine” and set up hidden cameras that reportedly caught Melody Johnson pouring bleach into a container and pouring the contents of that container into the coffee maker investigators said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d0b3AuY29tL2xvY2FsLXNwb3J0cy8yMDI0LzA1L2luY3JlZGlibHktc3BlY2lhbC1yYXJlLTE5MjAtamVyc2V5LXdvcm4tYnktd2FsdGVyLWpvaG5zb24td2hlbi10aGUtc2VuYXRvcnMtYmVhdC1iYWJlLXJ1dGgtaXMtbm93LXVwLWZvci1hdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Incredibly special’: Rare 1920 jersey worn by Walter Johnson when the Senators beat Babe Ruth is now up for auction,"A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up…

A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up its value.

A game-worn jersey that belonged to Washington Senators pitcher and Baseball Hall of Famer Walter Johnson is currently at auction. Heritage House which is hosting the auction says the unique uniform is over a century old and valued at $3 million.

Production Manager Mike Provenzale told WTOP in the 20 years he’s worked for Heritage House Johnson’s jersey ranks at the top of all the items they’ve ever sold.

“It’s one of the most impressive items we’ve ever offered” he said calling the right-hander “one of the greatest sportsmen of all time.”

Using photo-matching the auction house traced the jersey back to April 29 1920 when the Washington Senators defeated the New York Yankees 2-1 at the Polo Grounds. It was the first time Johnson faced legendary hitter Babe Ruth. According to Provenzale Johnson earned his 299th career win while Ruth was only able to get a an RBI off a sacrifice fly.

“Through that photo-matching you’re able to identify the exact moment he was wearing it and when you can do that and it’s an important game with a lot of significant notes like that that just really piques the interest of high level collectors” he said.

This jersey was gifted by Johnson to teammate Eric “Swat” Erickson as a retirement gift after the 1920 season. Provenzale said Erickson brought a ranch in New York and had a barn where he kept all his sports collectibles including Johnson’s jersey.

“Decades later his granddaughter discovered it in the barn” Provenzale said adding that she was the one who initially sold it to a private seller.

Johnson’s legacy added an additional element that makes the jersey extremely valuable.

Known as “The Big Train” Johnson helped the Senators win its only World Series championship in 1924. He spent his entire 20-year playing career in Washington earning a record of 417-279 with a 2.17 ERA. For more than 50 years his 3509 strikeouts were the most thrown by a pitcher in the majors. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1936 prior to his death 10 years later.

“He was the most dominant pitcher. He holds numerous records. He has the most scoreless games the most consecutive years leading the league in strikeouts” Provenzale said. “Essentially it’s him and Cy Young who are considered … the greatest pitchers of all time.”

Unlike modern jerseys which teams and players hold on to due to their value at the time uniforms were not seen with much significance other than being work clothes. The fact that Johnson’s gift survived is “a miracle” Provenzale said.

“Jerseys in that era were considered disposable” he said. “They were worn and worn and repaired until they could no longer be repaired.”

There is only one other known jersey worn by Johnson that exists and it is sitting in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown New York. Combined with the disposable nature of uniforms in the past it is unlikely that another game-worn Johnson jersey will surface Provenzale said.

“So if you’re interested” he said. “This is the opportunity to get it”

The auction ends on May 17.

Speaking on the second second season of the Netflix series ""Full Swing"" Johnson believes those golfers who were handed tens and some hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are the ones who ""took the risk."" One reason is the criticism those golfers received from joining a league financed by a country with atrocious human rights violations.

Johnson who lives in Jupiter also wonders why those who remained on the tour — many turning down those multimillions — should be compensated if the two sides one day unite.

""No I don't"" Johnson said on the episode when asked whether PGA Tour players were owed compensation if LIV players returned to the tour.

""The guys that went to LIV we took a lot of criticism. We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously if this merger comes along there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.""

With no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.

PGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises' equity share plan. Large as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth according to the The Telegraph.

When it comes to legacy reputation and their safety Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.

Paulina Gretzky Johnson's wife revealed that the couple received death threats after her husband joined LIV.

""People sending death threats and awful awful awful things"" she said. ""People were aggressive that’s for sure. But that’s when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don’t need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.”

But financially … Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV while Johnson Phil Mickelson Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.

And many others will earn tens of millions such as Tyrrell Hatton who reportedly signed for around $65 million.

It’s exactly the type of story that has executives itching to get people back to offices. Chance meetings like this are essential for innovation the theory goes. “Remote work virtually eliminates spontaneous learning and creativity because you don’t run into people at the coffee machine” Jamie Dimon the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase recently told shareholders.

Creativity is hard to quantify. But research including studies of companies working remotely during the pandemic supports Mr. Dimon’s argument only up to a point. The data shows that in-office work is helpful at one part of the creative process: forming initial relationships particularly with people outside your normal sphere.

In the past year and a half that hasn’t been happening much with large shares of American office workers still remote and the Delta variant pushing some companies including Google and Ford to keep offices closed until 2022. A significant share of workers say that they want to return at least some of the time and that they miss meeting colleagues in the office.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2NsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlL25ld3MveHItZG9jdG9ycy1wcm90ZXN0LWNhbmFyeS13aGFyZi1iMTkxMzg1Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,XR doctors glued to bank demand end of fossil fuel investment,"Sign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planet Get our free Climate email Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

London’s Canary Wharf became the centre of striking scenes on Friday after healthcare professionals belonging to Extinction Rebellion (XR) were forcibly removed from the pavement they had occupied outside an investment bank.

Dozens of doctors nurses psychiatrists and anaesthetists all clad in scrubs kickstarted XR’s 11th day of action in the capital by targeting JP Morgan Chase which was identified in a 2021 report by the Rainforest Action Network as the world’s biggest funder of coal oil and gas extraction.

The medics who all form part of the environmental movement’s Doctors for XR faction gathered outside the bank’s front doors just after 7am to explain why the climate crisis must be considered a “public health crisis” and to read a letter they had written to the bank’s CEO Jamie Dimon.

Others meanwhile lay ‘dead’ on the ground beneath a giant banner which read: “Cause of death: fossil fuel finance.”

Quickly though as the building’s security warned XR members they were “trespassing on private property” Metropolitan Police and private security guards began a clear up operation lifting doctors by their arms and legs and carrying them down the road.

One XR member a GP told The Independent he could not understand why there were “so many police” and why they were being “so heavy handed when we weren’t even blocking the road”.

Around six of the protestors proceeded to superglue their hands to planters and pavement outside the building where they remained for more than three hours until specialist police were called in to free them.

Dr David McKelvey who has been a qualified GP for 36 years spoke while glued-on: “We are the inconvenient truth for JP Morgan health professionals are calling out the reality of the future they are investing in. They must face up to the reality of the catastrophe they are fuelling.”

The Independent later saw four of those glued once freed being immediately handcuffed escorted into police vans and driven away. As of 6.30pm two official arrests were made on Friday Met Police confirmed.

Rhiannon Osborne a 23-year-old medical student who was at her first XR protest described the police intervention as “pretty scary”.

“I find it kind of sad and embarrassing that we’re the people being policed not the people who are financing fossil fuels and basically committing crimes against humanity” she said. “It makes no sense that there’s so little scrutiny being put on these banks.”

Ms Osborne added: “The thing that really angers me is that it’s not the people in those rooms who are making money from these investments who will suffer the most from the climate crisis – it’s the regular people the patients we’re already seeing who suffer from the health issues caused by climate change.”

Dr Lynne Jones OBE FRCPsych a child and adolescent psychiatrist described the demonstration on Friday as “an act of communication” saying she “wanted to educate people” as best she could.

“There was a report out a couple of days ago saying that air pollution shortens life more than HIV malaria car accidents smoking war and terrorism” she told The Independent adding: “These are all issues I’ve spent my life’s work on yet they are nothing compared to what global warming is doing to us. It’s an emergency.”

Dr Jones who has worked with children overseas during major humanitarian emergencies during her career finished by saying she is “more scared [by climate change] now than I was in Sarajevo [during its siege] in the Nineties”.

The Met Police’s deputy assistant commissioner released a statement amid the action to say the force had tried to balance the rights of “protesters to assemble together” with the “the rights of others”.

“We’ve fulfilled our duty by facilitating these protests but where protesters have taken direct action and broken the law our response has been firm and at times direct” DAC Matt Twist said adding almost 500 arrests have been made since XR’s “Impossible Rebellion” began last Monday.

Asked if he thought the risk of being arrested was worth the journey from Bristol GP Duncan Still 47 said it was his “duty as a doctor” to be there.

“One of our duties of care is to look out for the wellbeing of individuals in front of us but also populations more widely and if we think there is an imminent threat to health it is incumbent on us to act.”

He continued: “I take that very seriously and that’s why I’m here to draw attention to the fact there is an imminent threat.”

XR announced on its Twitter page that the medics alongside other supporters and members of the group had moved on to St Paul’s by around 1pm. “See you on the streets rebels” the tweet said.

Hoon Seong a 53-year-old intensive care consultant told The Independent as she headed to catch a tube that she was part of the rebellion because “history proves” campaigning works.

“Take the abolition of the slave trade people think that happened overnight but it didn’t. It took decades of campaigning – and a civil war in the US – before it finally ended. Why? Because there was a lot of economic interest invested in the slavery of human beings – just like there is in fossil fuels” she said.

“It may take a long time but that doesn’t mean you stop pushing because if we stop trying to fight this [climate crisis] nothing will ever change.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA5LTA1L29wZWMtb2lsLXByb2R1Y2Vycy1lbmpveS10aGUtY2FsbS1iZWZvcmUtdGhlLTIwMjItc3Rvcm3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil Producers Enjoy the Calm Before the 2022 Storm,"You’d be forgiven for thinking that it’s smooth sailing ahead for the OPEC+ oil producer group.

(Dan Bates / Herald file)

Herald columnist has been an inspiring role but it’s time to begin a new chapter in retirement.

Without pad and pen. That’s what the birthday invitation said. Its sender couldn’t have known he was describing the next chapter of my life.

September is always a golden month. This year it’s especially so for me. As of Sept. 1 I am retired.

In April when I wrote about the 40th anniversary of The Daily Herald’s first Sunday edition I had a question for our human resources department. I couldn’t remember my exact start date. The reply came back: “Our records show a 3/1/1981 hire date.”

So yes after 40-plus years on the job it’s time.

It was Everett’s George Beykovsky who emailed that Aug. 21 party invitation: “Please come to the Mukilteo Lighthouse Park to share my 90th birthday without pad and pen.”

I definitely had my notebook in 2010 when I first met Beykovsky. His is among thousands of memorable stories I’ve been privileged to tell as a Herald columnist. His family escaped the Holocaust.

In 1939 when he was 8 they fled Europe. His early childhood home was the Czech province of Slovakia which by ’39 was under Nazi control. With a passport and fear for his family Beykovsky’s father boarded a ship with his wife and two boys. They settled in Ecuador.

A Boeing retiree who also worked at Western Gear in Everett Beykovsky served in the U.S. Air Force at Paine Field. Seeing him surrounded by loved ones and nearly 90 guests on his birthday I couldn’t help but think that had it not been for his parents’ courage Beykovsky may never have had the blessing of becoming a father grandfather and great-grandfather.

Without a doubt the greatest gift of my work has been the people I’ve met — like Beykovsky.

Most days I think about the strength of Apryl DeBroeck Roberts who has ferociously battled a rare form of breast cancer. Her story was first featured here on May 15 2016 just before the birth of her second daughter and not long after her devastating diagnosis. A month after meeting this sweet family I was back at their home near Martha Lake to see their newborn Haven who recently celebrated her fifth birthday.

After the 2018 death of U.S. Sen. John McCain I visited the widow of Wesley Schierman an Air Force veteran who’d spent nearly eight years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Everett’s Schierman a retired airline pilot who died in 2014 was captured after his F-105 fighter-bomber was shot down and freed in 1973. Like McCain he had suffered torture and solitary confinement in North Vietnam.

If you ever get around to reading a book titled “The Cruelest Miles” about the lifesaving feat that inspired Alaska’s Iditarod dogsled race perhaps you’ll notice my name in the acknowledgments. Thanks to a 2001 tip from Laney Salisbury the New York writer who co-authored the 2003 non-fiction book I had the adventure of discovering the Everett background of Gunnar Kaasen and of talking with his descendants.

Kaasen was the last sled driver — and musher of the noble Siberian husky Balto — on the 1925 run to bring diphtheria-fighting serum to Nome. The dog’s story was told in the 1995 animated movie “Balto.” Kaasen lived a quiet life here after his brief brush with fame. He died in 1960 and is buried at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Everett.

I feel particularly fortunate to have chronicled the lives of five distinguished Everett women. Helen Jackson Idamae Schack Jeanne Metzger Jane Best and Mary Duryee all now deceased were true role models whose legacies will benefit our community for generations.

I spent a morning with Mrs. Jackson widow of the late U.S. Sen. Henry M. Jackson when she and the Henry M. Jackson Foundation received the 2002 Human Relations Award from the American Jewish Committee’s Seattle chapter. An elegant woman who might have been first lady she spoke of how glad she was to live in Everett. “It was a joy meeting so many people” said Jackson who died in 2018.

The Schack Art Center and the Imagine Children’s Museum wouldn’t be what they are without the generosity of Mrs. Schack an “angel of the arts” who died in January. In April we lost Jeanne Metzger a former Herald editor and dear friend.

For The Herald’s 100th anniversary in 2001 I learned about the newspaper’s earlier days from Jane Best who died in 2005. The Best family owned the paper from 1905 to 1978. The widow of Robert D. Best Herald publisher from 1939 until 1976 said the day we met that “people will always rely on local news.”

When Mary Duryee died in 2019 close friend Judy Matheson described her as “one of the last great ladies of Everett.” During World War II she was one of the first women in Washington to get a real estate license. She kept her family’s real estate business going during the war years.

In 2017 the 20th anniversary of writing this column I shared memories of other extraordinary people I’ve profiled and of horrific news events.

I attended vigils and and a memorial service for victims of the 2014 Oso mudslide that claimed 43 lives. Also that anguishing year I met and had a sorrowful interview with parents of first-graders slain in Newtown Connecticut. They came to Snohomish County after the 2014 shooting at Marysville Pilchuck High School that claimed five lives.

Since my first column was published on Oct. 26 1997 I’ve written about 3500 of them. This wasn’t how I started at The Herald. The copy desk was my first Herald home. I was an intern the summer of 1978 and a full-time copy editor from 1981 to 1992. In those years we scrambled to update the paper’s multiple editions. I distinctly remember big news days the shooting of President Ronald Reagan the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion and the 1991 Gulf War.

As features editor until the fall of 1997 I learned so much working with Herald arts and entertainment editor Mike Murray. My focus then was on lifestyle stories.

In all I have worked under the leadership of six Herald publishers: Robert Best Jr. Chris Little Larry Hanson Allen Funk David Dadisman and Josh O’Connor. On Sept. 7 Rudi Alcott will become the paper’s 10th publisher.

My work has been an incredible history lesson.

In 2016 for the 100th anniversary of what’s known as the Everett Massacre Herald local news editor Eric Stevick and I sought to better understand the 1916 labor strife that killed two deputies and at least five Industrial Workers of World (IWW) members or Wobblies on the waterfront.

I’ll never forget our chilling interview with the late David Dilgard the Everett Public Library’s brilliant historian. Dilgard who died in 2018 spoke of a 1970s interview with a retired Everett policeman. The old cop told Dilgard he saw the bodies of a half-dozen other Wobblies killed that day — wrapped in canvas and weighted with chains to be secretly dropped in deep water off Mukilteo.

Among my memorable outings was a day in Darrington. It’s a tradition there that when a local person dies small-town cooks go to work. They host after-funeral meals at the Darrington Community Center where mourners are welcomed not as strangers but as neighbors. With a logging history many in Darrington have roots in Sylva North Carolina in the Great Smoky Mountains. Tarheel recipes and hospitable customs followed them to the Northwest.

In 2011 I met and wrote about Helen Cupic Stone. She had toiled 51 years at Scott Paper Co. later the Kimberly-Clark Corp. before the 2012 closure of the last mill on Everett’s waterfront. “It’s breaking my heart that the place is closing” she said the day we talked. She’d been at the mill longer than any worker in the factory’s history.

Today I enjoy walks on the new pedestrian bridge to the Everett waterfront part of which is becoming a lively residential space. It’s been said that life’s only constant is change.

A member of my book club who retired not long ago from Sno-Isle Libraries sent me retirement advice: “One of the best recommendations I got was not to commit to anything for six months” she said by email adding “it took that time to decompress.”

For me it might take longer.

Readers may know about the life-shattering losses my family has endured. Many sent kind messages in 1998 when my husband Jim Muhlstein died of a heart attack. A Herald editor he was just 45. I was expecting our third child. In 2017 the unimaginable happened when that young man my younger son was killed in a drug-related crime. He was 18.

I have written often about addiction recovery juvenile court programs and related topics — and like so many families who’ve walked that road ours has known heartbreak. I have also had the great joy of watching my daughter and older son become bright lights who contribute so much to this world.

The next chapter of my life actually began a couple years ago. On Oct. 5 2019 longtime Herald photographer Dan Bates and I were married.

One memory makes us both laugh. Some time ago Dan and I were out for a walk in our north Everett neighborhood. I waved to a neighbor who was sitting on a porch. He looked like maybe he didn’t recognize me. So I said “It’s Julie Muhlstein from The Herald and Dan Bates.” And he replied “THE Dan Bates?”

Yes THE Dan Bates whose incomparable photos graced these pages for more than three decades. Now we’re both happily retired.

Thinking about Labor Day weekend plans the other day it dawned on me that every day is a weekend. Oh the freedom — to take long road trips read fatter books spend more time with grandkids and my 98-year-old dad and maybe tackle long-neglected house projects.

Thank you truly for reading. I’ll be around — without pad and pen.

Kraft Heinz will pay a $62 million penalty after regulators charged it on Friday with violating federal anti-fraud and record-keeping requirements. Two of the food conglomerate's former executives have agreed to pay a combined civil penalty of $400000 as well.

""Kraft and its former executives are charged with engaging in improper expense-management practices that spanned many years and involved numerous misleading transactions millions in bogus cost savings and a pervasive breakdown in accounting controls"" the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement.

The company behind Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and Heinz ketchup — along with its former operating and procurement chiefs Eduardo Pelleissone and Klaus Hofmann — didn't admit to or deny the charges but agreed not to commit future violations the SEC said.

Kraft Heinz didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider. The company said in a regulatory filing that it fully cooperated with the SEC it has improved its financial reporting and the settlement concludes the investigation.

The SEC accused Kraft Heinz of overstating its cost savings inflating its profits and misleading investors as to how cheaply it makes its products.

The food giant restated its financials after the SEC launched its investigation in 2019 reversing $208 million of supposed cost savings from nearly 300 transactions between late 2015 and the end of 2018.

The SEC alleged in its complaint that Kraft Heinz employees drafted contracts showing upcoming savings from suppliers were already realized recorded upfront payments without disclosing the future orders they related to and reported discounts without revealing they were tied to price hikes in the future

The agency also alleged that the food conglomerate lacked sufficient internal accounting controls accused Pelleissone and Hofmann of ignoring warnings signs and attributed the alleged false accounting to excessive pressure to achieve unrealistic cost-savings targets.

Kraft Heinz counts Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as one of its largest shareholders with a 27% stake. Berkshire partnered with 3G a Brazilian private equity firm to buy Heinz in 2013 and helped finance the condiments giant's $100 billion merger with Kraft in 2015.

The claims against Kraft Heinz echo those against Wells Fargo which paid a $3 billion fine after employees resorted to opening fake accounts to meet aggressive sales targets.

The s’mores variety features vanilla flavored marshmallows enrobed in milk chocolate coating and topped with graham cracker crumbs.

“Our new resealable packaging and Jet-Puffed Bites lineup are answering a consumer desire for more snackable marshmallows” said Allison Kelly associate director at Kraft Heinz. “The stand-up resealable bags deliver marshmallows that are easy to store and help them stay soft and fluffy while our new Bites flavors offer an exciting variety of new indulgent flavors.”

NEW YORK: US regulators fined Kraft Heinz $62 million over an alleged accounting scheme that inflated the food giant's financial results due to bogus cost savings authorities announced Friday. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged the company and two former executives over accounting practices between 2015 and 2018 that misrepresented expenses at the maker of Philadelphia cream cheese and Grey Poupon mustard the agency said in a news release.

""Investors rely on public companies to be 100 percent truthful and accurate in their public statements especially when it comes to their financials"" said Gurbir Grewal director of the SEC's enforcement division. ""When they fall short in this regard we will hold them accountable."" The agency alleged in a civil complaint that Kraft Heinz procurement employees negotiated agreements with suppliers that allowed them to obtain upfront discounts in exchange for future spending commitments by the company.

US accounting practices require such savings to be recognized at the time that Kraft Heinz meets its commitments meaning they would be spread out. But Kraft Heinz staff ""negotiated and maintained false and misleading supplier contracts"" that were designed to ""improperly recognize cost savings prematurely"" the SEC said in its complaint.

Kraft Heinz ultimately revised a number of financial reports with $208 million in cost savings corrections. Besides Kraft Heinz the SEC also charged former chief operating officer Eduardo Pelleissone and former chief procurement officer Klaus Hofmann for their role in the alleged scheme. Pelleissone agreed to pay a civil penalty of $300000 while Hofmann will pay a civil penalty of $100000 and will be barred from serving as director or officer of a public company for five years.

""Kraft and its former executives are charged with engaging in improper expense management practices that spanned many years and involved numerous misleading transactions millions in bogus cost savings and a pervasive breakdown in accounting controls"" said Anita Bandy associate director of the SEC's division of enforcement. ""The violations harmed investors who ultimately bore the costs and burdens of a restatement and delayed financial reporting."" Neither Kraft nor the former executives admitted or denied the SEC's findings the SEC said. - AFP",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc2hvY3RvbnRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8wOS8wNS9sb2NhbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXBpbmluZy13b3JrZXJzLzU1OTE5ODIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local businesses pining for workers,"Coshocton County for August had unemployment rate of 7% or 1000 people out of work.

Companies said they have jobs available but haven't been able to find people to apply.

Ohio Means Jobs of Coshocton County had an employment expo with 111 jobs seekers and more than 45 receiving offers.

Employers said people prioritize differently than they once did as time off trumps wage and benefits.

COSHOCTON — Employment in Coshocton County has drastically changed over the past 10 years.

During the Great Recession people were looking for work but jobs were scarce. As the economy began to recover jobs were plentiful but employers had a hard time finding those with the right skill sets that could pass a drug test. In the past year businesses have had a hard time finding anyone at all to even to fill out an application.

A drive around Coshocton County will reveal plenty of help wanted signs ranging from fast food cashiers to factory workers to upper management. Many managers and business owners place the blame on the extra $300 stipend in unemployment benefits that was instilled during the COVID-19 pandemic. However others realize the employment landscape isn't what it once was and companies have to offer more including wages to entice employees.

Employment by the numbers

The unemployment rate for August in Coshocton County was 7% or about 1000 people unemployed out of a labor force of 13800. This is above the state unemployment rate of 5.4%. Athens and Jefferson counties had the highest unemployment rates in the state at 8.1% and Holmes County was the lowest at 3.7%.

Ohio Means Jobs (OMJ) of Coshocton County held its annual employment expo on Aug. 18 with 57 vendors that included local businesses colleges and military recruiters. OMJ reported 111 job seekers attended with more than 45 employment offers made.

At the end of August OMJ had 248 full-time jobs listed with 30 part-time jobs 13 seasonal jobs and one internship in Coshocton County. Of major employers Fanatics is looking for 20 seasonal warehouse associates ITM Marketing needs 75 customer service/sales advocates and Kraft-Heinz has 30 production team member spots open.

""This is not just a Coshocton issue or even an Ohio issue. It is across our nation that we are seeing record-high numbers of job positions that need filled"" said Shanna Stanton business coordinator for Coshocton County OMJ.

She said the biggest obstacles facing jobseekers locally is child care and transportation. However many people are looking to switch careers as the large number of open jobs provide a prime opportunity.

""At the expo I spoke to a few people who have been at the same job for years and are looking into better opportunities and are making those career changes now. If you are looking for a job the ball is definitely in your court with many options available"" she said.

Workers are scarce

During an enterprise zone agreement meeting in April relating to tax abatements for new capital projects Kraft-Heinz said it had exceed its payroll promise of $8.8 million at $15.5 million but it was short on the agreement to add 300 new jobs. Controller Jody Wright said recruiting efforts included advertising and working with the local OMJ office and other agencies.

McWane Ductile with its own enterprise zone agreement has exceeded job and payroll promises but is still having a hard time attracting and retaining workers according to local general manager Tom Crawford.

""There should be no reason there should be any unemployment in the city of Coshocton these days. There are jobs plentiful we just can't get people to come in"" Crawford said at the time.

On Aug. 18 the Lava Rock Grill at Unusual Junction closed temporarily with owner Bob McKenna citing the inability to find workers. Universal Bridal remains open as do McKenna's Farm Market on U.S. 36 and McKenna's Market at Medbery in Roscoe Village. They were able to find diner employees who wanted jobs at the other McKenna outlets he said.

McKenna feels the situation is common across the country right now especially with the blow the restaurant industry took during the pandemic. Many places had to close or limit service.

""Even though the past several months have been extremely busy in the restaurant we just couldn't continue to operate with the lack of staff. It makes us very sad but that was our only option at this time"" McKenna said.

Shifting work priorities

Coshocton Grain Company in August 2019 expanded with the Coshocton Soy Processing ExPress Meal and Oil facility. At full capacity the plant can process about 3.36 million bushels of soybeans annually to produce 81000 tons of soybean meal and 12600 tons of soybean oil. Chief Executive Officer Rhoda Crown said they're close to signing two new customers which will have them running full tilt.

With business booming the plant is now running two 12-hour shifts four days a week and will be moving to five days a week soon. They are looking to hire between two to five plant operators. Coshocton Grain participated in the recent employment expo and received 11 good candidates Crown said. Starting wage is $18 an hour.

When she first joined the workforce several years ago Crown said her greatest concerns were pay benefits and retirement. Today people prioritize time off.

""It's a different environment. When I started working here 38 years ago that wasn't a question that crossed my mind. What's my benefits what's may wage and what's my retirement going to look like was what I was thinking. People don't even ask about retirement anymore. It's more important to them how many days off they have"" Crown said. ""I'm not saying that's right or wrong that's just our lives that's the world we have right now.""

(WKYT) -Saturday afternoon Big Blue Nation has their first football game with full capacity at Kroger Field in two years.

It isn’t sold out. Still tens of thousands of people are to attend the game against Louisiana-Monroe Warhawks. With rising covid cases fans may notice some new safety measures.

“We’ve had season tickets for years” says fan Kristin Meyer. “We park in the same spot have a group of people join us. It’s a lot of fun.”

“This is kind of a tradition of mine and my dad’s something we’ve kind of carried on forever” says fan Blake Rose.

Still this first football game with full capacity is still different.

Tickets are virtual. Plus university officials say you’ll see more masks. Unvaccinated people are required to wear them at all times. Vaccinated people are to wear them indoors.

For the BBN community the chance to have a Saturday morning tailgate made all the difference.

“It feels like old times” Meyer says. “Any chance we can get to come up here to support them we will come up here it doesn’t matter what changed they make.”

UK officials say 80% of the university is vaccinated. Proof of vaccination is not required to attend today’s game.

Joshua Kemp took advantage of the change Sunday morning and picked up beer at a Kroger Marketplace in Lewisville.

“We’re going to the lake all day so being able to grab it in the morning is a lot easier than worrying about getting it at night because we’re going to be on the water before noon” Kemp said.

The previous 12 p.m. restriction didn't bother Kemp too much but ""now that [earlier] is an option it's nice"" he said.

Gary Huddleston with the Texas Retailers Association said the change will make shopping smoother.

“There was some conflict when the customer believed that they could purchase beer and wine before Sunday at noon"" Huddleston said. ""And it takes time even though the cashier will be cordial explaining the law.""

For grocery stores selling beer and wine the change comes in time for the holiday weekend.

“It’s really good timing because of Labor Day weekend and also the start of professional football season” Huddleston said.

Fans were excited to cheer on the Wildcats at Kroger Field for the first time with full capacity since 2019.

The Ky Roadcats RV Club of Lexington attend every home football game with RV's instead of tailgating in cars or trucks. They tailgate to fundraise money to support UK football athletic trainers with an annual scholarship.

What You Need To Know The Ky Roadcats RV Club attend UK football basketball and baseball games



Kathy and Philip Adams have been members of the club for twelve years



The club has around 30-40 RV’s that participate



The next home UK Football game is Sept. 11

Kathy Adams serves as the secretary of the Ky Roadcats Rv Club and many members refer to her as the woman that keeps everything running smoothly – organizing times that members need to arrive prior to game kickoffs.

“My husband and I belong to a group called the Roadcats and it is a group of 30-40 RV’ers that meet every home game and we tailgate together” Kathy said.

The Roadcats not only attend every UK home football game but they also support UK basketball and baseball games arriving early and staying late. They travel to Lexington the Friday before the game and leave on Sunday mornings after the game.

“This year to be able to walk around and greet people and eat together is absolutely wonderful” Kathy said.

It's the Adams 12th year tailgating – now they're making it a tradition for a new addition to the family.

“This is India Blue it is her first tailgate and she is 18 months old. So she did not get to tailgate last year either and it is really special to share it with my granddaughter” Kathy said.

It's been too long for the Adams family and many other Roadcats since they have been able to have laughs eat good food and have even better company.

“We have been looking forward to this day for a long time we had friends that we did not get to see except for football season it is like an extended family. So Friday night when we came in the RV’s we immediately got to see people we had not seen” Philip said.

The Adams family feel the same way about the return of football at full capacity for UK football games. The two made more food than they usually do encouraging any and everyone to come join the fun.

“We have missed each other terribly it is like a family reunion. We have not seen these people that have become close friends in two years” said Kathy Adams.

The Adams can not express enough how thankful they are to have a little ounce of normalcy back in their lives.

“To be able to gather is just wonderful and we’re doing it very safely every one of us has had our vaccines” Adams.

The Ky Roadcats RV Club will be at every home game in the orange tailgating lot."

More:The Killers to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination negative test to see Augusta concert

The concert was set to be the first one in Augusta to require those wishing to attend to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination and a negative test. The decision for the COVID-19 requirements was made by the band and the event organizers Live Nation Entertainment.

“We are taking every precaution we can during a difficult time for all involved” Robert Reynolds The Killers manager said in an email to The Augusta Chronicle in August. “The band wants to perform. We don't want to have to cancel and above all we want people safe.”

No statement has been released regarding the cancellations.

The cancellation comes after the latest increase in area COVID infections with area hospitals reporting record numbers of COVID patients exceeding the surge in January.

He was 71.

Furano started in the merchandising and licensing business co-founding Bill Graham’s Winterland Productions. He would go on to work with some of the top names in music including John Lennon the Rolling Stones AC/DC Madonna Michael Jackson Led Zeppelin Coldplay Justin Timberlake Jay-Z Maroon 5 and Aerosmith.

“In the ’70s it was not cool selling merchandise so we had to be careful” Furano once told Billboard. “Groups would say ‘OK you can sell but don’t ­embarrass us. Stand in a corner.’”

Born in Nevada City Calif. near Lake Tahoe Furano graduated from Stanford University in 1972 with a degree in political science and government taking a year off to learn the concert business from Graham before a plan to attend law school. Working part-time at the San Francisco Winterland venue with his brother Dave a well-known promoter while still at college Furano was enlisted to do merchandising when Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann’s wife legendarily asked Graham whom she should talk to about T-shirts and Graham replied “Go talk to Dell.”

Another variation of his story has Dell stenciling Rolling Stones on a collection of psychedelic tie-dyed T-shirts and selling hundreds of them outside the venue. That was the start of Winterland Productions co-founded by the brothers with Graham which soon became the leading merchandising and licensing company in the earliest days of the modern concert business. Graham and the Furanos eventually sold Winterland Productions to CBS Records in 1985 then to MCA/Universal three years later.

Popular on Variety

In 1993 Furano became the CEO of Sony Signatures the entertainment merchandise licensing and consumer products division of Sony Corp. directing the merchandise licensing programs for Columbia and Tri-Star Pictures as well as the concert and retail sales of a number of top music artists. He was instrumental in the company’s successful merchandise program for the 1998 World Cup in France with record sales for FIFA merchandise.

Furano then started Signatures Network Inc. in 1999 expanding the enterprise into working on musicians’ online presence including the management of official websites social media pages VIP ticketing/fan club programs and e-commerce sites. Live Nation acquired Signature Neworks in 2008 with Furano serving as CEO of Live Nation Merchandise through 2012.

In 2014 Furano and his wife Kym founded Epic Rights a full-service entertainment agency and brand management company based in West Hollywood which also offers services in celebrity retail fashion and lifestyle branding e-commerce sales VIP ticketing digital fan communities and global tour merchandising. In February 2019 Universal Music Group’s Bravado the company’s consumer lifestyle and brand management division acquired Epic Rights and along with it licensing deals for Madonna’s skincare line Celine Dion’s handbag collection an apparel deal featuring the lyrics of Lennon and McCartney Kiss waffle makers a CBGB/Dr. Marten’s tie-in and Funko Def Leppard and Duran Duran figures.

Said Phil Cussen president/COO of Epic Rights: “I have been honored to work for Dell for the better part of thirty years. He was a true visionary — constantly reinventing our business for changing times while embracing evolving technologies. Through all the changes he never lost sight of the artist their representatives the fans our partners and our employees. He had a profound and positive impact on so many lives and careers – he was a very special guy a true giant. I together with the whole Epic family am going to miss him dearly. Our heartfelt condolences go out to Kym and the entire Furano family.”

Ozzy Osbourne tweeted “So sad to hear of the passing of Dell Furano. He was a legend in the merchandising business a great friend and above all a true gentleman. Much love and respect to his wife and family.”

Motley Crue manager Allen Kovac said of Furano whose Epic Rights is handling the merchandising for the band’s upcoming stadium tour with Def Leppard Poison and Joan Jett & the Blackhearts: “Dell was a trailblazer in the merchandising world. Always smiling as if he had a special gift something new he would bring you didn’t know you needed.”

Rob Light head of music at CAA wrote on Instagram that Furano was “the true king of rock and roll merch. He took an embryonic business and made it part of the infrastructure of Live Music. He always found a way to get a deal done. And always made the artist money. All while being a decent good person who always had a smile and lived live music. RIP”

UMG issued a statement on Sept. 6 which read: “We mourn the loss of our friend and partner Dell Furano a trailblazer who helped to guide the formation and development of the music merchandise business. Dell was a true entrepreneur and he leaves an enduring legacy. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones.”

Furano was a board member of the trade organization International Licensing Industry Merchandisers’ Association (LIMA). He was inducted into the LIMA Hall of Fame in 2017 the first member of the music industry to be so honored.

Nicole Scherzinger is being sued by Pussycat Dolls founder Robin Antin over claims she's threatening to pull out of a reunion tour.

A lawsuit was filed at Los Angeles Superior Court The Hollywood Reporter reports claiming the Don't Cha singer now wanted a larger slice of the profits from the tour and has “demanded to renegotiate the terms” of her contract.

Nicole 43 had agreed to 49per cent stake of the profits and signed off her part in the reunion according to court papers.

But after the tour was delayed due to Covid Nicole “now refuses to participate in the tour” unless she gets ""75 percent stake along with final decision-making authority"" says Robin.

The court papers also reveal $600000 that Live Nation put up prior to the tour is also at risk as the promotor now wants to be paid back because of the delays.

Nicole is the most famous breakout star of the Pussycat Dolls which was founded in 1995 as a burlesque act. Since leaving the Dolls Nicole has gone on to carve out a solo music career and a successful career in TV as a reality show judge.

The former Masked Singer judge has always maintained she did the majority of the singing for the group.

In an unearthed interview she said: ""But I'll never forget I finished the album PND. Ron [Fair] and I brought the girls into the studio and we played it for them.

""It was the first time they had ever heard the music. Do you understand what I'm saying? We played the album for the Pussycat Dolls. It was the first time they heard the songs.""

Ron Fair the producer goes on to explain that Melody Thornton recorded some ad-libs but the rest of the singing was all Nicole.

Nicole adds: ""I probably did 95% of the album on my own.""",,,

Powell in his 20s and with a bad attitude said he sought fast cash to settle debts move out of his mother's place and rent from a friend. Instead he was arrested and pleaded guilty. During a prison stint Powell decided he would change course.

Today he is a truck driver for LKQ Corp an auto parts distributor with a regional operation in Fridley. And Powell 37 is one license away from driving huge semitrailer trucks and has the potential annual earnings of $75000 or more.

Powell is an empowered purposeful man.

""I'm never late on rent or car payment"" he said. ""And the car is paid. I'm debt-free. I learned through 'empowerment' training at Twin Cities Rise how to avoid borrowing save money and know the difference between your wants and your needs.

""I sometimes help my family and friends. And the homeless. I'm a Christian. And just because somebody thinks something is cool doesn't mean I gotta do it or have it.""

Davis Powell drives the Duluth route daily from LKQ Corp’s auto parts regional distribution center in Fridley.

Powell assumed a can-do attitude and achievable goals thanks to training and coaching for several months through Twin Cities Rise. The 27-year-old nonprofit business helps unemployed and underemployed folks boost technical and personal skills.

But Powell's journey to empowerment wasn't easy. While enrolled at North Side-based Rise Powell also worked a temp job that required a three-bus commute.

After graduation he took a job fixing and changing tires that paid $14 an hour plus benefits by 2017. He also has delivered newspapers and he drove a downtown pedicab in 2018 and 2019.

Hired by LKQ in 2020 Powell's several-stop route to Duluth begins at 2:30 a.m. and concludes most days around 1 p.m. He listens to music and Christian broadcasts and enjoys chatting with customers along the route.

Powell always wanted to drive a truck. And there's a shortage of drivers. Now he's driven to become that $75000-plus-a-year truck driver.

""Davis is detailed and very concerned about making sure things are done correctly"" said Joe Hernandez general manager of the LKQ operations in Fridley and St. Cloud. ""He is a great person and a pleasure to work with.""

Powell is one of 1200-plus mostly low-income disproportionately minority clients who spend several weeks to months annually in training at Twin Cities Rise. Its empowerment training addresses decisionmaking communication humility and owning choices. The average participant is 36 years old.

Not everybody graduates the first time. Most leave with better prospects and a higher wage.

The program founded by former General Mills executive Steve Rothschild is a partner agency of Northside Achievement Zone. It works with schools nonprofits and businesses to help individuals and families break the often-generational cycle of poverty.

""We are a connector between the marginalized and employers"" said Rise CEO Tom Streitz a one-time Marine officer lawyer and former Minneapolis housing director. ""Average starting wages have gone up from $16 to $18 per hour since COVID-19 and 2020 as employers are hiring again.""

Rise's revenue increased to about $4.6 million last year which helped it develop online instruction and counseling.

""We're growing including to St. Cloud and Rochester because employers asked us"" Streitz said. ""But we don't have to build bricks and mortar.""

The program served 1245 participants in 2020. More than 560 were in its long-term employment training programs and 275 graduated to paid internships and jobs. The hires move from an income if they have income of less than $13000 to an average income of $35000.

The returns to society are tremendous in terms of lower costs and tax-paying citizens.

A 2013-18 study of the nonprofit by Ecotone Analytics concluded that $1 invested in Twin Cities Rise yields $7.48 in returns to society for full-time job placements. Many participants came from prison some were homeless and others lacked a drivers license sufficient education or skills working with people. These barriers drive public costs that subside when the program and its partners help with find stable housing and a living-wage job.

Also baby boomers didn't replace themselves with even two children per couple. The incremental workforce growth for a decade has been from members of minority groups and immigrants.

State workforce analysis from 2014 through 2019 found that the growth of employment by members of minority groups in such categories as management technology education health care engineering and construction grew faster than the overall job market. That was before 2020 when unemployment spiked because of COVID-19. Those job losses hit minority members particularly hard.

About 80% of Twin Cities Rise's funding comes from private sources. It gets state training money about $700000 last year. However under a unique model that has been renewed with bipartisan support at the Legislature the nonprofit gets up to $22000 per placement but only after two years' retention.

""My goal is to make TCR a stronger organization than the one I found"" said Board Chair Donzel Leggett who joined the board five years ago and is vice president of global manufacturing at General Mills. ""And it was strong when I came to the board.

""When our participants go through empowerment and coaching with the expertise of our fantastic staff … many of them gain the emotional intelligence and wherewithal to break out of the cycle of generational poverty. We're having an impact regionally and even nationally.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

VIRGINIA — The 2021 Forbes list of the best employers has been released with specific rankings for Virginia as well as the other 49 states and the District of Columbia.

To determine the rankings market research firm Statista surveyed 80000 Americans working for businesses with at least 500 employees. The respondents were asked to rate their employers on factors like work environment safety compensation opportunities for advancement and openness to telecommuting. Respondents were also asked how likely they would be to recommend their employers to others. Surveys were conducted from October 2020 to June 2021 accounting for some changes companies have made due to the coronavirus pandemic. The best employer in Virginia is Lockheed Martin according to Forbes' list issued recently. Microsoft NASA the Federal Reserve System and Wegmans Food Markets round out the top five in the rankings for Virginia.

Microsoft was ranked the top employer in DC. These are the top employers in Virginia according to Forbes:

Bank of America Home Depot and the U.S. Department of Defense are ranked in 29 states Walmart in 27 FedEx in 26 and UPS in 25. The full rankings are available online.

Although the pandemic hit the health care education and retail industries among the hardest employers in those fields dominated the rankings according to Forbes. They combined to account for 41 percent of the full 2021 list compared with 38 percent when the 2020 list came out. Microsoft for one has moved to adopt a hybrid work model even after the pandemic ends according to Forbes' report. The tech giant founded by Bill Gates had the No. 1 spot in four states on the lists.

On Sept. 2 2021 at 06.15AM LT Michael Fugnit took a photo of a rather mysterious aircraft at high altitude flying with a southwestern heading over the Philippines.

“I didn’t hear any sounds from the aircraft” told us Michael in a message. “I was waiting for the sunrise since it is my daily routine to capture sunrise and sunsets when I took the photo from the top hill of Brgy. San Roque Municipality of Sta. Magdalena Province of Sorsogon”.

Analysis on the only photograph Michael took of the aircraft suggest that the image is genuine and not doctored.

The shot features what seems to be a large-span flying wing with straight trailing edge and trails two contrails suggesting closely paired twin turbofan engines: in other words the one photographed over the Philippines a few days ago appears to be strikingly similar to the mysterious UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System) spotted flying over Palmdale California in 2020 a UAS thought to be a either the highly classified Northrop Grumman RQ-180 drone or a Lockheed Martin P-175 Polecat derivative.

This is what we wrote in November 2020 when the image of the UAS flying over California first appeared online:

The photo which was claimed to be taken “…in California just north of Edwards [AFB]” shows an aircraft trailing two prominent contrails suggesting the altitude of the aircraft at the time the photo was taken was in excess of approximately 25000 ft. Contrails require moist cold air to freeze the water vapor expelled during normal jet engine combustion. Considering the altitude of the aircraft at the time the photo was taken the size of the aircraft in the photo may be significant. Published estimates of the wingspan of the RQ-180 drone claim it may be as large as 130 ft. Estimates of the wingspan of the Polecat suggest it is about 90 ft. The U.S. Air Force does not acknowledge the existence of the RQ-180 drone but a number of factors seem to support theories of its existence and even operational deployment. One theory that supports the operational deployment of the RQ-180 is the reduction in the number of RQ-4 Global Hawk reconnaissance drones. It’s possible a newer more capable RQ-180 may have taken over missions previously assigned to RQ-4s. Forbes magazine reporter David Axe is another keen-eyed journalist who recognized the significance of the new Kolinsky photo. Late Sunday night Axe wrote “The Air Force reportedly tested the roughly 170-feet-wingspan RQ-180 at Groom Lake part of the Area 51 complex in Nevada. By early 2020 the RQ-180 apparently was so well-established in Air Force service that the flying branch was comfortable cutting its fleet of non-stealthy RQ-4 Global Hawk drones.” […] Observers of the photo on internet forums have made some interesting insights about the Kolinsky photo. Some suggest the planform of the aircraft in Kolinsky’s image is nearly identical to the Polecat. A revived P-175 (the original one crashed in 2007) or a testbed based on it? Maybe.

Provided they are the same type the main difference between the sighting last year and the one of a few days ago is that the latter proves the mysterious (most probably unmanned) aircraft would be already conducting operational missions around the world. In fact based on the location where the aircraft was spotted it seems reasonable to believe it was returning from a mission in the South China Sea where there might have been interesting Chinese activity to surveil. Dispatching a HALE (High Altitude Long Endurance) low-observable drone from either the U.S. or a forward operating location (like Andersen Air Force Base in Guam that already hosts the RQ-4s) to cover some specific time-sensitive target would totally make sense. These missions could require the aircraft to cross some unpopulated areas of the Philippines during daylight conditions (as happened on Sept. 2) when chances to be spotted from the ground are scarce.

Obioviously there are many other intriguing theories including the one that the aircraft overflying the Philippines could be a Chinese H-20 stealth bomber but we have no details suggesting the Chinese have reached a phase of the development of their aircraft that would allow them to fly it in daylight inside enemy airspace.

Dealing with the RQ-180 the existence of a secret unmanned aerial system (UAS) designed for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and scheduled to be operational with the U.S. Air Force by 2015 was first revealed by Aviation Week & Space Technology Senior Pentagon Editor Amy Butler and Senior International Defense Editor Bill Sweetman in December 2013.

Developed by Northrop Grumman since 2008-2009 the stealthy RQ-180 is designed to operate in “contested” or “denied” airspace as opposed to the non-stealthy RQ-4 Global Hawk that are intended for “permissive” scenarios.

In their analysis back then Sweetman and Butler said: “It is similar in size and endurance to the Global Hawk which weighs 32250 lb. and can stay on station for 24 hr. 1200 nm from its base. The much smaller RQ-170 is limited to 5-6 hr. of operation. […] The aircraft uses a version of Northrop’s stealthy “cranked-kite” design as does the X-47B with a highly swept centerbody and long slender outer wings. Northrop Grumman engineers publicly claimed (before the launch of the classified program) that the cranked-kite is scalable and adaptable in contrast to the B-2’s shape which has an unbroken leading edge. The RQ-180’s centerbody length and volume can be greater relative to the vehicle’s size.”

The RQ-180 is nicknamed the “Great White Bat” or sometimes “Shikaka” a fictional sacred white bat from the 1995 movie Ace Venture 2 AW&ST reported.

They kept it secret from everyone else for more than five decades.

The report details a route through which four trucks could traverse the Inland Empire and Mojave Desert. The value of the cargo carried by these trucks appears to have been incalculable: Sensitive enough to coordinate multiple state highway patrol escorts and massive enough to require special government permits for blanketing all two-lane roads in their path.

The convoy’s mission despite its cartoonishly noticeable presence was to avoid any engagement or curiosity from the outside world. A smooth ride was the top priority even if it meant moving highway signs shaving the slope of uphill roads and trimming trees throughout the roughly 450-mile journey.

The route began a few miles north of Hollywood at Lockheed Martin Corp.’s now-former site for top-secret experimental aircraft development: The “Skunk Works” facility. From there overnight stays in Barstow and Shoshone were central to the meticulous blueprint. It ended in southern Nevada at what is now among the most popular locations in American UFO lore.

“MOVEMENT OF TEST ARTICLE FROM B*6 TO AREA 51” the report’s opening subject-line reads. Ambiguity persists throughout in a document that offers details only on a need-to-know basis.

A change of tone

The Central Intelligence Agency declassified this report on Sept. 11 2013 — more than 52 years after it was written — and made it publicly available online for the first time a few years later.

Yet the report has seemingly slipped through the cracks in media and ufology circles ever since. The CIA had been releasing troves of files along similar line for three weeks before it declassified the “B*6-to-Area 51” roadmap.

Those earlier documents included the government’s first-ever acknowledgement that Area 51 exists.

The admittance gave fuel to ufologists and military-history buffs alike after decades of pressing the issue — though often for different reasons. Some view Area 51 as a site for development and testing of advanced but exclusively-earthly technology. Others theorize that it’s home to literal alien bodies.

The 2013 document-release arrived in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from the National Security Archive at George Washington University.

The request didn’t mention Area 51 but covered the CIA’s Lockheed U-2 spy plane program — used during the Cold War to spy on the Soviet Union Cuba and other regions with aerial technology no one else had at the time.

Documents released in response to George Washington University’s request showed that the military used Area 51 for decades beginning in 1955 to test the U-2 and its successor the A-12 OXCART. Both planes were created at Lockheed Martin’s former Skunk Works facility.

The formerly classified “B*6-to-Area-51” route began at Lockheed Martin’s former Skunk Works facility in Burbank. The Bethesda Maryland-based aerospace and arms company used this site for top-secret work throughout the Cold War but it moved those operations to Palmdale in the 1990s.

Skunk Works is still active today. Construction finished last month Aug. 18 on a new 215000-square-foot facility at the Palmdale site for classified work using “digital tools robotics artificial intelligence and augmented reality to reduce the need for hard tooling” the San Gabriel Valley Tribune reported.

“The problem with Skunk Works’ programs is that they typically get credit for changing history long after they actually change history” a program manager once said according to Lockheed’s website.

In 2021 the Pentagon is departing from a longtime dismissal of UFO-talk. The military this year has stated that multiple videos of what it calls “unidentified aerial phenomena” are real encouraged personnel to report “sightings” for the first time and taken other legitimizing actions.

The sudden change-of-tone lends a present-day fascination to the 1961 “B*6 to Area 51” roadmap for High Desert residents specifically and the world in general.

‘Traveling on a special permit’

The August 1961 report’s unnamed authors describe test-runs they’d conducted from Skunk Works to Area 51 over the prior two years while hauling the specific “test article” that the report centered around.

The authors offer little detail to clarify exactly what the cargo was or why it was so important. Presumably their original recipients either already knew or were themselves not allowed to know. They do make one thing clear: This was a big haul.

“All four of these trucks were over width traveling on a special permit” the report states.

The authors attached various grainy photos that they said were taken at prominent checkpoints during those runs. One photo referenced in the report is said to have been taken of a fenced area for parking at Barstow Diesel Service where the convoy spent its first night.

Three of the trucks each carried one piece of the overall “test article” as the report describes it. Each object would be reassembled into the whole form when the trucks arrived at Area 51 and “the fourth truck had the turn-over jigs and fixtures” needed for that reassembly the report states.

One truck carried a piece of the test article measuring 32.5 feet wide and 63 feet long according to the report which calls this “the largest package” but doesn’t describe it further.

The second truck’s haul measured to 22 feet wide and 30 feet long. These were “the outer panels” of the test article.

The third truck carried the test article’s “forward section” measuring 14 feet wide and 65 feet long.

The authors identified multiple changes to the landscape that curated their convoy’s route including that:

A “KEEP RIGHT” sign in north San Fernando had to be moved.

Some trees just east of Hinkley may need trimming.

Some trees near Yermo checking station definitely needed trimming (about five feet worth).

Just outside of Shoshone “it will be necessary to remove (five feet) of a small hill.”

A fear of standing out to casual passersby during the 1961 voyage appears to have held merit. The authors at one point indirectly inject an element of slapstick comedy into the report by describing one series of unfortunate events they faced on the initial test run in 1959.

“We had a serious problem on the hills with a couple of the trucks dropping down to 4 to 8 miles per hour” the report states. “This caused the traffic to build up behind the convoy and made it necessary for the State Highway Patrol cars to pull the convoy off the highway into a clearing to allow the general traffic to pass.

“This makes it real difficult to get started again especially on a hill with such a large and heavily loaded truck. This then would cause us to continue our move at a slow rate of speed on most of the long hills such as the Highway 99 ridge route and again out of Baker to Shoshone.”

The B*6-to-Area-51 blueprint relied on highway patrol escorts to mitigate hiccups like this.

Upon reaching a service station in Death Valley Junction the report stated “the California State Highway Patrol will turn the convoy over to the Nevada State Highway Patrol.”

With the Nevada patrol now maintaining its cover the convoy entered its final stretch. The trucks were to travel through a nuclear weapons testing site run by the Atomic Energy Commission the report says then through the town of Mercury Nevada. That led to its destination: “Groom Lake Area 51.”

‘All sorts of weird stuff’

The report describes this as not a one-time roadmap but a route likely to be traveled as standard practice by top-secret trucks in the future.

“This type of convoy is required to travel in daylight hours Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday. Not allowed to travel on Holidays or Friday Saturday Sunday or Monday because of heavy public traffic on these days.”

Steve Smith — who has lived in Barstow since 1979 and worked with the Mojave River Valley Museum for two decades — is well-acquainted with UFO lore in the High Desert.

“Post-World War II we had all sorts of weird stuff going on in the sky here in Barstow” Smith said in an interview.

One story Smith describes ties into perhaps the most famous incident in American UFO lore: The 1947 Roswell New Mexico affair in which rancher William “Mac” Brazel found a massive collection of debris he described as metal-like material that didn’t conform with any metal he’d seen or held before.

Military personnel scooped up the material in Roswell and in following days said the material was merely a crashed weather balloon. The story has faced pushback ever since with witnesses from the time claiming the government conducted various acts of what some now call “fake news” to cover up the real source of the debris.

One day before the Roswell incident according to Smith the High Desert had its own alleged UFO encounter. A group of high-schoolers claimed that as they sat atop B Hill in Barstow that day Smith said “they saw an airplane chase a UFO across the sky.”

Yet with this and other eerie tales originating from 20th-century Barstow Smith said an important point to remember is the city’s proximity to various military stations. He specifically highlighted its direct connection to the Fort Irwin National Training Center and a major Marine Corps Logistics Base both of which began taking their current form around 1942.

Smith claims the local newspaper covering Barstow in the decades following this time was often censored by the military when reporting on the development of these bases as well as on seemingly paranormal events that locals described at the time.

He finds the ""B*6-to-Area-51"" report fascinating but says he is not buying an extraterrestrial answer to its mysteries.

Rather than alien UFOs Smith thinks the item being transferred was “probably something from JPL” referencing NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

Smith added that the report reminds him of something he consistently encountered when he worked as a ghost-tour guide a couple years back. After getting off work between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Saturday nights he always took Interstate 15.

“Literally every time I would do that — and I know other people who can testify to this — there would be a white semi-truck going towards L.A. with no company markings and no chemical markings or anything like that flashing its hazard-lights and driving the speed limit” Smith said.

Although commonly referred to in the singular Lockheed Martin’s fifth-generation F-35 stealth fighter is technically three different planes: the F-35A conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) variant that is being procured by the US Air Force (USAF) to phase out the F-16 Fighting Falcon the F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) variant that’s slated to succeed several of the Marine Corps’ aging fighters and a F-35 catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery variant that’s optimized for operations from aircraft carriers. The F-35A is by far the most numerous of the three with the Air Force seeking to procure just under 1800 such units through the coming decades. But the fact that the F-35B and F-35C are being procured in smaller numbers does not make them any less significant for the key battlefield tasks that they are meant to perform.

The F-35B attained initial operating capability (IOC) in 2015. The fighter is principally slated to replace the 1980’s AV-8B Harrier II which is rapidly approaching its planned 2025 sunset period after having its service life cut short due to mounting maintenance outlays. The F-35B is generally similar in dimensions to its F-35A counterpart but there are several notable differences under the hood. The F-35B sacrifices about one-third of the F-35A’s fuel capacity at 13500 versus 18250 pounds of internal fuel to accommodate a shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF). Given these special design considerations the F-35B also has a slightly lower weapons payload of 15000 lbs and shorter combat radius of around 505 nautical miles. Still the fighter features internal and external weapons bays that support the same weapons configurations as the F-35A.

The SDLF is in essence a lift system that gives the F-35B the unique capability to land vertically in a similar fashion to a helicopter; it likewise helps the fighter to take off from short runways. The system works by generating a massive downward thrust that enables the plane to “hover.” It should be noted that F-35B’s STOVL capability is not a functionality trade-off in the sense that the fighter fully retains the ability to land on longer conventional runways. Consider also that the F-35B’s slightly reduced range is offset by the fact that it can take off from and land in places where its F-35A counterpart cannot. It’s a similar story for the F-35C; whereas the former operates from aircraft carriers as part of U.S. Carrier Strike Groups (CSG’s) the F-35B can operate from smaller amphibious ships like the USS America. This means that amphibious assault formations can deploy their own fifth-generation stealth fighters without relying on the carrier fleets of nearby CSG’s a major tactical boon for the Marine Corps. The F-35B’s “hover” ability opens new venues for scouting and close-air-support that are impossible for the other two F-35 variants and especially useful in the context of the Marine Corps’ amphibious assault operations.

The F-35B vastly outperforms the Harrier II that it is replacing in virtually every category delivering a larger payload at a longer range and faster speed. The F-35B is exponentially more survivable due to its stealth-focused design not only lowering operational risks across the board but also allowing the fighter to undertake deep penetration missions that would have been inconceivable for the Harrier. This comes in addition to the fighter’s revolutionary interoperability and networking features with the F-35B able to act as a force multiplier for nearby surface ground and airborne units through its sensor fusion suite that can generate a dynamic integrated picture of the battlefield.

There are currently fifty-seven F-35B’s in the Marine Corps' possession of which just over two dozen are trainer units. As of its most recent aviation plan the service aims to procure 353 F-35B’s spread across fourteen mixed-strength squadrons two reserve squadrons and two fleet readiness squadrons. “Game changer” is nothing if not an overused phrase in defense commentary but one thing is clear: the F-35B will transform how the Marines wage war.

In the trailer above you can hear the likes of Chris Pratt Ben Schwartz and Fred Armisen as well as many of the key talents from various departments on set such as the prop maker who created DJ Roomba. Surely Amy Poehler will be involved at some point because she's pretty much the most important part of the show.

Even though Lowe didn't join ""Parks and Recreation"" until towards the end of the second season of the series Yang has been in the writers room for every single season of the series so there will be no shortage of stories from deep behind the scenes. Plus Lowe already has that podcast momentum going since he's been hosting ""Literally! With Rob Lowe"" a podcast that references ""Parks and Recreation"" in its title but merely features the actor talking to his famous friends and collaborators in an intimate way. It'll be interesting to hear what Lowe has to say about the episodes of the series before he joined the cast with Adam Scott.

Yang says they'll be diving into ""Parks and Recreation"" episode-by-episode but it's not clear if that means they'll be chronicling every single episode from all seven seasons for a total of 125 episodes or if they'll be choosing select episodes for coverage. ""Office Ladies"" has been going through each and every episode of ""The Office"" in chronological order so I'm hoping that ""Parks and Recreation"" is getting the same treatment.

Below is the official synopsis for the ""Parks and Recreation"" podcast premiering on September 14 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2hvbWUvaG9tZS1kZXBvdC1odWJzcGFjZS1ib3RoLWV4Y2l0aW5nLXdvcnJ5aW5nL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2hvbWUvaG9tZS1kZXBvdC1odWJzcGFjZS1ib3RoLWV4Y2l0aW5nLXdvcnJ5aW5nLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Home Depot’s Hubspace smart home line has me both excited and worried,"Home Depot has announced its own line of smart home products called Hubspace as the home improvement giant looks to take its place among the ever-growing number of companies looking to make a mark in the rapidly expanding market. The announcement of a new lineup of budget-priced products is exciting especially given the number of them – more than 20 products in total – but it also stirs a tinge of worry.

Store-brand products do not have a great track record

Let’s dice into the source of this anxiety with a question. What happens to smart products if they lose all support? They turn into “dumb” accessories. Sometimes unsupported smart products can still be used as normal lights or speakers but the loss of support often means you are left with a very expensive paperweight. Unfortunately this isn’t just pessimism – this exact scenario played out with Best Buy’s Insignia brand.

The company shut down support on November 6 2019. While the smart plugs still worked as plugs and the lights still provided illumination there was an Insignia-branded smart camera that became a pricy piece of plastic. Best Buy isn’t the only company to shut down support when its products don’t perform as well as expected.

Lowe’s shut down its Iris platform on March 31 2019. The difference between the Iris shutdown and the Insignia shutdown is that Lowe’s provided refunds to its customers. Best Buy only offered partial refunds and only for products that had already been connected and registered. If you had an Insignia smart device that hadn’t been hooked up by the deadline you were out of luck.

With many store-branded smart devices ending support within just a few years of launch including Home Depot’s biggest competitor I can’t help but approach the announcement with a healthy amount of skepticism. The new products will enter a market already thick with competition so fast adoption and continued support from Home Depot will ultimately decide whether the devices succeed or the platform falls flat.

Hubspace is off to a strong start

Despite the obstacles to a new smart home platform entering the market at this time Hubspace has a lot going for it. The platform is designed with compatibility in mind and integrates seamlessly with Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. This means you have the option for smart voice control out of the box.

Hubspace is also compatible with both iPhone and Android right away. Some platforms start initially on one or the other which limits its user base out of the gate. That isn’t the case here. Hubspace lets you pair products through both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi although it defaults to Wi-Fi control. If you have no connection Bluetooth will work instead. This means you can control the platform remotely a key aspect of any effective smart home platform.

Some of the products available at launch include smart LED bulbs smart recessed lighting smart LED tape lights and recessed LED trim. There are also smart ceiling fans and smart plugs. The variety of products sets it apart especially considering the lack of brand-name products in the overall market. If you’ve ever tried to find a smart ceiling fan you know how few options are available from brands you recognize.

The same holds true for recessed lighting. It’s not easy to find name-brand (or even smart) recessed lighting so the fact Home Depot is making it easy to control these lights straight from the Hubspace app is a major win.

Another key element that gives Hubspace a leg up is the ease with which visiting friends and family can connect to your devices. The process isn’t as complex as it is on other platforms and makes controlling smart devices much more approachable even for those that aren’t the most tech-savvy. You can even control multiple homes from the Hubspace app similar to the way HomeKit works.

The ability to build your own network of smart home devices and control them all from the Home Depot app as well as through the two major smart assistants is a great start for this platform. If Hubspace goes on to later include HomeKit compatibility it will really stand out from those that have come before. It has a tremendous amount of promise especially with the different device options that come with it.

Limited reach

Despite all of these strengths I’m still skeptical. Hubspace is trying to grow in an environment where many other platforms have tried and failed especially those that are store-specific. Home Depot is an American institution which automatically limits the customer base of these products. Other brand-name smart devices have global reach like Ikea’s line of smart home devices. I have a lot of hope for Hubspace but I will reserve judgment until I have the chance to try it for myself.

LULU,Lululemon Athletica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvbHVsdWxlbW9uLWF0aGxldGljYS1icmFuZC1sb3lhbHR5LWRyaXZpbmctc2hhcmVob2xkZXItdmFsdWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lululemon Athletica: Brand Loyalty Driving Shareholder Value - TipRanks.com,"Lululemon Athletica (LULU) is a sports apparel company specializing in clothes designed for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities such as yoga running and training and various sweaty recreations. Despite Lululemon’s branding itself for such niche activities the company has gathered international appeal. With sales and profitability expanding rapidly Lululemon currently features a market cap of around $52.6 billion.

While COVID-19 limited relevant businesses such as gyms consumers’ increased interest in outdoor sports and activities following global lockdowns actually boosted demand for Lululemon’s products. I am bullish on the stock. (See Lululemon stock charts on TipRanks)

Brand Value Boosting Margins

Lululemon’s sales growth momentum following the pandemic’s boost has hardly faded out. In its Q2 results the company reported net revenue growth of 88% to $1.2 billion. International sales in fact grew by 125% which means that the company should be less reliant on U.S.-based sales in the future as the sales mix widens.

What makes Lululemon different and quite investor-friendly compared to its larger peers is not just its higher growth rates but sky-high margins. The company has managed to achieve excellent profitability levels in the sports apparel industry due to its branding as a purveyor of luxury-like clothing that targets higher-end consumers who are willing to pay a premium price.

For example Lululemon’s women’s leggings its flagship product start selling at $69.00 post-discount with an average price point above $100. For this reason Lululemon’s gross margins are considerably juicier compared to the company’s competitors.

For context Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDYY) feature gross margins of around 45% and 50% respectively. This compares to gross margins of 57% in the case of Lululemon despite the company’s significantly inferior scale and production capacities against these two industry behemoths.

Lululemon’s Valuation

These days high growth lucrative margins and expanding brands do not come cheap. With Lululemon combining multiple such traits its stock has consistently attracted a premium price tag much like its products. Despite the growing profits attempting to catch up to the stock’s extensive rally and justify its valuation multiple Lululemon trades at a forward P/E of around 47.

On the one hand this is quite a high multiple for the company industry-wise. On the other hand with analysts expecting annual EPS growth of at least 20% over the next few years it’s no wonder why investors keep buying any dip (which rarely occurs anyway).

Wall Street’s Take

Turning to Wall Street Lululemon Athletica has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys 3 Holds and zero Sells assigned in the past three months. At $414.25 the average analyst LULU price target implies a 6.67% upside potential.

Moving Forward

Overall Lululemon seems well-positioned to keep capitalizing on the growing demand for sportswear especially on the ever-expanding wellness trend. The company keeps opening new stores specifically two new stores in Q2 reaching 523 locations at the end of the quarter. At the same time online sales gaining a higher percentage of the total sales mix should keep boosting net margins higher.

Shares may be pricey but considering Lululemon’s growth trajectory and historically excellent brand-developing execution investors may want to consider its long-term potential.

Wes Ball’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes from 20th Century Studios the first Apes release under the Disney empire is looking at $21M-$22M today (which includes previews) for a what is looking like a $52M-$55M opening at 4075 theaters. Tracking saw it around $50M.

Also the opening is in the vicinity of the first and third chapter of the previous millennium trilogy: 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M Friday $54.8M 3-day) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M Friday $56.2M 3-day). RT Audience sentiment is still at 82%.

The rest of the top five is as follows:

2.) Fall Guy (Uni) 4008 theaters Fri $3.6M 3-day $14.5M -48% Total $50.5M/Wk 2

3.) Challengers (AMZ) 2609 theaters Fri $1.55M 3-day $5M -34% Total $38.3M/Wk 3

4.) Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Fri $1M 3-day $3.4M -48% Total $12M/Wk 2

5.) Godzilla x Kong (WB/Leg) 2531 theaters Fri $700K 3-day $3M -34% Total $192.3M/Wk 7

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvdmEtaW1wcm9wZXJseS1hcHByb3ZlZC0xMW0tYm9udXNlcy1zZW5pb3ItZXhlY3V0aXZlcy13YXRjaGRvZy9zdG9yeT9pZD0xMTAwODE1NjnSAXRodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9Qb2xpdGljcy92YS1pbXByb3Blcmx5LWFwcHJvdmVkLTExbS1ib251c2VzLXNlbmlvci1leGVjdXRpdmVzLXdhdGNoZG9nL3N0b3J5P2lkPTExMDA4MTU2OQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VA improperly approved almost $11M in bonuses to senior executives watchdog says,"Some have challenged having to pay the money back an inspector general said.

VA improperly approved almost $11M in bonuses to senior executives watchdog says

Department of Veterans Affairs officials improperly approved nearly $11 million in bonuses to senior executives intended for other workers a department watchdog said in a new report.

The money was recently allocated by Congress and intended to be used to recruit ""critical skill"" employees but ended up in the hands of senior executives in the VA's central Washington office according to an inspector general's report posted Thursday.

The funds authorized by the Pact Act were meant to be incentives in hiring and retaining specialists needed to process billion in new benefits for veterans dealing with health issues from being exposed to burn pits. Agent Orange and other toxic hazards.

The IG report said the money was paid instead as bonuses to more than 180 senior executives last year with several taking home more than $100000.

The average bonus paid out was over $55000 the report said.

The Washington Post first reported the results of the inspector general's investigation.

The IG said the improperly approved bonuses were due in part to breakdowns in leadership and controls at multiple levels of the VA.

The IG recommended the ""Secretary of Veterans Affairs or his designee takes appropriate action to determine whether individuals involved in the decision-making process ... had any actual or apparent conflicts of interest and develop a process to ensure all decision-makers are free from conflicts when awarding future incentives.""

When Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough in September ordered the executives to return the money most did or agreed to do so but 19 have challenged having to repay the bonuses the IG report said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMTIwNTkyLW5iYS1ydW1vcnMtbWlrZS1idWRlbmhvbHplci1zdW5zLWFncmVlLXRvLTUteWVhci01MG0tY29udHJhY3QtYWZ0ZXItdm9nZWwtZmlyaW5n0gGNAWh0dHBzOi8vc3luZGljYXRpb24uYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FtcC8xMDEyMDU5Mi1uYmEtcnVtb3JzLW1pa2UtYnVkZW5ob2x6ZXItc3Vucy1hZ3JlZS10by01LXllYXItNTBtLWNvbnRyYWN0LWFmdGVyLXZvZ2VsLWZpcmluZy5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBA Rumors: Mike Budenholzer Suns Agree to 5-Year $50M Contract After Vogel Firing,"Jeff Haynes/NBAE via Getty Images

The Phoenix Suns have filled their coaching vacancy.

Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported that the franchise has agreed to a five-year deal worth more than $50 million with Mike Budenholzer.

Budenholzer has been named NBA Coach of the Year twice in his career and has an overall record of 484-317. The Suns will be his third spot as he previously spent time with the Milwaukee Bucks and Atlanta Hawks.

Budenholzer's most recent tenure came with the Bucks where he led the franchise to a 271-120 record in five seasons. The team won the 2021 NBA championship coincidentally against Phoenix and had a 39-26 overall postseason record.

In that role with Milwaukee he saw Giannis Antetokounmpo win two MVP awards and saw other players like Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday play major roles on contending teams. In Phoenix he will have a similar situation to handle.

The Suns boast the likes of Kevin Durant Bradley Beal and Devin Booker and earned a 49-33 regular-season record. However that only earned a No. 6 seed in a loaded Western Conference and the team's season ended in the first round at the hands of the Minnesota Timberwolves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Ukrainian M-2 Sneaked Up On A Russian Tank—And Hit From A Mile Away,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/05/08/a-ukrainian-m-2-fighting-vehicle-sneaked-up-on-a-russian-t-80-tank-at-night-and-hit-it-with-a-missile-from-a-mile-away/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Together they have developed The Hotel Waste Measurement Methodology which will allow hotels to collect data on waste. This will allow them to create waste reduction targets to keep food waste out of landfills.

WWF was founded in Switzerland in 1961 by individuals concerned about the impact of human activity on vulnerable animals. Now the charity has turned its attention to preventing climate change catastrophe.

Rotting food creates a greenhouse gas: methane

Food waste is a massive contributor to climate change. Rotting food in landfill creates methane a greenhouse gas which is more potent than CO2.

Humanity minimising the volume of methane is as important as decreasing the consumption of CO2.

According to WWF:

One-third of all the food produced in the world goes to waste

It’s important to remember food is not just wasted when customers buy the food cook too much of it and throw the remains away. Food can also be lost or spoiled during distribution

WWF believes that this volume of food would be enough to feed every undernourished person on earth

In the USA 40% of food waste comes from restaurants and hotels something Pete Pearson global food loss and waste lead for World Wildlife Fund feels needs to change.

“The hotel industry has the unique ability to implement changes that will have global impacts when it comes to managing food waste and all waste” said Pearson.

Hotel industry to decrease food waste

As the world gets back to normal the hotel industry will evolve into a more sustainable one.

“Through awareness with our operating teams on how much food waste is generated and by measuring it we believe we can bring behavioral change” said Max Verstraete Hilton’s VP of corporate responsibility. “We can change menus for our restaurants buffets and catering events — how they’re set what we’re buying how we’re buying — which ultimately has a positive impact on food costs.”

The Hotel Waste Measurement Methodology has been reviewed by figures in the hotel industry who feel it addresses the hardest challenges faced by hotels.

“As companies start using it and more data becomes available we will be able to update the methodology to reflect new insights and harness the power of industry benchmarking. This will in turn catalyze action across the hotel sector as companies work towards waste reduction and diversion goals” says Olivia Ruggles-Brise Greenview Director.

HARD-EARNED POINT KICKS OFF WCQ

The USMNT started its World Cup qualifying campaign with a tough 0-0 draw vs. El Salvador in front of a raucous sellout crowd of 29000 at San Salvador’s Estadio Cuscatlán. It proved to be a back-and-forth affair as both sides struggled to establish rhythm on a choppy and spongy playing surface.

The U.S. and El Salvador both showed some flashes in attack on set plays nearly scoring on headers from their respective center backs in the opening 15 minutes. Second-half substitutes for the USA made a difference late and Weston McKennie factored into two of the USMNT’s best chances in the 73rd and 75th sending a header just wide and sending in a cross for Kellyn Acosta that forced the Salvadoran goalkeeper into action.

Goalkeeper Matt Turner recorded his seventh shutout in eight starts with the USMNT. After winning his first seven appearances Turner is undefeated in his first eight games with the USA conceding just one goal- a penalty kick in a 6-1 win against Martinique in the 2021 Gold Cup group stage.





INTRODUCTION TO CONCACAF WCQ

Thursday night’s match provided an introduction to the rigors of Concacaf World Cup qualifying for many of the USMNT’s young player pool. Twelve of 16 players made their World Cup qualifying debut for the USA in the match against El Salvador tying a modern-era record set in the opening game of 1998 World Cup qualifying on Nov. 3 1996 vs. Guatemala in Washington D.C. Gio Reyna became the second-youngest U.S. player to start a qualifying match following only Christian Pulisic. Also making his qualifying debut Tyler Adams became the youngest player to captain the USMNT in the modern era.

The starting line-up carried an average age of 23 years 282 days the fourth-youngest WCQ line-up in the modern era and third-youngest in matches where the team had not already qualified or advanced to the next round. The only lineups that were younger came in April 1989 from the first two matches of qualifying for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3NvY2Nlci1zcG9ydHMtbGEtbGlnYS13b3JsZC1jdXAtZXJlZGl2aXNpZS1mY2ZmOWZmMzFlOGU4YTRlYmU3ZDI4MDZmNGMzNzVlM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Depay double as Dutch outclass Montenegro 4-0 in qualis,"EINDHOVEN Netherlands (AP) — Memphis Depay scored a brace and the Netherlands outclassed Montenegro 4-0 on Saturday to stay second in Europe Group G of World Cup qualifying.

The Barcelona striker shot the Netherlands into the lead from the penalty spot in the 38th minute after he was hauled down by Dusan Lagator. He doubled the lead in the 62nd with a hard shot that beat goalkeeper Matija Sarkic at his near post.

Georginio Wijnaldum made it 3-0 in the 70th after a quick pass by Steven Berghuis and Cody Gakpo curled a shot into the far corner six minutes later for a memorable first international goal.

It was a night to remember for fans at Philips Stadium; Depay and Wijnaldum made their names playing in Eindhoven and Gakpo still plays for PSV.

Turkey stayed atop Group G after beating Gibraltar 3-0.

Earlier Erling Haaland scored first as Norway beat Latvia 2-0 in Riga.

The Netherlands plays Turkey in Amsterdam on Tuesday.

“We’ll take a good feeling from this match” midfielder Frenkie de Jong told Dutch broadcaster NOS. “Now on to Turkey.”

The Netherlands started without captain Virgil van Dijk to prevent the Liverpool defender who has only recently fully recovered from a serious knee injury from having to play three internationals in a week.

Juventus defender Matthijs de Ligt replaced Van Dijk while Van Gaal gave a debut to Feyenoord left back Tyrell Malacia to replace the suspended Daley Blind.

The Netherlands started sluggishly but quickly took control of the match. Davy Klaassen shot just over in the 28th and headed powerfully against the bar four minutes later before Depay opened the scoring.

The Dutch could have gone further ahead before the break with Depay curling a shot just over the bar three minutes after his penalty.

Stefan Mugosa spurned a great chance to equalize in the 56th when he blazed his shot high and wide after running onto a back pass from Dutch debutant Malacia.

Depay scored his 30th international goal to put the result beyond doubt before Wijnaldum and Gakpo rounded off the scoring. Van Gaal beamed and raised his arms to celebrate Gakpo’s strike.

Depay even had time to pose for a selfie with a young fan who ran onto the pitch in the 90th. Other fans ran onto the pitch after the fulltime whistle.

Van Gaal’s first match in his third stint as Netherlands coach ended 1-1 with Norway. On the same night Montenegro scored an equalizer deep in stoppage time to earn a 2-2 draw with Turkey. Against the dominant Dutch there was no comeback.

“After the European Championship and Norway you really wanted a match like this” Wijnaldum said. The Netherlands was eliminated in the round of 16 at Euro 2020.

The business world is speaking out against a new Texas law banning abortions after six weeks.

Lyft Uber and Match are among the companies taking action against SB8 or the ""heartbeat bill.""

The CEOs of Bumble and Match Group called the law ""regressive.""

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Companies are speaking out against Texas' harsh new anti-abortion law.

The Senate Bill 8 in Texas nicknamed the ""Heartbeat Bill"" bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy - which is before many women realize they are pregnant - even in the case of incest or rape.

It specifically allows private Texas citizens to report and personally sue anyone they think is seeking an abortion as well as anyone helping them.

The Supreme Court ruled not to block the Texas law.

Here are the business world players taking action against the new legislation.

GoDaddy shut down an anti-abortion website

Gizmodo wrote about the website which was registered to GoDaddy and created by an anti-abortion group called Texas Right to Life for people to report on others who were seeking abortions.

The company tweeted Friday that it told the website's owner ""they have violated GoDaddy's terms of service and have 24 hours to move to a different provider.""

Texas Right to Life spokesperson told CNN that the organization ""will not be silenced"" and ""if anti-Lifers want to take our website down we'll put it back up.""

Dallas-based Match Group called the law 'regressive'

The dating app company owns Tinder and Hinge and its CEO - Shar Dubey - is a Texas resident who immigrated from India 25 years ago. She wrote in an internal memo that she is ""shocked"" to ""live in a state where women's reproductive laws are more regressive than most of the world.""

The CEO also said she's creating a fund for Match employees that are affected by Texas' new abortion law to seek healthcare out of state.

""I'm not speaking about this as the CEO of a company"" Dubey wrote. ""I'm speaking about this personally as a mother and a woman who has fervently cared about women's rights including the very fundamental right of choice over her body.""

Bumble created a fund for Texas women to access abortions

The dating app company said in a tweet last week that it had started a relief fund for proceeds to go to organizations that support women's reproductive rights.

CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd said in a tweet that her $6.6 billion company was ""women-founded and women' led"" and that it would ""keep fighting against regressive laws like #SB8.""

Uber and Lyft said they will pay legal fees of drivers that get sued

Carlo Allegri/Reuters

Texas' abortion law forbids anyone to transport a woman to receive an abortion after six weeks which could affect drivers of ride-sharing companies.

Lyft said it created a Driver Legal Defense Fund to completely front the costs that drivers could incur under the new law.

""Drivers are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why"" Lyft said Friday. ""Imagine being a driver and not knowing if you are breaking the law by giving someone a ride. Similarly riders never have to justify or even share where they are going and why.

""Imagine being a pregnant woman trying to get to a healthcare appointment and not knowing if your driver will cancel on you for fear of breaking a law"" the company said. ""Both are completely unacceptable.""

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi shared Lyft cofounder Logan Green's pledge on Friday and tweeted that ""drivers shouldn't be put at risk for getting people where they want to go"" and that Uber will also cover legal fees of its drivers.

A previous version of this story said American Airlines had spoken out about the Texas abortion law. The airline has not commented on that legislation.

At a clinic in Albuquerque New Mexico an abortion provider said that on Tuesday the day before the law’s enactment every patient who had made an appointment online was from its neighbor state to the east. By Thursday all of New Mexico’s abortion clinics were reportedly booked up for weeks and a Dallas center had dispatched dozens of employees to help the much less populated state’s overtaxed system.

But for every Texan who is able to leave town to elude the new law there are more who can’t.

“That’s the people that have a working car that can get time off who have somebody who can take care of their kids” said Vicki Cowart president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains which covers New Mexico Colorado and Las Vegas Nevada. “There are going to be thousands of individuals who don’t have that wherewithal and it’s really particularly going to impact women of color young women rural women.”

The Texas law prohibits abortions after doctors detect a “fetal heartbeat” which can be as early as six weeks along when many people still don’t know they are pregnant. Experts call the term misleading because embryos haven’t developed a heart by this stage but do exhibit cardiac activity. The law does not exempt cases where someone was impregnated as a result of rape or incest.

But the state does not enforce the law. Instead private citizens can sue those they suspect are violating it ranging from abortion providers to abortion funds and even other civilians like Uber drivers who drive women to abortion clinics. And under the law anyone in the country is able to file lawsuits against Texans they suspect of aiding in now-illegal abortions.

For Republican lawmakers and abortion opponents the Texas law was a long-fought victory one of the strictest abortion laws to go into effect since the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973. When signing the legislation in May Gov. Greg Abbott said the measure “ensures that the life of every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion.”

But abortion providers as well as advocates for the rights of immigrants and Black women say that the new restrictions won’t establish a de facto ban on abortion for all Texans. Instead they argue state lawmakers have created a system that will most heavily affect teenagers and Texans with disabilities as well as further disadvantage poor women of color.

Half of all women in the U.S. who got an abortion in 2014 lived in poverty double the percentage in 1994 according to a 2016 study by the Guttmacher Institute a reproductive health research group. Texas health data shows that Black patients accounted for about 30% of Texas abortions in 2020 though 12% of the state’s population is Black. In Texas and the nation Black women are much more likely to die in pregnancy-related deaths than white or Hispanic women.

“For Black women we know that our young girls are at risk of losing their futures because they’ll be forced to parent before they’re prepared” said Michelle Anderson with the Afiya Center an advocacy group for Black Texans’ reproductive rights. “It will further perpetuate the rate of generational poverty in Black communities ... . It also perpetuates the rate of maternal mortality.”

For access to a legal abortion provider after about six weeks Texas residents now have to be able to spend the time and money to travel out of state. That could take days: State laws in Louisiana and Oklahoma currently require respectively 24- and 72-hour waiting periods after an initial appointment before a patient can get an abortion. On the west New Mexico has no major abortion restrictions like waiting periods or required parental notification but most of Texas’ population is closer to the more restrictive states.

Where the average distance to an abortion clinic in Texas had been about 12 miles according to a report by the Guttmacher Institute that has now grown to about 248 miles. Beyond driving time and cost of gas abortions may now require the cost of lodging child care and lost wages the institute reported.

Although the new limits on abortion — which providers estimate will ban about 85% of abortions in the state — just went into effect Wednesday Texas women and neighboring providers had a glimpse last year of what was to come. In 2020 an executive order from Gov. Greg Abbott effectively banned abortion for more than a month during the pandemic labelling the procedure elective as hospital space became limited. During that time Cowart said clinics in Colorado and New Mexico saw a 12-fold increase in patients.

“The folks that went out of state [for abortions] and came back to have follow-up care tended to be higher-income tended to be white folks” said Bhavik Kumar a doctor at Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston recalling patients he saw after Abbott’s executive order ended.

The patients who simply had to wait for weeks until the order ended to have their procedures in Texas “were the folks that were low-income folks of color especially Black women” Kumar added.

Throughout 2020 the number of abortions performed on Texas residents out-of-state nearly doubled from 654 the year before to 1226 according to data from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The state did not split data by month for out-of-state abortions. Still the number was relatively small compared with the nearly 54000 performed in Texas.

About 3% of abortions for white and Black Texans were performed out of state the health department reported. But while Hispanic women living in Texas had more abortions in 2020 than any other racial or ethnic group — nearly 20000 — only two left the state for the procedure the state reported. The health department could not clarify Thursday how other states reported on data about Hispanic people.

Immigrant rights advocates said Hispanic women have lower numbers of out-of-state abortions partly because many immigrants from Central and South America are unable to leave border cities much less the state due to federal immigration checkpoints. For others any health care inquiry any health care spending can be a burden.

“Outside of the existing barriers for the immigrant population to health care access … there’s already an existing fear to just call [a doctor] and find out [if they’re pregnant]” said Miriam Camero vice president of social programs at RAICES an immigrants’ rights group.

The flood of Texans reaching out to clinics in other states began well before the law took effect Wednesday. A Planned Parenthood spokesperson said Thursday that New Mexico clinics were already booked up three weeks out after performing abortions for a significant number of Texans on Tuesday at the Albuquerque clinic. And one Dallas abortion provider Southwestern Women’s Surgery Center sent a dozen members of its staff to a sister clinic in New Mexico to help treat the increase in patients there.

Staffers left Dallas at 5 a.m. Wednesday so they could reach Albuquerque in time to “see as many patients as as possible who are going to need abortion care that aren’t going to be able to access it here in Texas” said Allison Gilbert a doctor at the Dallas clinic.

The staffers plan to stay there for at least three to four weeks Gilbert said.

Some organizations have started abortion funds to help women with the costs of traveling out of state. The law notes that providers and those assisting women in getting abortions can be sued for violating Texas’ ban; advocates and some providers fear that could include helping women leave the state. RAICES as well as abortion fundraising groups like the Lilith Fund and Texas Equal Access Fund are hoping to get women access to abortion who would otherwise not be able to afford it.

Even some private companies like Match Group in Dallas and Bumble in Austin which are both headed by women have set up similar funds.

But for many even if they can get access to funds for a paid trip the costs will still be insurmountable said Anderson with the Afiya Center.

“There are a lot of barriers especially when you’re talking about Black women” she said referring to child care and job instability. “It also may be like am I going to be able to pay my rent? Am I going to be able to put food on the table?”

Americans Ally Ewing and Nelly Korda endured a rules controversy during their Saturday four-ball match. Getty Images

That putt was never going to fall. OK not never. One time in a thousand in a situation like Nelly Korda’s Saturday afternoon at the Solheim Cup a rogue wind will suddenly materialize sweep across a green and cause a dead-still ball sitting on a lip to drop.

Far more often lip balls that eventually drop are teetering. That’s why the 10-second rule exists to give that overhanging teetering ball a chance to drop.

The logic is the logic. The rules don’t allow a player to hit a moving ball. Not from a fairway not from the rough not on the green. So if a ball is sitting on the lip — if per Rule 13 any part of the ball is hanging over the lip — a player gets 10 seconds to allow the ball to drop. That is 10 seconds after the player takes a reasonable amount of time to get to the hole.

Nelly Korda never got her 10 seconds on her putt on 13 to win a critical hole in a tight match. She never got one second. The American’s golf ball wasn’t teetering. You’re tempted to say it was never going to fall. But part of her ball — 30 dimples something like that — was over the hole. She was by the rules owed the chance for some weird thing — a rogue wind — to materialize. She didn’t get that chance when one of her opponents picked up her ball.

The walking official Missy Jones an American made the call. And she got it right. The only question for her was this: is part of the ball hanging over the hole?

Yes part of the ball was hanging over the hole. She could see that with her naked eye in real time. The TV footage confirmed it.

Nelly Korda was doing yoga on the 13th green — the You Cannot be Serious pose — when her ball was picked up. That means her count-to-10 never even got started.

On such little things individual matches with a single point hanging in the balance can turn. And on any one point a whole match can turn too. Golf is a game played on a big field but it unfolds on a million little things.

For those who might need a catch-up: Saturday morning in alternate shot (foursomes) the Europeans on paper huge underdogs won three matches and tied the fourth. Your lunchtime score: Europe 3.5 U.S. 0.5. The American team of Nelly Korda and Jessica Korda lost 1 up to the European team of Mel Reid and Leona Maguire. First team to 14.5 wins the cup. Yes they’re playing for a cup. How cool is that?

On Saturday afternoon in a four-ball (better ball) session Pat Hurst the American captain decided to break up the Korda sisters. Jessica sat. Nelly played with Ally Ewing in the leadoff position. They played the formidable pairing of Nanna Koerstz-Madsen and Madeline Sagstrom. Through 12 holes the match was tied.

The walking official Missy Jones an American made the call. And she got it right.

The 13th hole at the host club (Inverness!) is a short par-5. Madsen made a birdie 4. Korda had about a 20-footer for an eagle 3. That is to win the hole. Her putt was a sweeping hooking downhiller on a gorgeous and tilting Donald Ross green. She read the speed and break beautifully. When the ball stopped it was sitting on the lip. Six seconds after it came to a stop Sagstrom picked it up.

The Americans won that hole to go 1 up in the match. The Korda-Ewing team held on to that 1-up lead through the 18th green. At that point The Americans no longer had a half point. They had 1.5. That’s better.

“You don’t want to win a hole like that” Korda told Golf Channel’s Kay Cockerill moments after the match was over. “It’s very unfortunate.”

Perfectly worded.

You might be asking:

*Couldn’t the Americans just say Oh we’ll let it slide just don’t do it again?

No the rules don’t allow that.

*Couldn’t the rules official just let it go? Because it wasn’t like it was teetering.

No. In golf as in life you’re responsible for what you know. And the rule doesn’t say anything about teetering. It says if any part of the ball is hanging over the hole.

*Isn’t the rule dumb?

No it’s sensible. You don’t want to not give the ball a chance to fall. But you don’t want to be out there all day either. Ten seconds is a good amount of time. Not too much. Not too little.

In the Saturday afternoon better-ball session the Americans won the first point and the second point. The Europeans won the third point.

In the day’s last group the European team of Georgia Hall and Leona Maguire had a 1 up lead over the American team of Yealimi Noh and Brittany Altomare as they came to 18. Marching up the fairway a rogue wind came up. You could see it even on TV.

You could see the wind in the trees in the American flag by the clubhouse in the flying sand of a bunker shot in Altomare’s flapping ponytail — and on the green where the striped flagstick was doing its own little dance. Rogue winds are a thing. Balls overhanging a cup do fall. The rules give you 10 seconds for a reason. You don’t need a stop watch. One Karsten Solheim two Karsten Solheim three Karsten Solheim all the way to 10 — that’ll do. If it’s your ball on the lip you beg for wind but you keep it to yourself.

The Europeans won 18 and ended the day leading 5.5. to 2.5.

MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers sign draft picks Mason McCormick Logan Lee to rookie contracts,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/sports/steelers-sign-draft-picks-mason-mccormick-logan-lee-to-rookie-contracts/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9iaWctc2hvZXMtdG8tZmlsbC1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stdGFsa3Mtd2VhcmluZy1kYXZpZC1kZWNhc3Ryb3Mtbm8tNjYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Big Shoes To Fill:' Mason McCormick Talks Wearing No. 66,"Though he’s been a Steeler for barely two weeks Mason McCormick knows the reputation that comes along with his new jersey number. Wearing No. 66 David DeCastro’s and Alan Faneca’s old numbers McCormick told reporters he’s fully aware of the legacy he’s replacing. At least in number.

“I have heard a little bit about it” he told reporters via Steelers.com when asked about his jersey digits. “I heard I got some big shoes to fill. And that’s super exciting.”

McCormick clearly isn’t backing away from the expectations. More similar to Troy Fautanu DeCastro was the team’s first-round pick in 2012 going lower in the draft than projections and the last West Coast college prospect the team had taken in the first round prior to Fautanu. After battling injury as a rookie DeCastro turned into one of the NFL’s best guards a six-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro before ankle problems shortened his career. Faneca came before both of them a first round pick and Hall of Famer even if his call to Canton took longer than it should’ve.

A punishing run blocker with tons of experience McCormick didn’t get his phone call until early on Day 3 the team’s fourth round pick. While McCormick will keep his goals high expectations out of the gate are lower than they were for DeCastro. Pittsburgh’s starting guards of James Daniels and Isaac Seumalo are set in stone entering the spring meaning McCormick is set to begin the year as a backup.

But o-line depth is valuable and can be quickly tested. Pittsburgh has been incredibly fortunate to avoid serious or multiple offensive line injuries the past two seasons but sheer law of averages suggests that luck will run out. That could push McCormick into a role sooner than expected.

“I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get on the field” he said. “I’ll play either guard spot center whatever it takes. I just want to help this organization in any way I can.”

That could include reps at center. McCormick noted he was the backup center in college and had South Dakota State’s starter gotten hurt he would’ve shifted over. Pittsburgh worked him out as such shortly before the draft and though Zach Frazier’s selection makes him a clear favorite to start the Steelers like to make their backups as versatile as possible. Friday McCormick played right guard and the Steelers will likely have him work at guard this spring before considering center come training camp.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9sb25kb24vc29tZWJvZHktd2lsbC1kaWUtaWYtZm9ybWVyLW1jY29ybWljay1zLWZhY3RvcnktaXNuLXQtdG9ybi1kb3duLW5laWdoYm91cnMtc2F5LTEuNzE5OTI4OdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS43MTk5Mjg5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Somebody will die' if former McCormick's factory isn't torn down neighbours say,"The owners of the former McCormick's candy factory on Dundas Street have been ordered by city bylaw officials to restore security fencing around the crumbling building but business owners near the property say much more needs to be done to deal with what they call a dangerous eyesore.

""The fence usually lasts 48 hours"" said Gord Inglis who operates Inglis Cycle located on McCormick Boulevard behind the property. ""It's very run down neglected not looked after and ignored and it's turned into a playground for children and an area where homeless people [go] in and out.""

A work order was posted on three parts of the fence surrounding some of the property stating that a property inspection done May 8 found contraventions of a city bylaw that requires owners to ensure that vacant buildings are secured against unauthorized entry and to protect the building from the risk of ""fire accident or other danger.""

When a CBC News reporter visited the site on Thursday there were at least eight places where the fence had been torn down partially or completely allowing anyone to walk onto the property.

Windows doors and duct openings were recently covered with plywood Inglis said but that's also usually torn down within days.

Two young teens had to be rescued from the roof of the building on Sunday night London Fire said. There was a fire in the building and the teens who were exploring inside made their way to the roof while they waited for help said Platoon Chief Kirk Loveland. An aerial ladder was used to communicate with the youth and tell them to stay put until firefighters came to the roof to escort them out of the building he said. The teens weren't hurt and were taken away by police.

A similar incident happened on Thursday afternoon. A teen was stuck in the building and police requested the aerial truck again so they could communicate with the young person and escort them out of the building.

Seeing young people in the building is a frequent occurrence Inglis said. ""I feel the city is playing with the devil. Every time an emergency service is called to the building it seems to be more severe. If you don't do something with this building somebody is going to get hurt.""

There are concerns over this former east London factory as redevelopment plans have stalled Duration 0:56 Once a bustling confectionary factory the former McCormick building is now an eyesore that is dangerous for people going in to strip out any metal that can be sold for cash and youth looking for an urban exploring thrill.

'We're picking up garbage everyday'

The recent rescue was just one of the latest incidents where emergency crews were called to the building said Lou Fatibene who owns neighbouring Dundas Automotive.

""I'm surprised nobody's been killed over there yet"" Fatibene said. ""We've had cars broken into the whole area has been vandalized. We're picking up garbage every day.""

Somebody's going to die"" he said. ""How much did it cost us taxpayers to have that aerial truck out there to save the kids?""

Tena Smith who works at Tim's Tires across the street from the old factory says young people are using it as an urban exploration site. Some throw bricks and other items from the roof damaging property and cars below.

""Every Monday when we come in after the weekend it's like the teenagers have had a heyday in there and they've knocked out more windows"" she said. ""We used to park our cars over there to make room for our customers but they throw stuff off the roof. A brick landed on my car and dented my roof so we don't park over there anymore.""

The fence that's supposed to keep people out of the crumbling factory is not very effective. (Kate Dubinski/CBC)

The owners of the property Sierra Construction based in Woodstock did not reply to emails and phone calls asking for comment. They have until May 12 to comply with the city's work order.

The company bought the property for $1. In 2021 McCormick Villages Inc. owned and run by Sierra Construction submitted a plan for a subdivision for the factory site comprising of five hectares. In October 2022 city council approved the development which included repurposing the former factory into a mixed-use mid-rise building as well as townhouses a long-term care facility and a seniors apartment building on the property.

But Sierra Construction wasn't happy with council's decision to limit the apartment building height to five-storeys and to make a multi-use path on the property publicly-accessible among other issues. The Ontario Land Tribunal will consider that appeal in June.

It's been frustrating watching the building and property fall further and further into disrepair said Ward 4 Coun. Susan Stevenson. ""It's becoming a huge safety concern and a lot of people are worried that there will be a tragedy there let alone the disturbance to the neighbourhood that's happening as well"" she said. ""The neighbours just want it taken down."""

His wife Paris Keena Scott said he died after suffering from a brief illness but did not elaborate on what the illness was.

In 1980 NBC television hired Scott for the Today Show to compete against ABC Television’s Good Morning America. Known more as a court jester for the morning news show than a meteorologist Scott would dress up in flashy outfits wish 100+ year olds happy birthdays and occasionally discuss the weather before tossing the broadcast to local affiliates for more weather information.









After earning a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and religion from American University Scott paired off with a classmate Ed Walker to host a comedic radio show known as the “Joy Boys” on WRC-AM from 1955 to 1972 and on WWDC-AM from 1972 to 1974.

In addition to his radio program Scott played the star of “Bozo the Clown” on WRC-TV from 1952 to 1962. That inspired McDonald’s to tap him to serve as a clown for their television advertising campaign. As a result of that Scott became the first Ronald McDonald character on TV.

Beyond playing a clown Willard Scott started to report the weather for WRC-TV in 1967. On WRC-TV he used different stunts and antics to get attention from his audience including dressing up as a groundhog for Ground Hog’s day. Scott had no background in science nor any interest in the science itself; in an interview he had said anyone can tell the weather if they “have the telephone number to the National Weather Service.”









To make way for Scott NBC fired meteorologist Rob Ryan. Ryan who had a bachelor’s degree in physics and a masters in atmospheric science was replaced by Scott to help boost ratings against Good Morning America. Joined with the team of John Palmer Bryant Gumbel and Jane Pauley the morning show catapulted to first place in the ratings for the time slot.

In 1996 Scott stepped into retirement and was replaced by weather person Al Roker. Scott would fill-in for Roker from time to time but officially retired from The Today Show and television in general in 2015 ending a 35-year career with the morning news and entertainment show.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGJpYmxlLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2NlbGVicml0eS13aWxsYXJkLXNjb3R0LXRoZS1vcmlnaW5hbC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtcm9uYWxkLW1jZG9uYWxkLWhhcy1kaWVkLTIwMjEwOTA10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Willard Scott The Original McDonald's Ronald McDonald Has Died,"In the 1960s Scott became the first ever Ronald McDonald – the smiling clown known as the mascot of the McDonald’s chain

As well as hosting children's TV shows and appearing on radio playing a range of characters including Bozo the Clown in the 1960s Scott became the first ever Ronald McDonald - the smiling clown known as the mascot of the McDonald's chain.

As Ronald he featured in commercials and in marketing imagery from the character's first appearance in 1963 into the early 1970s.

Many of the recipients are first-generation college students.

The Raymond H. Costa Family Scholarship Fund at the Community Foundation for Monterey County was established to provide scholarships to employees and their children of McDonald’s restaurants in the Salinas Valley and Monterey area.

This year 20 students were offered between $1000 and $3000 in scholarship money. Recipients can use their award for tuition or cost of attendance.

The scholarship strives to promote learning and enhance the quality of life for McDonald’s crew members and their families. The award provides funding to assist eligible students who wish to pursue an undergraduate/post-graduate college education attend a certificate course or seek trade skill development.

“Many of these students are first in their families to attend college and have overcome many obstacles” Costa said in a press release. “These scholarships are available to give every type of student the opportunity to pursue higher education to better themselves and their families. It is an honor to give back to our hardworking employees.”

Costa has been a McDonald’s owner/operator for 26 years and owns eight restaurants throughout Salinas and Salinas Valley. Costa was inspired to give back from his own personal experience when he and his family were given Christmas gifts collected from a toy drive after his father had passed away.

They started serving their delicious grilled burgers and fries in the city of Homewood Alabama a suburb of Birmingham. That location is still operating as their flagship Jack's Family Restaurant. The first location was a walk-up hamburger and hot dog stand that served 10 cent sodas 15 cent french fries 20 cent milk shakes and a 20 cent ""fish on a bun"" sandwich. It was an instant hit because of quick service friendly workers and great food at great pricing.

Their motto of ""Smiling Faces Friendly Service"" hasn't changed since those days. They serve quality food with a smile. Like their jingle says ""It keeps you coming back back back to Jack's Jack's Jack's.""

By the mid 1960s there were more than a half dozen locations in the metropolitan Birmingham area. There was the original Homewood location Roebuck 3rd Avenue West Bessemer Five Points West Vestavia Eastwood Mall Alabaster and Center Point. Jack's was already expanding into Mississippi and South Carolina.

With almost 200 locations now in Alabama Tennessee Georgia and Mississippi there's good food everywhere you turn at Jack's Family Restaurant. Now known just as Jack's it's safe to say Jack's truly is ""All About the South.""

After the rapid expansion of the 1970s and the 1980s many of these locations started to close but one successful franchisee was still going strong. Benny LaRussa had bought a single Jack's Hamburger franchise in the 1960s while still working in his grocery business. By 1979 LaRussa said goodbye to groceries and went all-in buying a franchise territory of 13 Jack's stores. In 1988 he expanded his territory to 33 stores. A short while later Benny LaRussa bought the entire franchise plus the rights to the Jack's concept.

In 2015 Jack's was acquired by a fund managed by Onex Corporation a private equity company based in Toronto Canada. Four years later Onex sold Jack's Family Restaurants to a private equity firm based in New York. Not much else is known about this deal involving one of the one South's favorite fast food restaurants. The current CEO is Todd Bartmess.

Jack's restaurants have changed from the original walk-up stand design with a welcoming slanted roof and orange and yellow stripes. In the late 1960s Jack's morphed into full dine-in restaurants. Soon the drive-thru locations of Jack's were hopping rivaling even McDonald's.

Jack's Family Restaurant even has a crispy chicken sandwich too. Alabama white sauce makes this one unique. Jack's says you can't get more Alabama than that. That white sauce also makes their cheeseburger deliciously Southern. Their cool coleslaw is second to none and I know coleslaw intimately. Order a fried chicken combo dinner to feed the family or just yourself.

Three large US drug distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson will proceed with a proposed $26bn settlement resolving claims that they fuelled the opioid epidemic after “enough” states joined in the companies said.

The companies had until Saturday to decide whether enough states back the $21bn proposed settlement with McKesson Corp AmerisourceBergen Corp and Cardinal Health Inc and a $5bn agreement with J&J.

The distributors said on Saturday 42 states five territories and Washington DC signed on to their agreement. The exact tally for J&J’s related deal was not immediately clear.

The companies will make their first annual settlement payment into escrow on or before September 30 the distributors said. The final amount will depend on several factors including the final participation rate of states and political subdivisions they added.

North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein a lead settlement negotiator called the support level a “remarkable showing of unity and commitment across the country to address this problem”.

The settlement’s complex formula envisioned at least 44 states participating but ultimately the companies got to decide whether a “critical mass” had joined and whether to finalise the deal.

A number of states had previously said they had not fully signed on by an August 21 deadline: Alabama Georgia Nevada New Mexico Oklahoma Washington and West Virginia.

Cities and counties within participating states have through January 2 to join as well. Ultimately $10.7bn is tied to the extent localities participate.

The deal unveiled by 14 state attorneys general on July 21 is designed to resolve more than 3000 lawsuits accusing the distributors of ignoring red flags that pain pills were being diverted into communities for illicit uses and that J&J played down the risks of opioid addiction.

The money would fund treatment and other services.

The companies deny wrongdoing saying the drugs were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and that responsibility for ballooning painkiller sales lies with doctors regulators and others.

The deal is separate from a settlement resolving similar claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its wealthy Sackler family owners. A bankruptcy judge on Wednesday approved that deal which Purdue values at more than $10bn.",,,,,,

Inc. (MRK): Here is What You Need to Know,"Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +2.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry to which Merck belongs has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Merck is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter representing a year-over-year change of +202.9%. Over the last 30 days the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.3%.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $8.66 points to a change of +473.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.3%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.7%.

With an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Merck the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.8%. For the current and next fiscal years $64.28 billion and $68.81 billion estimates indicate +6.9% and +7.1% changes respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Merck reported revenues of $15.78 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +8.9%. EPS of $2.07 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.32 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.95%. The EPS surprise was +6.7%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples such as price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on) is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

Merck is graded C on this front indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBoYXJtYWxldHRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zZXRiYWNrLWZvci1tZXJjay1pbi1iYXR0bGUtdG8tdHJlYXQtZW5kb21ldHJpYWwtY2FuY2Vy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Setback for Merck & Co in battle to treat endometrial cancer,"Merck & Co (NYSE: MRK) has announced that the Phase III KEYNOTE-B21 trial of its leading checkpoint blocker Keytruda (pembrolizumab) has failed.

Platforms such as Fortnite are already causing a great deal of buzz on digital avatar events especially in concerts by well-known artists. Epic recently featured US music star Ariana Grande on the digital Fortnite stage for a spectacularly staged concert with millions of viewers most of them very young people.

HTC Relying on Volumetric Recordings

Although appearances such as those of Ariana Grande at Fortnite are specially rendered in computer graphics for the Fortnite World HTC is planning on introducing more realism to the new music platform Beatday where appearances by artists and bands will be filmed volumetrically in studios in Japan Taiwan and France before one suitably created digital stage can be played.

The mix of volumetric recordings with digital assets has the advantage that the production effort stays manageable as only musicians have to be recorded not the whole surroundings.

However viewers will still have the feeling of ‘being there’ at a digital concert instead of just watching a video of it thanks to the volumetric or spatial recording technology. Concert-goers will be moving inside the immersive concert as avatars and will have the feel of a real stage in different directions instead of just a 2D view of the stage. The volumetric recording increases the degree of realism as well as the feeling of presence compared to what you would get with conventional 3D videos with a depth effect. With volumetric recording even a virtual walk directly onto the concert stage is conceivable. The video below illustrates its principle of production: –

﻿

Behind the volumetric production in the video includes a Canon camera. Canon has recently formed an initiative for volumetric videos in collaboration with other well-known tech companies. However HTC is not a part of the Volumetric Format Association.

Beatday is HTC’s “Metaverse for Music”

HTC has pitched Beatday as a “metaverse for music”. A beta version of Beatday for desktop PC and smartphones will happen soon. Beatday for virtual reality and augmented reality is set to follow later. HTC Vice President Liu Szu-ming told Variety that the company will initially bring Beatday onto the market on PCs and smartphones so as to reach the general public as well as younger users. Once the company has reached a certain market threshold it will release a VR version so as to provide its audiences with a “real high-end experience.”

HTC will initially collaborate with the Taiwanese indie brand “Amazing Show” for six concerts each of which will last half an hour. The ticket prices for the concerts are yet to be determined but it is expected that they will be around $10 to $12 for entry and a permanent NFT avatar. HTC also wants to generate revenues with digital accessories as well as clothing for the avatars.

According to Liu following the cancellation of physical concerts during the pandemic ‘holo concerts’ have emerged as a new form of online events and they are becoming popular.

The Vive boss believes Beatday can bring about “great change” in the music industry. This makes it an attractive proposition for artists. Liu says Beatday integrates music licenses record labels as well as artist management agencies to create new business opportunities as well as an innovative model for dividing income.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMTA5LzEyMzMzNTQuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chinese tech giants aim high in creating a version of 'metaverse',"A man using virtual reality equipment Photo: VCG

Chinese vanguard

The word ""metaverse"" may still a new concept for the general public but it's already a project high on agenda of many big tech firms around the world ranging from US' Facebook Microsoft to China's ByteDance and Tencent.Tech firms are in the early stages of a global arms race to create a virtual reality universe placing big bets that this technology could define the future of the internet.The so-called metaverse is widely understood as an alternate digital reality where people work play and socialize. According to the definition published on Wikipedia the metaverse is a collective virtual shared space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space including the sum of all virtual worlds augmented reality and the internet.The word ""metaverse"" is made up of the prefix ""meta"" (meaning beyond) and the stem ""verse"" (a back-formation from ""universe""); the term is typically used to describe the future iteration of the internet made up of permanent shared 3D virtual spaces linked into a perceived virtual universe.Industry players told the Global Times that the global increase in attention on the metaverse is in part based on people's demand for entertainment experience and improvement in life efficiency and on the other hand the rapid development of 5G AI blockchain technology and VR/AR display technology is also helping populating the concept.Moreover the 2020 epidemic is undoubtedly an accelerator. People's life scenes are shifting more from offline to online. This ""forced"" transformation has instead made everyone think discuss and pay more attention to the embryonic form of the future meta-universe.On a Facebook earnings call in July CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned metaverse 16 times according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. He said Facebook should be known as a ""metaverse company.""Intel Unity Software Microsoft and Nvidia also frequently referred to the so-called metaverse throughout 2020.Recent developments show that this new wave of technology is coming much faster-than-expected speed.Nvidia on August 10 has announced a major expansion of NVIDIA Omniverse - the world's first simulation and collaboration platform that is delivering the foundation of the metaverse - through new integrations with Blender and Adobe that will be open to millions of users.""Nvidia Omniverse connects worlds by enabling the vision of the metaverse to become a reality"" said Richard Kerris vice president of the Omniverse development platform at Nvidia. ""With input from developers partners and customers we're advancing this revolutionary platform so that everyone from individuals to large enterprises can work with others to build amazing virtual worlds that look feel and behave just as the physical world does.""Chinese forces meanwhile are rushing into the metaverse space.Gaming unicorn Roblox known a leader in the metaverse and Tencent has announced earlier in 2019 a strategic partnership to help fuel the next generation of Chinese creators. Roblox and Tencent have secured a license to launch the Roblox gaming platform in China.""Roblox's vision for the metaverse is to create a platform for immersive co-experiences where people can come together within millions of 3D experiences to learn work play create and socialize. Fostering a rich community built on shared experiences is central to this vision and a driving force for Roblox's path forward"" Roblox said in a blog article it posted on Thursday.ByteDance owner of the short-video app TikTok has increased its investment in Roblox competitor Reworld by nearly 100 million yuan ($15.3 million) according to a report from the South China Morning Post in April citing people familiar with the matter as the company seeks its own so-called metaverse platform in its escalating rivalry with video game giant Tencent.""Apart from leading players there are already start-ups engaging in the field in China"" Zhao Dan a close follower of the XR industry told the Global Times on Sunday.Zhao said Chinese firms have strong software development capabilities and the hardware gap is not big compared with their foreign counterparts so this time Chinese team could have a possibility of leaping ahead in creating a metaverse rather than being only a follower in PC and mobile internet era.Zhao predicted that unlike Facebook which may look at global market from the beginning Chinese leading players like ByteDance and Tencent may likely to create their own platforms starting from the domestic market then aiming for the overseas.Nevertheless at this stage the metaverse is at its infancy and may not as immersive as described above but a little prototype has made people feel that the future is promising and boundless an industry insider surnamed Zheng told the Global Times.Zheng said so far some initial metaverse products produced by Roblox and Decentraland have some basic experience and years of technical development needed before the vision in the 2018 sci-fi film Ready Player One would become a reality.The infrastructure of metaverse includes a large varieties from 5G communication network VR AR WIFI6 wearable devices blockchain cloud computing edge computing and AI+GPU analysts said noting that blockchain VR and brain-computer technology that are necessary in the metaverse are still being built and cannot support the ideal metaverse ecology.Moreover the metaverse is not just a game and it's a set of application scenarios not just focused on entertainment but also for socializing studying working shopping watching dramas exhibitions sports and even investment and financial management on the platform a parallel digital world Zheng said.""Thus no giant or individual can build such a meta-universe on its own only through cooperation can the vision be achieved"" Zheng said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA5LzA0L3doeS1udmlkaWEtc3RvY2stanVtcGVkLTE1LWluLWF1Z3VzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Nvidia Stock Jumped 15% in August,"In 2021 shares of the gaming and tech giant have returned 75%.

What happened

Nvidia (NVDA 1.27%) stock popped 14.8% in August significantly outpacing the S&P 500's 3% return according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

This robust performance can be attributed to the graphics chip specialist's release of strong second-quarter results and continued investor enthusiasm about its long-term growth potential.

Nvidia stock is having a great year. In 2021 to date (Sept. 3) the tech stock has returned 75.1% compared to the broader market's 22% return.

So what

On Aug. 18 Nvidia released fiscal second-quarter results that beat Wall Street's consensus estimates for revenue and earnings and issued fiscal third-quarter guidance for the top and bottom lines that also came in higher than analysts had been expecting.

Shares popped 15.3% in the three days following the release while the broader market was up 1.8% during this period. Shares continued to move upward throughout the rest of the month.

In its fiscal second quarter Nvidia's revenue surged 68% year over year to $6.51 billion topping its guidance of $6.30 billion and the analyst consensus estimate of $6.33 billion. All four platforms posted at least double-digit year-over-year growth with the two largest platforms gaming and data center growing revenue by 85% and 35% respectively.

Nvidia's results also got a boost from sales of its cryptocurrency mining processor launched earlier this year. CMP sales were $266 million or about 4.1% of the company's total quarterly revenue.

Adjusted for one-time items earnings per share (EPS) soared 89% to $1.04 surpassing the $1.02 the Street had been expecting.

Now what

For fiscal Q3 management projects revenue of $6.80 billion representing growth of 44% year over year. It also guided (albeit indirectly by providing a bunch of inputs) for adjusted EPS of $1.10 or growth of 51%.

I'll reiterate what I said in my earnings article: Nvidia stock is one of the best growth stocks in the market today in my view."

SHO immediately put on the shirt and the four men posed together before heading backstage.

The new t-shirt wasn't a simple Bullet Club shirt though and all of them read 'House Of Torture' with a BC logo on the sleeve confirming the formation of a new subgroup within the faction.

Subgroups have been common in Bullet Club over the years most famously The Elite when the stable was under Kenny Omega's leadership.

Ahead of the match Ibushi told njpw1972 that he is ready to put both Tanahashi and Jay White's historic achievement of becoming Grand Slam Champions to dust by capturing the IWGP US Title.

Much like White and Tanahashi Kota Ibushi has also won every single top championship in New Japan Pro Wrestling except the IWGP US Heavyweight Championship.

However the one advantage that Ibushi has over White and Tanahashi is that he has previously won the IWGP Jr. Heavyweight Title. A title that is missing from both White and Tanahashi's list of achievements.

With a victory at the MetLife Dome Kota Ibushi has the chance to pretty much surpass both The Ace and Switchblade in one go.

Interviewer: To talk about the US belt itself recently Jay White won the NEVER Openweight Championship to complete what he called a ‘grand slam’. Tanahashi then matches that task or beat it if you count his tag title victories. Here you have a chance to leave both in the dust.

Ibushi: Definitely if you count my junior heavyweight title wins.

Kota Ibushi will be hoping to win the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship for the first time

At Wrestle Grand Slam in MetLife Dome Kota Ibushi will be hoping to capture the IWGP US Heavyweight Championship by beating Hiroshi Tanahashi. The match will be The Golden Star's first big match in months as he was suffering from aspiration pneumonia.

Due to his illness Kota Ibushi was forced to withdraw from his IWGP World Heavyweight Championship match against Shingo Takagi. But Ibushi will hope to get gold around his waist once again by taking out his former tag team partner in what promises to be another historic event for NJPW.

Meanwhile Tanahashi is headed into Wrestle Grand Slam in MetLife Dome on the back of a big win at NJPW Resurgence. At the Resurgence show The Ace defeated Lance Archer in the main event to win the IWGP US Heavyweight Title for the first time.

In fact by many estimates Edge is not for most people representing just 3.5 percent of the market compared to 64.9 percent for Chrome.

The majority of users who reject Edge are content to simply install Chrome Firefox or Opera and change the default browser in Windows 11 or 10. But for some folks it's not enough to avoid using Microsoft's browser and leave it as a vestigial organ on the body of their Start menus; they want to remove Edge altogether.

Normally if you want to uninstall an application in Windows 11 or 10 you just navigate to Settings->Apps->Apps & features locate the name of your app select uninstall and (Microsoft) Bob's your uncle. But with Edge the uninstall option is grayed out and you need to use some command-line magic to get the job done.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Note that uninstalling Microsoft Edge does not prevent it from being listed as your default browser (you have to change that separately) nor does it stop the Windows 11 widget and Windows search's web results from attempting (and failing) to launch themselves in Edge. There are workarounds however which we cover below.

How to Uninstall Microsoft Edge in Windows 11 or 10

1. Navigate to the Edge About page by going to the browser's settings menu and then Help & feedback->About Microsoft Edge.

The edge About page will appear.

2. Copy the version number into your clipboard by highlighting it (just the number) and hitting CTRL + C. You may want to paste it into a notepad document for safe keeping.

3. Launch the command prompt in admin mode. The easiest way is by searching for ""cmd"" right clicking the top result and selecting ""Run as administrator.""

4. Enter the following command where [VERSION] is replaced with the actual Edge version number (in my case it was 93.0.961.38).

cd %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Microsoft\Edge\Application\[VERSION]\Installer

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

5. Enter the following uninstall command.

setup --uninstall --force-uninstall --system-level

6. Change your default browser if you haven't done so already. If Edge was your default before you uninstalled it Windows 11 will still list it as the default (though with a blue box as an icon) which could cause problems when you try to click a link in another app.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

See our tutorial on how to change your default browser in Windows 11 for details on how to make the change. If you want to continue to click links in the Widgets box or those that appear in Windows search you'll need to use EdgeDeflector.

If you want to reinstall Microsoft Edge you can search for and download it directly from the Microsoft Store.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Microsoft Edge will then download itself and install like any other app.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy81LXRoaW5ncy1pLXdhbnQtZnJvbS10aGUtbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN1cmZhY2UtcHJvLTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Surface Pro 8 — here are 5 upgrades it needs to have,"Microsoft has announced that it will hold a Surface-related event on September 22 where we're expecting to see the reveal of the rumored Surface Pro 8 and the Surface Duo 2 .

Given last year we only got a minor refresh to the Surface Pro with the Surface Pro 7 Plus  I'm hoping that Microsoft will push things further with what we’re expecting will be called the Surface Pro 8. While the hybrid laptop-come-tablet is a very good device its design is perhaps getting a little long in the tooth. So I'm hoping for more than a refresh as well as some new specs and features.

With that in mind I’ve come up with five things I’d like to see from the Microsoft Surface Pro 8. Let me know if you agree or what you’d like to see from the next Microsoft tablet.

Surface Pro 8 needs a new design

(Image credit: Future)

The most obvious change I want for the Surface Pro 8 is a redesign. While the design has been refined since the first Surface Pro in 2013 it’s remained largely the same.

While there’s only so much you can do with a tablet’s look I’d like to see Microsoft work to trim down the bezels of the Surface Pro’s display. Yes I know you need somewhere to rest your fingers when holding a Surface Pro as a tablet. But I feel a combination of slimmer bezels and smart touch detection would remove the need for a chunky screen surround that looks rather dated.

And while the flat edges of the Surface Pro make for an attractive device they aren't always the nicest to hold. So a more rounded design as seen with the Surface Pro X  would be appreciated; as would some form of built-in storage compartment for the Surface Pen.

A few more ports wouldn't go amiss say an extra USB-C port or a full-size SD card reader hidden behind the kickstand. Speaking of which the kickstand is very good so that’s the one thing I hope Microsoft doesn't mess with.

Upgraded display for Surface Pro 8

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

While I’d like to see the Surface Pro 8 sport slimmer screen bezels and thus a larger display say 13 inches I’d also like to see some tweaks to the panel it'll use. The current Surface Pro's PixelSense touchscreen display is great full of color and contrast but it can overdo things a bit. And more brightness would be good too.

So I’d like to see a refreshed PixelSense display with a more color-accurate panel and boosted brightness ideally 500 nits of brightness or above. And a faster refresh rate wouldn't go amiss as well as a higher touch-sampling rate to make the screen feel more responsive when used as a tablet.

Surface Pro 8: AMD chips and no more 4GB of RAM

Intel Tiger Lake chips offer pretty solid laptop-grade processor power but some of AMD’s mobile Ryzen CPUs are really impressive. So I’d like to see them put to use in the Surface Pro 8. After all Microsoft has worked with AMD before to bring custom Ryzen chips to the Surface Laptop so there's no reason Team Red shouldn't get a look in for the Surface Pros.

I’d also like to see an integrated RDNA 2 GPU thrown into the mix given the Valve Steam Deck uses one which would give the Surface Pro 8 some gaming grunt. I like to run some older and casual games on my Surface Pro 5 but I'd love to see future Surface Pros handle more demanding titles.

One thing I’d like to see Microsoft kill off for good is a 4GB option for the Surface Pro 8. In the Surface Pro 7 or older models I find that amount of RAM simply doesn't seem to be enough especially when you’ve got a lot of Chrome tabs open. It would also be good if that RAM was upgradable following in the footsteps of the upgradable storage the Surface Pro 7 Plus has.

Surface Pro 8: It's time for a new Type Cover

(Image credit: Future)

There’s a lot to like about the Surface Pro’s Type Cover. Despite its small stature it offers a surprisingly tactile typing experience. But I’d like to see Microsoft make a few tweaks.

Ideally a little more key travel say 1.5mm would be ideal. But more importantly I’d like to see a larger trackpad as the current one can feel rather cramped. More vertical and horizontal space would be lovely.

A brighter backlight for the keys would also be appreciated. And while I doubt it would be to everyone's taste the option of a metal Type cover would be good to inject a bit of rigidity into it for people who really like to pound away at the keys. It could be made out of the same magnesium alloy as the Surface Pro tablet and topped with a fabric layer to protect the display and make for a more comfortable keyboard deck.

An audio boost for Surface Pro 8

(Image credit: Future)

Finally I'd really like the Surface Pro 8 to come with stronger speakers. The recent Surface Pros don’t sound bad at all but compared to the likes of the iPad Pro 2021 they don’t cut the mustard.

Laptop speakers are never going to wow but they have been getting better and better with the likes of the MacBook Pro leading the pack. So we’d like to see Microsoft find a way to get more sound out of the next Surface Pro. The company found a way to put a speaker system under the keyboard of the Surface Laptop 4  so there’s no reason the engineers at Redmond couldn’t come up with some clever speaker system for the Surface Pro. A boost in audio would make watching movies on what we hope will be an even better display that much more pleasurable.

And those are five of the upgrades I’d like to see the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 sport. I feel they're pretty realistic asks.

""Windows 10 sounds were sharp literally created with sharp wave lengths. In Windows 11 we have focused on making the technology calm. In order to do this we needed to reevaluate our sound scape to also be calm"" Microsoft told BleepingComputer in a statement.

""The new sounds have a much rounder wavelength making them softer so that they can still alert/notify you but without being overwhelming.""

""Just like we rounded UI visually we rounded our sound scape as well to soften the overall feel of the experience.""

Unlike all previous versions of Windows Microsoft also created different versions of the system sounds for Windows 11 depending on whether you are in Light Mode or Dark Mode.

For Light Mode users the sounds are meant to be brighter and louder while in Dark Mode the sounds will be quieter and more subdued with a slight echo.

""We introduced light and dark sound options so that people who may have low visibility or no vision can still experience light and dark themes audibly. Themed sounds improve productivity by matching your working style through your theme. Dark Sounds help you stay in focus while Light Sounds ensure you’re always engaged"" - Microsoft spokesperson.

The Light Mode sounds are still stored under the C:\Windows\Media folder with the new Dark Mode sounds stored under C:\Windows\Media\dm.

Compare the Windows 11 Light and Dark mode sounds

With Windows 11 Microsoft created ten new system sounds that will be played while in Dark Mode. These ten sounds and their Light Mode counterparts are displayed below to compare their differences easily.

The Light Mode sound will be in audio control with a white background while the Dark Mode sound will be the dark background.

We have also labeled each sound based on default assignment under the 'Program Events' section in the Windows 11 Sound properties screen.

Asterisk Default Beep Exclamation Low Battery Alarm System Notification: This system sound is played when an alert is displayed such as a warning message.

Critical Battery Alarm and Critical Stop: This sound is played when an error occurs.

Device failed to connect: This sound will play when an inserted device could not be correctly set up by Windows 11.

Device Disconnect: This sound will play when you disconnect a device such as a USB key from your computer.

Calendar Reminder: This sound will be played when a Calendar event occurs.

New Email Notification and New Fax Notification: When a new email or fax is received this sound will play.

New Text Message Notification: This sound will play when you receive a new text message.

Notification: This sound will play when a program wants to issue a notification.

Windows User Account Control: This system sound will play when a User Account Control prompt is displayed in Windows 11.

There are still quite a few system sounds that do not have new Dark Mode versions. So we will have to wait and see if Microsoft adds other sounds in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9ob3ctZ2V0LW92ZXJsYXktc2Nyb2xsYmFyLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1lZGdlL9IBQGh0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9ob3ctZ2V0LW92ZXJsYXktc2Nyb2xsYmFyLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1lZGdlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Get Overlay Scrollbar in Microsoft Edge,"Microsoft is preparing to replace the traditional scrollbar in its Edge browser with an overlay scrollbar. The latter looks more modern and doesn’t interrupt your view when you are browsing websites to kill time. If you are a Microsoft Edge user here’s how you can get the overlay scrollbar ahead of the general rollout.

Get Overlay Scrollbar in Microsoft Edge (2021)

Notably you can get an overlay scrollbar even in the stable channel as long as you use Edge 93 or newer versions. The workaround was first pointed out on Reddit by tipster u/Leopeva64-2. We have tested it below on Edge stable version 93.0.961.38. We have also detailed an alternate way to enable the overlay scrollbar through an Edge flag if you are on Insider channel builds. With that out of the way let’s get started!

Get Overlay Scrollbar in Microsoft Edge Stable Version

If you are on Edge 93 or newer versions in the stable channel you can get the feature by adding a parameter in Edge’s shortcut. Here’s how to do it:

1. Right-click on Edge’s shortcut and choose ‘Properties’. You can also use the Windows 11 keyboard shortcut ‘Alt+Enter’ after selecting the shortcut to open Properties.

2. From the ‘Shortcut’ tab of Edge Properties click on the ‘Target’ field and paste the following text at the end of the path:

--enable-features=OverlayScrollbarOverlayScrollbarWinStyleOverlayScrollbarWinStyleAnimation

3. Click on ‘Apply’ and close the dialog box. You will see the overlay scrollbar the next time you open the browser using this shortcut. To know how the overlay scrollbar differs from the old chunky scrollbar check out the image gallery below:

Old scrollbar in Edge

New overlay scrollbar in Edge

4. And if you would like to see the overlay scrollbar in action check it out in the GIF below. As you can see the scrollbar doesn’t interrupt your browsing experience until you hover over it unlike the old persistent scrollbar.

Get Overlay Scrollbar Using Feature Flag in Microsoft Edge

If you are using Microsoft Edge Beta Dev or Canary builds from the Insider channel you can enable overlay scrollbar using a feature flag. Here’s how:

1. Open the Edge browser on your PC navigate to edge://flags and search for ‘Windows style overlay scrollbars’. As always you can paste the following direct link of the flag in Edge’s address bar to access it quickly.

edge://flags/#edge-overlay-scrollbars-win-style

2. Set the flag as ‘Enabled’ from the drop-down menu next to it and restart the browser.

3. You will start seeing an overlay scrollbar in Microsoft Edge after restarting the browser.

Experience a Modern Scrollbar in Microsoft Edge

So that brings us to the end of our quick guide on how to enable overlay scrollbar on Edge. The steps to get started are straightforward and you no longer have to tolerate the default chunky white scrollbar in Edge. If you found this helpful do not forget to check our articles on the best Edge flags and best Edge tips and tricks to use Windows 11‘s native browser like a pro."

""We were hoping that we would get both the candidates both products Moderna and Pfizer rolled out by the week of the 20th. It is conceivable that we will only have one of them out but the other will likely follow soon thereafter"" Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told ""Face the Nation.""

Fauci and top federal health officials announced in August that vaccinated Americans will need to get booster shots eight months after receiving their second vaccine dose subject to approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The administration said it is prepared to begin offering the boosters the week of September 20 with those who were the earliest to get vaccinated — health care workers nursing home residents and the elderly — first to get the shots.

While Pfizer has submitted data to federal officials there is insufficient data from Moderna on safety and efficacy Fauci said. Still he said the drug maker is collecting its data to give to the FDA which will then make a determination on whether to green-light the third doses of its vaccine.

""We hope that Moderna would also be able to do it so we could do it simultaneously but if not we'll do it sequentially"" Fauci said. ""So the bottom line is very likely at least part of the plan will be implemented but ultimately the entire plan will be.""

Fauci said any delay in offering Moderna's booster after the September 20 roll-out date would amount to ""at the most a couple of weeks"" if there is one.

He also said studies are underway about whether Americans could mix the vaccines — getting two doses of Pfizer and one of Moderna or vice versa — and hopes data will be available ""within a reasonable period of time measured in a couple of weeks.""

""But right now we are suggesting and hopefully it will work out that way that if you got Pfizer you will then boost with Pfizer. If you get Moderna you'll be boosting with Moderna"" Fauci said. ""But we are doing the studies to determine if we can do just that: Switch one with the other.""

In announcing the recommendation for boosters top federal health officials said the additional doses would be needed to maximize the vaccine's protection against COVID-19 and extend its durability especially given the dominance of the highly contagious Delta variant.

The strain has driven a rise in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations particularly among those who have not received their vaccines. The CDC also reported a spike in hospitalizations for teenagers and children. Pfizer's COVID-19 shot is available for people over the age of 12.

Fauci said the surge in infections among younger Americans can be attributed to the transmissibility of the Delta variant though the data being collected by federal health agencies does not give definitive information that the variant is more severe in children.

""We know certainly more children are getting infected and therefore more are getting hospitalized"" he said. ""But we don't have definitive enough data to say that is fact on a child by child basis that it's any more severe.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZ2gudXNlbWJhc3N5Lmdvdi91LXMtZG9uYXRlcy0xMjI5NjIwLW1vZGVybmEtY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZXMtdG8tZ2hhbmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Donates 1229620 Moderna COVID-19 Vaccines to Ghana,"We’re sorry this site is currently experiencing technical difficulties.

Arguably the one company most associated with messenger RNA (mRNA) is Moderna (MRNA -4.38%). The biotech even has MRNA as its stock ticker. But it's not the only vaccine maker focused on mRNA technology. In this Motley Fool Live video recorded on Aug. 25 2021 Motley Fool contributors Keith Speights and Brian Orelli talk about three mRNA stocks not named Moderna that investors might want to check out.

10 stocks we like better than Moderna Inc.

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Moderna Inc. wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of August 9 2021

Keith Speights: Brian is there a smaller biotech or two that is also focusing on mRNA that you think investors might at least want to check out?

Brian Orelli: Yeah. But I haven't really done maybe a good enough deep dive to pull them out of my head. There are some that are certainly earlier stage that are going to be riskier but definitely do you have one that you had in mind?

Speights: There's one that I'm starting to do some research on. I've written about it a couple of times in the past or a few times in the past. Arcturus Therapeutics (ARCT 1.75%) ARCT is the ticker there has mRNA vaccines in development not just for COVID-19.

I'm not recommending their stock at this point but it's just one you might want to check out. It is a much smaller market cap than Moderna. I think Arcturus is right at I'm going to pull up really quickly... it's $1.4 billion market cap right now.

There are other companies that are focusing on mRNA that you might want to check out. BioNTech (BNTX -0.42%) it's not nearly as big as Moderna and they have a pretty strong mRNA pipeline.

Of course if you want to be more risk averse check out Pfizer (PFE -0.60%). Pfizer of course is already partnered with BioNTech but Pfizer is moving into its own development of mRNA vaccines and therapies. So if you're risk averse Pfizer might be a company to look into if you're interested in mRNA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5LzA1L3dvcmxkL3NjaWVuY2UtaGVhbHRoLXdvcmxkL2NvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmVzLWFudGlib2RpZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Moderna vaccine makes more antibodies than Pfizer's. Does it matter?,"Ten months ago the results of large clinical trials appeared almost too good to be true: Two messenger RNA vaccines reduced symptomatic COVID-19 cases by more than 90% in almost every group that got them.

Now subtle differences between the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. vaccines are emerging across patient groups over time. One small U.S. study found waning levels of antibodies with Pfizer’s vaccine particularly in an older group of people. And a larger study from Belgium found that Moderna’s shot may generate more antibodies than Pfizer’s.

But what this all means in the real world is still unclear. While hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines have been administered around the world researchers are still working to understand the nuances of how long their protection lasts and how it differs from one person to another.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvbC5jb20vZmF1Y2ktcGZpemVyLTNyZC1kb3Nlcy1saWtlbHktMjIzODA5MDYxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fauci: Pfizer 3rd doses will likely start Sept. 20 but not Moderna boosters,Fauci: Pfizer 3rd doses will likely start Sept. 20 but not Moderna boosters

Punters were faced with over an hour's wait for drinks at popular Plymouth Wetherspoon pub Union Rooms on Friday night.

Revellers enjoying a few drinks at the Union Rooms in Plymouth on Friday were baffled as staff informed them that there was an hour's wait on drink orders whether it was ordering through the app or at the bar.

According to one Wetherspoon customer some people were even leaving the pub when finding out how long the wait would be and there was also 'a number of items' unavailable on the menu.

The punter who was at the popular pub on Union Street on Friday night said they waited an hour and a half for their drink to arrive - however they pointed out that staff seemed to be rushed off their feet and were extremely apologetic.

They said: ""When I got to the door of the Union Rooms the doormen told me there would be an hour wait for drinks.

""At first I thought I misheard them so I asked if that was for food or for drinks and they said it was for drinks. I then walked past the bar and heard people talking about the wait and saying they'd rather leave.

""I ordered via the app and it did take just over an hour to get my drink but the staff were doing their best and were really apologetic.

""There were also a number of items unavailable from the menu. Towards the end of the night drinks were arriving faster but it was still between 30 and 45 minutes.""

Another conveyed a similar message: ""We didn't ever really know the reason but it got better as the night progressed for sure. It was an hour wait on drinks when we first arrived around 7.30 then it sort of got progressively better as the night went on.

""It didn't seem to make much of a difference if you ordered via the app or at the bar. Staff were clearly working their socks off and it was quite busy in there in fairness.""

Another vented: ""I was so excited to see my friends there were lots of tables free when I arrived just after 7pm I thought I’d order a drink while waiting for my friends to arrive… wasn’t expecting to wait an hour and a quarter for my drink!

""I later ordered a meal which took more than an hour too. It was chaos.""

Wetherspoon has been approached for comment on this matter.

It comes as Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin has recently played down the role of Brexit-related driver shortages after the pub chain was hit by beer supply issues.

The group apologised to customers on Wednesday after it said supplies of Heineken Carling and Coors beers ran dry in some pubs.

Mr Martin an ardent supporter of Brexit said the shortages were mainly driven by industrial action in recent weeks by drivers and warehouse staff acting on behalf of Heineken.

A spokesman for Wetherspoons also said that stocks of Carling and Coors had been depleted when customers bought more after industrial action impacted deliveries from Heineken the pub group’s biggest supplier.

It said that Heineken supplies six of the group’s 23 draught lines it usually offers.

A spokesman for Molson Coors Beverage Company which produces Carling and Coors said on Wednesday that it has been impacted by the HGV driver shortage which industry bosses have partially linked to the recent departure of EU drivers.

“Like many in our great British brewing and pub sector we have been hit by the HGV driver shortage” a spokesman for the brewer said.

They added: “While overall our availability is good there are intermittent pockets of pressure in our supply network that are unfortunately affecting a number of Wetherspoons pubs.

“We’re working around the clock with our customers and third-party logistics partners to ensure we minimise any impact to our customers.

“After such a difficult period for our industry it’s heart-breaking to be letting any customer down and we will continue to do everything in our power to get our much-loved brands back on every Wetherspoons bar.”

Some experts say it may be in just a few years others suggest the second half of the decade. Many still scratch their head as to why there is even a big difference now between the price of EV models and the fossil fuel equivalents.

Perhaps one reason is that the EV makers can get away with it. Subsidies or taxes are bringing the prices into line in those countries or states where electric cars are now mass market items. In other markets where buyers are mostly “early adopters” they can get away with a premium because the customers want them so much.

Tesla which produces the best selling EVs in most markets across the world has only recently started posting profits from its operations but that disguises the fact that its margins per unit are high and steadily growing. Much of its money goes into R&D.

Morgan Stanley estimates those margins to be getting close to 20 per cent near the luxury end of the auto market even though its Fremont plant in California is regarded as the highest cost car manufacturing plant on the planet.

Morgan Stanley estimates the margins at the new Berlin Austin and other plants or “gigafactories” will be 1000 to 1500 basis points higher than Fremont so as their share of production grows the costs of production will fall dramatically and the margins (assuming the prices remain study) will soar at the same time.

Will Tesla book all those gains as profits? Not likely Morgan Stanley suggests because its top strategic priority will be to expand the availability of lower priced Tesla vehicles to as many people as possible.

Why is that? Because Tesla sees even bigger profits in the future not from the cars themselves but from its multiple “ancillary” business possibilities – software full self driving subscriptions insurance robo-taxis and more.

To make this work Tesla needs as big a fleet as it can get. Design and engineering will deliver a new level of scale at EV factories possibly at a level that the industry has never seen.

“We see the EV market as a highly deflationary business” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent note. “”While it may take several years to play out we would be prepared for Tesla vehicles to be offered as low as $US20k/unit this decade.” That’s half the current price of just under $US40000 for the base level Model 3. And others will be forced to do the same. “We also expect the price of certain EVs across different manufacturers to be as low as $US10k” the analysts say. “OEM (Car maker) profitability will be derived from monetizing the customer via other revenue streams such as software as opposed to the hardware (the car).” To give some idea of the scale of Tesla’s ambition Morgan Stanley estimates that Tesla will spend around $US27 billion a year by 2027 on d annve R&D – that’s more than Apple spends now and more than NASA. “Investors are witnessing one of the most spectacular industrial ‘arms races’ in a generation” the analysts write. “The ‘batteries are the new oil’ mantra is being put to work in the form of extraordinarily large budgets across private and public enterprise research labs and government sponsored efforts.” Morgan Stanley estimates that more than $US1 trillion will be spent on developing advanced battery materials and cell architecture and “industrializing its production at tera-scale” And they believe that Tesla has a big advantage in terms of innovation and scale from the raw materials of the battery to the data coming off the car. “The battle for EV supremacy is still in its early skirmishes … even in our own modeling we may be underestimating the ambition and speed with which Tesla is industrializing the EV its supporting infrastructure and its ‘internet of cars’ revenue model.” See also: Tesla flags $25000 electric hatchback for 2023 but it might have no pedals",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvd3V4aS1hcHB0ZWMtcmVjZWl2ZXMtYWEtZXNnLXJhdGluZy1mcm9tLW1zY2ktMzAxMzY5NTYxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WuXi AppTec Receives AA ESG Rating from MSCI,"SHANGHAI Sept. 5 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- WuXi AppTec (""the Company"") is pleased to announce that Morgan Stanley Capital International (""MSCI"") has upgraded its MSCI ESG Rating to AA.

For The Bulletin

That fateful morning 20 years ago was my 30th birthday. I was a high school history teacher and there were no smartphones in classrooms then so I was quite surprised when one of my students asked “Mr. Cregeau why did the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor?” There was no way she or anyone else could have known of the attacks occurring at the same time at the World Trade Center. I had been a graduate student in Colorado in the late 1990s so when the principal said there was an emergency situation and everyone would leave class I flashed back to Colorado and thought we had another security crisis. While I was shocked by the attack on September 11th as a historian I also immediately flashed back to the first terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 that many people had forgotten.

Understandably there were many great tributes then and during the years that followed for the many heroic firefighters policeman and other emergency workers who responded that day and in the days and weeks that followed.

Growing up in a Marine Corps family I wish I had space to devote to two Marines Sgts. Jason Thomas and Dave Karnes who rescued people in the World Trade Center rubble. For this brief feature I wish to share the stories of two amazing heroes whom many readers may not remember.

For John O’Neill September 11th was his third week at his new job. He was in charge of security for the World Trade Center. A New Jersey native Mr. O’Neill had served in the F.B.I. as a special agent for decades joining in 1976. Between then and 1995 he worked at the Chicago Field Office on the organized crime and counterintelligence squads.

He then worked from 1995 to 1999 at F.B.I. headquarters in Washington D.C. becoming chief of the counter-terrorism division. He became an expert on various Islamic terrorist organizations and was frustrated with the lack of cooperation and honesty from Saudi Arabia following the June 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers there. In 1997 he moved to New York City to work as Special Agent in Charge of counter-terrorism at the New York Office. In 2000 he worked briefly over in Yemen in charge of the U.S.S. Cole bombing.

On the morning of September 11th O’Neill had moved with other security people to a command center in the South Tower following the earlier North Tower attack at 8:46 AM. The second plane crashed into the South Tower at 9:03 AM. That tower collapsed at 9:59 while the North Tower collapsed at 10:28 followed by 7 WTC at 5:21 PM. O’Neill was last seen headed into a tunnel to the South Tower likely to help lead the building’s evacuation.

Another great loss that morning was Rick Rescorla. Col. Rescorla was born in Cornwall Britain and served as a British Army paratrooper in the late 1950s. After moving to the U.S. he enlisted in the U.S. Army then graduated from Officer Candidate School. He was assigned as a lieutenant to the 2nd Battalion 7th Cavalry Regiment 1st Cavalry Division. He was sent to Vietnam and served under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore including at the Battle Ia Dran in 1965 made famous by Moore’s book We Were Soldiers Once…Any Young and later the 2002 Mel Gibson film by the same name. Moore called Rescorla “the best platoon leader I ever saw.” For his heroic service in Vietnam Rescorla received the Silver Star two Bronze Stars and the Purple Heart. He retired as a colonel in the Army Reserve in 1990.

Rescorla became a corporate security officer in 1985. Following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in 1988 Rescorla worried about a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. He warned the Port Authority of the risk of a truck bombing of the WTC in one of the two basements which went unheeded but occurred in 1993. He also frustrated some Morgan Stanley executives with his evacuation drills in case their building was attacked. That training paid off for everyone.

On September 11th Rescorla famously supervised the safe evacuation of most of Morgan Stanley’s 2700 employees by ignoring the Port Authority’s announcement to remain at their desks. He was heard singing songs such as “God Bless America” to help keep people calm while guiding workers down fire stairwells to safety. He was last seen going back up the stairs on the 10th floor of the South Tower making sure everyone was out. His remains were never found. Between singing songs Rescorla called his wife Betsy telling her “Stop crying. I have to get these people out safely. If something should happen to me I want you to know I’ve never been happier. You made my life.”

Mr. Biden also named Chesley B. Sullenberger III the pilot who executed a water landing off Midtown Manhattan after a dual engine failure brought his plane plummeting toward earth as his nominee for ambassador to the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization.

Among the nine nominees announced were Ken Salazar a former Colorado senator who served as the interior secretary during the Obama administration as ambassador to Mexico; and Thomas R. Nides a vice chairman at Morgan Stanley who served as a deputy secretary of state under President Barack Obama as ambassador to Israel.

The official announcements of the long-rumored nominations came as Mr. Biden traveled to Europe with the goal of demonstrating to global leaders that “America is back at the table.” Mr. Nides’s nomination also came just days after a new government took power in Israel opening up the possibility of a less contentious relationship with the Biden administration."

But one Detroit home-based business is literally turning those virus lemons into lemonade. And business is good.

Fourteen-year-old Cyr-Edward Shearon is the proud owner of CBS Lemonade Plus selling homemade lemonade and Kool-Aid right outside of his house on the corner of West Seven Mile Road and Greenlawn Street to thirsty neighbors and passersby. In fact you could say that he's ""cornered"" the market. Get it?

He started the business in 2014 before the pandemic hit. But according to his mom/accountant LaVerne Naize-Maxwell this has been his best year yet.

“He’s made over $6000 just between the months of May and July"" she said.

CBS Lemonade Plus serves up a mix of different Kool-Aid flavors — grape tropical watermelon punch orange pineapple blue raspberry and green apple — along with his regular and pink lemonades. The lemonades are made from fresh fruit and two special ingredients — shhh it's a secret. He sells them in different sizes: a 16-ounce small cup for $1 a 32-ounce cup for $3 a Mason jar that also holds 32 ounces for $6 or an entire liter for $30.

Cyr-Edward said the mason jars are his most popular size and the blue raspberry flavor Kool-Aid is his customers' most popular drink of choice.

“Everybody asks for the blue raspberry” he said. “But my favorite is the pink lemonade.""

On any given day of the week that Cyr-Edward is out selling his drinks traffic outside of his home can be anywhere from two to three cars nonstop or a stretch of vehicles wrapped around his Greenlawn Street corner. Sometimes his customers are frequent buyers. And sometimes they are new. But the one constant is that the many customers who walk or drive up to the blue awning stand he sells from tend to buy him out of all the drinks he has for sale.

“I pretty much sell out every day” he said with a big smile on his face. “And at night I make more for the next day.”

His mom who is working from home during the pandemic said she helps her son prepare the lemonade at night and sell it during the day. She said she is extremely proud of her son said and loves watching his business soar.

“When the cars start lining up outside I come running out the house to help him. I’ve always wanted him to have a business mindset so I feel that it is my job to keep this momentum going” Maxwell said.

When Cyr-Edward who is preparing to attend Martin Luther King Jr. High School as a freshman this fall is not making lemonade he is playing football for the Detroit Spartans. And one day he said he hopes to become a professional football player with a degree in culinary arts. Right now though he said he is saving his money in the hopes of one day buying a trailer to sell his drinks from.

Cyr-Edward's attitude and work ethic are just as refreshing as the drinks he sells according to his customers. One regular customer who lives in the neighborhood and who has been coming to get his special drink for over a year said he returns not only because the drinks are good but because he is proud to see what the young man is doing and wants to help him achieve his dream.

“We have to support our children” Darius Hare 45 said from inside his vehicle before ordering a blue raspberry Kool-Aid in a Mason jar. “And plus the drinks are good too.”

Another customer Lisa McNish who stopped by with her son Kieran McElhoes for the first time said: “Yeah that’s what’s up"" with a look of satisfaction on her face after taking one sip of the grape Kool-Aid she ordered.

Maxwell says that with her son beginning high school next week she isn’t sure what his lemonade stand schedule will be. But if folks are looking for good homemade drinks they can continue to stop by her home on Fridays from noon-6 p.m.

The proud mom said she always thought her son would use football to earn a better life. But after watching the success and business acumen Cyr-Edward has displayed with his drink stand ""this this just may be it.""

Let’s talk about scarcity: what it is and how it relates to the dollar gold and bitcoin.

First let’s start by defining it. Scarcity is the gap between the limited supply of various resources and the limitless want of humans. The principle of scarcity is a core concept in the study of economics. Thomas Sowell an economist at the Hoover Institute defines economics as such:

“The study of the allocation of scarce resources with alternative uses.”

There Are Two Different Types Of Scarcity: Relative Scarcity And Absolute Scarcity

First we’re going to talk about relative scarcity and we’re going to use gold a relatively scarce good to illustrate it. If there is a sudden spike in the demand for gold the price of gold goes up but gold miners seeing the higher prices are going to work overtime and upgrade all their equipment to produce as much gold as possible because profit margins are higher than they usually are. But as the gold miners extract more gold increasing the supply the price of gold will decline because supply and demand are reaching their original equilibrium. So what this means generally is that relatively scarce goods do not have a fixed supply so whenever demand increases supply will also eventually increase to meet demand.

Okay now let’s go into absolute scarcity and we’re going to use the Mona Lisa as our example. If there is a spike in the demand for the Mona Lisa the price is going to spike too. However its supply is not going to increase because it is impossible to make another Mona Lisa. The original creator Leonardo Da Vinci is dead so he can’t make another exact replica of the painting. No one can. So the price is going to stay up until the demand for the painting decreases. So what this means is that in absolute scarcity there is a finite fixed supply of a good. Whenever demand for an item increases there is no additional supply response to meet that increased demand. This means that the supply is completely inelastic. You cannot create more regardless of the increase in demand. The only output that can change is price.

The Dollar Is Not Scarce Because It Can Be Printed By Central Banks At Any Time

During economic downturns when people don’t have much money there is an increased demand for the dollar. So central banks print money into circulation so that the monetary supply meets the new increased monetary demand. Bitcoin on the other hand is absolutely scarce. The number of bitcoin in circulation will never exceed 21 million as per its protocol. So when the demand for bitcoin increases there is only one variable that can change to ensure the demand and supply of bitcoin are in equilibrium and that’s price. While absolute scarcity is what makes bitcoin so valuable… it’s the same property that tends to make it’s price volatile.

To sum up:

The Dollar: Not scarce created at will - “There is an infinite amount of cash in the Federal Reserve” - Neel Kashkari Minneapolis Fed Chairman Gold: Relative scarcity - Gold is only scarce relative to the amount of energy put into mining it. If we gave everyone a shovel and told them to start mining we would have a whole lot more gold flooding the market causing the price to go down. Bitcoin: Absolute Scarcity - No matter how much energy is put into mining Bitcoin it’s issuance rate and hard-capped supply remains the same.

The Big Question Is Why Does It Matter What Type Of Money An Economy Uses?

Well simply put the more scarce a currency is the more conducive it will be for economic growth. Economic growth is the creation of new products and services in an economy and the best way to incentivize this is through savings and investment. Inflation which is what we get under a non-scarce currency reduces the effectiveness of savings and investments because we are losing our purchasing power.

So whenever you see headlines of the government passing stimulus bills understand that they’re printing money to make that happen.

In fact 20% of U.S. dollars were printed in 2020 alone. All this money printing causes inflation and stifles economic growth. Bitcoin gives us the option to remove the government from the equation and build a more sound economy.

This is the question with which the lawyer Kenneth Feinberg (played by Michael Keaton) opens the new Netflix film Worth stressing to his students that he’s not posing it as a philosophical query. He is a high-powered mediator who assesses damages in cases involving unexpected large-scale death—such as lawsuits involving Agent Orange or in the case of this film the September 11 attacks. Feinberg’s job is to calculate the monetary value of lives lost—to turn names into dollars and cents—in a chilling role befitting our capitalist society.

As Worth begins Feinberg leads his law students through a mock case in which someone dies in a farming accident and his family sues for damages. Abstract numbers are bandied about until the class agrees that $2.7 million sounds right; Feinberg’s lesson is that putting a price tag on a soul can be that easy and that arbitrary. Sara Colangelo’s film an adaptation of the real-life Feinberg’s memoir is about the attorney being handed the same challenge on a staggering level: running the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund which paid out damages to thousands of families still recovering from the attacks.

Colangelo’s movie written by Max Borenstein was released yesterday just a week before the 20th anniversary of 9/11. That timing wasn’t always planned—Worth debuted at the Sundance Film Festival back in January 2020. But it means the movie functions as a timely tribute of sorts: a consideration of how bureaucracy can be both a calming force and an infuriating obstacle following incomprehensible trauma. In Worth Feinberg is appointed to ease families’ suffering. At the same time he’s expected to be a bulwark against those same families’ demands. Eventually he has to understand that a business-as-usual approach simply can’t contain a tragedy of this size.

From the September 2021 issue: What Bobby McIlvaine left behind

The September 11th Victim Compensation Fund was created not merely out of a sense of duty but also out of fear within the government that people would bring legal action against airlines for huge damages crippling a major industry at a tenuous moment. In Worth Feinberg’s job is to sell thousands of grieving families on financial settlements in return for their declining to sue and he’s given broad power to decide who gets what from a multibillion-dollar fund. Keaton plays Feinberg as an avuncular no-nonsense presence convinced that he can hammer a system of fairness out of calamity even though the 9/11 victims encompassed a wide range of ages salaries and occupations.

Colangelo sets almost the entire first half of Worth in offices and boardrooms—the more anonymous the better. The only glimpse audiences see of the attacks themselves is in the reflection of Feinberg’s commuter-train window as he and other passengers stare at a pillar of smoke off in the distance; everything else is filtered through news broadcasts audio recordings and other media. The antiseptic distance is intentional. Though Worth’s Feinberg is not emotionless he’s also erecting familiar force fields trying to divorce his feelings from the strange task of devising mathematical formulas to estimate what the dead might have been able to earn had their lives not been cut short.

Keaton is in a phase of his career where he excels at playing pillars of credibility—white-collar guys with a blue-collar evenhandedness. His work as Feinberg is reminiscent of his terrific performance as the dogged newsman Robby Robinson in Spotlight or as former Attorney General Ramsey Clark in The Trial of the Chicago 7. He never raises his voice never patronizes anyone and rarely even flashes the toothy grin that made him a movie star back in the days of Batman and Beetlejuice. His performance crucially retains the audience’s sympathies even as Feinberg is a figure of frustration to everyone around him upsetting both co-workers and victims’ families who care about compassion not just compensation.

Charles Wolf (Stanley Tucci) a dogged advocate whose wife died in the attacks eventually becomes the voice of reason for Feinberg helping him understand that he has to step out of the boardroom and meet people face-to-face. Tucci and Keaton had similarly powerful chemistry in Spotlight (another gripping film largely staged in dingy offices) and the arc of their relationship in Worth from adversaries to allies undergirds a movie that might have otherwise felt like a series of endless meetings. A separate plot about the grieving wife of a firefighter (Laura Benanti) is too overwrought for the film’s muted tone since she seems like a fictionalized stand-in for a whole group of people whereas Worth’s key message is about coming to understand each individual loss.

Colangelo communicates the magnitude of the devastation not through visceral imagery and flashbacks but through simple remembrance with family members telling specific stories of the people they lost so Feinberg can understand that they’re more than numbers to be plugged into an algorithm. Watching the bureaucracy shift from a source of frustration to comfort gives the film its arresting tension. Nearly two decades after 9/11 Feinberg’s realization is also the audience’s reminder: The event was a shock to the United States that even billions of government dollars couldn’t reverse and only by looking closely and empathetically at its human cost can we really understand what was lost.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL2Jlc3QtbmV0ZmxpeC1tb3ZpZXMtdG8td2F0Y2gtYmVmb3JlLXRoZXktbGVhdmUtbmV0ZmxpeC1zZXB0ZW1iZXItMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Best Netflix Movies to Watch Before They Leave Netflix in September 2021,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL2Jlc3QtbmV0ZmxpeC1tb3ZpZXMtdG8td2F0Y2gtYmVmb3JlLXRoZXktbGVhdmUtbmV0ZmxpeC1zZXB0ZW1iZXItMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvNy1nb29nbGUtY2hyb21lLWV4dGVuc2lvbnMtZm9yLW5ldGZsaXjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Google Chrome extensions to up your Netflix and chill game,"Amid the countless streaming apps available today Netflix reigns supreme.

Bored of aimlessly scrolling through Netflix's recommended watches? Netflix does categorize its content into hyper-specific genres but it doesn't display them to users.

New polling has revealed how much the average Australian has saved up in the bank and it’s nowhere near the amount that would constitute a reasonable deposit – at least in Sydney or Melbourne.

According to the Finder.com research which polled more than 30000 people across the country the average Aussie has just under $32800 tucked away for a rainy day.

Inside Karl Stefanovic’s waterfront mansion

This figure is up about $5000 from prior to the pandemic largely due to most people keeping their expenses down during lockdowns.

A 20 per cent deposit for a house priced at the Sydney median of $1.29 million would be about $260000 and the purchaser would need about another $50000 for stamp duty.

Of course not everyone is saving for a deposit but there are plenty of people who are with separate Finder polling revealing 19 per cent of NSW residents wanted to purchase within six months.

Given how big the gap between savings and deposits has become you may be wondering how so many people have continued to purchase homes.

And it turns out very few are first home buyers. Housing experts revealed the bulk of recent buying activity was from “trade up” buyers who already owned a property that could fund their next purchase.

These were also the buyers who were often behind the biggest house sales of recent weeks – in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars above reserve at auctions.

Finder also analysed average earnings and living expenses data in each state to find out where Australians have the most disposable income.

The results showed those from the ACT had the most disposable income per capita with an average of $2899 left over after paying for living expenses like rent food and bills.

Western Australia ($2832) and Victoria ($2794) come in second and third place for the most amount of disposable income per person per month. In NSW it was $2602 and in Queensland $2358.

Those from the Northern Territory have the least amount of leftover cash an average of $1635 per person per month.

Finder.com.au personal finance expert Kate Browne said there was no doubt some states are more expensive than others.

“Sydney is one of the most expensive cities in the world for property but is also home to some of the highest wages in the country” Ms Browne said.

“The best way to increase your disposable income and boost your savings is to cut your expenses and increase your earnings.

New polling has revealed how much the average Australian has saved up in the bank and it’s nowhere near the amount that would constitute a reasonable deposit – at least in Sydney or Melbourne.

According to the Finder.com research which polled more than 30000 people across the country the average Aussie has just under $32800 tucked away for a rainy day.

Inside Karl Stefanovic’s waterfront mansion

This figure is up about $5000 from prior to the pandemic largely due to most people keeping their expenses down during lockdowns.

A 20 per cent deposit for a house priced at the Sydney median of $1.29 million would be about $260000 and the purchaser would need about another $50000 for stamp duty.

Of course not everyone is saving for a deposit but there are plenty of people who are with separate Finder polling revealing 19 per cent of NSW residents wanted to purchase within six months.

Given how big the gap between savings and deposits has become you may be wondering how so many people have continued to purchase homes.

And it turns out very few are first home buyers. Housing experts revealed the bulk of recent buying activity was from “trade up” buyers who already owned a property that could fund their next purchase.

These were also the buyers who were often behind the biggest house sales of recent weeks – in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars above reserve at auctions.

Finder also analysed average earnings and living expenses data in each state to find out where Australians have the most disposable income.

The results showed those from the ACT had the most disposable income per capita with an average of $2899 left over after paying for living expenses like rent food and bills.

Western Australia ($2832) and Victoria ($2794) come in second and third place for the most amount of disposable income per person per month. In NSW it was $2602 and in Queensland $2358.

Those from the Northern Territory have the least amount of leftover cash an average of $1635 per person per month.

Finder.com.au personal finance expert Kate Browne said there was no doubt some states are more expensive than others.

“Sydney is one of the most expensive cities in the world for property but is also home to some of the highest wages in the country” Ms Browne said.

“The best way to increase your disposable income and boost your savings is to cut your expenses and increase your earnings. Of course this is easier said than done.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9uYXRpb25hbC93b29sd29ydGhzLXRvLWJyaW5nLWJhY2stYWdyaWN1bHR1cmUtZGlzY292ZXJ5LXRvdXJzLWFmdGVyLXN0dWR5LWZpbmRzLWtpZHMtbGFjay1mb29kLWtub3dsZWRnZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzZjZDJlOTdmZjUzOGM1Yjg2Y2ZhYzg3M2NmZjk5MjRl0gGwAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L25hdGlvbmFsL3dvb2x3b3J0aHMtdG8tYnJpbmctYmFjay1hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZS1kaXNjb3ZlcnktdG91cnMtYWZ0ZXItc3R1ZHktZmluZHMta2lkcy1sYWNrLWZvb2Qta25vd2xlZGdlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNmNkMmU5N2ZmNTM4YzViODZjZmFjODczY2ZmOTkyNGU_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aussie kids unable to identify common vegetables,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/national/woolworths-to-bring-back-agriculture-discovery-tours-after-study-finds-kids-lack-food-knowledge/news-story/6cd2e97ff538c5b86cfac873cff9924e on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9uYXRpb25hbC93b29sd29ydGhzLXRvLWJyaW5nLWJhY2stYWdyaWN1bHR1cmUtZGlzY292ZXJ5LXRvdXJzLWFmdGVyLXN0dWR5LWZpbmRzLWtpZHMtbGFjay1mb29kLWtub3dsZWRnZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzZjZDJlOTdmZjUzOGM1Yjg2Y2ZhYzg3M2NmZjk5MjRl0gGwAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L25hdGlvbmFsL3dvb2x3b3J0aHMtdG8tYnJpbmctYmFjay1hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZS1kaXNjb3ZlcnktdG91cnMtYWZ0ZXItc3R1ZHktZmluZHMta2lkcy1sYWNrLWZvb2Qta25vd2xlZGdlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNmNkMmU5N2ZmNTM4YzViODZjZmFjODczY2ZmOTkyNGU_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY28udWsvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MvamVyZW15LWt5bGUtam9pbnMtdGFsa3JhZGlvLXRvLWhvc3QtZHJpdmV0aW1lLXNob3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeremy Kyle joins talkRADIO to host Drivetime show,"Jeremy Kyle has joined talkRADIO as host of the Drivetime show on Mondays to Thursdays at 4-7pm.

NKE,Nike,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2Vmb2N1cy5jb20vdGhlLWh1bWFuLWJvZHkvbmlrZS1hbHBoYWZseS1iYW5uZWQtdGVjaG5vbG9naWNhbC1kb3BpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Technological doping: The science of why Nike Alphaflys were banned from the Tokyo Olympics,"What running shoes have been banned from the Tokyo Olympics?

In October 2019 Kenya’s Eliud Kipchoge did what no human had done before and ran a marathon in under two hours. His 1:59:40 time came via an average speed of 21.18km/h (just try that for 30 seconds next time you’re on a treadmill).

But some argue the unofficial record partly derived from the Nike Alphafly shoes he was wearing. The Alphaflys or “the shoe that broke running” as sports scientist Dr Ross Tucker called them contain tech designed to deliver greater energy return and speed.

Thanks to a trio of carbon plates and a cutting-edge midsole (the cushioning above the tread) peer-reviewed studies – albeit funded by Nike – claimed the shoe served up a 4 per cent increase in running efficiency and an estimated 3.4 per cent in speed.

However new guidelines unveiled by World Athletics back in January 2020 saw the Alphaflys banned from elite competition. These new rules outline a shoe must have no more than one carbon-fibre plate with midsole height not exceeding 40mm.

But the story doesn’t end there. Nike has released an altered version the Vaporfly which adheres to the new regulations and the shoe took 31 of the 36 podium positions at major marathons in 2019. Proponents laud Nike’s innovation; critics say it’s technological doping.

What is technological doping anyway?

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is best known for battling drug cheats. But its remit covers sports equipment too and WADA will suggest a sport’s governing body prohibits a particular item if it’s deemed to be “against the spirit of the sport”.

But since most kit is designed to enhance performance many items fall into a grey area like Speedo’s LZR Racer swimsuit for example. The body-length suit uses textures based on shark skin to increase buoyancy.

At the 2008 Beijing Olympics 23 out of the 25 swimming records broken came from athletes wearing the LZR Racer. The suit was banned by swimming’s governing body FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) in 2009.

How does the Nike Vaporfly work?

On the face of it the legal Vaporflys resemble a traditional shoe. But subtle differences combine for a significant difference. According to the British Journal Of Sports Medicine the carbon-fibre plate midsole material and midsole thickness are at the heart of the Vaporfly’s efficiency.

The full-length plate increases the shoe’s stiffness and acts as a lever to cut work at the ankle. This Nike-funded but peer-reviewed studies claim increases running efficiency by 1.5 per cent. On its own the carbon plate’s stiffness might deliver an uncomfortable feel but this is offset by the thickness of midsole which measures 31mm at the heel.

Such a thick midsole would add weight over a traditional race shoe but doesn’t because it’s made with a polyamide block elastomer called Pebax foam. More recent models also feature air pods as an extra suspension system.

It’s difficult to pin down the collective advantage each element grants. But for some runners the stability energy efficiency and comfort the shoes provide is more beneficial than others – improvements in run times range from 6 per cent to absolutely nothing according to the British Journal Of Sports Medicine.

Is ‘shoe fairness’ even possible?

With commercialism the driving force shoe fairness simply isn’t possible. Nike’s revenue grew 9 per cent in 2020 hitting the $11.24bn-mark (£7.9bn) with online purchases of its footwear a big driver. Even the considerable £250+ price tag for the Alpha/Vaporfly shoes didn’t deter performance-seeking recreational runners.

Nike’s secured a number of patents with the Vaporfly including the curvature of that full-length carbon plate. And while competitors such as Adidas and Saucony have followed suit do their different shapes and different lengths of carbon afford the same advantage or has Nike beaten them to it?

If a marathon runner wearing Adidas’s equivalent shoes covers the 26.2-mile distance in 1:57:00 will Nike cry foul and play the technological-doping card?

It’s a competitive quagmire though one World Athletics (track and field’s governing body) has gone some way to navigating this by limiting the midsole height to 40mm.

What other technology could boost running performance in the future?

As the disparity in performance improvements for runners wearing the Vaporfly showed differences such as arch shape foot width and run gait all impact the proficiency of a shoe. So bespoke footwear is the ideal.

And it’s happening with Adidas using 3D foot-scanning technology and 3D printing to produce its prototype Futurecraft run shoe. This has progressed to the Strung shoe slated to launch in late 2022.

In future tech could be used to help you run quicker by lowering your perceived exertion. This revolves around brain manipulation using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) which is already growing in popularity.

The idea is that a low current sent through your grey matter teaches your brain to maintain stronger neural signals as you flag resulting in faster times. tDCS products are already on the market making big claims that aren’t backed by independent evidence.

Not only did the Spurs surprise him and rest of the basketball word by selecting the 18-year-old 12th overall in the draft but it has been lucrative as well. He signed his first NBA contract got a chance to show at the bare minimum that he might be worth the risk with an intriguing Summer League showing got his NBA rookie card and now he has signed his first big endorsement with Nike. According to Jeff Garcia of KENS5:

“He’s a Nike athlete officially now” said Primo’s agent Todd Ramasar. “He’ll be wearing more Nikes on the floor as well as some of those exclusive Jordans.” “It was a natural fit for him” Ramasar said. “Josh has worn Nikes. He’s comfortable in them. It was a good fit.”

He joins some elite company with Nike as several of the NBA’s top players are Nike athletes and who knows? Maybe someday Primo will have his own signature shoe. (One suggestion: if you’re a collector it might be a good time to buy low on his rookie card; it could become valuable someday if he reaches his full potential and becomes the star the Spurs believe he can. If there’s any team one can trust to reach for the stars in the draft and succeed it’s the Spurs.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC1wbHVzLTMtZG82Mzg2LTAwMS1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Max Plus 3 DO6386-001 Release Date - SBD,"In addition to the recently revealed Air Max Plus Nike Sportswear will be using a similar graphic print displayed on this upcoming Air Max Plus 3.

The wives of the 19 Northern State Governors have said that bandits must be defeated for children to feel safe going to school and also engaged in national developmental initiatives.

The chairperson of the Northern State Governors Forum and First Lady of Kaduna State Hadiza El-Rufai told newsmen on Saturday in Abuja that they are also determined to collaborate with the federal government to combat gender-based violence and drugs abuse.

According to her closure of schools is a short-term plan to tackle the kidnapping of school children but that the security agencies must do all it can to defeat the bandits for all children to return to schools on the long run.

Hadiza who rolled out the activities of the forum in 2021 and 2022 said banditry is one of the issues security agencies must tackle to enable them achieved their objectives.

“We are concern about kidnapping of school children. The short-term plan is about closing down the schools as Kaduna and Zamfara state are doing.

“You don’t put the children in danger by taking them to school. The bandits must be defeated at all cost.

“We cannot continue like this. We must defeat the bandits for children to go to school. The short term you must shut down the schools” she said.

Also the vice chairperson of the forum who is also the first lady of Kwara State Ambassador Olufolake Abdulrazak said they will ensure the sustainability of the programme even beyond 2023.

According to her the programmes would be such that their successors would see their merits and ensure their sustainability.

On her part the Special Assistant to the President on social investment in the office of the vice president Mariam Uwais who earlier briefed the governor’s wives on what the federal government is doing on empowerment of women young girls and school children said they will get the data of out of school children and address their health concerns.

“The states has the constitutional mandate to bring the children to share a framework for digital skills agriculture and other empowerment programme.

“We are collaborating with the governor’s wives and other stakeholders to select 50 young educated but not employ youths in every local government empower them to mentor the young children and guide those that are out of school to return to the school and remain in schools.

“Fifty will be selected in every local government. They will be paid N30000 which is the minimum wage. This will create capacity and create jobs for them” Uwais said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3RoZWdvbGZuZXdzbmV0LmNvbS9nb2xmbmV3c25ldHRlYW0vMjAyMS8wOS8wNS8yMDIxLWZlZGV4LWN1cC1maW5hbC1yZXN1bHRzLXByaXplLW1vbmV5LXBheW91dC1zdGFuZGluZ3MtYW5kLWhvdy1tdWNoLWVhY2gtZ29sZmVyLXdvbi0xMjQwMzYv0gGXAWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZ29sZm5ld3NuZXQuY29tL3J5YW5fYmFsbGVuZ2VlLzIwMjEvMDkvMDUvMjAyMS1mZWRleC1jdXAtZmluYWwtcmVzdWx0cy1wcml6ZS1tb25leS1wYXlvdXQtc3RhbmRpbmdzLWFuZC1ob3ctbXVjaC1lYWNoLWdvbGZlci13b24tMTI0MDM2L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 FedEx Cup final results: Prize money payout standings and how much each golfer won,"The 2021 FedEx Cup final leaderboard is headed by winner Patrick Cantlay who prevailed by a shot in the Tour Championship to win the FedEx Cup at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta Ga.

NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXZpYXRpb25pc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMDUvbXlzdGVyeS1haXJjcmFmdC1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mysterious Aircraft Spotted Over Philippines Strikingly Similar To Mystery UAS Photographed Over California Last Year,"Let’s talk about the mysterious flying wing aircraft that flew over the Philippines a few days ago.

On Sept. 2 2021 at 06.15AM LT Michael Fugnit took a photo of a rather mysterious aircraft at high altitude flying with a southwestern heading over the Philippines.

“I didn’t hear any sounds from the aircraft” told us Michael in a message. “I was waiting for the sunrise since it is my daily routine to capture sunrise and sunsets when I took the photo from the top hill of Brgy. San Roque Municipality of Sta. Magdalena Province of Sorsogon”.

Analysis on the only photograph Michael took of the aircraft suggest that the image is genuine and not doctored.

The shot features what seems to be a large-span flying wing with straight trailing edge and trails two contrails suggesting closely paired twin turbofan engines: in other words the one photographed over the Philippines a few days ago appears to be strikingly similar to the mysterious UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System) spotted flying over Palmdale California in 2020 a UAS thought to be a either the highly classified Northrop Grumman RQ-180 drone or a Lockheed Martin P-175 Polecat derivative.

This is what we wrote in November 2020 when the image of the UAS flying over California first appeared online:

The photo which was claimed to be taken “…in California just north of Edwards [AFB]” shows an aircraft trailing two prominent contrails suggesting the altitude of the aircraft at the time the photo was taken was in excess of approximately 25000 ft. Contrails require moist cold air to freeze the water vapor expelled during normal jet engine combustion. Considering the altitude of the aircraft at the time the photo was taken the size of the aircraft in the photo may be significant. Published estimates of the wingspan of the RQ-180 drone claim it may be as large as 130 ft. Estimates of the wingspan of the Polecat suggest it is about 90 ft. The U.S. Air Force does not acknowledge the existence of the RQ-180 drone but a number of factors seem to support theories of its existence and even operational deployment. One theory that supports the operational deployment of the RQ-180 is the reduction in the number of RQ-4 Global Hawk reconnaissance drones. It’s possible a newer more capable RQ-180 may have taken over missions previously assigned to RQ-4s. Forbes magazine reporter David Axe is another keen-eyed journalist who recognized the significance of the new Kolinsky photo. Late Sunday night Axe wrote “The Air Force reportedly tested the roughly 170-feet-wingspan RQ-180 at Groom Lake part of the Area 51 complex in Nevada. By early 2020 the RQ-180 apparently was so well-established in Air Force service that the flying branch was comfortable cutting its fleet of non-stealthy RQ-4 Global Hawk drones.” […] Observers of the photo on internet forums have made some interesting insights about the Kolinsky photo. Some suggest the planform of the aircraft in Kolinsky’s image is nearly identical to the Polecat. A revived P-175 (the original one crashed in 2007) or a testbed based on it? Maybe.

Provided they are the same type the main difference between the sighting last year and the one of a few days ago is that the latter proves the mysterious (most probably unmanned) aircraft would be already conducting operational missions around the world. In fact based on the location where the aircraft was spotted it seems reasonable to believe it was returning from a mission in the South China Sea where there might have been interesting Chinese activity to surveil. Dispatching a HALE (High Altitude Long Endurance) low-observable drone from either the U.S. or a forward operating location (like Andersen Air Force Base in Guam that already hosts the RQ-4s) to cover some specific time-sensitive target would totally make sense. These missions could require the aircraft to cross some unpopulated areas of the Philippines during daylight conditions (as happened on Sept. 2) when chances to be spotted from the ground are scarce.

Obioviously there are many other intriguing theories including the one that the aircraft overflying the Philippines could be a Chinese H-20 stealth bomber but we have no details suggesting the Chinese have reached a phase of the development of their aircraft that would allow them to fly it in daylight inside enemy airspace.

Dealing with the RQ-180 the existence of a secret unmanned aerial system (UAS) designed for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and scheduled to be operational with the U.S. Air Force by 2015 was first revealed by Aviation Week & Space Technology Senior Pentagon Editor Amy Butler and Senior International Defense Editor Bill Sweetman in December 2013.

Developed by Northrop Grumman since 2008-2009 the stealthy RQ-180 is designed to operate in “contested” or “denied” airspace as opposed to the non-stealthy RQ-4 Global Hawk that are intended for “permissive” scenarios.

In their analysis back then Sweetman and Butler said: “It is similar in size and endurance to the Global Hawk which weighs 32250 lb. and can stay on station for 24 hr. 1200 nm from its base. The much smaller RQ-170 is limited to 5-6 hr. of operation. […] The aircraft uses a version of Northrop’s stealthy “cranked-kite” design as does the X-47B with a highly swept centerbody and long slender outer wings. Northrop Grumman engineers publicly claimed (before the launch of the classified program) that the cranked-kite is scalable and adaptable in contrast to the B-2’s shape which has an unbroken leading edge. The RQ-180’s centerbody length and volume can be greater relative to the vehicle’s size.”

The RQ-180 is nicknamed the “Great White Bat” or sometimes “Shikaka” a fictional sacred white bat from the 1995 movie Ace Venture 2 AW&ST reported.

A big thank you to Michael Fugit for allowing us to use his photograph and to our reader Marls for the heads up!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvYnJhZGxleS1maWdodGluZy12ZWhpY2xlLWFib3V0LWdldC1maXJlLXBvd2VyLXVwZ3JhZGUtMTkzMDA00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Bradley Fighting Vehicle is About to Get a Fire Power Upgrade,"Here's What You Need to Remember: The Bradley vehicle served decently despite a very controversial development history. A firepower upgrade could be coming soon.

Jane’s Information Group an open-source intelligence company reported that Northrop Grumman delivered several prototype guns to the U.S. Army for their Bradley replacement vehicle—and what they delivered looks like a beast.

Previous photos released by Northrop Grumman show the XM913 50mm cannon outdoors silhouetted against the sky. The massive 50mm main gun is said to have two types of ammunition a fin-stabilized armor-piercing sabot round as well as a high explosive tracer round. To offset some of the no doubt massive recoil the massive gun would generate the XM913’s barrel features a prominent four-baffle muzzle brake—though a quick google search shows that the main gun still has lots of recoils.

While the current Bradley vehicle’s 25mm cannon can hit targets at ranges of up to two kilometers or about 1.2 miles Northrop Grumman maintains that their XM913 has double the range of a 25mm gun—and can hit targets up to four kilometers away.

A Northrop Grumman spokesman told Jane’s that the 50mm cannon “combines Bushmaster chain gun reliability with [a] next-generation effective range that will provide the warfighter with increased stand-off against near-peer adversaries” though what platform the massive main gun will be mated to remained slightly ambiguous.

Jane’s reported that the 50mm cannon is being developed to support the Army’s Next-Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) program one of several projects that the Army says are intended to replace the Bradley family of vehicles. But the main gun could also be used to increase other platform’s lethality as well.

Into Modernity

The Army is in the middle of a modernization push and is introducing several new armored platforms into service. One of these the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle manufactured by BAE Systems recently entered serial production.

Though it does offer increased protection when compared to the M113 and Bradley vehicles it appears to be rather modestly armed with a single .50 caliber heavy machine gun. It remains unclear if the XM913 would be able to be mated to the AMPV platform though the Army would likely want a firepower upgrade for the platform.

Postscript

Northrop Grumman estimates that by the end of 2021 the Army will have ordered a total of seventeen XM913 cannons for testing and evaluation. Still the Army has not yet decided what caliber the NGCV program will choose. So for now all we can do is wait and see what happens. Watch this topic for new details about both the NGCV program—and the XM913—in the future.

The news followed on the heels of two acquisitions in July: Heron Systems and Martin UAV. Shield AI said it plans to use its new capital to grow the combined company in the defense and commercial markets.

Separately Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) announced on Sept. 1 that it is in a partnership with Shield AI to test Martin UAV’s marquee product the V-BAT unmanned aircraft.

Shield AI based in downtown San Diego says it takes a software-first approach to serving the defense market. In short it applies self-driving car technologies to military aircraft. Autonomy is an important consideration when the military thinks about next generation air dominance said Brandon Tseng chief operating officer of Shield AI.

Tseng a former U.S. Navy SEAL and a Naval Academy graduate co-founded the business with brother Ryan Tseng the company’s CEO.

Series D Round

Disruptive led the Series D round. Based in Austin Texas Disruptive is a late-stage technology investor headed by Alex Davis. Also participating in the round were Point72 Ventures the company that led Shield AI’s Series C round.

As of Sept. 1 the company reached $225 million in equity and was at work to finalize another $75 million in debt.

Shield AI’s CEO has high expectations for his company.

“The funding round enables Shield AI to move one step closer to its goal of becoming a 21st century defense prime through a software first approach where products derive a strong competitive advantage from an autonomy and artificial intelligence backbone similar to what you see across the consumer product market where great hardware is differentiated through great software” said Ryan Tseng in a statement distributed on Aug. 24.

Tseng worked for Qualcomm Inc. (Nasdaq: QCOM) for several years after selling a startup company to Qualcomm.

Brandon Tseng said the company plans to use its new funding to grow and in particular hire talented engineers — specialists in software hardware and artificial intelligence. “San Diego has been a great place to attract talent” he said.

“The competition for talent in engineering is extremely fierce” said Brandon Tseng.

Tseng reiterated the importance of the software “backbone” to the company. Strong software offers capability to the military client. Increasingly he said senior military leaders as well as war fighters see the value attributed to software capabilities.

Aerospace Acquisitions

Shield AI did not disclose the terms of its two acquisitions in July.

Artificial intelligence software is at the heart of Heron Systems based in Alexandria Virginia. Its product recently had the distinction of defeating an experienced Air Force F-16 pilot and five other AI-pilots during the AlphaDogfight trials put on by DARPA the Pentagon’s research and development arm. (The initials stand for Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.)

“Truly special AI companies are incredibly rare assets in the defense market” Ryan Tseng said. “Heron has developed the most advanced AI-pilot for fighter aircraft in the United States. With China already showing comparable results operationalizing Heron’s work for programs such as Next Generation Air Dominance must be a national security priority.”

The other recent acquisition Martin UAV is based near Dallas in Plano Texas. Its V-BAT unmanned aircraft sits on its tail when not in flight and can take off and land vertically.

V-BAT can address the U.S. Army’s Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (FTUAS) mission said Kenn Todorov sector vice president and general manager of global sustainment and modernization at Northrop Grumman.

For the Martin UAV acquisition Shield AI retained JPMorgan Chase & Co. as exclusive financial adviser and Reed Smith LLP as legal adviser.

The ALE air vehicle design meets the US Army’s defined specifications for size weight and power requirements for the Future Vertical Lift program.

For the test the team demonstrated a launch of an ALE configuration intended for the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter.

According to the company the ALE air vehicle was ground launched from the canister spread its wings and accomplished stable flight. All test objectives were achieved including low-altitude launch wing and flight surface deployment and stable air vehicle flight control.

The launch was the first in a series of increasingly complex near-term flight tests that will advance the ALE air vehicle’s design including payload integration and further demonstrate its performance and maturity.

Raytheon Missiles & Defense is one of three companies awarded Other Transaction Authority contracts in August 2020 to produce ALE air vehicle designs. Raytheon Technologies businesses were also chosen for projects aimed at developing ALE mission systems and payloads.

The US Army envisions ALE as a crucial piece of the Future Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft Ecosystem. It extends tactical and operational reach and lethality of manned assets allowing them to remain outside of the range of enemy sensors and weapon systems while delivering kinetic and non-kinetic lethal and non-lethal mission effects against multiple threats as well as providing battle damage assessment data. They will provide scalable effects to detect locate disrupt decoy and/or deliver lethal effects against threats.

As relatively low cost systems ALE are attritable or optionally recoverable.

“Leveraging the maturity of the Coyote design we are well-positioned to offer the Army a reliable sustainable and cost-effective air-launched effects air vehicle” said Tom Laliberty vice president of Land Warfare & Air Defense at Raytheon Missiles & Defense. “Our solution’s modular open systems architecture design means it can rapidly integrate new technologies to take on advanced threats and protect aircrews in future high-end fights.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvY29taW5nLXN1Ym1hcmluZS1uZWFyLXlvdS1tZWV0LXRpbnktdG9ycGVkby0xOTI5OTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coming to a Submarine Near You: Meet the Tiny Torpedo,"Here's What You Need to Remember: In places with high ocean traffic like shipping lanes submarines launched mobile mines (SLMMs) can lie in wait and be used to restrict traffic during a conflict scenario.

Northrop Grumman just announced successful testing of their new Very Lightweight Torpedo. According to their press release “the successful testing of the torpedo nose on the first try is a testament to Northrop Grumman’s design-for-affordability approach which will significantly reduce cost without sacrificing operational performance.”

Like its predecessors the Very Lightweight Torpedo will likely be powered by the Stored Chemical Energy Propulsion System (SCEPS). The SCEPS propulsion system was first authorized for use by the Navy in 1992. SCEPS is a chemical reaction that essentially immerses a piece of lithium in a sulfur hexafluoride bath. This chemical reaction creates an enormous amount of heat which in turn generates steam for propulsion.

Light vs Heavy

One of the United States’ standard torpedoes the Mark 48 is 21 inches in diameter and weighs around 3500 pounds making it a heavy-weight. They were upgraded in 2016 by Lockheed Martin and equipped with a new propulsion system to make them quieter given better resistance to jamming and other electronic anti-torpedo countermeasures and given greater range. Despite the extensive upgrades the torpedoes aren’t getting any younger and were first introduced into U.S. Naval service in the early 1970s.

Though the VLWT’s exact specifications are not known it is based on the Navy’s previous CVLWT which is considerably smaller than the Mark 48 or any other 21-inch torpedo for that matter. At 6.5 inches in diameter is easily dwarfed by the Mark 48 in both size and weight and weighs a mere 220 or so pounds.

Full Load

Given the VLWT’s small dimensions submarines could carry a much greater weapon loadout. It’s likely that surface ships will also be equipped with the VLWT. The VLWT’s small size indicates its role may be primarily as a torpedo intercept munition rather than an offensive weapon as its low weight and warhead size would be very limited against larger vessels like aircraft carriers or enemy submarines. It could become a potent air-dropped weapon against smaller surface vessels or potentially submarines though thanks to its light weight. An anti-submarine helicopter could in theory carry nearly 16 VLWTs in place of one Mark 48 torpedo.

Given the small size VLWTs could also be used as a submarine-launched mobile mine or SLMM. SLMMs are essentially torpedoes that can be launched and propelled to remote locations. In places with high ocean traffic like shipping lanes SLMMs can lie in wait and be used to restrict traffic during a conflict scenario.

Whatever its future role the Very Lightweight Torpedo will soon be coming to a submarine near you.

OGDEN — A new leader is at the helm of Ogden’s Own distillery as the local liquor manufacturer moves to grow and expand.

Ogden’s Own most known perhaps for its Five Wives Vodka moved into a new production facility in west Ogden last year and now Steven Conlin co-founder of the firm has stepped down as president. Mark Fine a veteran of the wine and spirits industry has taken over as company president.

“We want to show what’s happening here in beautiful Ogden at the base of the Wasatch mountains” Fine said. One of his missions he said is to showcase the company’s many “messages in the bottle” and to spread the word about the distiller’s varied sometimes quirky products.

Ogden’s Own launched in 2009 has been in the midst of a transformation over the past two years or so as it has sought outside investors to aid with expansion moved into a new facility to accommodate higher production and now brought a new leader on board. Conlin 55 is retiring “and sailing the world” said Tim Smith the Ogden’s Own production manager and the other force behind the business’s creation.

Fine “brings the experience (the distillery’s board members) were looking for in a candidate” the company said in response to a Standard-Examiner query. “While the strategies are not changing Mark brings 30 years of industry experience to the job and is expected to continue Ogden’s Own Distillery growth strategy.”

Fine who came here from Miami most recently served as director of beverage at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. He has also worked for distributors importers and suppliers in the industry.

His replacement Conlin said “has a magic touch for taking beverage brands to new heights.” Fine he went on is “the perfect person to take what we’ve built to the next level.”

Among Ogden’s Own advances of late are expansion into the Nevada Michigan and Idaho markets Fine said with more on the horizon including Florida. The COVID-19 pandemic made expansion tough but the firm is “prepared to ramp up once life normalizes more” the company said.

Ogden’s Own which operates a small retail outlet has also launched several new canned products since late last year including whiskey and cola Moscow mule and huckleberry lemonade concoctions. Opening soon Fine hopes will be a new bar inside the Ogden’s Own facility though timing will depend on how quickly the company can secure the required bar license from state regulators.

When it opens — as early as November or as late as next summer perhaps — the bar will showcase Ogden’s Own products and the varied cocktails that can be made with them. In its now-unfinished state it features chandeliers mirrors and vintage furnishings and Fine is hoping it lures visitors from along the Wasatch Front. The new Ogden’s Own facility in operation since May 2020 is located at 615 W. Stockman Way.

“We will make it worth the trip to come from Salt Lake City to Ogden” Fine said. He also plans to reach out to bartenders to convert them to “brand loyalists” of Ogden’s Own.

Ogden’s Own also makes Porter’s Whiskeys Madam Pattirini Gin and more. The firm is devoted “to championing freedom of expression” and Fine called its products “a great value that over-delivers.”

NVDA,Nvidia,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA5LzA0L3doeS1udmlkaWEtc3RvY2stanVtcGVkLTE1LWluLWF1Z3VzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Nvidia Stock Jumped 15% in August,"In 2021 shares of the gaming and tech giant have returned 75%.

What happened

Nvidia (NVDA 1.27%) stock popped 14.8% in August significantly outpacing the S&P 500's 3% return according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

This robust performance can be attributed to the graphics chip specialist's release of strong second-quarter results and continued investor enthusiasm about its long-term growth potential.

Nvidia stock is having a great year. In 2021 to date (Sept. 3) the tech stock has returned 75.1% compared to the broader market's 22% return.

So what

On Aug. 18 Nvidia released fiscal second-quarter results that beat Wall Street's consensus estimates for revenue and earnings and issued fiscal third-quarter guidance for the top and bottom lines that also came in higher than analysts had been expecting.

Shares popped 15.3% in the three days following the release while the broader market was up 1.8% during this period. Shares continued to move upward throughout the rest of the month.

In its fiscal second quarter Nvidia's revenue surged 68% year over year to $6.51 billion topping its guidance of $6.30 billion and the analyst consensus estimate of $6.33 billion. All four platforms posted at least double-digit year-over-year growth with the two largest platforms gaming and data center growing revenue by 85% and 35% respectively.

Nvidia's results also got a boost from sales of its cryptocurrency mining processor launched earlier this year. CMP sales were $266 million or about 4.1% of the company's total quarterly revenue.

Adjusted for one-time items earnings per share (EPS) soared 89% to $1.04 surpassing the $1.02 the Street had been expecting.

Now what

For fiscal Q3 management projects revenue of $6.80 billion representing growth of 44% year over year. It also guided (albeit indirectly by providing a bunch of inputs) for adjusted EPS of $1.10 or growth of 51%.

I'll reiterate what I said in my earnings article: Nvidia stock is one of the best growth stocks in the market today in my view.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3RoZS1wYXJ0eS1pcy1vdmVyLW52aWRpYS1ncHUtcHJpY2VzLWFscmVhZHktdXAtMTgtaW4tY2hpbmVzZS1tYXJrZXRzLWFzLWV0aC1jcm9zc2VzLTM5MDAv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vdGhlLXBhcnR5LWlzLW92ZXItbnZpZGlhLWdwdS1wcmljZXMtYWxyZWFkeS11cC0xOC1pbi1jaGluZXNlLW1hcmtldHMtYXMtZXRoLWNyb3NzZXMtMzkwMC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Party Is Over: NVIDIA GPU Prices Already Up 18% In Chinese Markets As ETH Crosses $3900,"A story from MyDrivers (via Videocardz) shows us that the GPU party is over for now and prices will almost certainly start creeping back up again. GPU prices have reached an all-time low back in July and everything seemed to be recovering but it looks like the second rally of Ethereum has started and shows no signs of slowing down: which has historically spelled disaster for GPU prices.

I tweeted back in August that the GPU party is over as far as I can see and will no longer advise people to wait before buying. It was clear almost a month ago that the forecasted trend was going up again and it has materialized almost to a tee in September 2021. ETH has crossed $3900 and with it the wider cryptocurrency market has gone up again and profitability has almost doubled since early August.

Videocardz also compiled the data from MyDrivers and we can see that prices for the RTX 3070 Ti are already up by 18% and climbing. This is something that the last report from 3DCenter also reflects and we can see the upwards trend visible in the graphic at the top of the article.

No change but nearly all mid to high-end cards are out of stock

Upstream raw wafer foundries like Shin Etsu and Global Wafers are running at 100% capacity (and this is not something they can easily improve upon). With NVIDIA set to return to TSMC as well we are existing in what is essentially a huge zero-sum game with no hope of capacity improvements till the end of 2022. Although ETH will shift to ETH 2.0 sometime later this year which will do away with GPU mining on that particular coin there are still altcoins that you can mine on a GPU and even NVIDIA's LHR series has been unlocked for more than 70% of its non-LHR hash rate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbC1jZW8tcGF0LWdlbHNpbmdlci1zYXlzLWdlZWstaXMtYmFjay1pbnRlbC1ncHVzLXdpbGwtcHV0LXByZXNzdXJlLW9uLW52aWRpYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says 'geek is back' Intel GPUs will put pressure on NVIDIA,"Intel CEO says it will respond to AMD with better products and put pressure on NVIDIA graphics

During an interview with Pierre Ferragu Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and CFO George Davis responded to various questions on the current market situation in which Intel has found itself right now.

While a large number of questions from Pierre was about Pat Gelsinger’s background and what he had learned from working as a CEO for VMWare there were also questions about AMD and NVIDIA and how is Intel planning to compete with both companies on CPU and GPU fronts.

Since Pat Gelsinger took over the seat of Chief Executing Officer at Intel the company had laid out its plans for the next few years including fabrication node roadmaps upcoming products for client and server and also Intel’s grand (re)entry into the discrete gaming GPU market.

Intel will be competing with AMD and NVIDIA in the HPC market with its next-generation Xeon Scalable products but also with its Ponte Vecchio and Xe-HP Arctic Sound GPUs. The company plans to be very competitive in the next 3 to 4 years with a goal to sustain leadership.

Pierre Ferragu (PF): How do you make sure Intel remains central and the number one client in the cloud. Pat Gelsinger (PG): We just say about the AMD threat you know we got to do better products period! So we gonna build better products and they had a period we haven’t executed well. We’re gonna execute execute execute! And with that we see that we are coming into a period where we are going to be very competitive. So we were in a period where we were behind. Now with Ice Lake Sapphire Rapids Diamond Rapids we are in a period where we are going to be very competitive and as we get out to 3 -4 years from now we see that we will be in sustained leadership again. So we are coming into a period where we are going to be much more competitive and with products that you know are much more competitive more pricing dynamics better market share potential better TCO values for the cloud guys so we just gotta compete.

Pat also said that Intel will be competitive with NVIDIA in the GPU architecture market and will for the first time ever be able to put pressure on NVIDIA. With the recent announcement of Intel XeSS supersampling technology and its multi-year plans for Xe-HPG architecture Intel will have not only have to compete with NVIDIA but also AMD who will be releasing its first MCM GPUs with Radeon 7000 series later next year.

PF:- Will there be a Zen moment for Intel? PG: We have a number of things going on over here[…] We are rolling out the heterogenous architecture that is part of Alder Lake where we have big and little cores you know AMD only has one. We’ll have a higher performance and a more energy-efficient version of the core pretty compelling we’ll lay out our major vector enhancement stuff we have our GPU architecture where we are gonna start being in a position to really put pressure on NVIDIA for the first time ever. And we are laying out our IPU architecture when we get to our smart NICs and smart networking fabrics so three major architectural announcements this week that we think are pretty Zen-like. And trust me we have a few that are still cooking back in the labs that we are going to look forward to talking to people about that we think are a pretty dramatic step forward and well beyond anything that was talked about yet and some that might not be talked about for a couple of years but innovation you know the geek is back.

Looking at the datasheet there appear to be three main parts with i.MX RT595 (DSP + GPU + 5MB SRAM) i.MX RT555 (GPU 5MB SRAM but no DSP) and i.MX RT533 (3MB SRAM no DSP no GPU).

NXP i.MX RT500 series microcontrollers are supported by the MCUXpresso SDK with LVGL open-source graphics library and AI libraries are also provided with “eIQ Inference with TensorFlow Lite Micro” and the Voice Intelligent Technology (VIT) library for voice UI enablement with always-on voice detection and local commands. As we’ll see below NXP i.MX RT500 MCU can also run FreeRTOS and several other commercial solutions are offered.

NXP has designed one development kit based on NXP i.MX RT595 crossover MCU with the MIMXRT595-EVK allowing developers to evaluate storage display and audio features of the new processor optionally using Arduino shields a 5.5-inch 1280×720 LCD display with touch-sensitive overlay or a 1.2-inch circular touchscreen display with 390×390 resolution.

We can watch the evaluation kit fitted with the circular display in action below. The demo shows a user interface (Wearable UX) based on Crank Software’s Storyboard graphical toolkit with the device running FreeRTOS open-source real-time operating system and it’s pretty smooth for a 200 MHz device.

The first time I heard about the new NXP i.MX RT500 crossover MCU was from a press release from Microej that claims that “thanks to smart power savings core functionalities smartwatches can now expect to achieve up to 40 days of autonomy on a standard battery”.

The announcement goes on to explain this is achieved by MICROEJ VEE’s platform with three optimization methods:

Reduced active power with six different power modes that automatically adjust power consumption to save battery life (FULL HIGH LOW SLEEP SUSPEND and OFF). Power consumption is further reduces by automatic voltage adjustments and optimal RAM allocations.

Power consumption is further reduces by automatic voltage adjustments and optimal RAM allocations. Reduced processing time by scheduling multitasking and synchronizing of timers and all the generic library stacks (UI IoT etc.) have been re-designed to leverage the hardware execution units of the NXP i.MX RT500 MCU.

Reduced standby power thanks to the built-in low-power modes of the new crossover MCU and automatically reducing voltage while in the SUSPEND power state.

If you are interested in power management in NXP i.MX RT500 Alejandra Guzmán System Engineer at NXP Semiconductors has written a detailed article about the topic on All About Circuits.

NXP i.MX RT500 cross MCU has “limited availability” according to NXP and indeed none of the distributors have stock with a typical lead time of 52 weeks (welcome to 2021!). MIMXRT595-EVK evaluation kit is sold for $129 and there are currently 16 units in stock.

The University of Richmond soccer team suffered a 3-1 loss to the Old Dominion Monarchs Sunday evening at the ODU Soccer Complex. The Spiders gave up two goals in the first half and played to a tie over the final 45 minutes.(Sea Girt N.J.) responded with her first goal of the season in the 59minute to cut into the Monarch's lead. Richmond falls to 1-4 on the season while ODU improves to 3-2.""Old Dominion is one of the best teams we played this fall and in the first half we didn't connect well offensively and gave them too much space defensively."" Head coachsaid ""However I'm really proud of how our players responded in the second half. We were so much better both offensively and defensively and went toe-to-toe with them. The biggest challenge we have right now is putting together a complete game. That's our goal as we return to President's Field Thursday afternoon against High Point.""Richmond was outshot by the Monarchs 16-5 Sunday night with one of Richmond's five shots on frame. The teams were even on corners at four each while Old Dominion was called for 15 fouls compared to the Spiders 14.(Tipp City Ohio) played the full 90 minutes in net picking up five saves in the loss.Wierman was one of five Spiders with a shot in during the match.(Magnolia Del.)(Blacksburg Va.)(Bernardsville N.J.) and(Shaker Heights Ohio) all had a shot in the contest.Old Dominion scored a pair of first half goals before extending its lead to 3-0 in the 58minute. Richmond responded just a minute later. The Old Dominion defense played a pass back towards its own net without a lot of force. Wierman made a run at it getting there a step before the keeper. She regained possession of the loose ball in front of the net and sent a shot in on the empty frame right before a Monarch brought her down with a slide tackle to cut the lead to 3-1.The Spiders open a two-game homestand this Thursday when they host the High Point Panthers at 6 p.m. followed by a home match with the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers Sunday afternoon.-- UR --",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hemRlc2VydHN3YXJtLmNvbS9mb290YmFsbC8yMDIxLzkvNC8yMjY1NjkzOS9hcml6b25hLXdpbGRjYXRzLWNvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwtbG9zaW5nLXN0cmVhay1ieXUtbW9ucm9lLW9sZC1kb21pbmlvbi11bWFzcy1yaWNocm9kLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arizona now tied for longest active losing streak entering BYU game,"Thanks to the Kansas Jayhwawks Arizona now owns the distinction of having the longest active losing streak in FBS.

Kansas scored a late touchdown to hold off South Dakota at home on Friday night snapping a 13-game skid in the debut of new coach Lance Leipold. That leaves the Wildcats with a 12-game losing streak atop that infamous list.

Misery loves company though and the UA is not alone as losers of 12 in a row. Old Dominion which lost 42-10 at Wake Forest on Friday has also dropped 12 straight and that skid extends back farther than Arizona’s since the Monarchs opted out of the 2020 season.

And on Saturday Louisiana-Monroe where former UA coach Rich Rodriguez is the offensive coordinator and his son Rhett Rodriguez started at quarterback lost 45-10 at Kentucky to join the 12-losses-in-row-club while Massachusetts took an 11-game skid into its game at Pittsburgh.

At rebuilding South Carolina a recently hired graduate assistant will be the Gamecocks' starting quarterback in Saturday's season opener against Eastern Illinois the school announced this week.

Zeb Noland played quarterback at Iowa State and South Dakota State starting seven games last season for the Football Championship Subdivision powerhouse before joining the South Carolina staff in May under first-year coach Shane Beamer.

The son of a successful high school coach in Watkinsville Georgia Noland was set to begin his own transition into the profession as an assistant working under South Carolina wide receivers coach Justin Stepp.

""He’s always just loved the schematics of the game"" said Noland's father Travis the head coach at Oconee County High School. ""I saw that this was something he wanted to do for a long time.""

His unexpected move onto and then up the depth chart says something about the Gamecocks who are expected to join Vanderbilt in bringing up the rear in the SEC and reflects the strange landscape of roster management influenced by the coronavirus pandemic. Noland will be able to play in 2021 after the NCAA granted all players impacted by COVID-19 an added season of eligibility.

The unexpected return to the position also represents the final twist in a college career defined by multiple stops where Noland came close but never quite captured the opportunity for consistent playing time and success.

""For Zeb if you knew him he never intended for this to be a good story he was just trying to help"" said Travis Noland. ""When they were serious about needing the help he was like ‘Yeah I’ll do it.’ He never anticipated it being a big story I don’t think.""

REALLY LONG LAYOFF:Old Dominion football's long strange trip through pandemic season yielded silver lining

WINNERS LOSERS:Ohio State N.C. State and Josh Heupel make splash

COLLEGE PREDICTIONS:Who wins the national title? The Heisman? Experts make their picks

The path to the Gamecocks' starting lineup was made available after projected starter Luke Doty injured his left foot earlier in preseason camp. The injury which is not expected to keep Doty out for the season led Beamer to move Noland onto the roster and into competition with redshirt senior Jason Brown a transfer from Saint Francis University an FCS program in Loretto Pennsylvania.

Brown who threw for 28 touchdowns against only six interceptions in 18 career appearances will be the backup in the Gamecocks' opener. Both players are expected to move down the depth chart — and Noland potentially back into his graduate assistant role — once Doty does return.

""It wasn’t like he walked in that huddle the very first day of practice and was overwhelmed and didn’t know what to do"" Beamer said.

This poise may be attributed to stints at two successful programs — Iowa State is No. 8 in the USA TODAY Sports AFCA Coaches Poll and NDSU has won eight FCS national championships since 2011 — spent largely as the backup to two accomplished college quarterbacks: Brock Purdy the Cyclones' multiple-year starter and former NDSU starter Trey Lance a rookie for the San Francisco 49ers.

Noland was the Bison's starting quarterback for the first seven games of the 2020-21 season which was held this past spring before being replaced for the final three games of the year. As the starter Noland completed 51% of his throws with five touchdowns and six interceptions.

""I think he felt a lot of pressure there to be maybe more than what he was"" Travis Noland said. ""I think he had a little bit of bitterness not toward anything that happened just that it ended the way it ended. I guess he just felt like it didn’t end the way he wanted it to I guess would be a better way of saying it. But that’s the way it ends for everybody you know?

""But he was in a tough situation at North Dakota State following Trey Lance and nothing Zeb ever did would’ve compared to what Trey Lance was able to do because they’re two totally different kinds of players. So he was always under the ‘what he couldn’t do’ rather than ‘what he could do’ kind of pressure. And that’s hard for anybody.""

He also started one game as a redshirt freshman at ISU in 2017 throwing for 180 yards and two scores to lead the Cyclones past Baylor 20-13 and secure the program's first winning season in conference play since 2000. Noland began the 2018 season as the backup but was moved into the lineup due to injury eventually starting another four games before being replaced by Purdy then a true freshman. Noland transferred to NDSU in late October of 2018 in search of consistent playing time.

""As a dad I’m thankful he had those struggles because it’s a rough world we live in"" Travis Noland said. ""There’s a lot of people that never experience what he’s had to experience with the setbacks and the criticism and all those things.

Soaring demand for semiconductors means the auto industry could struggle to source enough of them throughout next year and into 2023 though the shortage should be less severe by then Daimler CEO Ola Kallenius said.

""Several chip suppliers have been referring to structural problems with demand"" Kallenius said. ""This could influence 2022 and [the situation] may be more relaxed in 2023.""

BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said he expects supply chains to remain tight well into 2022. ""I expect that the general tightness of the supply chains will continue in the next six to 12 months"" he said.

Zipse said he saw no issues in the long-term adding that the automotive industry was an attractive client for chipmakers.

Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess said shortages will continue for the next months or even years because semiconductors are in high demand.

""The internet of things is growing and the capacity ramp-up will take time. It will be probably a bottleneck for the next months and years to come"" he said.

VW purchasing chief Murat Aksel said semiconductor supply remains very volatile and tight in the third quarter. ""We hope for a gradual recovery by the end of the year"" he said..

The auto industry worldwide would need roughly 10 percent more production capacity for chips Aksel said.

Renault CEO Luca de Meo said the situation regarding the shortage was tougher than expected during the current quarter.

He said the next quarter should bring some improvement despite a poor visibility.

Renault was sticking to its previous forecast for a cut to production of 200000 cars in 2021 due to the shortage de Meo said.

Automakers forced by the COVID-19 pandemic to shut down plants last year face stiff competition from the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip deliveries which have been upended by a series of supply chain disruptions.

Cars have become increasingly dependent on chips -- for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to advanced driver assistance features such as emergency braking.

Daimler recently cut its annual sales forecast for its car division projecting deliveries will be roughly in line with 2020 rather than up significantly.

Daimler's Mercedes-Benz brand has been hit this quarter by factory shutdowns in Malaysia which in recent years emerged as a major center for chip testing and packaging.

Infineon Technologies NXP Semiconductors and STMicroelectronics are among the key suppliers operating plants in the country.

Kallenius said Daimler hopes its own supply of semiconductors will improve in the fourth quarter.

There are a few established approaches on how data should be modelled for consumption by different types of users and systems. But there is no arguing that technology has changed massively in 40 years and the last 5–10 years in the data space have been particularly significant. Are those approaches still applicable today?

Screenshot from Codd’s paper

A little bit more on history

Dr. E. F. Codd published the paper “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” in June 1970. Codd’s model is now accepted as the definitive model for relational database management systems (RDBMS). The language Structured English Query Language (SEQUEL) was developed by IBM Corporation Inc. to use Codd’s model. SEQUEL later became SQL. In 1979 Relational Software Inc. (now Oracle) introduced the first commercially available implementation of SQL. Today SQL is accepted as the standard RDBMS language.

A few things happened after that as you can expect.

In the 1990s two major books on data warehousing were published - one by Bill Inmon 1992 and another by Ralph Kimball 1996. In data warehouse modelling they became two well-known competing options for modelling the layer where the data are stored. Either you model according to Ralph Kimball with the facts tables and conformed dimensions (as a Star schema) or you model according to Bill Inmon with the database normalised.

In 2000 Dan Linstedt released the Data vault modelling as an alternative to Inmon and Kimball to provide long-term historical storage of data coming in from multiple operational systems with emphasis on tracing auditing and resilience to change of the source data model. The data vault model actually provides a “graph based” model with hubs and relationships in a relational database world.

In the 2010s Apache Hadoop and the ecosystem around it was developed and became popular. Those technologies were very different to relational databases even though some of them allowed to query the data using SQL. Schema-on-read allowed loading data as-is for querying later — so no upfront data modelling was required. When data was processed for later usage the approach was to “join everything together” into a wide denormalised file. Data storage was not an issue anymore but “data joins” were very computationally expensive.

It is 2021 and a new type of data technologies is keep growing in adoption in particular cloud-native columnar data warehouses with MPP (massively parallel processing) architecture like Snowflake Amazon Redshift or Google Big Query.

Does it make sense to model the data using approaches from the 1990s? Should new data or analytics engineers invest time in learning them today?

Data Vault vs Traditional vs Flatten that Crap Out

I came across this video recently where a panel of data professionals discussed these questions.

It is a long and interesting discussion and here is my summary if you choose not to watch it.

Ultimately there is no single answer — different use cases and workloads require different approaches. Traditional approaches are called traditional for a reason — they are time tested and they work. And sometimes there is a space for all those approaches within the single architecture.

Any solution should be purpose-built and here are some commonly chosen options (just some examples):

Ad-hoc analytics — Star schema (Kimball)

Data science — Flat tables

Enterprise data warehouse with tracing and auditing requirements —Data vault

Operational databases— Third normal form (3NF)

Horsepower provided by modern data stack can overcome many design deficiencies and queries can perform well even when there is less than optimal modelling choice. However apart from the query speed there is also maintenance cost or so called technical debt and this cost can be unnecessarily high if the suboptimal technique is used.

In fact when we talk about speed we should consider several different things:

speed or performance of queries

speed of delivery

speed of change (in other words agility or how quickly we can respond to change in the requirements within our data model)

Modern data tools utilising cloud elasticity combined with good development practices like automated data quality testing and CI/CD (which I wrote about here) allow us to be much more agile in our development process and iterate on requirements as they come up. When the speed of delivery and change is fast you can start simple and focus on delivering business value first and improve as you go. Alternatively some data models are designed to be resilient to change (data vault) and that can be a better approach in certain scenarios.

Another significant consideration is data management. When we look at the data we need to know what it is where it came from and how it holds together. Good data models help with that but so do tools that help keep track of data lineage data quality data dictionaries etc. It is very easy to end up with a huge data mess if the data is poorly modelled and badly documented.

Final thoughts

I am a data engineer and my typical use cases are ad-hoc analytics BI and data science. I like to think about the data I work with as of facts and dimensions (even when it’s flat) and prefer to model the data in a Kimball-like style when it makes sense. I find star schema easy to reason about and business users usually like it too. Do I always physically model the data this way these days? No.

If requirements allow data model can be “logical” rather than physical and can be changed when requirements change. In some cases it is possible to skip up-front modelling altogether or model as little as needed. I must emphasise here it works when the speed of delivery and the speed of change is fast and when data management is in place. And of course the assumption is that original data is available in the data warehouse in its raw form so final models can always be rebuilt what is a common practice today when data storage is not a concern and is usually referred to as ELT (extract — load — transform).

For example in the past I had to be very careful when adding columns and choosing data types for my multi-billion rows fact tables in MS SQL Server as 4 bytes saved per record when choosing int over bigint meant 10–20 gb saved overall— that was significant for a mid-range on-premise server 10 years ago. Today I can save json logs directly into the blob storage read them in Snowflake’s SQL view straight away with schema-on-read and then build a dashboard on top of it — all of that in a matter of days without any upfront thinking of the schemas or data types. And then within days it can be redesigned into a star schema with referential integrity — when it becomes valuable.

What is the answer?

So does it make sense to model the data using approaches from the 1990s?

You don’t have to be dogmatic about Kimball’s approach or any other approach mentioned here but it is often helpful to be aware of classic design patterns and common pitfalls especially when you try to solve some tricky design challenge with no obvious answer. Data modelling is around for 40+ years — so most likely there is an answer to that tricky question already.

Where do I learn more?

If you want to read Kimball’s “The Data Warehouse Toolkit” today I highly recommend this article (and other data modelling resources on holistics.io) that explains which chapters are still relevant and which you can safely skip.

I have no practical experience with data vault (it seems to be better suited for enterprise data integration) but I found this review interesting if you want to learn more.",,,,,,

In his latest interview the young producer admits that a theatrical release would have been ideal. That said he suggests that he just can't help it in the prevailing situation.

A lot of people have been shocked by your decision to skip a theatrical release. What went into the decision to release on OTT?

We had no choice. The film completed its production works in December 2020. We waited for several months before and after the second wave-induced lockdown. As recently as in August we were mooting a theatrical release. At a time when theatres are not running at full capacity and the exhibition sector is not doing well in large parts of the domestic and overseas market we decided to skip the theatres altogether.

Your decision has antagonized theatre owners.

We have not hurt anybody. It's natural for creators of content to wish for a theatrical release. That said 'Tuck Jagadish' will reach the family audience at the comfort of their homes for Vinayaka Chavithi. While 'Uppena' and 'Jathi Ratnalu' did extremely well this year in theatres during the pandemic 'Vakeel Saab' had to be removed from theatres after the second wave hit the country.

You are highlighting the fact that 'Tuck Jagadish' is a family movie.

Yes. There is comedy in it but before everything it's a family drama. The emotions are there throughout. There are a lot of relationships in the story. Director Shiva Nirvana's biggest strength lies in handling emotional subjects. And actor Nani is known for pulling off performance-oriented roles. He was our natural choice. I must say that 'TJ' is driven by its emotional content. Its run-time is 140 minutes.

Thaman has composed the songs. But why did you choose Gopi Sundar for the BGM?

Director Nirvana has previously worked with Gopi Sundar on two movies. Given the nature of the subject he preferred to pick the music director for the background score.

What about your upcoming movies?

We have a movie lined up with actor Naga Chaitanya. The name of the director will be announced soon. We will be producing Nandamuri Balakrishna garu's movie with director Anil Ravipudi. As for Vijay Deverakonda's movie it has been put on hold for now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vcXV3YS5vcmcvcXV3YS1wcmVtaXVtLWV4Y2VycHQvcGFraXN0YW4tbmF2eS1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWFubm91bmNlcy1uZXh0LWdlbi1scm1wYS1wcm9ncmFtLTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pakistan Navy Officially Announces Next-Gen LRMPA Program,"On 02 September 2021 the Pakistan Navy (PN) announced that it will procure three long-range maritime patrol aircraft (LRMPA) based on the Embraer Lineage 1000E. According to the PN’s press release on social media the LRMPAs will have “the latest weapons and sensors to undertake Maritime Air Operations.”

The PN’s announcement confirms earlier news reports about Pakistan contracting Paramount Group and Leonardo to overhaul and convert the aircraft respectively. Reportedly designated “Sea Sultan” Pakistan intends to acquire a total of 10 aircraft to gradually replace its Lockheed P-3C Orion LRMPAs. The PN did not disclose the duration of the procurement timeline though 10-12 years could be plausible.

The PN announced its plans to acquire a new jet-powered LRMPA in 2018. The Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) at the time Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi said that the PN was open to acquiring new aircraft from any source including the United States if possible thus hinting at an interest in the Boeing P-8 Poseidon.

However Pakistan’s tenuous defence ties with the U.S. and the high cost of the P-8 had basically left the PN with one realistic option for its LRMPA requirements: pursuing an original project. Prior to the start of the Sea Sultan program the closest analogous alternative to the P-8 was Saab’s Swordfish MPA concept.

The Saab Swordfish combines the Bombardier Global 6000 business jet with several commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) subsystems from Saab Leonardo FLIR Systems and other vendors.

Though not as large as the P-8 Saab said the Swordfish would cost two-thirds as much as the P-8 to acquire and half as much to maintain in through-life. But the lower costs come at the expense of less payload and range compared to the P-8. Clearly the countries that could acquire the P-8 ultimately opted for it – or in Japan’s case developed a closely comparable design (i.e. the Kawasaki P-1).

The PN chose to acquire an original project similar to the Swordfish in terms of COTS subsystems but with the ATR-72-based Sea Eagle maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) as the template. However the PN opted for a larger aircraft in the form of the Lineage 1000E. In fact based on its original tender from 2020 the PN was specifically seeking this particular aircraft it was not interested in the Global 6000 or other platforms…

(NASDAQ:EEFT) recently revealed that it has completed the integration of the PayPal QR Code in their point-of-sale (POS) solution.

The new solution is now live in Germany and will be offered in other markets in the foreseeable future according to a release. With this option the full-service payment provider will be extending its portfolio of mobile payment methods for brick-and-mortar retailers. It will give retail partners access to a potential client base of around 29.1 million active PayPal clients residing in Germany and 400 million+ active customers globally.

Retailers who have added epay’s checkout integration software are able to use PayPal’s QR Code at the point of sale alongside various other payment options via a single source. The epay service reduces the overall complexity that retailers have to deal with when providing multiple payment options at the point of sale. Retailers are able to respond effectively to changing client requirements in payment methods.

Jörg Kablitz MD PayPal Germany Austria and Switzerland stated:

“We are more than happy to collaborate with epay in Germany enabling merchants to easily expand their point-of-sale solutions with our new PayPal QR Code. The expectation of customers to pay the way they prefer has increased – online and in person. Together with epay we help merchants offering their customers a wider choice of payment options at the point of sale by integrating the contactless PayPal QR Code.”

Stephan Heintz Director DACH epay remarked:

“We have great faith in the success of QR code and barcode-based payment methods as they are very convenient and secure for consumers. The PayPal partnership is an important step for us. It helps us expand our payment diversity and positions epay as an aggregator and concentrator of all payment types as well as a provider of value-added services of today and tomorrow for retailers.”

If clients want to make payments with PayPal then they can open the QR code in the PayPal app on their mobile phone and present it for scanning purposes. The cashier then proceeds to scan the code and the amount to be paid is displayed via the app.

Next clients choose their preferred payment option stored in their PayPal account – for instance bank account or credit card – and confirm the payment on their phone. Customer and cashier then receive a confirmation of the transaction.

Retail partners who may be interested in finding out more about the PayPal QR Code may check here.

As mentioned in the release epay is a full-service payment provider for handling payment processing and prepaid services that processed 2.4 billion transactions last year.

The firm has built up “an extensive network of retailers with 748000 point-of-sale terminals in 60 countries to connect renowned brands with consumers all around the world.” The company offers “a portfolio of gift cards (prepaid closed loop and digital media) business incentives and payment solutions (card acceptance terminals e-commerce mobile and Internet of Payment) for omnichannel commerce and offers its services thanks to its proprietary cash register integration software.”

Of course this is all part of a tried-and-tested tactic used by scammers to convince victims into handing over personal information. Revealing the threat Action Fraud said: ""Watch out for this Asda gift card scam. Action Fraud has received 159 reports within 48 hours about fake emails purporting to be from Asda.

""The emails state that the recipient can win a '£100 promo reward gift card' by completing a marketing survey. The links provided in the emails lead to phishing websites that are designed to steal your personal information.""

To help people falling for this - and similar scams - Action Fraud advised: ""Your bank or any other official organisation won't ask to share personal information over email or text. If you need to check that it's a genuine message call them directly.""

Elsewhere Action Fraud has also warned Gmail and Outlook users about another scam email that is being circulated. This time around it's a bogus PayPal message with the recipient allegedly locked out of their account.

Dozens of eager ABBA fans have taken to social media to report issues securing pre-sale tickets to their new residency.

Pre-sale tickets for the ‘revolutionary’ Voyage concert residency which will take place in a purpose built arena in Stratford from next Spring went on sale at 10am this morning Sunday September 5 for those who pre-ordered the band’s new album Voyage.

One Twitter user wrote: “Once again a Ticketmaster shambles with the #ABBAVoyage tickets.

“At one point I had (out of desperation) the most expensive tickets on the opening night only for it to fail during the PayPal part. How does this happen?”

Writer and YouTuber Lex Croucher tweeted: ABBA tickets are a f****** nightmare. @TicketmasterUK sort your LIVES out.

“It lets you reserve tickets with the usual few minutes to check out you check out and then you’re told the tickets don’t exist rinse & repeat for the last hour.”

Another joked: “In the end maybe the real Voyage was the time you spent on Ticketmaster?”

Ticketmaster’s UK account posted an apology for the issues.

It said: “We are super busy this morning sorry to hear that you are experiencing issues for the ABBA Voyage onsale this morning! There’s plenty of availability for this event so please keep trying. Thanks!”

Ticketmaster’s customer service Twitter account also reported that its support teams were “incredibly busy”.

We're testing a new site: This content is coming soon

A tweet posted seven minutes after the tickets went on sale read: “Our Fan Support teams are incredibly busy at the moment but we’ll be in touch with you if your event has been affected.”

Other users have been complaining of “weird error messages” popping up and being forced back into a queue with thousands of other desperate fans.

The Voyage residency won’t see the four-piece unite in person with original members Bjorn Benny Agnetha and Anni-Frid instead appearing via digital avatars to perform.

Last week the iconic pop group surprised fans by dropping not one but two new songs.

They also announced the residency alongside a new album also entitled Voyage which will be released on November 5.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFscGhyLmNvbS9kb25hdGUtYml0cy10d2l0Y2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How To Donate Bits on Twitch,"If you’re new to Twitch you may have seen mention of bits and donations while watching streams. Bits are a virtual currency used within Twitch to show appreciation for a streamer’s work.

You Cheer Bits on Twitch to those you like to watch or who entertained you in a meaningful way inspiring you to give micro-donations in the form of bits. Donations are similar but the mechanics behind them are a little different.

Bits are an internal currency in Twitch. You buy them for real money and you can tip a particular streamer a given amount of Bits as a way to appreciate their stream. Tipping is called Cheering in Twitch when you use Bits.

When you Cheer you donate a set amount of Bits. Donations are referred to as tips but they are viewed and work differently by streamers and users.

How to Donate Bits on Twitch

To donate Bits you first need to buy the Bits. Then you can donate them as you see fit. Here’s how you buy Bits on Twitch:

Log in to Twitch and go to a channel. Select Get Bits in the top right of the stream. You can also click the Bits icon within the Send Message box. Then click on Buy and select the amount you want to buy and pay for them. Wait a few seconds for your inventory to be updated.

Once your Bits arrive in your account you can Cheer for streamers however and wherever you like in Twitch.

To donate type ‘cheer250 Loving your work’ or words to that effect. There is a countdown timer to allow for typos so if you type ‘cheer2500’ instead of ‘cheer250’ you have five seconds to change your mind. Once the Cheer is complete the transaction also completes and becomes irreversible.

This process works similarly across desktop machines and on mobile devices. Buying Bits is slightly different on mobile but using them is the same as you would on your laptop or desktop computer.

The more you donate the more of a discount you get on your bits as you can see in the photo. Your badge on the streamers’ chat shows how many bits you’ve given the streamer.

All about Bits

Buying Bits is roughly 1 Bit per 1c. Once you Cheer the streamer the transaction is irreversible. The streamer gets the Bits as they are donated but the streamer has to accumulate $100 worth in order to withdraw them. Beginner streamers or those still working on a following will need to wait a while before getting paid. More popular streamers will not have to wait so long. Twitch also takes a cut of between 25-30% to help with the cost of running the site.

If you donate Bits you get emotes as a reward. They are payable when you cheer with 1 100 1000 5000 and 10000 Bits and come in various shapes and sizes. The more you Cheer the better the emote. You also earn Cheer Chat Badges which shows other users on that channel that you’re a supporter.

Cheering using Bits is more emotive than donating or subscribing. People usually Cheer when the streamer gets a kill says something amusing or clever or when they win the match. These are reactive spends and are useful to use when you feel the streamer has done something particularly cool.

All about Donations

Donations in Twitch work slightly differently. Instead of buying bits you tip by using your credit card directly. You tip via PayPal directly to the streamer so Twitch doesn’t take a cut and the streamer gets all the money. It appears as a message in the stream but doesn’t qualify for the emotes or badges.

Tipping is the preferred method of tipping for many Twitch streamers because the Twitcher gets the entire donation. Twitch does not take a cut of tips as it is a transaction between you and the streamer. They are also more unpredictable and force streamers to keep on their A-game for the entire stream. However as tips use PayPal they can use chargeback. This is where payment is made through PayPal and the payee decides to reverse it for whatever reason. This is a downside for tips.

As donations are not as quick to make as a Cheer they tend to be less emotive or reactive. These tend to be more measured rewards that you give to a streamer for being entertaining or for being consistently useful informative or amusing.

Subscribing on Twitch

There is a third way to show your appreciation on Twitch and that is subscribing. Using Twitch Prime you can subscribe to a particular channel for a month at a time and the streamer gets a cut of that. In return for a monthly fee of $4.99 you can follow one channel for one month. You can also buy subscriptions in bulk for 3-month or 6-month tiers.

In return you get some unique emotes and badges and access to exclusive chatrooms or events. There are also some ad-free experiences available depending on the stream. Different streams offer different benefits so check before you subscribe.

Donating Bits

It is important to donate Bits on Twitch when a streamer entertains you. It is what drives these people to work hard on your behalf and their only reward for perhaps hours of effort. This feedback loop of performance and reward is what makes Twitch great so support it as much as you can!

Four PET bottle recycling machines have become new highlights at Shanghai Disneyland raising awareness of the environment.

The machines in partnership with beverage makers Kang Shifu and PepsiCo were installed in Treasure Cove Tomorrowland Fantasyland and Gardens of Imagination as part of Shanghai Disney Resort's brand new youth program ""Disney Green Experience – Sort & Recycle Adventure.""

Themed to each land the recycling machines provide people with a convenient way to return used containers for while still being immersed in the park. Students will be invited to learn how to use the machines as well taught the importance of recycling.

According to a newly-released report China's consumption of PET bottles dramatically increased from 6.33 million tons in 2016 to 9.49 million tons in 2020. What's more in 2019 China produced 10.44 million tons of PET bottles.

The domestic PET recycle market is relatively negative.

From 2016 to 2020 the market has seen a constant decline in business start-ups from 50 percent to 33 percent according to the report co-released by Cailian Press and Frost & Sullivan.



Wang Chenhui managing director of Frost & Sullivan China said the biggest challenge for China to promote PET recycling is to raise people's awareness.

Currently China's public environmental protection education is not well-established and thus it needs governments businesses and institutes to work together.

According to the resort it is committed to promoting environmental protection and awareness within the local community encouraging everyone to take small steps that can lead to a positive impact on our planet.

Therefore it has designed a new program aiming to immerse young students in fun and engaging activities at Shanghai Disneyland. It will raise their awareness of environmental protection and inspire them to think and act with a conservation mindset to protect the planet together.

Young students will participate in a number of engaging experiences.

A visit to Fantasyland's Tangled Tree Tavern will allow them to see food waste sorting practices at the resort. A meeting with artistic custodial cast members will allow them to see how memorable pieces of art are created using water and recyclable materials collected from around the park including leaves and flower petals.

The program will open booking this autumn for children aged between 7 and 11.",,,,,,,,,

The U.S. will likely start to widely distribute Pfizer Covid-19 booster shots during the week of Sept. 20 but the rollout for Moderna 's vaccine could be delayed White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday. The Biden administration has announced plans to offer third doses to people who received the Pfizer and Moderna shots pending approval from public health officials. The U.S. recommends an additional shot eight months after the second dose. Only the Pfizer vaccine booster may get Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approval in time for a rollout the week of Sept. 20 Fauci said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" People who received Moderna shots may have to hold off for longer as the company waits for regulators to sign off on a third dose.

""Looks like Pfizer has their data in likely would meet the deadline"" the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told CBS. ""We hope that Moderna would also be able to do it so we could do it simultaneously."" ""But if not we'll do it sequentially"" he continued. ""So the bottom line is very likely at least part of the plan will be implemented but ultimately the entire plan will be.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA5LzA0L2F0LWxlc3MtdGhhbi01MC1jb3VsZC1wZml6ZXItcmVhY2gtMTAwLWJlZm9yZS0yMDI1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At Less Than $50 Could Pfizer Reach $100 Before 2025?,"The reason it's a long shot might surprise you.

Pfizer (PFE -0.60%) is one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies and as you may have heard it makes one of the most widely distributed coronavirus vaccines. Right now its stock price is around $47 and it hasn't beaten the market consistently over the last five years. But all that might change now that it's in the limelight and selling vaccine doses like wildfire.

Could it be possible for Pfizer to ride its newfound fame into a share price near $100 over the next few years? I'm of the view that it could happen so let's map out how it might come to be -- with the help of a simple financial model that I'll explain as we go.

Brace yourself for a few calculations

Before we start to map out the feasibility of Pfizer reaching $100 let's articulate a few assumptions so that we can make a well-grounded projection.

First I'll be assuming that the impressive rate of Pfizer's earnings growth over the last year will slow down somewhat.

The company's trailing diluted earnings per share (EPS) expanded by 50.32% in the last 12 months and it would be very surprising for a business the size of Pfizer to be able to sustain such rapid growth. But with sales of its coronavirus vaccine estimated to bring in approximately $33.5 billion in new revenue during 2021 -- compared with $41.9 billion in total revenue in 2020 -- we aren't in normal times.

Demand for these vaccines is likely to remain high for at least the next few years especially considering that people will need booster shots to retain their immunity. Plus the company will keep launching a handful of new medicines each year driving even more revenue growth. In the second quarter of 2021 alone Pfizer chalked up three new approvals and it currently has seven programs in registration awaiting the final regulatory approval before launch.

Furthermore since Pfizer spun off its underperforming generic drug-manufacturing subsidiary Upjohn in late November 2020 (joining it with Mylan to form a new country called Viatris) it won't be facing as much pressure on its margins. So I'll be assuming that the company's EPS will continue to grow at 25% year over year -- still quite quick despite being much slower than its recent pace.

Next comes valuation. Pfizer's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is currently about 22. It's likely that market has all of the relevant information regarding its rate of growth over the past year as well as all of the information about expected vaccine sales and near-term earnings estimates so let's assume that the P/E multiple will remain constant through 2025.

Effectively that means we are assuming that the market will not dramatically change its appraisal of how much the company is worth compared to its expected earnings. But investors should note that if Pfizer were a smaller company without a history of successful drug development and commercialization at scale this assumption would not be safe to make because there would be too much room for surprises with large revenue impacts.

Finally its current diluted trailing EPS is $2.34 so I'll be using that as the starting point to model the stock's growth over the next three years. For that number to remain meaningful we'll also posit that Pfizer won't issue any new shares to raise cash which it shouldn't need to do anyway given its $21.7 billion in liquid funds.

The verdict

If all of these assumptions about vaccine demand earnings growth rate and the stock's valuation hold up Pfizer could reach $4.57 in diluted trailing EPS by August 2024 making its stock price $100.55 when we multiply the EPS by the P/E ratio. That means the stock is capable of more than doubling before 2025.

You should be aware that my simple model's estimated price is highly sensitive to the rate of earnings growth. If earnings grew at a rate of ""only"" 20% annually over the next three years Pfizer's stock price might be in the ballpark of $89.

That said investors should probably expect compensation in the form of larger dividend payments rather than share price appreciation alone. The company's payout ratio is 70.64% meaning that most of its quarterly earnings growth is dispensed in dividend form rather than retained or spent on stock buybacks. That might eventually change but until it does dividend payouts will likely mitigate most of the upward pressure on the stock's price.

So while it's possible for Pfizer's stock to reach near $100 it probably won't happen anytime soon if it keeps paying a dividend. Nonetheless the future amount of incoming revenue means that there are probably still large shareholder returns ahead. In other words Pfizer could still be a highly lucrative stock to own even if its chances of reaching triple-digit prices are largely theoretical for the time being.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5LzA1L3dvcmxkL3NjaWVuY2UtaGVhbHRoLXdvcmxkL2NvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmVzLWFudGlib2RpZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Moderna vaccine makes more antibodies than Pfizer's. Does it matter?,"Ten months ago the results of large clinical trials appeared almost too good to be true: Two messenger RNA vaccines reduced symptomatic COVID-19 cases by more than 90% in almost every group that got them.

Now subtle differences between the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. vaccines are emerging across patient groups over time. One small U.S. study found waning levels of antibodies with Pfizer’s vaccine particularly in an older group of people. And a larger study from Belgium found that Moderna’s shot may generate more antibodies than Pfizer’s.

But what this all means in the real world is still unclear. While hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines have been administered around the world researchers are still working to understand the nuances of how long their protection lasts and how it differs from one person to another.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8wMy9oZWFsdGgvdXMtY29yb25hdmlydXMtZnJpZGF5L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAT9odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzA5LzAzL2hlYWx0aC91cy1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1mcmlkYXk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three doses of Covid-19 vaccine are likely needed for full protection Fauci says,"CNN —

With the latest Covid-19 surge upending American life yet again an official rollout of booster doses could begin within weeks pending FDA authorization. And it’s likely that three doses of the vaccine are needed for full protection Dr. Anthony Fauci said.

He cited two Israeli-based studies that showed a decrease in infections among people who got a third or booster shot.

There was good reason to believe that a third dose “will actually be durable and if it is durable then you’re going to have very likely a three-dose regimen being the routine regimen” Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said at a briefing Thursday.

It’s ultimately up to the US Food and Drug Administration to decide whether Americans should get three doses of the Covid-19 vaccine Fauci said. The agency is considering the question later this month after Moderna and Pfizer both applied for FDA authorization for a third dose either six months or eight months after getting the second dose.

The recommendation for the booster doses will likely lead to availability for a broad portion of the population and doses could begin rolling out as early as the week of September 20 US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Thursday.

Additional doses were granted emergency use authorization by the FDA this month for those who are immunocompromised.

Even though the doses are not yet available to the public local health departments nationwide have seen a recent surge in calls from people wanting to make appointments according to the National Association of County and City Health Departments.

While the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster plan remains on track for the week of September 20 according to a source familiar with the discussion it may take a few weeks longer to move forward with Moderna’s boosters.

There have been internal conversations within the Biden administration about scaling back the ambitious booster plan laid out by top federal health officials last month as the calendar nears September 20 when officials initially said boosters could be available for people who had either mRNA Covid-19 vaccine.

A person familiar with the matter told CNN there was a meeting between top federal health officials and White House staff on Thursday in which officials warned that more time may be needed before enough data is available to recommend boosters for all adults. Federal health officials relayed that Moderna’s submission was “found inadequate and needs strengthened data” from the company a source said.

The company announced on Twitter Friday that it has completed submission of its data on booster doses to the FDA. The agency is already evaluating data submitted by Pfizer/BioNTech for approval of a booster dose.

Nearly 53% of US population fully vaccinated

For now the emphasis remains on increasing vaccination rates among the US population to help overcome the pandemic.

Roughly 62.2% of the US population has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose and about 52.9% is fully vaccinated CDC data shows.

Of the 10 states with the worst Covid-19 case rates over the past week seven of them also had among the 10 best vaccination rates according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

And in states with lower vaccination rates more children went to the hospital and emergency room according to a new CDC study.

The research published Friday in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Report found hospitalizations and emergency room visits for children with Covid-19 increased from June to August. And in the two-week period in mid-to-late August ER visits were 3.4 times higher in the states with the lowest vaccination rates while hospitalizations were 3.7 times higher than in states with the highest vaccination rates. The states with the lowest vaccination coverage were in the South.

Schools and universities enact safety measures

The risk of Covid-19 spread at schools and campuses remains critical and recent research demonstrates how unmasked behavior among the unvaccinated can lead to outbreaks.

A study published Thursday described a Covid-19 outbreak among more than 150 students at a Chicago university after many unvaccinated students traveled during spring break despite university policies that advised against it.

To prevent similar outbreaks some universities have instituted mandates to attend classes in-person.

Virginia Tech disenrolled 134 students for failing to comply with the university’s requirement that students be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and “did not submit vaccination documentation or receive a medical or religious exemption” according to a statement on Monday.

The University of Virginia has also disenrolled more than 200 students for failing to comply with their vaccine mandate according to a statement last month.

Vaccinations in teens and adults can not only stave off infections at schools but can also protect children under 12 who are ineligible for the vaccine.

“Communities with high vaccination coverage are seeing lower pediatric cases and hospitalizations” CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said.

Along with vaccinations mask-wearing is also beneficial to curbing Covid-19 spread evidence shows.

The state of New York will require weekly Covid-19 testing for teachers and other school employees with an opt-out for those who are vaccinated and will continue its mask mandate for everybody in a school building Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Thursday.

In Florida districts will be able to institute mask mandates following a judge signing a written order Thursday that ruled against Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ban on such mandates in schools. DeSantis said he will appeal.

New Mu variant is under observation

A new coronavirus variant designated as Mu by the World Health Organization is being monitored as a “variant of interest” but federal health officials say they don’t consider it immediately dangerous.

On Tuesday WHO designated the B.1.621 variant as a “variant of interest” because it carries mutations that could help it partially evade vaccines and treatments such as monoclonal antibodies. WHO named it Mu under its system to designate important variants using the Greek alphabet.

“This variant has a constellation of mutations that suggests that it would evade certain antibodies” Fauci said Thursday of Mu. “Not only monoclonal antibodies but vaccine and convalescent serum-induced antibodies. But there isn’t a lot of clinical data to suggest that – it is mostly laboratory in vitro data.

“Not to downplay it – we take it very seriously. But remember even when you have variants that do diminish somewhat the efficacy of vaccines the vaccines still are quite effective against variants of that type. Bottom line we’re paying attention to it. We take everything like that seriously. But we don’t consider it an immediate threat right now” he said.

The Delta variant still accounts for more than 99% of Covid-19 cases diagnosed and sequenced in the US Walensky said Thursday while Mu is rare.

“We are watching it carefully” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHA6Ly90dC5sb29wbmV3cy5jb20vY29udGVudC9oZWFsdGgtbWluaXN0cnktbGlzdHMtbG9jYXRpb25zLWNvdmlkLTE5LXBmaXplci12YWNjaW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Health Ministry lists locations for COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine | Loop Trinidad & Tobago,"The Health Ministry has listed locations for members of the public seeking to get the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

The slick was first identified by the Associated Press using satellite photographs provided by NOAA. The agency has published a full set of high resolution imagery of some of the key areas hit by Hurricane Ida last week including Port Fourchon. The slick is clearly visible to the east of the port's approaches.

Port Fourchon is a receiving hub for offshore oil and gas pipelines and the seabed just off its coast is a maze of pipe networks. One of the operations in the vicinity of the spill used to belong to Talos which produced oil from a field nearby until 2017. The Coast Guard initially suggested that Talos bore responsibility as the operator but the firm denied involvement saying that it had plugged its wells and removed the associated pipelines by 2019. Still Talos called in two spill response vessels and a dive support vessel and cleanup operations are under way.

On Sunday Talos said that its divers had inspected the site and identified the source of the leak as a ruptured 12-inch-diameter pipeline which had been pulled out of its trench. Talos said that it is not the owner of the line and it is working with the Coast Guard and other regulators to identify the responsible party. Like most of Louisiana's near-coastal waters the area's oil and gas deposits have been in active development for decades with multiple operators working in the same region.

Talos said that the rate of the spill appears to have slowed over the weekend with less visible oil on the surface. No shoreline impacts have been reported to date.

NOAA satellite imaging also identified a large rainbow sheen at the Alliance Refinery complex in Belle Chasse Louisiana early last week. In a statement operator Phillips 66 said that the spill was contained within the refinery's grounds. A spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality told AP that the flooding had breached a levee at the refinery and it is unknown how much oil might have escaped.

Lower Mississippi reopens to all traffic

The Captain of the Port for New Orleans has reopened all of the Lower Mississippi to vessel traffic including areas previously closed due to downed powerlines.

During the storm a high-tension powerline fell into the river next to the former Avondale Shipyard site west of New Orleans blocking marine traffic for days. The shutdown impeded the flow of barge traffic carrying Midwestern grain to dry bulk export hubs at the Port of New Orleans raising concerns among agribusiness interests.

Capt. Will Watson @USCG Sector New Orleans commander works with @EntergyLA to clear downed power lines from blocking the Lower Mississippi River - clearing the way for hundreds of millions of dollars in commerce that moves daily over this critical waterway. #USCGIda #Storm21 pic.twitter.com/XlpqI8kKhu — USCG Heartland (@USCGHeartland) September 4 2021

“Working alongside key federal state parish city and maritime industry leaders we’ve made significant progress reconstituting ports and waterways throughout Southeast Louisiana” said Capt. Will Watson the captain of the port for Sector New Orleans. “The marine transportation system in this region connects our heartland’s harvest with global markets and provides vital energy supply to our nation. We continue to support the State of Louisiana as we collectively recover from the impacts of Hurricane Ida.”

Some restrictions still apply. Upriver from Avondale as far as the Sunshine Bridge (mile marker 108-167) vessels are instructed to maintain their slowest safe speed when passing ongoing vessel salvage operations. Tows are restricted to six barges wide and all vessels should keep as close to the center as possible as there may still be sunken obstructions near the banks. Downriver a large field of partially sunken barges is still located on the right descending bank at river miles 56-58.

Deep draft vessels on the Lower Mississipi are still restricted to daylight transit only as aids to navigation may be out of place and storm debris and shoaling may present hazards."

America had a record 10.1 million jobs openings in June but businesses are struggling to fill these open positions CNN reported. So what’s causing this mismatch between worker supply and demand?

According to Hourly Workers These Are the Primary Reasons That Businesses Are Facing Difficulty Hiring

A recent survey of over 3000 hourly workers conducted by Branch is shedding some light on the divide between worker supply and demand. The hourly employees surveyed said that the No. 1 reason businesses are likely having difficulty filling open roles is that wages are too low. Sixty-eight percent said that they believe people are earning more from unemployment benefits/stimulus checks than they would be working at the retailers hotels and restaurants that are desperate to hire. Going hand-and-hand with that 59% of hourly workers said that companies need to provide higher wages to attract new workers.

Other reasons businesses are having difficulty hiring according to the workers surveyed are that employees fear COVID-19 exposure (46%) companies are not providing enough benefits to their employees (28%) people are rethinking their careers and are taking their time before taking on a new job (28%) a lack of child care/school (27%) a lack of career growth opportunities within companies that are hiring (22%) and a lack of scheduling flexibility (20%).

“In order for industries like hospitality to eventually return to normal the industry needs to meet new expectations from workers in the field” said Sumir Meghani CEO and co-founder of Instawork a digital marketplace connecting local businesses with professionals. “Our team at Instawork regularly meets with hourly workers and we hear repeatedly that flexibility is incredibly important in order to better care for their families. In addition they’re looking for higher wages that better correlate with their individual levels of experience and unique skillsets.”

The Labor Force Has Shrunk

The dissatisfaction about current working conditions is causing the labor market to shrink so there are now fewer people to fill job openings than there were pre-pandemic.

“There are about 3 million fewer people in the U.S. either working or looking for work now as compared to before the pandemic” said Gus Faucher chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. “If employment is to return to its pre-pandemic level labor force growth must pick back up. Some of the contraction in the labor force is due to concern about the coronavirus some is due to child-care responsibilities some is due to an increase in legislated unemployment insurance benefits.”

Story continues

Lack of available child care has disproportionately affected female workers which took a major hit on the available labor force.

“The labor participation rate has been declining for years especially for men while the participation for women nearly doubled from 1950 to recently” said Ira Wolfe president and chief Googlization officer at Success Performance Solutions an employee testing provider. “The reality is women drove the U.S. labor force until recently. But then the pandemic hit and women left the workforce in droves [we experienced a] ‘SheCession.’ Women still hold the role of caregiver in most families. When push came to shove they had a choice — take care of their kids or parents or their career. Kids and parents won out. The female participation dropped from just a little over 60% to approximately 52%.”

Another reason the labor force has shrunk is a reduction in immigration.

“The pandemic stopped immigration in its tracks” Wolfe said. “This isn’t sustainable but currently is a reason for so many unfilled jobs especially low- to moderately-skilled jobs.”

Yet another factor leading to a reduction in the labor force is that many workers decided to retire early after being laid off or furloughed amid the pandemic.

“Baby Boomers have been leaving the workforce since 2002 but at a rate slower than predicted” Wolfe said. “But then the pandemic hit and as an at-risk population the rate accelerated.”

( ) — One suspect from Delray Beach applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in eight different states.

Another on his application claimed he made $546000 as a cashier in California before he lost his job when the COVID-19 pandemic hit last year.

A third suspect who lived in West Palm Beach applied for unemployment benefits in Arizona where he claimed he lost his job at a Walmart in Missouri.

A fourth claimed he lost his job as a nursery school teacher where he made $63000 a year.

New information is emerging in the arrests of nine people as part of a CARES Act fraud investigation involving the Office of Statewide Prosecution and Delray Beach Police.



Police said the suspects fraudulently received more than $555000 in PUA funds from multiple states.

Court records show Pennsylvania Arizona Massachusetts and California as popular targets.

THE SUSPECTS

TYRELL BOUIE

Tyrell Bouie 19 faces seven counts of fraud to obtain reemployment assistance fraud to obtain property under $20000 and use of a 2-way communication device to commit a felony.



Investigators said Bouie of Delray Beach applied for PUA money in eight states. Court records show in Kansas he claimed on his application that he lost his job at a Footlocker store due to COVID-19. The state denied his claim. He received the same response in Arizona and Idaho. California where he listed an apartment building as his home address didn't send him any money either because he didn't have the right documentation to verify his identity.

However the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance sent him eight payments of more than $5700. On this application he claimed he lost his job in Massachusetts due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 15 Investigators later discovered a wage and earnings report showed he worked for Gubagoo Inc. a car dealership in Boca Raton.

Bouie also received money from Pennsylvania where he claimed he lost his job on March 11 2020. The state sent him a debit card to his home and uploaded $195 to it.

He also applied to the Ohio Office of Unemployment Insurance Operations for relief funding. The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services later sent Bouie four payments for a total of $4734.

Investigators said Bouie also applied for benefits in Hawaii but released no information in that investigation.

Investigators said Bouie used his Instagram account to teach others on how to commit unemployment assistance fraud.

NATHANIEL BRAXTON

Nathaniel Braxton 21 is also accused of sharing examples of the scheme to friends on Instagram.



Braxton arrested on Thursday is facing five counts of fraud to obtain reemployment assistance fraud to obtain property under $20000 and use of a 2-way communication device to commit a felony.

According to court records Braxton claimed he bought a BMW and a Mercedes Benz with fraudulent PUA funds. He applied for funding in five states: Arizona California Massachusetts Nevada and Pennsylvania.

California Nevada and Massachusetts all denied his claims. Arizona according to records flagged his application because of the Florida mailing address and that his phone number showed up on five different addresses in the system.

Pennsylvania however loaded $10920 onto a US Bank ReliaCard debit card. Authorities said he transferred two chunks of it to his girlfriend at the time. On his application he claimed he worked for Pennsylvania Physical Medicine in Greensburg until March 14 2020.

ENOS DUCOSTE

Enos Ducoste 21 claimed he earned $12000 while working for the Orozcos Mechanic Shop in Kansas City during 2020 court records show.



The year before he said he made $69000 in Massachusetts until the COVID-19 pandemic forced him out of a job on March 1 2020.

Court records show he also applied for PAU in Ohio claiming on his application he worked as a plumber pipefitter pipe layer and steamfitter.

Investigators said the Ohio Office of Unemployment Insurance Operations sent Ducoste a letter on June 3 2020 to say he's eligible for benefits and could receive $189/week for up to 39 weeks. He received $8235 in a direct deposit though investigators found no records he ever lived in Ohio. Investigators believe he received a deposit of an additional $3156 into another bank but so far those records have not been recovered.

On July 14 2020 the Office of Unemployment Insurance Operations asked Ducoste for more information which included a social security card a driver's license photo proof of previous employment and a voided check from his most recent employer. In December the UIO sent him another letter saying he was overpaid $11391 and to contact them immediately.

DEONTRE RICHARDSON

Deontre Richardson 23 applied for unemployment benefits in four states investigators say.



On his application in California investigators said Richardson claimed he worked as a cashier and made $546789 during 2019 only to lose his job on July 25 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Records show Richardson ultimately received six separate payments onto the debit card from California's Employment Development Department totaling $11075.

For the application in Massachusetts investigators said Richardson told the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance he lived in Boston and earned $12000 in 2019.

The Arizona Department of Economic Security denied his application where he claimed he lost his job at Arizona Construction Equipment Inc. on March 11 2020. Investigators later learned the construction company is family-owned and only the owner and his father work there.

On June 29 2020 investigators said Richardson applied for PUA with the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. Richardson claimed he lost his job at Walmart in Sayre Pa. on March 15 2020. The state sent a US Bank ReliaCard to an address on N. Australian Avenue in West Palm Beach. Walmart would later tell investigators no one by the name of Deontre Richardson worked there according to court records.

DEVONTRE RICHARDSON

Devontre Richardson 22 received a total of more than $44000 from three of the four states he sent applications to according to court records.



In Massachusetts he claimed he worked in 2019 and made $11175 but couldn't work after March 8 2020 due to COVID-19. Investigators would later find incidents that showed him under arrest in Florida during the time period in which he claimed he worked in Massachusetts.

On his application in California investigators said Richardson claimed he worked as a nursery school teacher where he made $63000 a year in 2019 before losing his job on Feb. 17 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The California Employment Development Department eventually approved to give Richardson $22800 on a prepaid debit card. Court records show he withdrew $1000 a day from various Bank of America ATMs in Palm Beach County. The state deactivated the card on Sept. 25 2020 due to suspected fraudulent activity with a balance of $12302.85.

And as a result of his application in Pennsylvania he received two checks from the Commonwealth of PA for $2925 and $6600. Both were deposited into the Wells Fargo bank on June 26 2020 investigators said.

Authorities said Richardson asked to receive his benefit payments through a US Bank ReliaCard. He received two payments of $1200 and $390 on July 1 2020. Devontre withdrew $800 from a PNC Bank in West Palm Beach and another $700 from a PNC Bank in Riviera Beach. Investigators said the money was spent over the next 10 days in Palm Beach County investigators said.

Shortly after Cardona surprisingly lost the world title to Jon Moxley at GCW The Art of War Games Josh Shernoff interviewed “The Deathmatch King” backstage. Though Cardona was clearly distraught about the loss he pointed out that the Universal Championship which he had commisioned himself is still in his grasp.

“Listen I say I’m always ready and I am but that’s bull—- dude” said Cardona. “I’m always ready except for when Jon Moxley except for that one time Jon Moxley screwed me over. That’s right he screwed me over. I beat Frank The Clown I was prepared for Frank The Clown. I don’t know what to say. I’m still this [gestures to the GCW Universal Championship] I’m still the Universal Champion but my title’s gone.

“I mean am I still the Deathmatch King?” Cardona asked. “Look at this! [Gestures to his legs.] There’s glass in my a–. That was an unsafe working environment. I did not sign up WarGames. I did not sign up for a death match. I signed up for a good clean fair fight. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know [where to go from here.]”

Cardona then walked away leaving his future with GCW unclear.

In multiple tweets Cardona commented on his loss. In one he compared it to the infamous Montreal Screwjob.

Later on Sunday morning Cardona noted that he knew how PNC Bank felt after Nick Gage walked in felt because he got “robbed.” Here Cardona was clearly using Gage’s past against him as he was arrested for robbing a PNC Bank in 2010.

Procter & Gamble is vacating its namesake Toronto office building.

The consumer goods company is downsizing from its 90000 sq ft office at 4711 Yonge Street. CBRE is marketing the concourse ground floor and second floor block at the Yonge and Sheppard tower which is owned by Menkes. P&G declined to comment on its move.

While pricing for the P&G office space was not available the asking net rent for the 15th floor is $21/sq ft on par with the average for the North Yonge submarket. Additional rent for the 23000 sq ft space is $23.61/sq ft. Suite 902 at 17000 sq ft asks the same.

As of the end of Q1 the office vacancy rate in the North York submarket was 24.7% higher than the Toronto North average of 19.3%.

The P&G block is available as of Feb 1 2025 and podium signage is offered. The space is being marketed towards life sciences companies and data centre operators. It offers 25 watts of power per sq ft.

The 16-storey Class-A office tower was built in 1987. It’s LEED platinum certified and has seven elevators car-charging stations and a café.

One underground unreserved parking space is available per 1000 rentable sq ft. Highway 401 and six GO Bus routes are nearby and there is direct underground access to the Yonge-Shephard subway station.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Congresswoman Ilhan Omar representative of Minnesota's Fifth District joined on the South Shore of Lake Bemidji by Indigenous leaders and fellow House members. Joining Omar for the event were Democratic Reps.Cori Bush D-Mo. Ayanna Pressley D-Mass. and Rashida Tlaib Mich.

The group arrived on the South Shore after conducting a roundtable in Bemidji's Sanford Center with several opponents of Enbridge's Line 3 oil pipeline replacement project. Recently company officials said the work on Line 3 is more than 90% finished.

""A lot of people say time has run out"" Omar said. ""That this is 90% finished. But the resilient water protectors and the Native tribes that have welcomed us into their spaces tell us time never runs out on fighting for what is right.""

The visit to Bemidji came a day after members of the progressive ""Squad"" held a press conference in Minneapolis where they also called on Biden to revoke the Line 3 permits. Before the stops in Minnesota a letter was sent to the White House which included signatures from the four Congresswomen and 13 other representatives as well as several state legislators.

The letter sent Aug. 30 stated ""when considering the extent of environmental cultural and social impacts on Indigenous people associated with Line 3 construction and its long-term climate impacts we believe the federal government has a responsibility to uphold treaties and engage with Tribal nations on a government-to-government level.""

On Saturday Omar reiterated her commitment to the Line 3 issue after speaking with the local opponents.

""It's been a really revealing and heartbreaking conversation"" Omar said. ""We learned the ways in which treaty rights have been disregarded. We learned the ways in which intimidation has taken place. We learned the ways in which the Line 3 pipeline will disrupt the future of tribal communities that it will impact.

""It is unconscionable for us to see zero action being taken by our governor and president in stopping this pipeline. None of our communities that have been engaged in this battle want to come back and say 'I told you so' after spills take place and our water is polluted.""

Project details

Construction on Line 3 started in late 2020 and completion is expected by the fourth quarter of this year . Enbridge officials say restoration and cleanup operations will then be conducted in 2022.

The new infrastructure will replace the original Line 3 which was installed in the 1960s. The existing pipeline is now operating at half capacity because of its age and condition.

ADVERTISEMENT

To replace it Enbridge is investing $2.9 billion for the new Line 3 which is more than 1000 miles long and extends from Edmonton Alberta to Superior Wis. where a terminal is located. Once finished it will carry an average of 760000 barrels of oil per day.

The portion going through Minnesota is 337 miles and takes an alternate route than the original pipeline. Both the existing and replacement pipes take a route from Canada through North Dakota to a terminal in Clearbrook.

From there the existing pipeline takes a direct path east going through Leech Lake Nation. The new route however will go south from Clearbrook to the border of Hubbard and Wadena Counties and from there go east to Wisconsin.

Work on the project started after six years of Enbridge going through the Minnesota regulatory process. During the regulatory process and continuing into construction opponents of the pipeline project have continually protested Line 3 arguing that potential spills could damage Minnesota waters and that it will accelerate climate change.

On Aug. 25 more than 1000 protestors gathered in front of the Minnesota Capitol demanding Gov. Tim Walz and Biden halt Line 3. Just a week earlier hundreds marched through the city of Duluth as part of the same cause .

'More than allies'

In her comments Saturday Pressley said the group of Congress members stood in solidarity with the Line 3 opponents.

""We're here to be more than allies"" Pressley said. ""We're here to be intentional accomplices and conspirators in the work of justice. To affirm Native sovereign rights tribal rights and treaties. Contracts that have been broken and violated. A people that have been violated. Who have experienced undue brutality simply for asking this nation to honor its promise.""

Bush said during the event that impacts of Line 3 aren't limited to those in Minnesota.

""We should be standing together"" Bush said. ""Because if I don't have water you don't have water. If they don't have water another group doesn't have water. Your struggle is our struggle.""

Climate change was also referenced several times during Saturday's speeches.

""I think it's really important that President Biden understands that this decision around being silent is devastating these communities"" Tlaib said. ""This is not only going to impact our climate but also our access to clean drinking water.""

""Climate change is no longer deniable"" said Red Lake Tribal Secretary Samuel Strong. ""Climate change is impacting us on a daily basis. You see it with the hurricanes. There was a time this summer where you couldn't see the sun our children couldn't go outside and play. Line 3 expansion project will create emissions equivalent to 50 coal-fired power plants. We are asking our government to take action that will protect our children and those generations to come. Half measures will no longer do us well.""

Opposing views

Friday and Saturday's events were met with criticism by Republican members of Minnesota's Congressional Delegation. In a letter signed by Reps. Tom Emmer Michelle Fischbach and Pete Stauber GOP officials wrote ""even after a litany of court decisions affirming the Enbridge Line 3 pipeline replacement project and even with construction more than 90% complete the misguided push to stop the pipeline using any means possible continues.

""They say it's about the impacts of the pipeline on Indigenous people but they have not met with the many Native American contractors who are currently on-site assembling the pipeline"" the representatives stated. ""They say it's about tribal sovereignty but they fail to note the agreement reached with the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. They say it's about the people but have not engaged with the cities counties and local businesses that have already benefited from the project.""

Enbridge also issued a response to the events on Friday and Saturday stating ""Line 3 does not violate treaty rights. The Minnesota Court of Appeals recently concluded 'the commission reasonably selected a route for the replacement pipeline based upon the respect for tribal sovereignty while minimizing environmental impacts.""

Enbridge's statement went on to note that the ""climate change claims regarding Line 3 are unfounded. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission addressed climate change in their decision granting Line 3 its certificate of need. They concluded that emissions from the ultimate consumption of oil transported by Line 3 do not result from the replaced pipeline but instead from the continued demand for crude oil to produce refined products used by consumers.""

The company also stated the project is being built ""under the supervision of tribal monitors"" who ""ensure that important cultural resources are protected.""

You Might Also Like: Market Movers: What sparked the stunning rally in HDFC Life Insurance?









NEW DELHI: HDFC Life 's decision to buy Exide Life for Rs 6687 crore has not gone down well with a few brokerages as they believe the premium valuations paid for the 'sub-par' business was not worth it.Analysts said smaller life insurance companies are struggling and many of them are up for sale. As there are not many suitors for firms without sizeable bancassurance distribution  the premium valuation paid for Exide Life looked unwarranted they said and added that HDFC Life would have done better growing organically as synergies from the acquisition would anyway take 18-24 months to materialise.That said brokerages still hold a positive view on HDFC Life as the valuation premium of Rs 4000 crore over the embedded value (EV) of Exide Life is insignificant and accounts for only 3 per cent of HDFC Life's current market capitalisation . It may though delay industry consolidation they warned adding that sectoral leaders would now be keen to pay such a premium valuation for weaker franchises.At nearly 2.5 times June 2021 EV the valuation paid for Exide Life far exceeds the quality of franchise Emkay Global said and added that smaller players without any meaningful bancassurance distribution like Exide were already battling to grow and manage high fixed costs.""Exide Life has been struggling on the expense front and its retail business has recorded poor persistency. In this context the 2.5 times P/EV (June 2021) paid to Exide Life appears to be at a significant premium over its intrinsic value. The three listed peers of HDFC Life currently trade at 3.5 times June 2021 EV. It is worth noting here that these listed peers have a very strong brand massive economies of scale formidable bancassurance distribution and sustained high operating return EV"" Emkay said.HDFC Life will play Exide a cash consideration of Rs 726 crore and will issue HDFC Life shares at Rs 685 per share for the rest of the amount. The deal would add 10 per cent to HDFC Life's EV while the stock consideration would lead to a 4 per cent dilution.Prabhudas Lilladher said Exide’s acquisition has minimal compliments to HDFC Life given the former's smaller size loss of market share and low immediate margins and opex synergies compared with 2.5 times multiple to current EV.The acquisition does provide HDFC Life access to the southern geography better agency business (60 per cent share for Exide – 38 per cent of HDFC Life) and better protection mix (11 per cent mix). Exide also has better solvency ratio than HDFC Life and a large co-operative banca partnership.""But lower persistency of less than 75 per cent against HDFC Life’s 85 per cent lower margins and lower scale (60 per cent higher cost than HDFC Life) do not compliment HDFC Life in a very big way” Prabhudas said.YES Securities however believes the acquisition makes sense. It said Exide Life has significant presence in the Tier 2 and 3 centres which contribute more than 60 per cent to their business. Exide Life also has significant presence down south where HDFC Life’s current share of agents is 26 per cent.""The synergies would be realised over a period of 18-24 months. New business margin will improve as operating leverage and product mx changes kick in. There is also slight scope to improve Exide Life’s agent productivity and their persistency. Regarding cost Exide Life variable cost is largely in line and their fixed cost is sub-optimal due to lack of scale. HDFC Life will start selling their products via Exide Life distribution. While Exide Life pre-overrun new business margin is in line with that of HDFC Life their cost ratio is about 60 per cent higher which will benefit as scale kicks in"" YES Securities said.The brokerage has an 'add' rating on HDFC Life and a revised target price of Rs 783 valuing HDFC Life at 4.3 times FY23 P/EV. The brokerage however prefers ICICI Prudential Life in the life insurance space.Prabhudas Lilladher has a price target of Rs 734 while Emkay finds the stock Rs 870 worthy.The stock had 23 'buy' calls 11 'hold' and 2 'sell' recommendations as of Saturday. In the last one week it has added one 'buy' call. The stock has a 12-month median price target of Rs 777.5 based on the recommendations of 36 analysts.On Friday the scrip closed at Rs 734.45 down 3.21 per cent suggesting up to 6 per cent potential upside from here on.",,,,,,,,,

And technology companies are moths that will chew through more of the fabric every year if we let them and especially if we encourage them.

An American who stores accumulated photographs in a spare bedroom or attic or self-storage space correctly presumes that those albums of visual keepsakes are off-limits to other people. Though an exhaustive inventory of the nation’s snapshots would include a minuscule percentage showing illegal acts it would be outrageous if a photo-album manufacturer or a storage-facility employee insisted that like it or not their business would be investigating all of your photos just to make sure that nothing in your collection was unlawful or immoral. We expect to be presumed innocent of nefarious acts absent evidence to the contrary—and to be spared public or private agents rifling through our personal effects.

But that norm may not survive the digital era. For now Apple has backed off its plan announced last month to install scanning software on all U.S. iPhones to help identify the vile but tiny subset of people who keep child pornography on their devices. The company will take time to “make improvements” on the idea The Wall Street Journal reported. But ultimately whether to proceed is up to the company’s discretion.

Apple’s original plan was to scan all the images of customers with the company’s iCloud storage service activated. Suspected sex offenders were to be flagged and reported to the relevant authorities. “Most cloud providers already scan user libraries for this information” TechCrunch explained after the announcement. “Apple’s system is different in that it does the matching on device rather than in the cloud.”

The civil libertarians who objected to the plans raised questions that remain important: Do we want a society in which the devices that we purchase—and that we must carry to navigate the modern world—are equipped to continuously and remotely monitor us for criminal acts? Or should Americans enjoy undiminished privacy in our personal effects including photos when we keep them in digital rather than physical form?

Read: Apple’s empty grandstanding about privacy

Even if technology companies load all consumer devices with intrusive spyware sex crimes won’t go away alas. Images of child sex abuse long predate digital photography and even in the digital sphere the technological arms race between criminals and cops will never end. It will grow only more sophisticated and distant from the computing practices of the masses. But the typical person’s sphere of personal privacy will shrink dramatically if we acclimate to a future in which everyone is regularly subject to digital stop-and-frisks.

“We’ve had personal computers for decades and there has never been a mandate to scan the private content of all desktops laptops or phones globally for unlawful content” Will Cathcart the head of the Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp declared on Twitter. “It’s not how technology built in free countries works.”

Under the system that Apple outlined last month the initial intrusion on privacy would be minimal. If a user deactivated iCloud the software on their device wouldn’t process its images at all because its ostensible purpose would be to stop child-sex-abuse images from being uploaded to iCloud. And for the majority of iPhone owners who use iCloud images would be made known to Apple only if the software flagged them as matching ones in nonprofit groups’ databases of material known to be exploitative.

If the matter ended there it would be of little consequence good or bad. All but the least technologically savvy predators would simply deactivate iCloud and avoid getting caught sharply reducing the public benefit of this change. As for future costs however Apple’s proposed approach embraced at least three worrisome premises: that we don’t fully own the devices that store so much private information about us; that tech giants that sell us those devices can ethically load them with spyware; and that the evil deeds of a tiny fraction of users justify the mass surveillance of data that millions of totally innocent users put on their phone.

If Apple accepts those premises and most of its customers go along without objecting then future iPhones will almost inevitably scan for more than child porn. The logic of catching a few evil actors by denying the cloak of privacy to everyone will inexorably expand to more and more areas that powerful societal factions want to target. Some of those factions will themselves be evil. Many are likely to be illiberal or repressive.

As Edward Snowden who famously revealed the NSA’s mass surveillance of innocent people asked on Substack

What happens when a party in India demands they start scanning for memes associated with a separatist movement? What happens when the UK demands they scan for a library of terrorist imagery? How long do we have left before the iPhone in your pocket begins quietly filing reports about encountering “extremist” political material or about your presence at a “civil disturbance”?

Geopolitical pressures of this sort are unavoidable. Multiple governments are already moving to obliterate or significantly undermine digital-privacy rights even in liberal democracies. This summer alone analysts at the Electronic Frontier Foundation a leading digital-civil-liberties advocacy organization have raised alarms about new or proposed laws in India Brazil and Canada.

And as Apple itself has argued on past occasions “the only way” to guarantee that a powerful tool for surveilling devices isn’t abused and doesn’t fall into the wrong hands is “to never create it.” Yet now Apple has effectively announced to every government in the world: We have or can develop the technical capacity to scan all iPhones for anything and under sufficient pressure we may use that power against our own customers to placate outside authorities. (The company did insist that if governments ask it to expand its spying “Apple would refuse such demands.”)

Another risk is that the technology would flag some of the innocents that it spies on. The computer scientists Jonathan Mayer and Anunay Kulshrestha who published a peer-reviewed paper on how to build a child-porn detection system like the one Apple is implementing published a Washington Post op-ed that explains why they came to believe the method is dangerous. “The content-matching process could have false positives” they wrote “and malicious users could game the system to subject innocent users to scrutiny. We were so disturbed that we took a step we hadn’t seen before in computer science literature: We warned against our own system design urging further research on how to mitigate the serious downsides.”

Read: The optics of Apple’s encryption fight

Like-minded critics of the technology have gone so far as to post open-source demonstrations of how bad actors could trick innocents into possessing innocuous images that have been manipulated to match the numeric codes known as hashes that nonprofit groups’ databases use to identify known child-sexual-abuse material. Using such techniques a sophisticated foreign-intelligence service (or perhaps a teenage troll) could theoretically cause trouble for American iPhone users—which is to say a substantial percentage of both average citizens and business government and academic leaders.

MIT Technology Review reported that Apple told journalists “the new systems cannot be misappropriated easily by government action—and emphasized repeatedly that opting out was as easy as turning off iCloud backup.” (The company posted a lengthy response to the broad criticism it faced after its initial announcement.)

But even if the company shelves the proposed system for now advocacy groups democratic governments and dictatorships alike will continue to pressure tech companies to play a much greater role in suppressing numerous kinds of material. Without the bulwark of control over our own devices and the attendant expectation of privacy in our personal effects users will have a far harder time protecting the zone of privacy that individuals enjoy in just societies—or conserving the democratizing effect technology has on information in authoritarian societies. Yes government agents should aggressively pursue people who create child porn and infiltrate networks of people who sell or trade it. Facebook YouTube Pornhub and every other platform on which content is publicly posted should marshal technology––perhaps this technology––to identify and remove child porn. But spyware on our personal devices goes too far.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGFsa29mdGl0dXN2aWxsZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8wNS9jdXJyZW50LWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXByb2plY3RzLWhhcHBlbmluZy1pbi10aXR1c3ZpbGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Current Development Projects happening in Titusville,"With more manufacturing & space industry companies moving to the #SpaceCoast developers are building new residential and commercial properties in Titusville.

For instance the recently launched P50 series came with the Snapdragon 888 4G. Now two more Huawei devices with Snapdragon chipsets are on the way.

According to Digital Chat Station Huawei has gotten rights to purchase the SM8325 and SM7315 chipsets from Qualcomm this year. The company will also be able to buy a 4G version of the SM8450 chip next year. For your information these model numbers are for the Snapdragon 888 Snapdragon 778G and Snapdragon 898 respectively. The nova 8i launched in July also has a Snapdragon chipset namely the Snapdragon 662.

""Crysanthemum factory"" is a nickname for Huawei - a reference to the company's logo

The source doesn't specify which devices would feature the two chipsets. But we can make a few guesses. Assuming that there's a Huawei P60 series next year it should come with the Snapdragon 898 4G chipset. For the Snapdragon 778G we expect it to be equipped on a Huawei nova 9 series device.

Access to Qualcomm's chips should ease the supply issues that Huawei has with its Kirin chips. We'll keep an eye out for news or rumours on Huawei devices that may feature a Qualcomm chipset too so stay tuned to TechNave for more updates on that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkYmouY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZ3Jvd3RoLXNwdXJ0LXNoaWVsZC1haS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Growth Spurt at Shield AI,"Defense tech specialist Shield AI reached unicorn status late this summer as $225 million in Series D funding pushed the company’s valuation above the $1 billion threshold. The news followed on the heels of two acquisitions in July: Heron Systems and Martin UAV. Shield AI said it plans to use its new capital to grow the combined company in the defense and commercial markets.

Separately Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) announced on Sept. 1 that it is in a partnership with Shield AI to test Martin UAV’s marquee product the V-BAT unmanned aircraft.

Shield AI based in downtown San Diego says it takes a software-first approach to serving the defense market. In short it applies self-driving car technologies to military aircraft. Autonomy is an important consideration when the military thinks about next generation air dominance said Brandon Tseng chief operating officer of Shield AI.

Tseng a former U.S. Navy SEAL and a Naval Academy graduate co-founded the business with brother Ryan Tseng the company’s CEO.

Series D Round

Disruptive led the Series D round. Based in Austin Texas Disruptive is a late-stage technology investor headed by Alex Davis. Also participating in the round were Point72 Ventures the company that led Shield AI’s Series C round.

As of Sept. 1 the company reached $225 million in equity and was at work to finalize another $75 million in debt.

Shield AI’s CEO has high expectations for his company.

“The funding round enables Shield AI to move one step closer to its goal of becoming a 21st century defense prime through a software first approach where products derive a strong competitive advantage from an autonomy and artificial intelligence backbone similar to what you see across the consumer product market where great hardware is differentiated through great software” said Ryan Tseng in a statement distributed on Aug. 24.

Tseng worked for Qualcomm Inc. (Nasdaq: QCOM) for several years after selling a startup company to Qualcomm.

Brandon Tseng said the company plans to use its new funding to grow and in particular hire talented engineers — specialists in software hardware and artificial intelligence. “San Diego has been a great place to attract talent” he said.

“The competition for talent in engineering is extremely fierce” said Brandon Tseng.

Tseng reiterated the importance of the software “backbone” to the company. Strong software offers capability to the military client. Increasingly he said senior military leaders as well as war fighters see the value attributed to software capabilities.

Aerospace Acquisitions

Shield AI did not disclose the terms of its two acquisitions in July.

Artificial intelligence software is at the heart of Heron Systems based in Alexandria Virginia. Its product recently had the distinction of defeating an experienced Air Force F-16 pilot and five other AI-pilots during the AlphaDogfight trials put on by DARPA the Pentagon’s research and development arm. (The initials stand for Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.)

“Truly special AI companies are incredibly rare assets in the defense market” Ryan Tseng said. “Heron has developed the most advanced AI-pilot for fighter aircraft in the United States. With China already showing comparable results operationalizing Heron’s work for programs such as Next Generation Air Dominance must be a national security priority.”

The other recent acquisition Martin UAV is based near Dallas in Plano Texas. Its V-BAT unmanned aircraft sits on its tail when not in flight and can take off and land vertically.

V-BAT can address the U.S. Army’s Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (FTUAS) mission said Kenn Todorov sector vice president and general manager of global sustainment and modernization at Northrop Grumman.

For the Martin UAV acquisition Shield AI retained JPMorgan Chase & Co. as exclusive financial adviser and Reed Smith LLP as legal adviser. Martin UAV retained Houlihan Lokey as exclusive financial adviser and Clark Hill PLC as legal adviser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdpem1vY2hpbmEuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMDUvaGVyZS1pcy10aGUtdml2by12MS1jaGlwLW5leHQtdG8tdGhlLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tODg4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here is the Vivo V1 chip next to the Snapdragon 888,"The Vivo V1 is Vivo’s first self-developed processor and it has been confirmed that it will make its debut in the upcoming Vivo X70 series set to launch this week. If you are wondering how big the chipset is images of it alongside the Snapdragon 888 have surfaced on the web.

The photos which were posted on Weibo by the known Chinese leaker Digital Chat Station show the V1 image signal processing chip alongside the 5nm Qualcomm SM8350 a.k.a. Snapdragon 888 processor. As we can see the Vivo V1 is pretty small when compared to the Qualcomm chipset.

Vivo says the V1 chip will improve the photography experience of the phone(s) it will come with. There are speculations that only the Vivo X70 Pro+ will feature the custom ISP but until there is an official confirmation it’s best to take it with a pinch of salt.

The Vivo X70 series will launch with a variety of chipsets. The standard model will be available in Exynos 1080 and Dimensity 1200 variants the X70 Pro will have the Exynos 1080 under its hood and the X70 Pro+ will ship with the Snapdragon 888+ processor.

Now a prominent leaker indicates that the OEM might secure an agreement with Qualcomm to release direct successors for these phones.

4 Reviews

Huawei normally releases premium phones with its own Kirin flagship SoCs. However anyone following the OEM's various trials and tribulations over the last few years may have concluded that these custom chipsets are fast running out perhaps permanently.

Fortunately for the recently-launched P50 series Huawei was able to obtain a supply of the Snapdragon 888 platform to bolster its unit numbers alongside Kirin 9000-powered SKUs.

However those Qualcomm processors came with the compromise of being 4G/LTE-only whereas nearly every other device on the market with the silicon is 5G. Now there is a suggestion that Huawei will be able to repeat this trick in 2022 albeit with the identical caveat.

The eminent tipster Digital Chat Station now claims that the Snapdragon 898 will also be offered in 4G form and that Huawei might thus be able to pick it up for P50 or Mate 40 successors. Furthermore the leaker asserts that the OEM acquired the Snapdragon 778G an SoC designed for premium mid-rangers along with its modified 888s.

Digital Chat Station did not specify whether this order of chipsets is similarly shorn of 5G capability or not. Nevertheless either version of the 778G might make a convincing match for something like a new generation of the Nova series. These new rumors might indicate that this is just the way things are going to go for Huawei for the foreseeable future.

These phones come with a new camera system better design and a powerful processor. The launch of the Huawei P50 series happed amid the supply chain issues created by the U.S. sanctions.

However that doesn’t stop the company to plan new models. Therefore the news for the next Nova models broke in and the Nova 9 series is ready to launch later this month.

That’s not it because there are more Huawei products are on their way this year. According to the information coming from DigitalKing the company will introduce the new device in September including:

Nova 9 series Huawei MateBook laptops Huawei Computer A new HarmonyOS powered device A new Printer and other IoT products

A Huawei Powerful phones:

Furthermore the tipster reveals that Huawei will also launch new products including new powerful phones and a few of them were not launched before. The tipster specifically mentioned that these devices will equip heavily. Yet there’s no specific identity or specifications revealed regarding the corresponding smartphones.

If we guess the tipster may be talking about new smartphone series and a flagship phone which is hard to find guess if it’s not Huawei Mate 50.

Even after these uncertainties and without any confirmation from the company the news of new powerful Huawei phones is quite big. Therefore it needs to be tracked continuously.

Huawei Nova 9 Pro:

The Huawei Nova 9 series is the next focus of state for Huawei and it has already completed an important certification in China. Thereafter its specs are already out in the open.

According to Telecommunication Equipment’s Network Access Managements (TENAA) in China. The phone equips a large display that has curved edges on the left and right sides with a punch-hole design.

The phone has a big camera bump on the rear that reflects a large main camera on the top and a triple camera system on the bottom ring. According to the information the phone only has 4G access and could be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G.

To be mentioned the Nova 9 could equip a 4500mAh battery with a trail-blazing 100W superfast charger. Also it will be one of the first Huawei devices to pre-pack a HarmonyOS 2.1 version."

Maybe a part-time monk…',"“In this company if you offend someone you are fired on the spot” Brunello Cucinelli tells me in his expressive yet sotto voce Italian. The king of cashmere’s register is if not quite as soft as his finest product then at least as airy as some of the higher-quality wools with which he works and he’s speaking to me by way of his perpetually hard-working translator Chiara. “Regardless of your position you are forbidden to offend another human being. I saw my father being offended in his work and I don’t want that for anyone.”

We are sitting in Cucinelli’s expansive office which is situated in the northwest corner of the main building of his headquarters in the Umbrian hamlet of Solomeo and the designer is positioned opposite me on a small chair upholstered in chalky wool. His arms and legs are crossed neatly in front of him and his lithe frame belies his 68 years. He’s wearing a pristine white button-down poplin shirt (the collar buttons left undone) with a grey cashmere tie (the back portion left dangling intentionally longer than the front) and on his legs he’s sporting a pair of pale stonewashed jeans ankles out. His sparingly lined face is tanned and his hair which is short and the colour of one of the darker chocolate linen suits in his collection is swept away from his face in a wispy centre parting. Cucinelli’s features – which are deep-set and positioned symmetrically around his nose a softened version of the muzzle on the mythological winged creature that adorns his company insignia – have a kind yet determined aspect.

In 1985 Cucinelli purchased Solomeo’s 14th-century tumbledown castle which was where his original studios were based before he moved in 2000 to the existing facility at the foot of the hamlet that constitutes his current production compound. Arranged in a U-shape like a series of giant Jenga blocks dotted around a flat grassy square bisected by water fountains the headquarters are sheltered from the hot Italian sun by the shadow of the castle and they’re an impressive testament to Cucinelli’s success. Indeed in a year when tailoring sales took a significant hit and the global fashion industry attempted to claw back growth following the decimation wreaked by Covid-19 Cucinelli has come out on top. The designer made not one of his 2000 global team members redundant during the pandemic and his company boasted an almost 60 per cent increase in revenues in the first half of 2021.

Inside the pristine white walls of GQ’s newly anointed Designer Of The Year’s private lair are peppered with pictures of him hobnobbing with all manner of luminaries. There’s the famous shot of Cucinelli hanging out with all the world’s wealthiest tech billionaires including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman and Twitter CFO Ned Segal whom he invited to Solomeo to eat pasta and talk philosophy in the summer prior to the pandemic (more on that later); there are manifold press cuttings of Cucinelli looking the very embodiment of sprezzatura (the uniquely Italian term that rather excellently translates into “studied carelessness”); and there are a series of framed pictures of him looking every bit the happy papa with his daughters both of whom hold senior positions in the company. Carolina is co-president and co-creative director of the brand while Camilla is the co-head of the women’s style office.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXl3ZWVrLmNvbS9pbnZlc3RtZW50cy9zdG9ja21hcmtldHMvNjAzNzc2L2lzLXRoaXMtYnJpdGFpbnMtbW9zdC1zdWNjZXNzZnVsLWNvbXBhbnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is this Britain's most successful company? | MoneyWeek,"What’s the most successful new British company of the last 20 years? You could make a good case for Ocado or one of the rising fintech giants such as Wise or for an artificial-intelligence start-up such as the recently listed Darktrace.

You could also make a compelling case for a company that we have only recently come to think of as a global business at all: Soho House. With its listing in New York now successfully completed the company is embarking on a round of expansion that could make it one of the biggest brands in the world.

Building a new global brand

When it reported its results last week Membership Collective Group as the chain is formally known certainly showed why investors were right to back its recent initial public offering (IPO). Revenues in the second quarter were up by 118% as the group bounced back from lockdown and its clubs started to reopen. True there was still a net loss of $57m and it may be a while yet before it turns an actual profit but the revenue figures are impressive and so are the plans for new clubs across the world and the waiting list for membership of more than 63000. With a market value of $2.2bn if it were listed in the UK it would be knocking on the door of the FTSE 100.

It has come a long-way from the slightly ramshackle private members’ club for media types that first set up shop in Greek Street in 1995. In the years since then Soho House has expanded to a chain of over 27 clubs each of which generate roughly $25m of revenues. It plans to open another 16 over the next two years as well as expanding into temporary office space taking it into competition with rivals such as WeWork. At its IPO this year it raised over $400m for expansion.

Although it is not profitable yet there is no question that it has come up with something new. Lots of cities have members’ clubs and of course London New York and many others have had the fustier gentleman’s variety since Victorian times. But a global chain with a global brand is something new – and could be very profitable if it can be made to work.

The problem though is that that will be lot harder in practice than it is in theory. Right now Soho House faces what is just about the hardest task in business: it has to take exclusivity and turn it into a huge business. The two may seem incompatible. If you are exclusive people want to belong but there are not many spaces. Once you become a mass-market product there are plenty of spaces but no one wants to join because it has lost its cachet. Soho House could be caught out by that contradiction: it has to expand to make profits but expanding may also kill off the brand.

Follow Mercedes not Thorntons

It is not impossible. LVMH has been doing it for years and made itself into one of Europe’s biggest firms in the process. The French company owns brands such as Louis Vuitton Moët & Chandon Dior Marc Jacobs and Bulgari. It has managed to keep all of them expanding while maintaining their exclusive status. Mercedes has managed it as well: it sells more than two million new vehicles every year but a Merc is still a very classy car. Apple seems to be pulling off the same trick.

But it is not easy and lots of firms have not managed it. When it was owned by Ford Jaguar produced a series of mediocre models that trashed the brand. It is hard to imagine anyone feels especially exclusive in a Ralph Lauren Polo shirt anymore or one by Pierre Cardin. A bottle of Jacob’s Creek wine isn’t going to impress your dinner party guests especially and neither will a Jamie Oliver sauce. Over the years many brands have been pushed out into the mass market and slapped as a quick label on lots of products. It’s not long before you become about as stylish as Brut aftershave or a box of Thorntons.

A very delicate balance has to be maintained in other words. If Soho House can work out how to do that it can build a huge company. Shareholders are staking a lot on Soho House being one of the tiny handful that manage it.",,,,,,,,,

(Full disclosure: PYMNTS is Boston-based. We’ll try to control the Tom Brady jibes. No promises.)

Thursday’s game is slated for Florida’s Raymond James Stadium site of Super Bowl LV in February 2021 where said quarterback was annoyingly victorious with a new team. Those attending will enter a stadium on the cutting-edge of pandemic payments.

Think of it as the digital shift of football making it more of a customer experience than a nuisance.

Tampa’s NBC affiliate WFLA-8 reported in August that “fans can expect to see many of the same COVID-19 safety protocols that were implemented last season … things like mobile ticketing cashless concessions and touchless devices inside bathrooms.”

Visa reupped its contract with the NFL back in 2019 at which time Lynne Biggar Visa’s chief marketing and communications officer said “Looking ahead we see a cashless future for NFL fans where events including future Super Bowls are digitally creating a more secure and seamless payment environment for fans and concessionaires alike.”

At Super Bowl LV that included the use of reverse ATMs for loading cash onto prepaid cards for stadium concessions. This and more is found in “Visa’s Guide to Touchless Payments: A Key to the Return of Live Events” which breaks down six steps to touchless payments for all stadiums.

A key discovery from Super Bowl LV: people spend more on cashless concessions. Keep that in mind as we map out a playbook for the 2021 NFL season and its new commerce characteristics.

Fantasy Football Filling a Void

For the millions who can’t be there for the Sept. 9 kickoff there’s the infinite world of online fantasy football. Major player DraftKings got out in front of the action with its tempting NFL $5M Fantasy Football Millionaire contest sure to draw virtual crowds and digital dollars.

Not to be bested Fanduel is hawking its online sports betting capability currently legal in 11 states and its Daily Fantasy sportsbook available in 44 states at this writing.

And there’s always TV. On Thursday (Sept. 2) CNET offered its lineup of picks for the best options — streaming and otherwise — to follow the NFL action as it happens.

As for the Fantasy Sports & Gaming Association (FSGA) their position is clear: the advocacy group is declaring in a series of position papers that “sports betting must be mobile” arguing that “unlike brick-and-mortar sportsbooks mobile sportsbooks require every person to sign up for an account which includes a rigorous identity verification process.”

We didn’t expect AML/KYC to extend to fantasy football but we didn’t expect Brady to quit the Pats. Point is there are no sure things in sports wagering or sports heroes. Right TB-12?

Someone should change that to “TBD.” But we digress.

Forewarned is forearmed so maybe check out these tips from Sporting News on fantasy football auction dollar values and navigating the endless combinations thereof.

Gridiron Glory Tackles Real-Time Payments

In whatever way one wagers this NFL season the winners want to get paid fast. It’s a byproduct of the digital shift with real-time payments (RTP) squarely on the 10-yard line.

In a recent chat with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster The Clearing House’s Senior Vice President of Products and Strategy Steve Ledford said: “Payments are payments — when they go through a network originated by a treasury management bank they all kind of look alike. It’s how the payments are being used and integrated with what the customer is doing — that’s where the creativity comes in like what Fifth Third has done with Mazooma with gaming and sports betting. We’re happy to see folks using the network in ways we never would have dreamed.”

Just like so many of us never dreamed that a certain quarterback would leave a certain New England football franchise that shall remain nameless. If you’re truly curious Patriots GM Bill Belichick was asked in a recent presser about the team’s ongoing quarterback snafus. In Belichickian fashion he gave this loquacious reply to Sports Illustrated: “Yeah I don’t know.”

For those who follow the sport — and this team — it bears noting that Belichick’s Machiavellian maneuvering reared its head again in August with the sudden sacking of presumptive QB Cam Newton. Mac Jones is the Pats’ new starter. Incidentally Mac is “Cam” spelled backward.

Seriously Bill?

That could be why USA Today Sports said: “Bill Belichick is an absolute savage. When he’s ready to part ways with a player he’ll just do it. In the blink of an eye. No questions asked.”

Not our words. We have journalistic objectivity even about you-know-who and what’s-his-face.

Brady who has since been vaccinated told the newspaper that he has concerns about how the league will handle the pandemic in the coming season which kicks off Thursday when the Buccaneers host the Dallas Cowboys and believes it could be an even bigger story than in 2020.

“I think it’s going to be challenging this year” Brady said. “I actually think it’s going to play more of a factor this year than last year just because of the way what we’re doing now and what the stadium is going to look like and what the travel is going to look like and the people in the building and the fans.

“It’s not like last year although we’re getting tested like last year. It’s going to be I definitely think guys are going to be out at different points and we’ve just got to deal with it.”

No team has repeated as NFL champions since the Brady-led New England Patriots hoisted the Lombardi Trophy after the 2003 and ‘04 seasons yet a compelling argument can be made that no reigning champ since has been more equipped to break the trend than this year’s Bucs.

Brady who turned 44 in August is showing no signs of growing old. And with all 22 starters returning the seven-time Super Bowl winner has a plethora of offensive playmakers at his disposal as well as one of the league’s top defenses to help him.

Despite not having training camp preseason games and a normal offseason to prepare for his first year with Tampa Bay due to the pandemic Brady threw for 4633 yards 40 touchdowns and just 12 interceptions in 2020. He passed for another 1061 yards and 10 TDs against three interceptions in four playoff wins.

What has also emerged is another side of Brady who appears to be enjoying himself a lot more than he displayed publicly during a 20-year stint with the Patriots.

Asked if that can be attributed to getting older a change in environment or desire to connect more with fans the quarterback said it might be “all of the above.”

“It’s nice that I’ve found my voice more” Brady said. “I really enjoy being around my teammates my coaches. It’s been a different environment ... playing with this group of guys.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmN1cnluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzA1L3RvbS1icmFkeS1oYWQtY292aWQtMTktaW4tZmVicnVhcnktYWZ0ZXItc3VwZXItYm93bC1ib2F0LXBhcmFkZS10YW1wYS1iYXktdGltZXMtcmVwb3J0cy_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVyY3VyeW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMDUvdG9tLWJyYWR5LWhhZC1jb3ZpZC0xOS1pbi1mZWJydWFyeS1hZnRlci1zdXBlci1ib3dsLWJvYXQtcGFyYWRlLXRhbXBhLWJheS10aW1lcy1yZXBvcnRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Brady had Covid-19 in February after Super Bowl boat parade paper reports,"Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady had Covid-19 in February shortly after the Super Bowl championship boat parade and is now vaccinated the Tampa Bay Times reported Saturday.

“You guys beat Covid last year. It’s still around. You’ve had it?” reporter Rick Stroud asked.

“Yeah” Brady said according to the Times.

“And I think it’s going to be challenging this year” he continued. “I actually think it’s going to play more of a factor this year than last year just because of the way what we’re doing now and what the stadium is going to look like and what the travel is going to look like and the people in the building and the fans.”

“It’s not like last year although we’re getting tested like last year. It’s going to be I definitely think guys are going to be out at different points and we’ve just got to deal with it.”

Brady’s comments come a week ahead of the start of the National Football League’s regular season. The NFL carried out last season under strict Covid-19 safety protocols including constant testing required mask usage and limited contact with the outside public.

This season some of those rules have been scaled back for players who are vaccinated as part of the NFL’s plan to encourage vaccinations and better ensure every game is played.

Brady appears to be vaccinated as Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said Thursday that the team was “100% vaccinated” including all the coaches and players.

The 44-year-old star quarterback won his seventh Super Bowl championship in February with a 31-9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. The Bucs then celebrated with a boat parade on February 10 during which Brady tossed the championship trophy from one boat to another.

It’s not clear when Brady was vaccinated. At the time of the boat parade early in the US vaccine rollout the vaccine was generally only available for people over 65 and younger people with pre-existing conditions.

A representative for Brady did not respond to a request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMDExODA3LXRvbS1icmFkeS1zaGVkcy1rbmVlLXNsZWV2ZS1hZnRlci0xMy15ZWFycy1pbS1ub3QtZ29pbmctdG8tdHVybi1pbnRvLW1pY2hhZWwtdmlja9IBjgFodHRwczovL3N5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmJsZWFjaGVycmVwb3J0LmNvbS9hbXAvMTAwMTE4MDctdG9tLWJyYWR5LXNoZWRzLWtuZWUtc2xlZXZlLWFmdGVyLTEzLXllYXJzLWltLW5vdC1nb2luZy10by10dXJuLWludG8tbWljaGFlbC12aWNrLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Brady Sheds Knee Sleeve After 13 Years: 'I'm Not Going to Turn into Michael Vick',"Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images

Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady said he's planning to play the 2021 NFL season without a sleeve on his left knee for the first time in 13 years.

Brady told Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times in an interview released Saturday he used the sleeve for stability dating back to his time with the New England Patriots but no longer feels it's necessary after offseason surgery to repair a torn MCL he dealt without throughout last year. Still don't mistake him as a serious running threat:

""It's good for me to feel like I can move around freely. I had a knee sleeve on for 13 years. Just that little bit of compression keeps a hamstring from working the right way. You try to compress the knee to keep it more stable but then you're also compressing the quad. This is the first time that I've been able to run and not think about it. I'm not going to turn into Michael Vick out there but at least I'm not going to be super restricted.""

The 44-year-old three-time NFL MVP guided the Bucs to a Super Bowl championship in his first year with the franchise after six titles across two decades with the Pats. His seven rings are the most by a player in league history.

While Brady has long pointed toward trying to play until he's 45 now that he's within one year of that goal and still playing at an elite level he's not putting a timetable on his NFL career.

""Hopefully I'll be here a long time"" he told Stroud. ""For many years.""

Brady completed 65.7 percent of his throws for 4633 yards with 40 touchdowns and 12 interceptions during the regular season last year. He added 10 TD throws during the team's playoff run.

The University of Michigan product has never been much of a running threat—his career high is 110 rushing yards compared to 1039 for Vick one of the most dynamic athletes in NFL history—but the future Hall of Famer has still made plays in short-yardage situations including 25 rushing scores.

A little more mobility in the pocket can only help as he looks to extend his career as long as possible which could include at least a few more postseason appearances with the Buccaneers who return virtually every key player from last season's title squad."

GPU prices have reached an all-time low back in July and everything seemed to be recovering but it looks like the second rally of Ethereum has started and shows no signs of slowing down: which has historically spelled disaster for GPU prices.

I tweeted back in August that the GPU party is over as far as I can see and will no longer advise people to wait before buying. It was clear almost a month ago that the forecasted trend was going up again and it has materialized almost to a tee in September 2021. ETH has crossed $3900 and with it the wider cryptocurrency market has gone up again and profitability has almost doubled since early August.

But on the Nintendo Switch the Crysis 2 remake runs surprisingly well and thus presents a good opportunity for fans to experience the first-person shooter once again.

4 Reviews

Owners of the Nintendo Switch handheld console (from US$299 on Amazon) can play more and more former top titles on their portable gaming console. Even games that at the time of their release needed more performance than the contemporary PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles could provide now find their way to the Switch. Enter Crysis 2 the middle child of Crytek's shooter trilogy which is being remastered and re-released for the PC and modern console platforms.

Digital Foundry have now got their hands on the golden release version of Crysis 2 for the Switch and as usual they put the game through their rigorous testing and made a video to present their findings. They found out that in docked mode Crysis 2 usually runs at a resolution of 900p on the Nintendo Switch while the resolution drops to 720p in portable mode. Only in some very busy scenes the game's resolution can decrease to 520p and 400p respectively. But the most important fact is that Crysis 2 runs at a very stable 30fps on the Nintendo Switch.

This is a day and night difference to the original console version of the game which technically overwhelmed PS3 and Xbox 360 consoles and therefore often dropped below 15fps or even further. Since the Switch edition of Crysis 2 also offers higher-resolution textures in addition to the smoother frame rate the soon to be released Crysis 2 remaster for the Nintendo Switch is a great opportunity for gamers to experience the shooter either for the first time or once again.",,,,,,

Mumbai-based Anarock which is one of the leading housing brokerage firms in the country had clocked an 18 per cent growth in its revenue at around Rs 305 crore during the 2020-21 financial year despite the pandemic.

In an interview with PTI Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri said ""Housing demand bounced back strongly both after the first and second wave of the COVID. The recovery happened much faster than our expectations.""



Asked about the company's revenue outlook in FY22 Puri said the company is expecting strong growth in turnover on improved housing sales driven by pent up demand and low interest rate on home loans.

""We are targeting to achieve a revenue of around Rs 400-450 crore from our housing brokerage business and other consultancy services in offices capital market hotel malls and project management among others"" he said.

Puri said a significant revenue will also come from its joint venture firm with UK-based Mace.

The JV formed in July 2020 provides project management services to Indian real estate developers and infrastructure firms.

On the market Puri said the size of the residential real estate market has shrunk from the pre-COVID level but developers with good execution track record have performed well and their sales bookings numbers have grown.

He expects a strong housing demand during the upcoming festive season as it was seen during the last year.

""People are looking to upgrade their homes to meet the requirement of additional space. The demand for second home at hills and other tourist destinations have also increased"" Puri said.

Quoting its recent survey with CII Puri said nearly 80 per cent respondents prefer to buy ready-to-move-in and nearing completion (maximum one year) units.

During the 2020-21 financial year Anarock had sold 14700 units worth Rs 16240 crore on behalf of the developers as against 12710 units worth over Rs 11000 crore in the previous fiscal.

Anarock which has an employee base of around 1800 across its offices in India and the Middle East was profitable during the last fiscal.

In the last fiscal Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune property markets were major contributors to its revenue driven by the stamp duty reduction by the Maharashtra government.

Anarock was formed by Puri in April 2017 after serving as a country head in a global real estate consultancy firm for a decade.

It has offices in all the major cities of India and also two offices in the UAE to tap non-resident Indians looking to buy real estate in India.

Unlike the founders he freed his slaves,"CNN —

It was 230 years ago Sunday that Robert Carter III the patriarch of one of the wealthiest families in Virginia quietly walked into a Northumberland County courthouse and delivered an airtight legal document announcing his intention to free or manumit more than 500 slaves.

He titled it the “deed of gift.” It was by far experts say the largest liberation of Black people before President Abraham Lincoln signed the District of Columbia Emancipation Act and Emancipation Proclamation more than seven decades later.

On September 5 1791 when Carter delivered his deed slavery was an institution a key engine of the new country’s economy. But many slaveholders – including founding fathers George Washington Thomas Jefferson and James Madison who knew Carter – had begun to voice doubts.

That was the extent of their umbrage.

Chattel slavery was wrong the men said but they supposedly worried it was not practical to abolish the institution without societal and economic consequences.

“As it is we have the wolf by the ear and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale and self-preservation in the other” Jefferson wrote a fellow politician almost 30 years after Carter’s deed of gift.

Yet Carter had provided them a blueprint not only for freeing their slaves but for ensuring the freedmen could sustain themselves even prosper and integrate into society. Washington freed his slaves after death. Jefferson freed only 10 people of the hundreds he enslaved.

Today descendants of both Carter and the men and women he freed say more must be done to propel the largely uncelebrated deed of gift into the national conscience.

Meriwether Gilmore who grew up in Westmoreland County where Carter’s Nomini Hall estate once spanned 2000 acres is related to Carter on her mother’s side. Her sister is named after his mother and oldest daughter Priscilla. Her father worked with Black churches in the area to commemorate the deed of gift’s bicentennial in 1991.

“I think the story of Robert Carter III is incredibly important” she said “and not just to glorify another rich White man but to show how personal convictions can be stronger than the status quo that doing the right thing is often hard but important and that people matter – that people are more important than the work that they perform.”

For Thomas Duckenfield there’s also a lesson in freedom’s influence on generations. The Washington DC attorney and government contractor descends from the Thompsons and Newmans of whom 50 were listed in Carter’s deed of gift.

Since age 12 Duckenfield has enjoyed genealogy. At first he focused on his father’s side of the family. He had just delved into his mother’s side when she brought him a newspaper clipping about “a twilight ceremony on a torch-lit clover field near the site of Nomini Hall.”

“Some of the names sound like the ones you come tell me about at dinner after you’ve done some research” the 57-year-old recalled his mother saying of the event spearheaded by Gilmore’s father Frank Delano of Warsaw Virginia.

“For African Americans you hold your breath before the 1870 Census” Duckenfield said explaining that records on slaves are shoddy. But examining his mother’s family tree he was surprised to see the “Thompson and Newman lines break through – 1860 1850 all the way back to 1800. I knew these people were free African Americans back to at least 1800.”

Duckenfield wrote Delano who mailed him a copy of the deed of gift. He later visited Delano and began collecting government records in Westmoreland County.

“I was able to identify folks I had found in census records so I began building out their lives and how the family grew their occupations from one decade to next” he said. “I was just awestruck this even had taken place.”

In 1850 Census documents he noticed his ancestors and adjoining families had two parents a rarity in an era when slaveholders ripped families apart. Tax records from 1880 onward indicate a trend of education land ownership and gainful employment – not just in planting and agriculture but an array of occupations.

His ancestors had wills and passed on wealth he said. By the 1930s they were graduating from colleges and entering the teaching and nursing professions. In the 1950s women in his family were attaining a variety of professional degrees.

“I think that we who are descended from that manumission had advantages in the sense that we were positioned maybe to be the first to achieve wealth” the lawyer told CNN. “Yes we benefited from having been manumitted by Robert Carter III.”

‘A pilot for mass emancipation’

Delano wasn’t available for an interview due to his health but Gilmore said her father who has been passionate about civil rights going back to his University of Virginia days in the 1960s always had a strong interest in Carter. He was so impressed with the ancient poplars lining the drive to Nomini Hall that he planted trees along the driveway to their old home she recalled.

Gilmore came across the deed of gift while taking an African American history class her senior year in high school she said. She “felt really passionate about finding those lost stories – and I’m sure that my dad reminded me that we had some of those stories right at home in Westmoreland County.” She continued looking for those stories in graduate school focusing her master’s thesis on a Jim Crow housing ordinance in Ashland Virginia where she lives now.

For Gilmore and others it’s a mystery that the legacies of Carter and his deed of gift remain hidden in history.

To grasp the oddness of his erasure it’s necessary to understand his lofty station among the Virginia gentry of his day. He counted Washington’s half-brother Lawrence James Madison and Thomas Jefferson as friends; he regularly dined with and loaned money to the latter. Washington himself was a neighbor and Robert E. Lee’s mother was the great granddaughter of his grandfather Robert “King” Carter.

In 1750 Robert Carter III planted poplars along the drive to Nomini Hall seen here in 2014. Tutor Philip Vickers Fithian wrote of them: ""These Rows of Poplars form an extremely pleasant avenue & at the Road through them the House appears most romantic at the same time that it does truly elegant."" Courtesy of Northern Neck of Virginia Historical Society

King Carter was a man of enormous wealth and power a colonial governor who owned about 1000 slaves and more than 300000 acres of land. He died in 1732 about three months after Carter III’s father leaving the boy with a fortune. Carter III was much wealthier than the younger Washington and Jefferson. The sprawling Nomini Hall which is tough to locate on a map today was just one of his 16 plantations.

A religious wanderer drawn later in life to integrated churches Carter III was not the first to free his slaves. Others middle-class Quakers and Baptists among them had released a few slaves here a few there but none rivaled Carter’s deed which established a schedule to free 511 slaves starting with the oldest and later their children.

Carter also allowed the freedmen to choose their last names so they could keep families together and pass down wealth. He ensured they had salable skills arranged for them to buy or lease land and bought their wares. He also spent a great deal on transporting them from his plantations to the Northumberland courthouse and on lawyers to guarantee his heirs – some none too happy he was paring their inheritance – didn’t undo his wishes.

“Carter’s plans look more like a pilot for mass emancipation” Andrew Levy a professor at Butler University told CNN. “He was having to think through these issues.”

A noble act went unheralded…

So how has this great manumission remained largely unknown outside of a handful of history buffs and the growing body of descendants? There are theories.

One is that Carter shunned attention as evidenced by his unmarked grave at Nomini Hall. Gilmore struggled to find “personal writings that would speak to his feelings on the issue” while writing her high school paper she recalled.

A certificate of freedom for one of the freedmen reads ""Dennis Johnston a Male Negro aged about twenty seven years of dark Complexion five feet ten or eleven inches stout and well made liberated By Benjamen (sic) Dawson trustee for Robert Carter by Deed dated the 3rd day of November 1799 and duly recorded in the County Court of Frederick. Registered this 2nd day of February 1809."" Fred Barr Collection/Stewart Bell Jr. Archives/Handley Regional Library

A platitude is the only clue Carter left in the deed: “I have for some time past been convinced that to retain them in Slavery is contrary to the true Principles of Religion and Justice and that therefor (sic) it was my duty to manumit them.”

Another hypothesis is that unlike wealthy contemporaries such as Jefferson Madison and Washington Carter was not great at politics and thus didn’t inspire their enduring legend. A third postulation is the manumission was so deeply unpopular – neighbors complained and one threatened to torch Carter’s home – it didn’t compel much documentation. A brief in a Richmond newspaper constitutes the bulk of the coverage.

Levy whose books include a biography of Carter “The First Emancipator” has another suspicion: America doesn’t care – because it’s inconvenient.

“It blows an enormous hole in this legacy we’re trying to balance for these founders” he said.

As Levy sees it American history feebly attempts to level the founding fathers’ fondness for freedom with their ownership of humans by uncritically parroting their assertions that there was no pragmatic way to emancipate hundreds of thousands of slaves. Slavery was a necessary evil to hear the founders tell it.

“If Carter is the anti-Jefferson” Levy wrote in his book “the man who did not lack the will to free his own slaves but who did lack the vision and clarity to make his love of freedom eloquent then the Deed of Gift is the anti-Declaration of Independence a document that makes liberty look dull but which is so absent of loopholes and contradictions that no result but liberty could prevail.”

The Northern Neck of Virginia Historical Society has been honoring those manumitted by Carter since 2008. A highlight of the 2016 ceremony was the unveiling of a highway marker which the society secured funding for.

Many have tried to raise awareness of Carter’s counterculture stance on slavery going back to his children’s tutor. Living at Nomini Hall in 1773 Philip Vickers Fithian marveled over how the generous but eccentric aristocrat weekly allotted each slave 16 pints of dry corn and a pound of meat.

“I make no Doubt at all but he is by far the most humane to his Slaves of any in these parts! Good God! are these Christians?” Fithian wrote in his diary.

… but not for lack of trying

Rebecca Ebert an archivist at Handley Regional Library System in Winchester Virginia about 140 miles from Nomini Hall took interest in Carter in the early 1980s while researching the freedmen of Frederick County home to one of Carter’s plantations. She later did her master’s thesis on the topic.

“As I was doing research on free Blacks in the area I found many of them had been freed by Robert Carter III which led me to ask ‘Who was Robert Carter?’” she said.

She later directed John Barden to various research. The historian who spoke at the 1991 bicentennial devoted almost 200 pages of his 730-page doctoral dissertation to listing 625 slaves and descendants freed by the deed of gift providing biographical details gleaned from tax and court records.

This proved useful to researchers as well as descendants trying to trace their family lineage back to the enslaved. Reading the copy of the deed Barden sent her about six years ago Chrystal Gaskins 49 of Spotsylvania Virginia discovered her family had ties with the Gaskinses Harrises and Robinsons – surnames encompassing more than 80 of Carter’s slaves – as well as tangential links to other lines.

“A lot of us went back and we are mostly double if not three times related back into the families” said Gaskins who manages a branch of a rental car company.

The more she learned the more she felt detached from other independence celebrations she said. Gaskins is now organizing the paperwork to propose a state proclamation recognizing the manumission’s anniversary as a holiday an idea that came to her in a dream she said.

“What irritated me was Juneteenth. Got under my skin. … It’s not our holiday” she said. “For the 500-plus of us that were freed 72 years before Lincoln’s emancipation Juneteenth don’t have nothing to do with us.”

She’s not the only one trying to lift the legacies of Carter the deed and those who were freed.

The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation has held educational events (Carter owned a home in Williamsburg) and the Northern Neck of Virginia Historical Society of which bicentennial organizer Delano is a lifetime member is in its 14th year honoring those freed in Carter’s manumission (this year’s date has not been set due to uncertainties surrounding Covid-19) said executive director Kathy Schuder.

Donna Andresen president of the Carter Society is busy planning a 20th anniversary reunion in Montross Virginia later this month. During the five-day retreat Carter descendants will visit the Carters’ graves at Nomini Hall before heading to the slave cemetery across the street for readings and a wreath laying the Grand Island Nebraska woman said. She described the event as “a special time when we can honor those enslaved that were part of Nomini Hall and the Carter family.”

‘I wanted all the descendants to have that experience’

LaTonya Lawson-Jones of Baltimore Duckenfield’s second cousin and a descendant of multiple families freed by Carter left a 20-year career in information technology three years ago. She now works full time on the Nomini Hall Slave Legacy Project an educational endeavor but also a genealogical resource helping descendants navigate the dizzying lineages that spring from the deed of gift.

“When I first saw the deed of gift with my ancestors’ names … it did something for me. It was a moment” Lawson-Jones said. “It was difficult but it was necessary. It was one of those moments that makes you say ‘Wow my ancestors were freed by this document and it still exists’ and I wanted all the descendants to have that experience.”

One such descendant Rosalind Bauchum of Grandview Missouri began tracing her family history years ago to educate her family namely her ailing father. The deed of gift assisted her work for a book on her ancestors the Gumbys 11 of whom Carter freed.

The retired researcher teaches genealogy at Western Baptist Bible College and enjoys connecting Gumbys who have lost track of their roots. Her thirst for family history may be genetic. Before he was freed in 1800 Thomas Gumby asked the Carter family tutor to draw up a record of his family and offered a bounty of eggs apples potatoes – “anything we can get for you Master!” – when Fithian obliged the tutor once wrote.

“I try to talk the deed of gift wherever I go just to keep his information alive” Bauchum said. “It made me realize what freedom meant back then.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5vcnRoZXJuLWlyZWxhbmQtNTg0MTI5NDLSATtodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY28udWsvbmV3cy91ay1ub3J0aGVybi1pcmVsYW5kLTU4NDEyOTQyLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'I found out I had five siblings when I was 73',"""We then saw a woman drive up and we knew straight away that it was my daddy's sister she just got out of the car and they both just hugged each other there and then by a busy roundabout.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL21pc3Npc3NpcHBpc2NvcmVib2FyZC5jb20vdmljLXN1dHRvbi1yb2JlcnQtZHVtYXMtanItc2NvcmUtdGhyZWUtdG91Y2hkb3ducy1lYWNoLW1hZGlzb24tY2VudHJhbC1kZWZlYXRzLWJyYW5kb24tNDItMTktd2l0aC1waG90by1nYWxsZXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VIC SUTTON ROBERT DUMAS JR.

It's always wild to spot former child stars in the er wild.

And the nostalgia was real when Two and a Half Men alum Angus T. Jones was snapped last week by celebrity photographers for the first time in almost five years. The actor now 27 years old was spotted in Los Angeles bearded and barefoot!

At age 10 the former child star rose to fame playing Jake Harper Charlie Sheen's character's nephew and Jon Cryer's character's son on the '00s CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men. In 2012 Jones then one of the highest-paid TV actors and at the peak of his fame publicly criticized the show in a video filmed for Alabama-based church Forerunner Chronicles.

He later apologized for his words and soon left his regular cast role although he did return for the series finale in 2015. But aside from an appearance on Louis C.K.'s comedy miniseries Horace and Pete in 2016 Jones never acted onscreen again."

The rally was held on the corner of Route 14 and Main Street in Crystal Lake around 12 p.m. Saturday.

Dozens of demonstrators held signs and American flags in front of the Wendy’s protesting Illinois’ mask mandates for schools and businesses.

Adults and even children held signs referencing “unmask the kids” and “unmask our children.”

“We will not be silent we will not be masked” one protestor’s sign read.

A reporter with the Northwest Herald said on Twitter that a group of people who were maskless walked into several stores in Crystal Lake around 3:30 p.m. Saturday following the roadside protest.

The group entered Best Buy Ross Dress for Less TJ Maxx and Ulta Beauty to protest the state’s mask mandate the Northwest Herald reported.

The group of people entered Steinhafels a furniture store but employees kicked them out for refusing to wear a mask.

Video from a Northwest Herald reporter showed the protesters chanting “USA USA” on their way out of the store.

Employees at World Market refused to even let the protesters into their store and an argument took place at the entrance.

The store called the Crystal Lake Police Department the Northwest Herald reported.

“We don’t have to do what [Gov.] Pritzker is trying to force us to do” Joshua Alvarado of Rolling Meadows told the Northwest Herald. “He doesn’t have the authority to tell me what to do with myself.”

On August 14 a few dozen demonstrators gathered in Crystal Lake to protest Illinois’ mask mandate for schools.

That protest also took place on the corner of Route 14 and Main Street in Crystal Lake.

“Free their faces hearts and minds! They are our future! What are we teaching them?! Masks are child abuse!” one man’s sign read.

Some of the protesters took issue with Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker saying “this mask is as useless as our governor” and another sign saying “fire Pritzker.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sYXRpbWVzL25hbWUvbWVydmluLW1vcnJpcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xNjgxNjI0M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mervin Morris Obituary (1920 - 2021) - San Francisco CA - Los Angeles Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/latimes/name/mervin-morris-obituary?id=16816243 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sYXRpbWVzL25hbWUvbWVydmluLW1vcnJpcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xNjgxNjI0M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHkxMDAuY29tL3ZpcmFsL3dvbWFuLW1hbi1maWxtaW5nLXN0b3JlLXRpa3Rvay1iMTkxNDMwMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman chases man out of store after she caught him filming her,"A woman who claims she allegedly caught a fellow shopper “crouching down behind” while filming her has exposed the stranger in a number of TikTok's.

During a shopping trip to a Ross department store TikToker @gretchennweenie captured the moment she confronted the man and demanded him delete his recordings.

But it was the aftermath of the confrontation that went viral which showed the man promptly headed for the store’s exit. Meanwhile the TikToker is heard notifying staff members of what had happened.

Perhaps flustered by the situation the man was so keen to leave that he forgot he was still holding a candle that he allegedly hadn’t paid for.

“Excuse me he was recording me and he has a bunch of videos of me” she says and adds text to the video that reads: “This guy was so scared of me he didn’t notice he was stealing a candle.”

This video has since between viewed over 680000 times with 83000 likes.

Previous footage from the incident also features on @gretchennweenie’s page as she filmed herself approaching the man and demanding he deletes the video’s he allegedly took of her.

One post shows the woman demanding to see the man’s phone while another customer claims to have seen the man taking pictures of the TikToker and can be heard saying “Yes you were I saw you.”

@gretchennweenie I didn’t noticed he was recording me till a girl saw him crouching down taking videos #fyp part 1 of 3

In another post the woman asks: “Let me see” and tells the stranger: “That is so uncomfortable that you are doing that.”

The man replies: “My bad...I’ll delete them OK” as he is seen selecting a number of videos on his phone. The TikToker says “Delete all of them and I will report you what’s your name?”

The man does not reveal his identity but continues to look at his phone as she says “You’re f***ing sick dude. You’re sick.”

The camera then pans to the man’s phone to show he’s deleting the clips and when the man begins to walk away the TikToker follows him and continues to berate him.

“This guy was f***ing recording me f***ing sicko” and warns she will report him for his actions.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff predicted a permanent shift to remote work warned the pandemic will continue indefinitely and underlined the importance of vaccines and testing in a Yahoo Finance interview this week.

The billionaire owner of Time magazine also trumpeted Roblox urged executives to cultivate equality and sustainability at their companies and called for greater measures to combat the climate crisis.

Here are Benioff's eight best quotes from the interview lightly edited and condensed for clarity:

1. ""We're not all coming back. About 15% of employees worldwide have come back to the office. Right now a lot of people are working and succeeding at home. They wanna continue to work at home and that should be just all right with CEOs if their employees are productive.""

2. ""I started Salesforce in an apartment in San Francisco. Today I would start it on Slack and that is because my digital space is more important than my physical space. I need to bring everyone together.""

3. ""Vaccines are extremely important. For our Salesforce employees if they wanna come back in the office they have to be vaccinated. Testing is also a critical part of making all of this work.""

4. ""Roblox is a vision for the future of digital interactions. You're creating custom worlds you're creating custom applications but they're all built on a consistent metaverse platform.""

5. ""In this new world if you're not cultivating a beginner's mind as a CEO you're making a mistake. It's one of the reasons why we paid $27 billion for Slack — because we knew every company was gonna have to have a digital HQ. It was a must-have not a want.""

6. ""We're in a pandemic world. This is a forever virus. We're only on the Delta variant — that's only the fourth Greek letter. There's more Greek letters to come there's more variants to come.""

7. ""CEOs need to be focused on their culture their values what is really important to them. Where is trust where is safety where are you with equality where are you with sustainability? These are the core values of a corporation today.""

8. ""We cannot run companies the way they are. Have you noticed the world is on fire? There's fires everywhere we're in a sustainability crisis. We need to sequester 100 gigatons of carbon we need to energize an ecopreneur revolution we need to accelerate the Fortune 500 to net zero and we need to plant a trillion trees.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Finis Conner is the second tech industry veteran to become a Senior Advisor to the project. Former Apple CEO Gil Amelio also joined the team citing its potential role in catalyzing the mass adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology.

Cirus Foundation is developing an accessible onramp to a blockchain Web 3 and what it calls the Ownership Economy. It’s implementing a ground up approach to data ownership through an ecosystem that gives users control over their most important digital asset and allows them to monetize it. This represents a leap forward from the current centralized model of the internet where third parties absorb all the value created by user data.

As the former CEO of a digital storage giant Conner will be key to Cirus’ expansion with strategic insights into scaling hardware production and improving storage solutions. The team is expecting millions to purchase its upcoming plug-and-play router that will connect them to the Cirus Ecosystem where they will benefit from increased security and privacy as well as decentralized storage.

He recently commented on his outlook for the project:

Conner will also help Cirus move from centralized storage to a more decentralized model that better aligns with its goals. As Cirus Co-founder Daniel Bland noted

“Storage is an essential part of computing at any level. As we move on to a decentralized model we’re sure to benefit greatly from the expertise of people like Finis not only with the mass production of our hardware but also from his ideas on how to build better storage solutions.”

These developments will be a step towards what Conner calls personal cloud data storage where users are guaranteed the ownership of their data at all levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Near the centre of Niagara-on-the-Lake Ont. sits the 157-year-old Prince of Wales Hotel. Built of red brick with a carefully restored exterior and manicured flower beds the building is serene and swanky; passersby pause to take photos making sure to include the horse and buggy parked outside.

With rooms costing about $500 a night the Prince is one of three high-end hotels in the picturesque town operated by Lais Hotel Properties Ltd. But while the buildings may emanate a historic vibe their current ownership can be traced not to some Old Canada family but a Hong Kong tycoon best known for publishing a racy muckraking tabloid: Jimmy Lai.

It was that ownership which saw the hotel chain cited in a recent court case in Hong Kong its parent company named as part of an alleged collusion between the defendants and foreign forces to “endanger national security” in the Chinese city.

The accusations concern a crowdfunding campaign – “Fight For Freedom Stand With Hong Kong” – set up in the summer of 2019 to pay for advertisements in major newspapers around the world seeking support from the international community for the city’s pro-democracy movement.

One typical ad which ran in The Globe and Mail urged Canadians to “please stand with us in upholding the heritage of freedom” and called on Ottawa to pass “Magnitsky-style sanctions on those persons responsible for or complicit in suppressing Hong Kongers’ human rights and freedoms.” Similar ads ran in The New York Times Le Monde and other major newspapers.

According to an indictment shared with The Globe one of the primary accounts used for payments was one belonging to Lais Hotel Properties which was linked to around $1-million paid to seven newspapers in Canada the United States the United Kingdom and Japan.

Lais Hotel Properties was bought by Jimmy Lai’s twin sister Si Wai Lai in 1997 and has been controlled by the family ever since. Canadian corporate records list American Mark Simon Mr. Lai’s top assistant as one of the directors of Lais Hotels.

Until June 2020 Royston Chow was also a director. Mr. Chow is one of several executives at Hong Kong’s Next Digital Ltd. the media company founded by Mr. Lai now facing charges under China’s national security law.

Lais Hotel Properties did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Mr. Simon also did not respond to a request for comment.

While the Hong Kong case did not directly involve Mr. Lai it was emblematic of a years-long effort “to construct a grand conspiracy around Jimmy Lai” said Johnny Patterson policy director at Hong Kong Watch a U.K.-based human rights group.

Since Hong Kong was handed over to Chinese rule in 1997 Mr. Lai and his pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper have been consistent critics of the local administration and the authorities in Beijing calling for greater democracy and promoting opposition candidates in elections.

Last year Mr. Lai and several executives at Apple Daily as well as the paper’s parent company Next Digital were all arrested under a draconian national security law imposed on the city by Beijing and the paper has since been forced to close.

The security law was prompted by the anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2019 during which Chinese state media repeatedly denounced Mr. Lai as a “traitor” and alleged he conspired with foreign powers to stoke and direct the increasingly violent unrest.

This Svengali-like image of the 73-year-old tycoon is not in keeping with the facts on the ground. While Apple Daily was a major cheerleader of the protests – even printing signs for people to take to rallies – and Mr. Lai lobbied Western governments to push for greater freedoms in Hong Kong the influence of older pro-democracy figures on the young leaderless movement was very limited. At the height of the unrest even elected opposition lawmakers found themselves ignored by protesters as those lawmakers tried to rein in the violence.

Michael Mo a former district councillor in Hong Kong now living in exile said Beijing was “pointing fingers” at Mr. Lai and his associates as a way of supporting its case that unrest in Hong Kong was inspired by and co-ordinated from outside China.

Blaming Mr. Lai he said in an e-mail was useful “in terms of making the story ‘legitimate’ telling both Hong Kongers and mainland Chinese” that the government’s claims are correct.

One of Mr. Lai’s greatest crimes according to the Chinese and Hong Kong governments was in pushing for sanctions against officials responsible for the crackdown in the city.

While the newspaper ads funded by Stand With Hong Kong were by no means the sole factor several governments did respond to the unrest in Hong Kong with sanctions. The U.S. also passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act which has resulted in penalties against several high-ranking local and Chinese officials.

China’s national security law criminalizes secession subversion and terrorism and makes it illegal to “collude” with foreign forces to call for sanctions with a maximum penalty of life in prison.

In theory the law is not retroactive but activities before its passage in July 2020 can be taken into account by courts. Hong Kong authorities have also taken a wide view as to what constitutes continuing activity such as having lobbied for sanctions that remain in force.

Stand With Hong Kong the crowdfunding campaign describes itself as independent and grassroots. For its 2019 lobbying campaign it raised some US$1.8-million about US$813000 of which was spent on newspaper ads with the remainder used for legal expenses and “advocacy activities” in several countries according to an accounting statement published by the group.

But Hong Kong prosecutors say this crowdfunding concealed the true “masterminds and financial supporters” of the campaign: Mr. Lai and Mr. Simon who sought to get international sanctions passed against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments in order “to force them to accede to their political agenda.”

This accusation was made during the trial of Andy Li and Chan Tsz-wah two activists who were involved in the lobbying campaign. Mr. Li was one of 12 fugitives detained by the Chinese coast guard last year while attempting to flee to Taiwan by speedboat. He served seven months in a Guangdong prison for illegally crossing the border before being returned to Hong Kong to face more charges.

Mr. Li and Mr. Chan both pleaded guilty to the charges of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and endorsed the government’s account of the case. The indictment against them shared with The Globe reads like a who’s who of critics of the Hong Kong government in the U.K. U.S. and Japan all engaged in a sweeping conspiracy overseen by Mr. Lai and Mr. Simon.

This included using bank accounts and businesses in Hong Kong Canada the U.S. and the British Virgin Islands to pay for the newspaper ads and fund other activities prosecutors claim.

In an interview with a local newspaper in Niagara-on-the-Lake when Mr. Lai was arrested in 2020 Bob Jackson chief executive of Lais Hotel Properties said he typically saw Mr. Lai a couple of times a year and corresponded with him occasionally by e-mail.

“We’re praying for him here” Mr. Jackson told the Niagara-on-the-Lake Advance. “With his situation obviously we support him but it doesn’t have an impact on our business.”

But while the connection between Mr. Lai and the hotel group is unequivocal the government’s assertion that Lais Hotels paid for the newspaper ads is much less so. It is unclear on what evidence prosecutors are basing their claims as they would not have access to Lais Hotels’ banking records or those of the newspapers that were paid for the ads.

When The Globe sought clarification from prosecutors about Lais Hotels’ alleged involvement a spokesman for Hong Kong’s Department of Justice said that as “proceedings remain ongoing it is not appropriate … to comment on the matter.”

Finn Lau a founder of Stand With Hong Kong who now lives in exile in the U.K. said he had never heard of the hotel chain before this month.

“I am not aware of it at all” he said. “Andy Li handled the nitty gritty of bank transfer. In essence all financial resources came from public crowdfunding.”

In the case of two ads placed in The Globe records show both were paid for in advance by a “Mr. Li” and there was no record of payments from Lais Hotel Properties Mr. Simon or anyone else associated with the company.

Mr. Lau added that if Mr. Lai a multimillionaire was a secret backer of the campaign “my teams would not need to rely on crowdfunding at all.”

Because the two defendants in the case pleaded guilty the government’s assertions about the payments will not be challenged in court. Mr. Li and Mr. Chan will be sentenced next year following the conclusion of a separate national security case against Mr. Lai.

The allegations may be of potential concern for Lais Hotels however and people associated with the chain. Hong Kong’s national security law is extraterritorial and the offences detailed in the law can in theory be committed by anyone regardless of where they are or what country they are a citizen of.

Mr. Patterson the Hong Kong Watch policy director said it was “quite possible given the absurd extraterritorial nature of the National Security Law that the hotel chain could receive a court summons from Hong Kong” though he added it was doubtful the authorities would find any way of meaningfully drawing Lais Hotel Properties into the case given the chain is based wholly in Canada.

“But it will be interesting to watch and see if they try” he said.

Tri Star Energy a Nashville Tennessee-based energy company and a convenience retailer acquired Herndon Oil and its convenience retail brand Southern Traders the company announced in a press release.

This acquisition includes 13 Southern Traders convenience stores and the Shell-branded fuel distribution business of Herndon Oil.

The release stated that Corner Capital exclusively advised Herndon Oil throughout this acquisition. The purchase price and terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

However Houston County property transfer records filed on Wednesday show Tri-State Energy paid more than $6.15 million for the seven locations around Dothan.

“Herndon Oil is a well-established company whose reputation and core values align nicely with ours. They have great locations many in areas where we do not currently operate” said Steve Hostetter CEO of Tri Star Energy. “Our combined companies will feature some of the best programs and operators in our region allowing us to continue to grow and build the brand in the future.”

According its website Herndon Oil’s beginnings can be traced to the late 1950s when brothers C.S. Herndon and A.W. Herndon both owners of small mom and pop grocery stores decided to supply their own stores with petroleum products rather than purchase them from local petroleum supplier C.C. Murphy. They began with a pickup truck and placed metal barrels in the rear of it to haul their products.

The company which soon started supplying other small stores and farmers was formed with the brothers becoming equal partners. As the business grew with the demand of petroleum products the brothers decided to divide the business. In 1966 Herndon Oil Company became C.S. Herndon Oil Company and A.W. Herndon Oil Company. A.W. Herndon continued to operate in Abbeville and C.S. Herndon relocated to Union five miles south of Abbeville. In the early 1970s the convenience store concept with self-service was introduced to the public and began replacing the full-service station.

A long-term partner in the communities they serve Tri Star Energy said it’s committed to cultivating local jobs local causes superior customer care and integrity across its retail and wholesale operations.

Locally owned and operated Tri Star Energy’s newly combined roster includes more than 1500 employees. The 21-year-old company operates retail convenience stores and premium coffee shops in five states while operating wholesale and commercial fuel operations in 14 states. For more information about Tri Star Energy visit www.TriStarenergy.com.

Tri Star Energy owns and operates Twice Daily and Sudden Service convenience stores. The company also owns premium coffee brand White Bison Coffee including locations throughout Middle Tennessee and North Alabama. Tri Star Energy has been recognized as one of Nashville’s Top Workplaces by The Tennessean the past three years and was recently named one of the Top 25 largest private companies in Nashville by the Nashville Business Journal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiyQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rY3NvdXRoZXJuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS9uZXdzL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMva2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktc291dGhlcm4tYm9hcmQtb2YtZGlyZWN0b3JzLWRldGVybWluZXMtcHJvcG9zYWwtZnJvbS1jYW5hZGlhbi1wYWNpZmljLXJhaWx3YXktY291bGQtcmVhc29uYWJseS1iZS1leHBlY3RlZC10by1sZWFkLXRvLWEtc3VwZXJpb3ItcHJvcG9zYWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KCS News Release Detail,"Kansas City Southern Board of Directors Determines Proposal from Canadian Pacific Railway Could Reasonably Be Expected to Lead to a “Superior Proposal”

Vyvianna Quinonez who is accused of knocking out some of the flight attendant's teeth was charged with assault resulting in serious bodily injury and interfering with flight crew members.

Three of the flight attendant's teeth were chipped — two damaged so badly they needed crowns — and a cut under her left eye needed four stitches the criminal complaint states. She also had a bruised left eye and bruises in the shape of a hand on her forearm and three chipped teeth.

The criminal complaint alleges that during the final descent of the Sacramento to San Diego flight Quinonez unbuckled her seat belt and pulled her tray table down which is in violation of federal regulations. The flight attendant also asked Quinonez to wear her face mask properly. When the attendant returned to her jump seat Quinonez started to film her with her cell phone the complaint said. When Quinonez was approached and questioned she allegedly pushed the flight attendant and then punched her and pulled her hair the complaint states.

Video of the May incident shows a passenger jumping in to stop the 28-year-old. ""Sit down!"" he yelled blocking Quinonez from the bleeding flight attendant. ""Don't you dare touch a flight attendant like that.""

Wednesday's charges come after the Federal Aviation Administration announced earlier this week it has received nearly 4100 reports of unruly passengers since the beginning of the year and almost 3000 reports of passengers refusing to wear masks. The Transportation Security Administration has extended the federal mask mandate onboard to 2022.

The incident is part of a sharp uptick in disruptive passengers on airplanes. So far the FAA is investigating 727 incidents and has requested civil penalties in 143 cases according to data provided by the agency. The FAA has requested a record $1 million in fines against passengers this year including a more than $52000 fine against one traveler. Passengers may appeal the civil fines requested by the FAA and local law enforcement can bring criminal charges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL25ld3Mvdnl2aWFubmEtcXVpbm9uZXotc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWZsaWdodC1hdHRlbmRhbnQtc3VzcGVjdC_SAVlodHRwczovL2hlYXZ5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3Z5dmlhbm5hLXF1aW5vbmV6LXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50LXN1c3BlY3QvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vyvianna Quinonez: Southwest Flight Attendant Attack Suspect Charged,"Vyvianna Quinonez is a woman accused in federal court of attacking a Southwest Airlines flight attendant so violently her teeth were chipped.

She was charged in the United States District court for the Southern District of California with assault resulting in serious bodily injury and interference with flight crew members and attendants. Both are felonies. Her full name is given as Vyvianna M. Quinonez and she is from Sacramento California.

You can read the federal complaint in full here. You can watch the viral video of the attack below. The charges were filed on September 1 2021 although the incident occurred in May.

As a result of the assault the flight attendant S.L. was taken to the hospital and suffered serious bodily injury. Her left eye was bruised and swollen she sustained a cut under her left eye requiring four stitches she had a bruise in the shape of fingers on her right forearm and three of her teeth were chipped with two of them needing replacement by crowns.

Quinonez later claimed she “acted in self defense” the complaint says

Here’s what you need to know:

The Attack Occurred on a Southwest Airlines Flight to San Diego

Play

According to the complaint on May 23 2021 Southwest Airlines Flight 700 was in flight traveling from Sacramento International Airport to San Diego International Airport.

Quinonez is accused of assaulting a flight attendant known only as S.L. in the court documents causing her to suffer serious bodily injury.

The complaint accuses Quinonez of “assaulting and intimidating a flight crew member and flight attendant of Southwest Airlines Flight 700” saying she “interfered with the performance of the duties of the member and attendant.”

The probable cause statement says Quinonez boarded the flight and was seated in an aisle seat in the last row. The victim was a Southwest flight attendant working in the back of the airplane for the duration of the flight. At that time federal rules and regulations required that airplane passengers over the age of 2 wear a face covering over their nose and mouth while flying. Passengers were also required to stow their tray tables and faster their seat belts in preparation for landing.

Susan Marie Stidham who was a passenger on the flight wrote on Facebook the attack occurred “simply because she was asked to put her seatbelt back on. I asked about the injured flight attendant on my return flight and she reportedly has a broken nose injured face and broken teeth. Someone can identify the perp even though she is wearing a mask. Hoping that they will give her jail time and put her on the No Fly list.”

The Incident Started With a Push the Complaint Says

Play

During the plane’s final descent the complaint alleges that Quinonez unbuckled her seat belt and pulled down her tray table.

S.L. approached her and requested that she fasten her seat belt and stow her tray table but the complaint says “Quinonez did not comply.” The flight attendant also instructed Quinonez to wear her facemask properly and then returned to her jump seat for landing.

The complaint alleges that Quinonez began filming S.L. on her cell phone. S.L. again approached Quinonez who “pushed S.L.”

S.L. said “You do not push a flight attendant” or words to that effect.

Around that time another passenger on the airplane began filming the interaction on her cellphone.

“Quinonez stood up and knowingly assaulted S.L. by intentionally punching S.L. in the face and head with a closed fist and grabbing S.L.’s hair” the complaint alleges.

Several other passengers attempted to stop Quinonez by grabbing at her clothing and arm and a male passenger sitting one row ahead of Quinonez in the middle seat across the aisle jumped in between Quinonez and S.L. and instructed Quinonez to sit down.

Quinonez Is From Antelope California and studied at Sierra College and California State University-Sacramento according to her LinkedIn profile. She worked as a server at a Sacramento restaurant.

Passenger Misconduct Incidents Are a Problem

Play

According to NBC 7 San Diego attacks against flight attendants are up.

“Unfortunately this is just one of many occurrences” said Lyn Montgomery Local 556 President of the Transport Workers Union to the television station.

Between April 8 and May 15 2021 alone there were 477 passenger misconduct incidents on Southwest planes Montgomery told NBC 7.

“The passenger repeatedly ignored standard inflight instructions and became verbally and physically abusive upon landing” said the spokesman for the airline Chris Mainz to the television station.

In court documents prosecutors alleged that Quinonez attacked the attendant on the Southwest Airlines plane who lost two teeth and suffered other injuries to her face on the May 23 flight from Sacramento California to San Diego.

A cut under the flight attendant’s left eye required four stitches leaving her swollen and bruised and her right arm was bruised.

Quinonez allegedly attacked the flight attendant after asking her to fasten her seatbelt stow her tray table and properly wear her facemask as the plane began its final descent.

Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images



Many families with children have been removed or asked to leave flights over mask rules.

A family who flew on Southwest said their son struggled with his mask but the airline didn't care.

An industry expert said airlines should use common sense over mask policies for children.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Flying with young children can be a fraught experience at the best of times but it's even harder during a pandemic.

Some passengers say airlines are not treating them fairly. Ryan Whitney Harris said this was the case when her husband their 7-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son traveled from Los Angeles to Nashville Tennessee on June 6.

She said she was in tears after being apprehended by Southwest Airlines' flight attendants because her toddler could not keep his face mask on.

""They never left us alone. The flight attendants were rude and had no care"" she told Insider.

She went to great efforts to try and get her son to keep his mask on ""while he screamed and kicked and cried"" she added.

According to Harris the family's every action was scrutinized. In one instance Harris said she handed her son a bag of sweets so he would just eat and they would be left alone by the airline crew. But she said they never were.

""Your son needs his mask on in between bites"" Harris recalled a flight attendant telling her. ""I kept my mouth shut the whole time because I was afraid we would be kicked off the flight. Since they said if he didn't wear the mask we would.""

Harris said she couldn't accompany her son to the bathroom either. ""They would not allow me to stand with my young child at the bathroom at three years old"" Harris said. ""He was so scared.""

Southwest did not reply to multiple requests for comment by Insider.

Harris complained to the airline and in an emailed response which Insider has viewed it apologized for her experience. ""Crew should not only be consistent but be compassionate. Ultimately I'm sorry if we missed a chance to be of better service to your family"" it said.

Federal regulations state that those who do not comply with mask mandates will be denied travel. But are airlines being heavy-handed when it comes to small children?

Charles Leocha president and co-founder of the Washington D.C. consumer advocacy group Travelers Unite certainly thinks so.







""Airlines that insist on having 2- and 3-year-old children wear masks at all times will always face problems"" he said. ""Treating a 2-year-old like a 30-year-old is foolish and unnatural.""

In April a family was ordered to leave a Southwest flight after their 2-year-old could not keep his mask on.

Michelle Harvey the boy's mother told Fox 7 that she had gotten him to practise wearing a mask before the flight but he threw it off she told the outlet.

When the family boarded her son again threw off the mask. The Harvey's were subsequently kicked off the plane according to the report.

Several similar cases involving Southwest and other airlines made headlines through the summer.

In August a mother said that a flight attendant told her to glue a mask to her toddler's face according to reports. She said she has since received an apology.

Some people have reported much more positive experiences while traveling with children. Lauren Hales her partner her 2-year-old and 3-month-old traveled from London to Portugal on British Airways in June. ""We found flying smooth safe and surprisingly enjoyable"" she told Insider.

Hales said only adults were required to wear face masks. The UK has mask regulations that may differ from other countries.

She said: ""I was really nervous to fly and travel in the midst of a pandemic but it was the staff on the flight who made us all feel comfortable and at ease.""

To reduce the chance of a dispute Leocha suggested that before flying ""parents should help younger children practice wearing masks so kids are comfortable wearing them during flight.""

But he said the responsibility also falls on airlines which ""should allow common sense to prevail."""

Jeff Greenberg/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images



Starbucks workers in New York state have stated their intention to organize a union.

Starbucks says it's proud of the open and honest conversations workers can have about the business.

Some workers say that they do not feel like true partners which is the term the company uses to refer to them.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Starbucks pointedly calls its workers ""partners"" not employees which for Starbucks employees in Buffalo New York who are trying to organize a union which has been a point of contention.

The chain's mission statement reads ""To inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person one cup and one neighborhood at a time."" One of the workers Loretta Scherrer says it isn't living up to this mission.

""From the start of my coffee journey to now I feel that this mission has been forgotten. Instead of nurturing the human spirit we are nurturing our machines for profit"" she said in a statement from Starbucks Workers United.

""The company calls us partners"" Alexis Rizzo a shift supervisor who has worked at Starbucks for six years told Insider. ""We want to be real partners.""

Starbucks says that its business is built on listening to employees.

""Our success is built on a long history of direct engagement and support for the well-being of our now over 400000 partners around the world. We proudly create the space and forums for open and honest conversation as it relates to establishing and maintaining a great work environment"" Starbucks spokesperson Reggie Borges told Insider. ""This includes offering a full suite of benefits for even part-time partners because we know success is best when it's shared. We will continue to empower our partners to constructively use their voice and our local leaders to listen to and address directly the concerns of partners.""

Starbucks employees are called partners because technically they are. Workers get Bean Stock which is Starbucks stock that vests over a two-year period with one half vesting after a year and the rest after two. The shares are Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) which do not carry voting rights.

""We call our employees partners because we are all partners in shared success. Every partner at every level of the company is eligible to receive an annual grant of company stock through our Bean Stock program"" Starbucks' website says.

The workers' concerns mostly revolve around understaffed stores and ingredient shortages. In just 11 months on the job ""I've also seen almost 30 partners leave and working conditions fall to the wayside"" barista Katie Cook said in a statement.

Starbucks stores like most restaurants across the country are facing a labor shortage with difficulty attracting and retaining workers. Baristas have previously told Insider about high turnover and few applicants. Some restaurants are so understaffed that they've been forced to close without any workers while others have turned to incentives like bonuses or free perks for interviewing.

""By forming this union we are telling Starbucks that we want to bring our own chairs to the table the was built upon our backs"" Cook said. Starbucks literally keeps two extra chairs at company meetings and conferences to represent workers and customers a custom started by former CEO Howard Schultz.

Starbucks the global coffee mega-chain doesn’t have “workers” — it only has “partners” or so the company parlance goes.

But for Alexis Rizzo a shift supervisor at a Starbucks store in Cheektowaga New York this label rings hollow. “We’ve always been called partners by the company” said Rizzo but when it comes down to it “we don’t have any voice.”

Jaz Brisack a barista at Starbucks’s Elmwood Village store in Buffalo agrees. “They call us partners and tell us that we’re partners. But there’s no equality so there’s no true partnership.”

This is why they both want a union. “For us” said Rizzo “it’s about becoming real partners and not just figurative partners.”

Rizzo and Brisack are two of 50 workers from the Buffalo area of New York who signed an August 23 letter to Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson declaring that they were organizing a union. They announced themselves as the Starbucks Workers United Organizing Committee and called on Starbucks to sign a set of Fair Election Principles that affirm workers’ right to organize without fear of retaliation.

On Monday August 30 Starbucks Workers United announced that it had officially filed petitions for National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) elections at three stores in Hamburg Cheektowaga and in Buffalo’s Elmwood Village.

Starbucks has over 8000 corporate-owned U.S. stores and none of them are unionized. But management now faces a significant challenge from Starbucks Workers United and their supporters in Buffalo a pro-union city that has recently been on the cutting edge of coffee worker labor organizing.

Organizing the Union

Rizzo said Starbucks employees in Buffalo have long had “small talks” about unionizing but that the time never seemed right. “There’s always been a lot of fear” she said noting the company’s long anti-union history: For decades the company’s executives have opposed unions and been mired in accusations of and judge rulings around unfair labor practices and illegal retaliation against pro-union workers.

But about two months ago pro-union workers and union organizers sensed that the “stirrings were happening” among workers and that a union drive was more possible. Since then said Rizzo “we’ve just been working behind the scenes trying to develop our organizing committee.”

Starbucks workers set about building their union the old-fashioned way: by organizing their co-workers through direct conversations. Many workers know each other across stores through picking up shifts at different locations and this gave organizers a good sense of who might be receptive to joining the organizing committee. Starbucks workers make up “a pretty tight-knit community” said Rizzo. “We really just went around to different stores visiting with people and asking them what they thought” — though they kept the union talk “very covert.”

One pro-union worker that Brisack spoke to was fearful of retaliation but said that “even if she lost her job it would be worth it to be able to try to make the union rather than just burning out and leaving” according to Brisack’s recollection. Another long-time worker told Brisack that “building a union” would be her “legacy at Starbucks.”

Some came to the union in other ways. Brian Murray a barista in Lancaster New York had never been involved in a union drive before. In June he crashed the victory celebration for India Walton Buffalo’s democratic socialist mayoral candidate who shocked the nation by defeating incumbent Byron Brown in the Democratic primary.

The company’s global CEO-to-worker compensation ratio is 1211 to 1.

Some friends he met through the Democratic Socialists of America and a Black Lives Matter rally posted the location of Walton’s party online. “So I just fled there out of the blue” Murray said with a chuckle.

At the party Murray told some people that he worked for Starbucks and they connected him with union organizers. Two months later Murray is now an outspoken member of the organizing committee.

Talking to co-workers and organizing the union has been “really exciting” for him. “Some stores had incredibly high amounts of interest” Murray said. “A lot of the Starbucks in the Buffalo area are very pro-union. A lot of workers have been waiting a long time.”

With momentum growing the union wanted to go public before management got a whiff of things and could retaliate. The current U.S. labor shortage also gave some workers a sense that they have a little more leverage. After forming their 50-person Starbucks Workers United Organizing Committee the workers took the plunge and sent their letter to Johnson on August 23. (The organizing committee now has 75 workers according to Brisack.)

“We Want to Have Our Own Voice and Bargain in Good Faith”

Buffalo Starbucks workers share grievances around a range of issues with understaffing being a major one. “We’re horrifically understaffed almost perpetually” said Rizzo. “We can’t provide a good experience for our customers. I have people waiting in my drive-through for upwards of 20 minutes some days.”

“It’s a really stressful environment from managing trying to have good customer experiences and also be as quick as possible” said Murray. “A lot of workers struggle day to day trying to keep up with the pace.”

But most of all the workers Truthout spoke with say their desire for a union is about having more power on the job and more respect within the company — in other words becoming real “partners” who can bargain as equals with management.

“I wouldn’t have done this for so many years of my life if I didn’t love the company” said Rizzo who has worked at Starbucks for six years. For her having a union means “being able to contribute in a more meaningful way” to the company. “I want to form a better place to work and a better place to visit” she said.

While Starbucks says that its level of compensation and benefits make unions unnecessary — a long-time company line — Rizzo disagrees. “There’s always a need for employees to have a voice” she said.

Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges told Truthout: “Our success is built on a long history of direct engagement and support for the well-being of our more than 400000 partners around the world. So I think from our perspective our goal is to create the space and forums for open and honest conversation as it relates to establishing and maintaining a great work environment.”

However Murray pointed to how in practice many Starbucks employees do not feel their input is seriously included in workplace decisions.

“We have very little control over our workplace” Murray said. “I think a unifying factor is that we want to have our own voice and bargain in good faith with the company.”

He also notes that Starbucks is “making billions right now with the pandemic” and that “workers deserve a share and a say in how that money is divided up since … we’re the ones making the profits for that company.”

As Starbucks’s CEO Johnson made over $47 million in total compensation between 2018 and 2020. The company’s global CEO-to-worker compensation ratio is 1211 to 1.

Drawing Inspiration From SpoT Coffee’s Union Drive

The workers who spoke to Truthout emphasized that the successful union drive at SPoT Coffee a coffee chain concentrated in western New York was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the current Starbucks campaign.

In 2019 inspired by successful union drives at a Rochester SPoT Coffee shop and Gimme! Coffee in Ithaca Buffalo SPoT workers began their own union campaign. For Buffalonians the chain is a cultural mainstay its seats often filled with professors students activists and artists. The unionization drive galvanized support and became a local cause célèbre.

After months of organizing and a boycott to combat the firing of two union supporters workers across four shops voted 43-6 in support of unionizing. In March 2020 the SPoT workers’ first contract went into effect.

Some current Starbucks workers followed and supported the SPoT effort and workers involved in the SPoT campaign are now part of the Starbucks campaign.

The Starbucks and SPoT workers both belong to Workers United Upstate which is part of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).

Before coming to Starbucks Brisack was the lead organizer with Workers United for the SPoT campaign. She became a barista at Starbucks in December 2020.

“I think SPoT showed that barista organizing is a viable project and a project that needs to be industry-wide in order to be able to really raise conditions for all workers in this industry” said Brisack. “I think it also laid an incredible framework for how to do this and what workers could accomplish.”

The Buffalo Starbucks workers have so far garnered national media attention and significant public support from labor leader Sara Nelson to a slew of local elected officials including Congressman Brian Higgins.

In addition to the positive response from the community Rizzo said her regular customers are “overjoyed” about the union drive.

The workers see public support as crucial to their success. “Without it” said Murray “I think the company could get away with a lot more than what they are now.”

Starbucks Has a History of Union-Busting

But if history tells us anything Starbucks is calculating how to bury the union drive.

The company has a long history of resisting unions. An Industrial Workers of the World-led union campaign that began in 2004 surfaced up a number of anti-union measures by Starbucks as I reported at the time in CounterPunch.

In February 2020 an Orlando Florida Starbucks barista claimed he was fired for wanting to organize a union. In the summer of 2021 a judge ruled that Starbucks illegally fired two pro-union baristas in Philadelphia — a ruling that the workers Truthout spoke with brought up.

Rizzo said that Starbucks is currently using gentler methods to dissuade unionization. “I think that our campaign really took them by surprise” she said.

Rizzo said her district manager visited her store after the union went public doing “what seemed a lot like gathering grievances which is not legal.”

The National Labor Relations Acts makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer “to interfere with restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed” when they form unions. This includes employers may not “imply a promise of benefits by soliciting grievances from employees during a union organizing campaign. (However if you regularly solicited employee grievances before the campaign began you may continue that practice unchanged.)”

Rizzo also said that management is scheduling paid “listening sessions” with employees that she believes amount to “thinly veiled” attempts to “sow anti-union rhetoric.”

While Starbucks has beaten back every unionization attempt in the U.S. there is reason to believe that the challenge coming from Buffalo could be different.

When given a chance to respond by Truthout Starbucks spokesman Borges asserted that “listening sessions are part of a regular activity that we do” and that he “wouldn’t necessarily equate listening sessions to a response to the union” and that Starbucks conducts listening sessions “on a consistent basis” and “all over the country.”

But fear of company retaliation has kept some workers who support the union from openly signing the letter to Johnson. Brisack calls it the “biggest challenge” the union faces.

“Workers overwhelmingly are interested in organizing and can name endless things that the union could improve” she said. “So in some ways it’s a hot shop but in other ways people are very afraid of potential retaliation.”

Organizers hope workers interested in joining the union effort will have more job safety now that the union has gone public with a high-profile campaign.

Why It Could Happen in Buffalo

While Starbucks has beaten back every unionization attempt in the U.S. there is reason to believe that the challenge coming from Buffalo could be different.

Though the union hopes to eventually negotiate around specific grievances the campaign isn’t foregrounding things like wages or scheduling but instead more fundamental questions of how power and “partnership” work at Starbucks. This potentially means workers may not be as easily dissuaded from organizing should management offer promotions or financial rewards.

Moreover the Starbucks campaign is occurring against a backdrop of recent successful café worker union drives. Colectivo Coffee with locations in Madison Milwaukee and Chicago voted to unionize in August beating back employer resistance to become the largest unionized coffee chain in the U.S. The past few years have also seen organizing efforts across kindred gig retail and service industries.

And then there’s the city where it’s all going down: Buffalo New York. With relatively high union density in the region and a pro-union political culture Buffalo may be an ideal place to see the first Starbucks union stores. The Starbucks workers also have the precedent of SPoT Coffee Buffalo’s own real-life example of how retail coffee workers can win a union across multiple stores.

Moreover India Walton’s union background and advocacy may aid the organizers. Walton strongly supports the Starbucks workers and attended the union’s August 31 press conference where they discussed their decision to file for NLRB elections in three stores.

If the union succeeds in Buffalo Starbucks stores it may only be a matter of time until the example spreads elsewhere.

Brisack noted that this year marks Starbucks’ 50th anniversary and that the company is sending out anniversary pins and T-shirts to stores to celebrate.

“A lot of us have been thinking that they’ve had 50 years being non-union” she said. “What will the next 50 years be like when we can actually win the union?”

Figs (FIGS -4.09%) is an up-and-coming specialty clothing company that recently went public. I bought shares in it and then had buyer's remorse and got out -- which is not Foolish at all just kind of embarrassing.

It's entirely possible I'll watch on the sidelines as this company becomes a 10-bagger over the next decade. It's happened before. I'm not negative on Figs by any means -- after all I initially bought the stock. So let me put forth the bullish case for the stock and then my reasons for why I'm not an owner.

I love the Starbucks analogy

Starbucks (SBUX 0.57%) took a generic drink -- coffee -- and made it upscale and expensive. It made coffee special. Starbucks does this in a variety of ways. One way is by using foreign languages or at least upscale words. The person who serves you is a barista. We've long had wine snobs. Now we have coffee snobs. ""It's not a large OK? It's a Venti.""

That snob appeal has made Starbucks investors a lot of money.

When you are able to create an upscale brand in a generic sector you can often create joy and happiness for your customer base. When coffee in restaurants is just generic (""I'd like coffee please"") a certain level of mediocrity is expected. Upscale coffee however creates joy as it gives people the opportunity to have something better for just a few dollars more. That's how Starbucks won so many fans. It was a different level of coffee.

Hospital scrubs before Figs are like pre-Starbucks coffee. These are generic uniforms. They are cheap uncomfortable and ugly. So the co-founders of Figs decided that this huge market of consumers (there are 20 million healthcare professionals just in the U.S.) had the money to spend on comfortable scrubs that look and feel good.

A Figs uniform starts at $86. That's four times what the generic version will run you at Walmart (WMT 0.07%). When I was in high school I once got some hospital scrubs to wear (just the shirt) because I thought they looked cool. I wore it once and never wore it again. That shirt was really uncomfortable. Maybe use some kind of cotton next time? It wasn't sandpaper exactly but I didn't like it. So I think Figs is on to something.

I jumped into the stock a little too quickly because I loved the elevator pitch and the numbers were amazing. From 2017 to 2020 the company had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 146% on the top line. In 2020 alone the annual revenue growth rate was 138%. So I was super-excited. Triple-digit revenue growth and it's the Starbucks of scrubs. I'm in.

Oops I'm out

But my thesis fell apart pretty quickly. When Figs delivered its first quarterly report revenue growth for the quarter was now up 58% year-over-year. That's not horrible by any means -- unless you're expecting revenue growth twice that high. What happened to the triple-digit revenue growth? Moreover they were happy about their numbers.

Part of the problem was expectations. I had no expectations really -- no specific number in mind for the quarter. Just something in the triple-digit range. Maybe if someone had sat me down with a nice cup of coffee and said ""we're expecting 50% revenue growth in the quarter"" I might have been OK. But my dashed expectations kind of put me in a mood.

On the call management was going on and on about ""awesome humans"" which is what they call anybody in the healthcare field. Figs really flattered its customers on the conference call. That's fine I guess -- although if we're going to talk about awesome humans every quarter I'm really going to get annoyed.

Then I started wondering ""Why is the company named Figs?"" That had sort of bothered me from the get-go this little nagging thought in the back of my mind. I don't really like the all-caps or the brand name. But I didn't Google it because I was distracted by my Starbucks comparison and triple-digit revenue growth.

So I found an interview with the founders and discovered that the company is called Figs because that is Co-CEO Heather Hasson's favorite fruit. Apparently Steve Jobs gave Apple (AAPL -0.69%) its name because he was on one of his fruit diets. And that's when I saw the black turtleneck. ""Oh my God one of them is dressed like Steve Jobs.""

That's when my doubts escalated to existential despair

I started wondering if I cared at all about doctor fashion. I like those scruffy doctors who haven't showered in a while and have forgotten to shave. I like Dr. House. I like Hawkeye. I'm not actually requiring that my doctor look like a bum. I just want my doctor to be focused on medical stuff. Focus on me! Not you. I want them looking at my X-ray and thinking about my X-ray.

Look at all those models in the Figs photograph. Yes they are all nice-looking but none of them is looking at the X-ray! How is this an improvement in healthcare? Are we making the world a better place? Or are we going from E.R. to General Hospital? Once I started thinking about Zoolander I had to get out.

And yet I think Figs will probably be a success story. I'm interested in how it plays out and I might be really sorry I sold.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzM1NzAxMDkvZnJlZWJpZXMtYmlydGhkYXktd2hlcmUtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzM1NzAxMDkvZnJlZWJpZXMtYmlydGhkYXktd2hlcmUtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 ways to get freebies on your birthday including Starbucks food and drinks...,"HAPPY BIRTHDAY 10 ways to get freebies on your birthday including Starbucks food and drinks

Secret saving hacks for shopping at Target"
STT,State Street Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vb3poYXdrLmNvbS83OC11bml0X2FwYXJ0bWVudF9wcm9qZWN0X21vdmVzX2ZvcndhcmRfaW5fZG93bnRvd25fc2FudGFfYmFyYmFyYV8yMDIxMDkwNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,78-Unit Apartment Project Moves Forward in Downtown Santa Barbara | Local News,"A plan to build 78 rental apartments behind the old Staples store in downtown Santa Barbara received mostly positive feedback in its latest appearance before the Historic Landmarks Commission.

Developer Peter Lewis working with architect Brian Cearnal wants to build the four-story building on the parking lot at 27 E. Gutierrez St. between the former Staples building and Reid’s Appliances at 409 Anacapa St.

In January the Historic Lands Commission granted project design approval but Lewis and his team returned for an in-progress review and update on changes to second-floor balcony railings a secondary garage the bike and trash rooms and the rooftop mechanical equipment layout.

Most of the changes were minor. For instance the trash enclosure will move to the front of the building on East Gutierrez Street from the complex’s paseo and the awnings in front of the bike enclosure will become more decorative.

Cearnal a partner in the Cearnal Collective also made adjustments to some windows and added a rooftop restroom. The designers also want to remove the awnings from the so-called “Juliet balconies” facing the paseo.

The proposed development calls for 78 rental units: 42 studios 18 one-bedrooms and 18 two-bedrooms averaging approximately 670 square feet per unit. The building has already been approved at a height of 52 feet.

Plans include 89 parking spaces in a combination of surface spaces and stacked parking lifts.

Commissioner Bill Mahan asked that Cearnal vary the height of some of the balcony windows and doors because they looked too “contemporary” and similar. The glass doors open out to a patio.

“It seems to me that some of these windows are gigantically tall for Spanish architecture” he noted. “I understand that you have high ceilings and it’s nice to have high windows but I feel like there’s too much similarity in this elevation.”

The ceiling heights are 9 feet with 10 feet on the top floor. The windows opening to a balcony are 8 feet tall.

Commissioner Robert Ooley disagreed however suggesting that it’s too late to make changes to window heights.

“The ship has already left the dock” he said. “I think it is a little late to ask the applicant to do that now.”

Cearnal responded to the discussion about making changes to the building by reminding the commission of the design’s original intent.

“We did all agree that this build was intended to reflect a simple apartment building of the ’20s and ’30s” he said.

The proposal comes at a time of growing support for building housing in the downtown core as one possible remedy to the stagnation of State Street.

Lewis has a long-term ground lease on the proposed site over three parcels at 410 State St. 27 E. Gutierrez St. and 409 Anacapa St.

“It is a very nice design” commissioner Anthony Grumbine said.

Just two years later in 1958 the fabulous foursome and their equally excellent Stevedore teammates accomplished that feat by taking down Newton High 4-1 before a sold-out crowd of 5000 at Fitton Field.

There were no divisions in those days and with just 90 boys St. Stephen’s had the smallest male enrollment of any school in the tournament. Newton on the other hand had more than 1400 boys.

Arena Morano Prizio and Riedl all earned scholarships to Holy Cross and helped the Crusaders to two College World Series appearances.

'An incredible life'

During a phone interview from his home in Kennebunk Beach Maine Arena fondly recalled his diamond days but his athletic achievements are just part of his fulfilling life’s journey.

“I’ve had an incredible life” said Arena who will celebrate his 80th birthday Wednesday.

Arena and his wife of 57 years Carole (Perrone) have made their home in Maine for more than five decades and together ran an upscale inn with views of the Atlantic Ocean for more than 20 years. They continued to work as hospitality consultants for several years before retiring.

Their three sons Mike Rob and Chris and their wives recently threw an early surprise birthday party for Arena at Okemo Mountain in Vermont. Their six grandchildren also joined in the fun for their beloved “Bob-Bob.”

Arena and his two siblings grew up on the third floor of a three-decker at 50 Pilgrim Ave. in the heart of Grafton Hill. His aunt lived on the first floor his uncle on the second. Arena’s father was a milkman and his mother worked the third shift at an envelope shop.

“They saved to put me through college” Arena said. “The day I got my college scholarship they went out and bought a house so that was a blessing.”

The new Arena home was on March Street right near Holmes Field where Arena and his friends played baseball and swam in the pool.

From Stevedores to Crusaders

In the ’58 state title game Arena who played first base and batted fifth in the Stevedores’ lineup went 1 for 3 and scored a run. St. Stephen’s victory was front-page news in the June 23 1958 Worcester Telegram and the accompanying photo showed teammates carrying Morano a hero of the game off the field on their shoulders.

The fab four went on to play together at Holy Cross and as juniors and seniors led the Crusaders to the College World Series. Arena keeps a container of infield dirt from Rosenblatt Stadium where the CWS used to be played on the bar at his home in Maine.

“It was great times” Arena said. “Often times it was written up in the media ‘Four St. Stephen’s stars’ and all of that. I think for Holy Cross it was a marketing tool — four stars from Worcester were at Holy Cross and maybe draw fans from the Worcester area and certainly it did. We had good-sized crowds for regular-season games. The bottom line is we went to the College World Series two years in a row.”

Arena Prizio and Riedl served as pallbearers at Morano’s funeral at St. Stephen’s Church in 2012. Tivnan passed away in 2010.

Arena recently talked with Prizio for the first time in a while. “We spent several hours on the phone getting caught up” Arena said. Riedl lives on Cape Cod Arena said but they haven’t been in contact for a few years.

After graduating from Holy Cross during the Vietnam War era Arena entered Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning Georgia. He went to U.S. Army Intelligence School at Fort Holabird in Baltimore and his first assignment was in Kansas City Missouri.

“We did background investigations for security clearances” Arena said “inspected missiles and we were the backup to the Secret Service for protection of Harry Truman who lived in Independence Missouri.”

Arriving in Maine

After completing his military commitment Arena and Carole moved back to Worcester and he went to work in human resources at Sprague Electric Company. Following a promotion to human resources director Arena went to work at the Sprague location in Sanford Maine.

“That’s how we arrived in Maine” Arena said. “We’ve been here 52 years but it was a long story getting here.”

The Arenas ran their inn The Ocean View seasonally from May-October which allowed them to spend the rest of the year at their second home in Tucson Arizona where they enjoy cheering on the University of Arizona men’s basketball team or traveling the world which they have continued to do.

They have visited Europe extensively Southeast Asia Tahiti Bora Bora New Zealand Australia and Africa. Their favorite spot is Saint Barthelemy (St. Barts) in the Caribbean.

“We’ve been very very very blessed” Arena said.

Arena was also a standout basketball player in high school. He matched up against Assumption Prep superstar Jack “The Shot” Foley twice and “held him to 48 and 52 points” Arena recalled with a laugh.

He also remembered playing three-on-three pickup against Holy Cross hall of famer Togo Palazzi who was a professional with the Syracuse Nationals at the time on the court in the St. Stephen’s parking lot.

“I got to guard him because I was the tallest (at 6-foot-2)” Arena said. “He played against me like he was playing in an NBA game. He was relentless going after the rebounds.

“The next day I’d play against him again” Arena said with a laugh “hoping someone taller would come along.”

The Arenas’ son Rob played hockey at Holy Cross and one of their grandsons also recently graduated from HC.

The Arenas don’t visit their home city often but they have many memories there like their wedding at Our Lady of Loreto Church on Massasoit Road and they will be spending Arena’s milestone birthday in Worcester on Wednesday. Among the highlights will be attending a Worcester Red Sox game at Polar Park.

“The older you get the more you think about your roots” Carole said “and both of ours run deep in Worcester.”

(AP) — Anthony Brown Jr. was blunt about No. 11 Oregon’s offensive struggles against Fresno State.

“It wasn’t clean enough” he said.

Brown scored on a 30-yard quarterback keeper with 2:57 left and the Ducks overcame a wobbly season opener with a 31-24 victory over the Bulldogs on Saturday.

Oregon jumped to a 21-6 lead but Fresno State scored two unanswered touchdowns to tie the game midway through the third quarter then took the lead early in the fourth on Abraham Montano’s field goal.

Camden Lewis kicks a 25-yard game-tying field goal before Brown’s go-ahead touchdown.

The performance was somewhat concerning given the Ducks face No. 4 Ohio State next weekend.

“In order for us to go where we need to go we have to be firing on all cylinders which we weren’t today. And that was obvious” Brown said. “We’re going to see it on the tape fix what we need to we need to fix and move on and progress from it.”

Brown threw for 172 yards and a touchdown while running for 62 yards and the winner. It was Oregon’s 17th straight home-opening victory.

Brown a sixth-year senior transferred to Oregon last year from Boston College but was backup to Tyler Shough until getting playing time in the Pac-12 title game and the Fiesta Bowl. Shough transferred to Texas Tech in the offseason.

The Ducks were hurt by the loss of defensive end Kayvon Thibodeaux who left the game at halftime with a left ankle injury.

Oregon had not played a game at Autzen Stadium for 644 days and the game came amid a surge in coronavirus cases in the state.

Oregon and Oregon State were among the first schools to require proof of vaccination or a negative virus test to attend football games. Gov. Kate Brown also imposed a mask mandate even at outdoor events.

The game was also marred by smoky conditions from wildfires in the region. Air quality was deemed unhealthy in the Eugene region by the U.S. Air Quality Index.

Fresno State quarterback Jake Haener threw for 285 yards and a touchdown. The Bulldogs (1-1) already started the season with a 45-0 victory over Connecticut.

“We talk about weathering the storm especially when you go into a hostile environment and the storm hit is pretty hard in the first quarter and we weathered it” Fresno State coach Kalen DeBower said. “You just get so far behind that it’s catching up and when you finally take a lead you have to make a lot of plays to get to that point.”

After Thibodeaux sacked Haener and caused him to fumble for a turnover CJ Verdell ran for a 2-yard touchdown to give the Ducks the early lead.

Another Fresno State fumble led to 4-yard scoring run from Travis Dye to make it 14-0. The duo of Verdell and Dye went into the game with a combined 4363 rushing yards most of any retuning pair at the FBS level.

Thibodeaux widely considered a possible Heisman Trophy contender this season appeared to injure his left ankle but had it taped on the sidelines and returned before the end of the first half. He came out of the break in street clothes and wearing a boot.

“I know it’s a sprain which we’re very optimistic that it’s nothing too serious” Oregon coach Mario Cristobal said.

Montano kicked a pair of field goals from 33 and 39 yards before Brown found Johnny Johnson III in the end zone with a 32-yard pass to make it 21-6. Jalen Cropper caught a 17-yard touchdown pass from Haener to close the gap for Fresno State to 21-13 just before halftime.

Haener scored from two yards out on a keeper and the conversion tied the game at 21 before Montano’s 22-yard field goal with 13:03 left gave the Bulldogs a 24-21 lead.

Cristobal wasn’t sure what caused Oregon’s offensive lapses.

“It’s hard to put your finger on it because the energy was real good preparation was real good. We thought our physicality and pregame was well also” he said. “I know they have some good players. They did what we thought they would do we did what we thought we would do.”

THE TAKEAWAY

Fresno State: Fresno State hadn’t played a ranked opponent since 2018. ... The Bulldogs are celebrating their 100th year of football this season.

Oregon: Senior linebacker Dru Mathis left the game in the first half with what appeared to be a left knee injury. ... Oregon leads the series against Fresno State 7-2. The Bulldogs haven’t downed the Ducks since 1982.

UP NEXT

Fresno State hosts Cal Poly next Saturday.

Oregon travels to No. 4 Ohio State on Saturday.

(AP) — Purdue coach Jeff Brohm promised to make changes heading into this season. On Saturday it paid dividends.

Now he’s hoping it keeps working.

Jack Plummer threw for 313 yards and two late touchdowns while the Boilermakers’ revamped defense made sure it held up for a 30-21 victory over Oregon State to cap the 500th game played at Ross-Ade Stadium.

Purdue has won 291 games since its home venue opened in 1924 and this one came in prime time and in front of the largest home crowd in 644 days — thanks largely to the Boilermakers defense.

“I think they played really hard tough had a couple huge fourth-down stops” Brohm said. “We did what we had to do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGFsa29mdGl0dXN2aWxsZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8wNS9jdXJyZW50LWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXByb2plY3RzLWhhcHBlbmluZy1pbi10aXR1c3ZpbGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Current Development Projects happening in Titusville,"With more manufacturing & space industry companies moving to the #SpaceCoast developers are building new residential and commercial properties in Titusville.

See if you are connected to a proper internet or not and if your internet speed is good enough to stream on Roku. Also check if there are disconnection issues with your WiFi. You can try troubleshooting your WiFi issues if you are using Roku on Windows.

3] Upgrade or connect to a high-speed network

Try upgrading your internet plan to a high-speed one or you can switch to some other available high-speed network. See if this fixes the issue for you.

4] Disconnect all other devices connected on the same internet

If you don’t have any other network available you can try disconnecting all the devices connected on the same WiFi. If there will more connected devices the bandwidth will obviously be divided amongst the devices and it may cause the 018 error on Roku. So make sure your Roku device is the only device connected to WiFi to enjoy hassle-free streaming.

That’s it!

Over the last few months Take-Two Interactive — the parent company of GTA devs Rockstar Games —has gone on a digital murder spree sending multiple takedown notices to get old 3D-era GTA mods and source ports removed from the internet. The publisher is also suing the creators behind reverse-engineered source ports of Vice City and GTA III. As a result of this hostility GTA Underground lead developer dkluin wrote in a post yesterday on the GTAForums that they and the other modders working on the project were now “officially ceasing the development” of GTA: Underground.

“Due to the increasing hostility towards the modding community and imminent danger to our mental and financial well-being” explained dkluin “We sadly announce that we are officially ceasing the development of GTA: Underground and will be shortly taking all official uploads offline.”

Dkluin also thanked the community for the support they received over the last six years and mentioned all the “incredible work” that went into the mod and the “great times” the team experienced working on it together. A final video simply named “The End.” was uploaded today on the modding team’s YouTube channel.

GTA Underground is a mod created for GTA San Andreas with the goal of merging all of the previous GTA maps into one mega environment. The mod even aimed to bring other cities from non-GTA games developed by Rockstar into San Andreas including the cities featured in Bully and Manhunt.

The mod had already faced some problems from Take-Two in July. As result it was removed from ModDB. It is now removed from all other official sources and sites.

In 2018 Kotaku interviewed dkluin about the mod and all the work going into it. He had started development on it back in 2014 when he was only 14 years old. GTA Underground isn’t a simple copy-and-paste job instead the modders added AI and traffic routines to every map making them fully playable as GTA cities. The team also had plans to add more cities to the game including their own custom creations.

Rockstar and Take-Two Interactive haven’t shared their official reasons for going after these fan-made mods but many suspect it has to do with the upcoming GTA remasters. As reported by Kotaku last month Rockstar is working on a collection that includes remastered versions of Grand Theft Auto III Vice City and San Andreas coming to the Switch and other platforms . Though the collection hasn’t been officially revealed sources say it’s targeting a release later this year.

Named GTA Underground the ambitious mod was built for San Andreas and attempted to merge all previous GTA maps into one massive open-world experience. It even set its eyes on bringing in environments from other non-GTA games developed by Rockstar such as Bully and Manhunt.

Unfortunately Take-Two Interactive has gone on a spree of placing legal pressure on modders as well as copyright infringement claims against different individuals teams and companies over recent months.

In light of these events GTA Underground lead developer dkluin said that the mod will now be canceled “Due to the increasing hostility towards the modding community and imminent danger to our mental and financial well-being.

Today's GTA news is a tad different. Rockstar Games' parent company Take-Two Interactive is now taking legal action against the 14 programmers behind the re3 project - making games like Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City playable on the Nintendo Switch.

As explained by Kotaku Take-Two's Manhattan-based firm Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp filed the lawsuit in California's Northern District on Friday. Take-Two is seeking a preliminary injunction and a jury trial and wishes to halt the behaviour before a ruling is determined.

In the complaint MSK's attorney noted how the source code enabled players to install and run games on multiple game platforms - including games that have never been released on Nintendo Switch.

“Perhaps most notably Defendants claim that their derivative GTA source code enables players to install and run the Games on multiple game platforms including those on which the Games never have been released such as the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo Switch.”

The lawsuit follows on from Take-Two issuing a wave of DMCA takedowns in August - aimed at some of the series' most popular mods. If the rumours about the Grand Theft Auto Trilogy remaster are true - it's likely to be the main motivator here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9ndGEtdW5kZXJncm91bmQtcHJvamVjdC1zaHV0cy1kb3duL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Six-Year-Long GTA Underground Project Shuts Down Over ""Increasing Hostility"" From Take-Two","ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9ndGEtdW5kZXJncm91bmQtcHJvamVjdC1zaHV0cy1kb3duL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Mérida September 4 2021 (venezuelanalysis.com) – The China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) is reportedly laying the groundwork to revive projects in Venezuela.

According to unnamed sources cited by Bloomberg CNPC is hiring local enterprises and sending its own staff including engineers for maintenance work at an oil-blending plant it operates with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA in the Caribbean nation.

Likewise CNPC is looking to boost operations at Sinovensa Sinovenezolana I and II Petrourica and Petrozumano its joint ventures with PDVSA in the eastern Orinoco Oil Belt and western Venezuela. The report adds that the Chinese company is currently contacting local service providers to begin ramping up production however no procurements or contracts have been signed.

The stage of these purported preliminary steps and the timeline to restart the oil projects are currently unknown. At the time of writing neither CNPC nor PDVSA have released statements.

The prospect of one of Venezuela’s most important international partners returning to invest in the country would represent a boost to Caracas’ efforts to recover crude output with PDVSA setting a 1.5 million barrel per day (bpd) target by the end of 2021. Increased trade with the CNPC would likewise allow Caracas to ease its debt burden having signed a number of oil-for-loan agreements over the years.

In July the South American nation produced 512000 bpd according to the last Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) report. The figure represented a mild downfall compared to June when it reached 537000 bpd the highest level in 13 months.

Despite the moderate recovery this year’s mark is only slightly above the 500000 bpd PDVSA averaged in 2020 when output hit historic lows under the weight of US sanctions. Washington imposed financial sanctions in 2017 an oil embargo in 2019 and a host of subsequent measures that saw production fall from an average of 1.911 million bpd to just over a quarter of it in four years.

For its part China’s most important oil corporation gradually reduced its direct dealings with Venezuela as the former Trump administration ramped up its sanctions program.

Threats of secondary sanctions halted expansion plans at the 110000 bpd Sinovensa project. The facility blends the extra-heavy Orinoco crude into the Merey grade favored by Chinese refineries and it is the largest CNPC project in the South American nation. Its output registered a reported 66000 bpd in May. The company also made headlines in late 2019 when five of its executives were arrested on corruption charges.

Apart from affecting oil operations US Treasury measures drove companies away from buying Venezuelan crude with CNPC stopping its cargo purchases in the wake of the August 2019 embargo.

As a result PDVSA has been forced to resort to intermediaries and sea-to-sea transfers in order to ship oil to its destinations.

Exports to China are reportedly facing additional hurdles after Beijing levied a new US $30 per barrel tax on bitumen imports with Venezuela’s heavy blends falling in that category.

For their part the Maduro administration and the Venezuelan National Assembly have looked to offer ever more favorable conditions for foreign investment. Legislative plans allegedly include allowing private corporations larger stakes in joint ventures while also doing away with PDVSA’s monopoly in running oil fields. The efforts to undo some of former President Hugo Chávez’s most emblematic laws have generated fierce debates.

However analysts stress that major investments are unlikely so long as crippling US sanctions remain in place.

Both companies are known for design advanced technology and a controlling approach to their ecosystems. Tesla’s cars use a giant iPad-like screen instead of physical controls and customers can use a smartphone as their key. It’s also steadily moving toward autonomous driving. That’s led people to call Tesla the Apple of carmakers.

Its Owner Was Just Charged With Federal Fraud,"In February of 2019 an unexpected ornament adorned the frozen surface of Lake Champlain in Vermont: a Tesla Model X burned to an extra-crispy shell. According to local Vermont news site WCAX a man identified by police as Michael A. Gonzalez claimed he drove the vehicle onto a frozen patch of Shelburne Bay to go ice fishing.

No one knows for sure but Gonazlez may have hit a rock and the Tesla ended up a toasty fireball; even then it barely made a dent in the thick ice. Within days of the Model X spontaneously catching fire on the lake (some Tesla Motors Club forum commenters blame the Lake Champlain Monster whatever that is) a flatbed truck was dispatched to haul the carcass away. By that time the Model X looked like Wile E. Coyote after Roadrunner blew him up with TNT for the hundredth time. That news all by itself is odd enough but here’s the follow-up story we didn’t see coming: a federal indictment unsealed recently states that Gonzalez allegedly helmed the heist of several Model Xs worth a total of $607000.

Here’s what happened according to the indictment on the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the State of Vermont:

“Between September 2018 and January 2021 Gonzalez obtained five Tesla vehicles worth a total of approximately $607000 from dealerships in New Jersey New York Massachusetts and Florida. For each vehicle Gonzalez made an initial payment of approximately $2500 and then arranged for electronic funds transfers to cover the balance of the vehicle’s price from accounts with insufficient funds or from fictitious accounts.

The statement continued: “Gonzalez took delivery of the vehicles from Tesla before Tesla discovered his failure to complete the final payments. Gonzalez resold or attempted to resell four of the five vehicles. Gonzalez was never issued the necessary paperwork to resell the fifth vehicle which subsequently burned on a frozen portion of Shelburne Bay on February 24 2019. Gonzalez attempted to claim insurance funds for the value of this burned Tesla but the insurance claim was denied.”

Vermont independent news blog Seven Days reported that Gonzalez made a reservation for his fourth Tesla Model X for $136710 with someone else’s driver’s license in March 2019. Then he allegedly registered the car with the Vermont DMV and transferred the title to his own name. Here’s a detail that makes you say “huh?” – he allegedly claimed he traded a 2013 Kia Optima valued at $8200 for the Tesla then flipped it on eBay for nearly $100000. Nice work if you can get it. However getting caught comes with a bonus of up to 10 years per violation for illegal possession and sale of a boosted car.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy81MzA5MzcvZmlyc3QtZHJpdmUtbW9kZWwtcy1wbGFpZC_SAURodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWV2cy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvNTMwOTM3L2ZpcnN0LWRyaXZlLW1vZGVsLXMtcGxhaWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Drive: 2022 Tesla Model S Plaid,"Ever since it was announced in January 2021 the Tesla Model S Plaid has captivated the attention of the entire auto industry. Here is a car that can comfortably seat five adults and has 894 liters of luggage space yet still beats every production hypercar in a quarter mile drag race (bar the epic Rimac Nevera). It can also run console-level video games on its two infotainment screens and features all the latest self-driving tech. The hype surrounding the Plaid has understandably been palpable and now a lucky few are getting their hands on one.

YouTuber DÆrik already owns multiple Teslas so comes from a place of experience. You would expect he is used to the crazy acceleration and impressive technology associated with Tesla’s vehicles. However the Plaid clearly turns things up a notch.

When pulling off the lot for the first time in his new Model S Plaid DÆrik immediately noted how quiet the vehicle was. He remarked that it is quieter than any of his previous / current Teslas (which includes everything bar the first-gen Roadster). He also felt the ‘yoke’ steering wheel would take some time to get used to accidentally turning on the car’s wipers when he only intended to rest his thumb.

Two weeks and 490 miles later DÆrik gave a further update on his Plaid. He noted the car’s ride and suspension is incredibly smooth. The finish of the car is also high quality and super solid according to DÆrik which is good news as build quality has often been an area of controversy for Tesla in the past.

DÆrik has also gotten more used to the yoke. There are multiple ways to hold it and the buttons work well. That said he still accidentally hits the turn signals from time-to-time when instead trying to press the scroll button. The vehicle’s voice control and infotainment is responsive and works well too. And of course the acceleration is immense. Overtaking only requires a single press on the accelerator and you’re gone - DÆrik simply describes it as “alien”.

Overall DÆrik is super happy with his Model S Plaid. Rapid well-built and tech-laden what more could you want from a car? Perhaps a normal steering wheel and stalks… but maybe the future will just take some getting used to.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZHJpdmVuLmlvLzIwMjEvMDkvMDUvd2h5LXRoZS1wcmljZS1vZi10ZXNsYS1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXJzLWNvdWxkLWZhbGwtYnktaGFsZi1pbi1qdXN0LWEtZmV3LXllYXJzL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZHJpdmVuLmlvLzIwMjEvMDkvMDUvd2h5LXRoZS1wcmljZS1vZi10ZXNsYS1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXJzLWNvdWxkLWZhbGwtYnktaGFsZi1pbi1qdXN0LWEtZmV3LXllYXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the price of Tesla electric cars could fall by half in just a few years,"The big question for the electric vehicle industry and the legacy ICE (internal combustion engine) car makers – and their customers – is when price parity between EVs and petrol and diesel cars might be achieved.

Some experts say it may be in just a few years others suggest the second half of the decade. Many still scratch their head as to why there is even a big difference now between the price of EV models and the fossil fuel equivalents.

Perhaps one reason is that the EV makers can get away with it. Subsidies or taxes are bringing the prices into line in those countries or states where electric cars are now mass market items. In other markets where buyers are mostly “early adopters” they can get away with a premium because the customers want them so much.

Tesla which produces the best selling EVs in most markets across the world has only recently started posting profits from its operations but that disguises the fact that its margins per unit are high and steadily growing. Much of its money goes into R&D.

Morgan Stanley estimates those margins to be getting close to 20 per cent near the luxury end of the auto market even though its Fremont plant in California is regarded as the highest cost car manufacturing plant on the planet.

Morgan Stanley estimates the margins at the new Berlin Austin and other plants or “gigafactories” will be 1000 to 1500 basis points higher than Fremont so as their share of production grows the costs of production will fall dramatically and the margins (assuming the prices remain study) will soar at the same time.

Will Tesla book all those gains as profits? Not likely Morgan Stanley suggests because its top strategic priority will be to expand the availability of lower priced Tesla vehicles to as many people as possible.

Why is that? Because Tesla sees even bigger profits in the future not from the cars themselves but from its multiple “ancillary” business possibilities – software full self driving subscriptions insurance robo-taxis and more.

To make this work Tesla needs as big a fleet as it can get. Design and engineering will deliver a new level of scale at EV factories possibly at a level that the industry has never seen.

“We see the EV market as a highly deflationary business” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent note. “”While it may take several years to play out we would be prepared for Tesla vehicles to be offered as low as $US20k/unit this decade.” That’s half the current price of just under $US40000 for the base level Model 3. And others will be forced to do the same. “We also expect the price of certain EVs across different manufacturers to be as low as $US10k” the analysts say. “OEM (Car maker) profitability will be derived from monetizing the customer via other revenue streams such as software as opposed to the hardware (the car).” To give some idea of the scale of Tesla’s ambition Morgan Stanley estimates that Tesla will spend around $US27 billion a year by 2027 on d annve R&D – that’s more than Apple spends now and more than NASA. “Investors are witnessing one of the most spectacular industrial ‘arms races’ in a generation” the analysts write. “The ‘batteries are the new oil’ mantra is being put to work in the form of extraordinarily large budgets across private and public enterprise research labs and government sponsored efforts.” Morgan Stanley estimates that more than $US1 trillion will be spent on developing advanced battery materials and cell architecture and “industrializing its production at tera-scale” And they believe that Tesla has a big advantage in terms of innovation and scale from the raw materials of the battery to the data coming off the car. “The battle for EV supremacy is still in its early skirmishes … even in our own modeling we may be underestimating the ambition and speed with which Tesla is industrializing the EV its supporting infrastructure and its ‘internet of cars’ revenue model.” See also: Tesla flags $25000 electric hatchback for 2023 but it might have no pedals"

New Business

If you're noticing something different with Florida Health and Wellness lately you're not the only one. With a new name and a new look Dr. Jorge Pelaez and his staff at RevitaLife are ready to accept new patients.

""The name was too long"" Pelaez said. ""Too complicated. So we decided to work with Lucid (Advertising). While in the middle of rebranding we asked would it be possible to have a name that's more identifiable and more aligned to what we actually do.""

RevitaLife located at 1004 Scenic Highway In Pensacola is an integrative medical practice that focuses on taking a proactive approach when it comes to your health.

""I was growing frustrated listening to my patients that were not getting what they needed"" Pelaez said. ""They would undergo tests and they'd come back normal but then they'll say 'But I don't feel normal.'""

For Pelaez his medical journey has been a personal one. Originally from Argentina Pelaez was treated for seizures as a pediatric patient and at the age of 17 his father died from a brain tumor. These two life changing events motivated Pelaez to pursue a career in neurology.

""After practicing medicine for more than 25 years I realized that we don't necessarily have the best health care system"" Pelaez said. ""We have the best sick care system.""

According to Pelaez this means that doctors are trained to treat the symptoms of an underlying illness rather than the illness itself.

""If I had a heart attack or cancer we have the best health care system in the world"" Pelaez said. ""But the problem is oftentimes we're not trying to help them prevent that from happening.""

RevitaLife offers a wide variety of services including hormone therapy weight loss and nutrition management and integrative medicine. To ensure accuracy and optimize the overall patient experience Pelaez has created a five-step process involving a discovery phase consultation follow up appointments and maintaining the treatment that's tailor made to patients.

In addition to the rebranding efforts Pelaez's book ""When Being 'Normal' Is Not Enough: Extraordinary Health For Ordinary people"" was recently released on Amazon.

""I think it will give people a more clear idea of what we do"" Pelaez said. ""We attempt to provide the tools so they can feel the best they can feel.""

RevitaLife is open from 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday. For more information visit revitalifehealth.com or call 850-805-8250.

Schools listed in the company's tracker have closed for anywhere from one day to several weeks. Most temporarily moved to remote learning. Others temporarily closed with no instruction. And a small number delayed the start of school or shifted into hybrid learning according to Burbio.

The rising number of closures comes amid a battle over mask mandates in schools and a surge in pediatric COVID-19 cases largely because of the highly contagious delta variant.

Late last month President Joe Biden's administration announced it is investigating five states that are banning districts from mandating masks on the grounds that such policies violate the civil rights of children with disabilities and underlying health conditions.

""The department will fight to protect every student’s right to access in-person learning safely and the rights of local educators to put in place policies that allow all students to return to the classroom full-time in-person safely this fall"" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement.

Fauci: Moderna boosters might not be ready by Sept. 20

The Biden administration has said that come Sept. 20 anyone who wants a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine will be able to get one as long as they are at least eight months past their second shot. But pulling that off may be challenging and experts have raised questions about whether it's a good idea at all.

Dr. Anthony Fauci President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser told CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday that booster shots for Americans who received Moderna's two-dose vaccine may not be ready by that date as it awaits the green light from regulators.

""We were hoping that we would get both products Moderna and Pfizer rolled out by the week of the 20th. It is conceivable that we will only have one of them out but the other will likely follow soon thereafter"" Fauci told CBS.

Moderna filed initial data for booster-shot authorization Wednesday and may not get cleared by Sept. 20.

""Looks like Pfizer has their data in likely would meet the deadline'' Fauci said. ""We hope that Moderna would also be able to do it so we could do it simultaneously but if not we'll do it sequentially. So the bottom line is very likely at least part of the plan will be implemented but ultimately the entire plan will be."" Read more here.

Hospitals in crisis in Mississippi the least vaccinated state in US

As patients stream into Mississippi hospitals one after another doctors and nurses have become all too accustomed to the rampant denial and misinformation about COVID-19 in the nation’s least vaccinated state.

People in denial about the severity of their own illness or the virus itself; visitors frequently trying to enter hospitals without masks. The painful look of recognition on patients’ faces when they realize they made a mistake not getting vaccinated. The constant misinformation about the coronavirus that they discuss with medical staff.

Mississippi’s low vaccinated rate – about 38% of the state’s 3 million people are fully inoculated – is driving a surge in cases and hospitalizations that is overwhelming medical workers. The workers are angry and exhausted over both the workload and refusal by residents to embrace the vaccine.

""This is the reality that we’re looking at and again none of these individuals were vaccinated"" state health officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs.

Paralympics marks closing ceremony amid COVID-19

The final act of the delayed Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics came Sunday almost eight years to the day after the Japanese capital was awarded the Games.

The Paralympics ended a 13-day run in a colorful circus-like ceremony at the National Stadium overseen by Crown Prince Akishino the brother of Emperor Naruhito. The Olympics closed almost a month ago.

These were unprecedented Olympics and Paralympics postponed for a year and marked by footnotes and asterisks. No fans were allowed during the Olympics except for a few thousand at outlying venues away from Tokyo. A few thousand school children were allowed into some Paralympic venues.

Like the Olympics the Paralympics went ahead as Tokyo was under a state of emergency because of the pandemic. Like the Olympics testing athletes frequently and isolating them in a bubble kept the virus largely at bay though cases surged among a Japanese population that is now almost 50% fully vaccinated.

Amazon Reddit take steps in fight against COVID-19 misinformation

This week was another reminder of how widely misinformation spreads and how tech companies are scrambling to push back.

Reddit shut down a popular anti-vaccine subreddit that had been connected to pushing misinformation about the pandemic and vaccine. The platform also placed 54 other COVID-19 denial communities under a quarantine which means posts won't appear in search results on Reddit and users must explicitly approve entering the subreddit before seeing any of its content.

Meanwhile Amazon said it plans to block some autocomplete results linked to ivermectin – an anti-parasite drug the Food and Drug Administration has advised people not to take to treat COVID-19 – after it appeared once users started typing ""iv"" into the search bar. Read more here.

The White House is preparing for future pandemics

The Biden administration unveiled a plan Friday to upgrade the country's ability to respond to biological threats comparing its scope to the Apollo Program which was initiated to put a man on the moon.

""We need better capabilities because there's a reasonable likelihood that another serious pandemic that could be worse than COVID-19 will occur soon and possibly even within the next decade"" said Eric Lander director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

The cost? $65.3 billion over the next decade. A good chunk of that money will go toward vaccine development and distribution the White House said. Administration officials are hoping an initial $15 billion will pass through Congress as part of the massive $3.5 trillion spending package on the table for this fall.

The plan includes:

Dramatically expanding the arsenal of vaccines therapeutics and diagnostics.

Strengthening public health systems both in the U.S. and internationally.

Improving the ability of the U.S. to produce personal protective equipment and other vital supplies.

Improving early detection of pandemic threats.

Creating a centralized “mission control” to be in charge of an effort that will draw on multiple federal agencies.

Hawaii struggles with delta surge begs travelers to stay away

Hawaii has already reported more than twice as many coronavirus cases this year as it did in all of 2020 Johns Hopkins University data show.

The Aloha State had 66778 COVID-19 cases through Saturday afternoon triple its 22007 infections in all of 2020 prompting Gov. David Ige to ask tourists not to visit until after October.

""It is a risky time to be traveling right now"" he said.

The annual comparisons don't begin to tell how much Hawaii struggled with a wave of cases caused by the delta variant. In just the last month Hawaii has had more cases than in all of last year.

Kentucky health care workers sue over COVID-19 vaccine mandate

Claiming mandatory COVID-19 vaccines are ""a fraud upon the entire American public"" 40 employees of St. Elizabeth Healthcare in northern Kentucky have filed a federal lawsuit challenging a requirement they be vaccinated.

The 93-page lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Covington comes amid a surge in COVID-19 cases – largely among unvaccinated patients – that threatens to overwhelm most Kentucky hospitals.

The lawsuit follows an announcement Aug. 5 by most of the state's major hospital systems including St. Elizabeth's that they would require vaccines for all workers without a medical or religious exemption to try control the surge of COVID-19 in Kentucky.

Denmark bans unvaccinated US tourists

Denmark is banning unvaccinated tourists from the United States joining a growing list of European Union member states that are tightening travel restrictions as COVID-19 cases rise.

The change comes after the country moved the U.S. to its ""orange"" travel advisory category on Saturday. Previously U.S. tourists could enter Denmark by showing a negative test or proof of recovery. Entry requirements do not change for fully vaccinated U.S. travelers who are still exempt from testing and quarantine requirements.

The Netherlands another EU member state on Saturday started enforcing a quarantine period for vaccinated U.S. travelers and prohibited entry among unvaccinated travelers. Bulgaria announced it would prohibit travel from the U.S. Spain started requiring vaccination certificates and Italy added testing and self-isolation requirements for U.S. travelers. Read more here.

What we know about the mu variant

The mu variant has been marked as a ""variant of interest"" by the World Health Organization and has spread across Chile Peru and parts of the U.S. and Europe.

The mu variant is the fifth variant of interest currently being monitored by the WHO. Stuart Ray a professor of medicine at John Hopkins University said the variant accounts for most cases in Colombia Chile and Peru but only some cases in the U.S.

As of now Ray said what’s concerning is mu obtains similarities to deadlier variants such as the delta variant which is the cause of over 99% of cases in the U.S. Read more here.

The Lancaster-based bank holds 27.80% of all bank deposits in the county according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. report issued Friday making Fulton the leading bank here for the seventh consecutive year.

Fulton’s market share is slightly smaller than the 28.52% it captured in 2020. As a result its lead over runner-up Truist Bank (formerly BB&T) receded a little – by less than 1 percentage point. But it’s still a commanding edge of 11.93 percentage points.

Fulton has almost always been the local leader since at least 1994 which is as far back as the FDIC has publicly available data. The exception came in 2012-2014 when the top spot went to Lititz-based Susquehanna Bank.

In 2015 though Fulton regained the summit surpassing Susquehanna. It then topped Susquehanna successor BB&T from 2016 through 2019 and now has done the same to BB&T successor Truist in 2020 and this year.

The rest of the 10 biggest banks here fall into the nearly the same order as they did in 2020 with changes only to the ninth- and 10th-place banks. Here are the top 10 with their share of all bank deposits in the county:

First Fulton 27.80%; second Truist 15.87%; third PNC 11.84%; fourth Ephrata National 8.02%; fifth Wells Fargo 7.05%; sixth Northwest 4.13%; seventh M&T 3.70%; eighth Bank of Bird-in-Hand 3.47%; ninth First National 2.86% replacing S&T which dropped to 11th; and 10th Univest 2.77% replacing First National.

As has been the case for years the top three banks in the aggregate account for the majority of deposits here; this year together they hold 55.51%. In other words the top three combined hold more deposits than the remaining 20 institutions combined.

The report which tallies the total deposits held in Lancaster County as of June 30 by each bank that has a physical office here shows that the 23 banks operating here have a total of $15.99 billion in deposits across a combined 165 offices here.

That number of offices represents a 19.5% drop from the peak of 205 offices in 2008 and 2009 LNP | LancasterOnline files show although there are several more institutions operating here.

The decline is largely due to the biggest institutions trimming their branch networks as consumers switch to banking online as LNP | LancasterOnline has often reported. For instance Fulton had 31 offices here in 2010; it has 21 per the FDIC. Susquehanna had 40 in 2010; its successor Truist has 26.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY2FsbHRvdGhlcGVuLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzA0L2F0bGFudGEtYnJhdmVzLW96emllLWFsYmllcy1yZXR1cm5zLWluanVyeS12b3dzLXRoaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Atlanta Braves: Ozzie Albies returns from injury vows to ""do my thing""",.@ozzie returns to the lineup and makes an immediate impact. pic.twitter.com/vHNiA9SP4J,,,,,,,,,

Gaming is profoundly transforming two central aspects of the modern world: culture and regulation. There will be no turning back.

When it comes to culture the West has been in a dialogue with itself for centuries indeed millennia stretching at least as far back as the Bible and the ancient Greeks.

Burst of development could be coming to tiny Nevada town

CAL-NEV-ARI — The roads kick up dirt the airstrip isn’t paved and the only store in town offers such items as milk beer some vegetables and marked at half-price for $2.50 each music cassette tapes.

After not changing much for years tiny Cal-Nev-Ari and its cluster of residents off the side of the highway face the prospect of something very different for the remote desert town: a burst of development.

Universal Green Technology majority owner of mining firm Heart of Nature has purchased just over 550 acres of mostly vacant real estate off U.S. Highway 95 some 70 miles south of Las Vegas acquiring the bulk of Cal-Nev-Ari.

The $8 million sale by town co-founder Nancy Kidwell closed in late July property records show.

Heart of Nature supplies the agricultural industry and won’t do mining in Cal-Nev-Ari. But it has big plans for a pint-sized community that relies on well water and is heavy on retirees and mobile homes.

All told locals have mixed reactions to the possible activity. Residents told the Review-Journal they would welcome more visitors and commerce to the rural unincorporated community though some are nervous about other possible changes after Kidwell who is in her 80s and seems to know everyone here sold her holdings after years of trying.

“It’s definitely gonna change the atmosphere I think around here and I’m a little nervous but I’m excited to see what happens” said Destiny Hughes manager of the 10-room Blue Sky Motel.

She indicated that only two rooms are taken per day and some real estate development could help fill the place.

“Honestly it’d help my workload” she said.

‘Always a fear of change’

Heart of Nature President Jerry Tyler who lives in Henderson says his group plans to build a 100000-square-foot warehouse that will hold granulating machines that make its products. The facility would be across the highway from Cal-Nev-Ari’s homes and would not produce foul odors he said noting the processing involves tree sap and almost smells like it’s baking bread.

He envisions building more restaurants a larger hotel and homes for staffers who work at the facility. His group also wants to pave the airstrip to attract more pilots.

Tyler said in a recent interview that residents’ initial reaction to the sale — reported Aug. 19 by the Review-Journal — was “fear because there’s always a fear of change.”

His group acquired hundreds of acres of land the airstrip an RV park and a mobile home park with the town’s only motel convenience store and casino and restaurant building.

“Everyone here was concerned because they’re used to Nancy” he said.

But his group wants to make Cal-Nev-Ari “a better place for everybody” won’t replace the workers here with a new crew and will keep and enhance all the businesses he said.

Tyler said that he is giving out his business card and asking people to call if they think he’s making anything worse and that locals are “starting to warm up to us.”

“The people that I’m meeting have been great” he said. “I just haven’t had a chance to meet everybody yet.”

Mixed emotions

Convenience store clerk Robin Williford who lives in the RV park believes most people here don’t know what’s going to happen now that Kidwell’s sale went through and she has heard some people are scared they will lose their jobs.

But she said she thinks the owners’ plans are “great” as the activity could bring more people and attention to the town.

“I don’t think a lot of people know that we’re really here” Williford said.

Bartender Connie Meyerring said she not only works for the town matriarch but also has been renting a home from her too and she’s worried about her job and her home.

Still she figures if Heart of Nature’s venture sparks more activity it could be a good thing.

“If it brings business to the community that’s fine” Meyerring said.

Desert flying

Milne “CC” Pocock a South Africa native who lives in Cal-Nev-Ari operates a flight training school here called Bush Air which specializes in backcountry flying. He has three Cessna aircraft at his property which like many other homes here is right across from the airstrip.

He said the sale could be “a good thing” adding the new owners seem highly motivated to upgrade the town. Pocock also pointed to Cal-Nev-Ari’s aviation roots and hopes the buyers “build that up and promote that.”

“Pilots don’t even know about this town” he said.

But he worries about his own future if the airstrip – formally known as Kidwell Airport albeit an airport without terminals a control tower or even a fence around it – is paved.

His business is built on taking off from and landing on unpaved surfaces and Cal-Nev-Ari is “perfect” for him as it offers uncontrolled airspace and vast stretches of open desert nearby.

If the airstrip is paved he said “I won’t be able to run my business here anymore.”

“I would have to move” Pocock said.

Tyler said it would be “a while” before the airstrip is paved an undertaking that would require plenty of permitting financing and engineering.

But his group wants more types of planes to land here amid its plans to boost the population and add more services such as grocery stores and supply shops.

“We think the airport can really contribute to that” Tyler said.

Rural growth

Kidwell and late husband Everette “Slim” Kidwell founded Cal-Nev-Ari in the mid-1960s having noticed its then-abandoned airstrip while flying by.

They acquired 600-plus acres from the federal government named the town after its home state and the two nearby and as the Los Angeles Times reported put in a sign that declared: “Cal-Nev-Ari Population: 4. Watch Us Grow.”

The other two residents were their cat and their dog.

By 2010 244 people lived in Cal-Nev-Ari according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

According to reports Slim a flight instructor was 34 years older than Nancy and died in 1983. A decade later she married Verne “Ace” Kidwell Slim’s son from a prior marriage who was 14 years older than Nancy and who died in 2011.

The father and son were buried in a small fenced plot in Cal-Nev-Ari with space between them for one more.

“There’s plenty of room for me” Kidwell once said.

Tyler said that Universal Green Technology was a customer of his before it acquired a majority stake in Heart of Nature and the people behind the company knew he wanted to set up processing operations in Nevada.

Heart of Nature mines and crushes minerals outside Tonopah and trucks them to Bakersfield California for processing. Under California law Tyler said the firm can haul up to 25 tons of cargo through the state without a special permit but in Nevada it can haul up to 43 tons.

Universal Green heard about Cal-Nev-Ari wanted to buy Kidwell’s real estate and picked Tyler to come down and help “digest” the purchase and do some planning because he lives closest he said.

Before the purchase Tyler said he had driven by Cal-Nev-Ari and thought it was “kind of cool.” He also believes he may have pulled in for the same reason as other travelers who come upon the speck of a town in the middle of the desert.

“I might have stopped here to use the restroom or something” he said.

April 8. The $425 million project includes a processing plant feed mill and hatchery. Local state and federal officials joined Tyson executives at the opening.

“We’re pleased to add to the growth in Gibson County with the opening of our new 370000-square-foot processing facility” said Dean Banks president and chief executive officer of Tyson Foods. “We appreciate the support of all those who played a role in making this facility possible – the local community county state and our Humboldt team members who safely and responsibly produce high-quality protein daily to help feed our nation and the world.”

The project was announced in Tennessee in late 2017 after a similar sized facility was proposed near Tonganoxie Kan. earlier in 2017. The project was met with resistance from local residents and ultimately rejected by officials in Leavenworth County and the city of Tonganoxie.

This is the second major economic development project Tyson Foods has initiated in Tennessee in recent years and the largest to date. In August 2017 the company announced an $84 million expansion of its Union City operations which has added more than 200 jobs.

“Tyson Foods started as a small family poultry business more than 85 years ago and today we are a recognized leader in protein” said John R. Tyson chief sustainability officer and member of the Tyson family. “We are incredibly proud to make western Tennessee the home of our first new poultry facility in 25 years and look forward to being part of the community and supporting the local economy.”

Production is expected to begin at the facility later this month – several hundred workers have been hired and are currently being trained. The processing plant which will produce pre-packaged tray packs of fresh chicken for retail is expected to employ 1500 workers by 2023.

“The demand for Tyson chicken products continues to grow and this plant will help us meet the needs of our customers and consumers” said Donnie King chief operating officer and Group president Poultry for Tyson Foods. “We’re excited to start this new chapter with the people of western Tennessee who have been extremely supportive of the project since day one.”

The new feed mill which will supply feed for approximately 56 local poultry farmers will employ 30 people and produce 14000 tons of finished feed a week at full capacity. The hatchery employs 30 and provides chicks for local poultry farmers who supply broiler chickens to Tyson.

“With five facilities across Tennessee Tyson Foods has an enormous impact on our state’s agriculture industry and rural communities” said Tennessee Governor Bill Lee. “Job creation is crucial to our continued economic success and I thank Tyson for its investment and commitment to Humboldt and West Tennessee.”

Including Union City Tyson currently operates five facilities in Tennessee employing about 5000 people with an annual payroll of more than $226 million. Tyson estimates its total statewide annual impact for fiscal 2020 including payroll grain purchases utilities property taxes and charitable contributions to be more than $428 million. The payroll and payments to farmers from the new operation is expected to generate an annual economic benefit of $150 million to the state of Tennessee.

“Tyson Foods has been doing business in Tennessee for nearly 50 years and we’re committed to making a positive impact on Humboldt and the entire region” said Tom McCue Humboldt complex manager. “We appreciate the support of the local community as we’ve worked toward this day and I’m excited to build a tradition of excellence with our team members.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvc2VwLzA0L3R5c29uLXVwZGF0ZXMtc2ljay1sZWF2ZS1wb2xpY3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyson updates sick-leave policy | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Tyson Foods said Friday that its processing plant workers who are fully vaccinated for the coronavirus will begin earning up to 20 hours of paid sick leave per year effective Jan. 1.

The policy will make Tyson the first U.S. company to provide paid sick leave to meatpacking workers according to the United Food and Commercial Workers union which represents 26000 Tyson Foods workers.

These added benefits are the result of a recent deal struck between the union and Tyson over its new coronavirus vaccination mandate effective Oct. 1 for office workers and Nov. 1 for meatpacking workers. Medical and religious exemptions also were negotiated.

Throughout the pandemic Tyson has struggled with labor issues from absenteeism to high turnover from worker illnesses and more. It is one of the few companies with a large processing plant workforce to impose a vaccination mandate. Companies have avoided this over concerns of worsening a labor shortage. However as delta variant cases and hospitalizations rose across the country Donnie King Tyson's president and chief executive officer said in a memo to workers that ""getting vaccinated is the single most effective thing we can do.""

To get workers on board before the deadline Tyson has been offering free on-site vaccinations health education materials and $200 ""thank you"" bonuses to fully vaccinated processing workers. The vaccinated are also eligible for a sweepstakes drawing to win thousands of dollars.

The company has increased pay plus benefits to $22 per hour for processing workers in addition to referral and signing bonuses. It has allocated $6 million for the sweepstakes. Northwest Arkansas poultry processing workers who are fully vaccinated have a chance to win a prize of $10000 each week in September.

According to Tyson the incentives are working. More than 90000 workers -- more than 75% of the company -- have received at least one dose of a covid-19 vaccine. More than 30000 workers have been vaccinated since the mandate was announced Aug. 3.

Union president Marc Peronne urged others across the industry to implement similar paid sick-leave policies so that ""workers can get vaccinated without losing a paycheck.""

""This historic agreement helps to ensure policies like paid leave are not just helping us increase vaccinations during the pandemic but are also permanent improvements that strengthen these jobs and protect these workers for years to come"" Peronne said in a written statement Friday.

Worker advocates have cited inadequate paid sick leave as a barrier preventing low-income workers from getting vaccinated.

A Harvard survey of service and retail workers found that nearly 60% of workers with access to paid sick leave had been vaccinated by May compared with less than 50% of workers without that benefit. More than 9000 workers at large companies were surveyed from March to May.

In addition to paid leave Tyson said it will offer one week of vacation for new hires after six months of employment. The company also is offering paid leave for up to two weeks for workers who are fully vaccinated and test positive for the virus over the next six months.

""These measures are the latest examples of our ongoing efforts to make Tyson the most sought-after place to work"" stated Johanna Soderstrom Tyson's executive vice president and chief human resources officer.

Other companies including Amazon and Walmart have rolled out similar initiatives that encourage workers to get vaccinated but stop short of a full mandate.

(U.S. Department of Agriculture Public Domain)

OMAHA Neb. (AP) — Two of the industry’s biggest poultry companies have agreed to pay nearly $35 million to settle a lawsuit that accused them and several other firms of conspiring to dominate the industry and fix the prices paid to farmers who raise the chickens.

Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms agreed to the settlements last week without admitting any wrongdoing while the lawsuit remains pending against several other industry giants including Pilgrim’s Pride Koch Foods and Sanderson Farms.

The lawsuit that Alabama farmers filed in Oklahoma federal court alleges that the contract grower system the meat companies created pushed them deep into debt to build and maintain chicken barns that met company standards.

They also said the companies colluded to fix farmer compensation at low levels to boost corporate profits making it difficult for the farmers to survive financially. Generally chicken producers enter long-term contracts with meat companies that farmers say lock them into deals that fix their compensation at unprofitably low levels.

The farmers who sued reported earning between $12000 and $40000 a year while working 12-to-16-hour days all year long while major meat companies like Tyson and Pilgrim’s were reporting annual profits over $1 billion.

Previously major meat companies have defended the system as fair; it calls for farmers to provide barns and labor to raise chickens while the companies provide chicks feed and expertise.

Industry officials have said the contract system has worked for six decades because it benefits companies and farmers.

Perdue Farms spokeswoman Diana Souder said the company which will pay $14.75 million values the relationship it has with its farmers and Purdue pays farmers based on their performance.

“As an imperative lifeblood of our business we value the excellent relationships built on trust we have with our farmers and remain committed to providing them fair competitive contracts that benefit them and therefore our animals company customers and consumers.” Souder said

Tyson which agreed to pay $21 million in the settlement decided it was in the best interests of the company to eliminate the uncertainty risk expense and distraction of extended litigation spokesman Derek Burleson said.

This lawsuit is an example of a case that might be easier for farmers to bring in the future because the Biden administration has said it plans to issue new rules encouraging competition in the agriculture sector and protecting farmers against the country’s largest meat processors.

The new rules the Biden administration plans would make it easier for farmers to sue companies they contract with over unfair discriminatory or deceptive practices. The regulation will make it easier for farmers to bring complaints under the Packers and Stockyards Act and is similar to one the Trump administration killed four years ago. That rule was first proposed in 2010.

Those who work in the arena of public affairs risk more than paper cuts when they decide to work with their opponents. I know this from the years when I worked for developers in the Seattle area and environmentalists and neighborhood activists were on the other side.

Some on our side did not like it when we began working with the opposition. The same was true for the other side. Before long though increased understanding and new friendships were producing results.

It’s pretty rare to see such coalitions come together. And food safety has not seen much coalition-building. Some food safety issues remain unresolved for years or decades.

But there are some risk-takers out there willing to work “in a broad coalition asking Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to meet with them to hash out a modernized science-based approach” to reducing salmonella and campylobacter illnesses in poultry production.

Four top poultry producers — Tyson Foods Perdue Farms Butterball and Wayne Farms — have joined the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) and others to compel the U.S.Department of Agriculture to update and improve outdated food standards and protocols.

James Kincheloe CSPI’s food safety campaign manager calls this “a moment of unity.” It brings the four poultry producers together with CSPI Consumer Reports Consumer Federation of American and Stop Foodborne Illness to revamp the poultry food safety system.

The newly formed coalition has written Vilsack suggesting a meeting.

If the newly-formed coalition can hold together it could be a game-changer. Salmonella and campylobacter from poultry annually sicken about 3 million people in the United States and cost about $6 billion a year. Those levels have not improved in 20 years.

The USDA even failed to reduce the rates of illness from these two pathogens after setting Healthy People 2020 goals targets. It is supposed to try again for 2030.

“While progress on reducing foodborne illness has been at a standstill scientific knowledge of salmonella has greatly increased and recognized best practices for campylobacter and other pathogens have advanced” says the coalition letter to Vilsack.

“Science tells us that current performance standards do not effectively target the particular types of salmonella and the levels of bacteria that pose the greatest risks of illness and the overall regulatory framework does not adequately harness modern tools for preventing and verifying control of the bacteria that are making people sick.”

The coalition letter outlined the following conclusions and principles:

• While current prevalence-based pathogen reduction performance standards are leading to reduced salmonella levels in products the performance standard method is broken and the standards are not producing the desired public health outcomes.

• Modernized standards should be objective risk-based achievable enforceable and flexible enough to adapt to emerging evidence and the latest science. Modernized standards should not stifle innovation. Instead they should invite innovation and technology development.

• While the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) cannot directly regulate food safety practices on the farm a modernized Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) framework should address risk reduction across the full production process from raw material to finished packaging including defining the responsibility of poultry processors to consider preharvest practices and interventions in their HACCP plans and verify that suppliers of live birds have implemented scientifically appropriate risk-reduction measures in accordance with modern best practices.

• Salmonella and campylobacter should be addressed in parallel but separate proceedings as larger knowledge gaps exist for campylobacter than salmonella and different timelines and risk mitigation approaches may be necessary. The coalition strongly encourages the USDA to review and reinvigorate programs around salmonella that exist within the National Poultry Improvement Plan.

• While science has advanced sufficiently to support regulatory improvements today ongoing research is also needed to support continued progress toward reducing salmonella and campylobacter moving forward including epidemiologic data and analysis to improve attribution of illness to specific commodities and products.

The Secretary of Agriculture will likely give this coalition a callback. It’s not just because Vilsack’s own food safety record could use some improvement but also because his Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety is uniquely suited to work with this sort of group. Before she moved over to USDA as the Deputy last March Sandra Eskin was known for bringing multiple stakeholders together to work on food safety problems from her previous perch at the Pew Charitable Trusts.

The bottom line this is going to be one that’s worth watching.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL3NlcC8wNS9ib296bWFuLWNhdHRsZS1mYXJtZXItZW1waGFzaXplLXJlc2VhcmNoLWluLXJpdmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boozman cattle farmer emphasize research in River Valley industry,"CHARLESTON -- Federal money improves local cattle operations even if the dollars don't flow straight into the ranchers' pockets a River Valley farmer recently said.

John Paul Pendergrass owner of Pendergrass Cattle Co. in the Charleston area said federally funded research has improved the quality of the cattle he raises. It's one of the reasons his farm's productivity has doubled in his lifetime he said.

The research is important in Arkansas where an estimated 25% of the state's gross domestic product is agriculture said U.S. Sen. John Boozman R-Rogers.

""Because of mechanization because of research because of being so much more productive you don't need the people that we used to in order to grow our economy. So it's just everybody working together to maintain our ability to produce a great product at a very cheap price compared to the rest of the world"" Boozman said.

The senator toured the farm Monday morning as part of a roundtable discussion with U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman R-Ark. and members of Tyson Foods Riceland Foods the Arkansas Farm Bureau and the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research.

The U.S. has fallen behind China and Brazil in agricultural research money according to a report from the Farm Journal Foundation and the American Farm Bureau Federation. The country's agricultural trade balance is at risk the journal states.

Support for agricultural research in the U.S. would ensure safe and affordable food supplies a Farm Journal news release states.

Congress in 2018 passed the Agriculture Improvement Act devoting an estimated $428 billion to efforts including nutrition crop insurance conservation and commodities according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research received $385 million from Congress between the farm bills passed in 2014 and 2018 according to Tim Kurt foundation scientific program director. Another bill is due in 2023 Boozman said.

""Research really is the building block"" Boozman said. That's why farmers are able to produce more crop on fewer acres and yet make sure the soil is healthy he said.

Boozman estimated 85%-90% of the local economy in rural areas of the country is farming.

Pendergrass said his farm doesn't see much direct federal investment because he's largely focused on cattle. But he said the research that was discussed at his farm Monday has allowed his cows to genetically improve.

His farm can now hold up to 1500 cattle that are raised and sent on to commercial feed yards. They're eventually sent to meat companies such as Tyson Foods he said.

""The cattle are more productive"" he said. ""We have access to more tools in the box that help us be more productive.""

Pendergrass Cattle Co. also contributes to the research by providing cattle to the experiment station in the stocker cattle unit at the University of Arkansas he said."

Here’s what is happening in the fast-growing crypto finance industry a sector that has officials in Washington sounding alarm bells.

What alternative banking services do crypto businesses offer?

Most notably lending and borrowing. Investors can earn interest on their holdings of digital currencies — often a lot more than they could on cash deposits in a bank — or borrow with crypto as collateral to back a loan. Crypto loans generally involve no credit checks as transactions are backed by digital assets.

Who’s in this sector?

Most of us stopped going to the bank during the pandemic and once you realize how easy it is to get things done from your phone or computer why go back?

But some of the biggest cyber threats we face today are banking Trojans — malicious programs that hunt for bank information while disguising themselves as harmless documents. They can scan what you type steal your money and compromise all of your most sensitive passwords. These often come loaded in malicious apps. Tap or click for more info on apps recently caught stealing bank credentials.

Your bank account is one of the most important things in your life to protect from hackers. Without strong cybersecurity you could end up losing money and critical personal data. If you haven’t given your online bank accounts a security checkup now’s the time. Here are the steps you need to take.

1. Create strong passwords

Creating strong passwords is the most fundamental step in securing your accounts. Weak options like 12345678 or Password can be easily guessed or cracked with software that hackers can download for free. And if you share a weak password across multiple accounts or profiles you’ll have a domino effect on your hands if one of them gets compromised.

To protect your accounts here are some good rules for making better passwords:

Always use a random (or non-sequential) set of upper and lowercase letters numbers and symbols. Always make your passwords eight characters or longer. Use unique passwords for every single account every single time.

If you’re having trouble figuring out strong passwords here’s an example we use here at Komando.com: T/V\ho2nnL. It comes from a random sentence — a Metallica lyric. “Take my hand off to never-never land.”

Use the first character from each word to get “tmhotnnl.” Then replace some words and letters with symbols and numbers. “M” becomes /V\ and “to” becomes 2. Finally capitalize a few of the letters to make a tough password that’s easy to remember: “T/V\ho2nnL”.

Tap or click here for even more ideas to help you generate stronger passwords.

2. Set up two-factor authentication

Activating two-factor authentication (2FA) for your bank accounts is a great way to keep hackers out. When it’s set up you can’t log in without a code that your bank sends to your phone via text message. Hackers won’t have access to your phone which means it’s unlikely they’ll be able to get in. Plus you’ll know any time someone tries to log in without your permission.

Here’s how you can set up 2FA for some of the nation’s biggest banks.

Chase: Chase automatically sets customers up with 2FA from the get-go. The first time you sign in to your account from a new device you’ll be asked to verify your identity with a text code. Your phone number and email address will need to be current on your account so if either is out of date call the support number on the back of your card.

Wells Fargo: Open the tab labeled Your Security Center from the Wells Fargo app or website or tap or click here to activate 2FA for your account. You’ll be asked to enter a phone number where you can receive your security code. Once you type in the code 2FA will be active the next time you log in.

Bank of America: Choose Profile & Settings in the upper left-hand corner of BoA’s website and click Manage SafePass. From here you can add any phone numbers you want your security code sent to. When you’re finished you’ll be asked to verify your debit or credit card details to complete the setup.

Citibank: Citibank customers already have 2FA active by default. The first time you sign in to your account from a new device you’ll be asked to verify your identity with a text code. Your phone number and email address will need to be current on your account so call the number on the back of your card if either is out of date.

If you don’t see your bank listed here you can usually find the option under the account settings or security settings for your bank’s website or app where you have the option to change your password.

In addition to 2FA some banks offer encrypted security tokens. These small handheld devices generate one-time passcodes you can use to log into your account. Because they’re physical devices owned by your bank and kept safe by you there isn’t a way for a hacker to gain access without physically handling one. Ask your banker for more information.

3. Stick to secure devices

Some devices are much better for checking your accounts than others. If your PC gets a virus for example you might have a hacker watching you type in your password without even realizing it.

One smart step you can take is securing every device you bank on with a strong antivirus and antimalware solution. Kim’s pick is TotalAV. Tap or click for more info and a link to get 85% off your first year.

To protect your accounts you can pick and choose a device that you only use for finances. For this we recommend a lightweight Chromebook computer. These affordable laptops run ChromeOS which means they aren’t vulnerable to the same kinds of malware as a full-fledged Windows PC.

This ASUS Chromebook retails for less than $200 and is secure enough to check your most sensitive bank accounts. It can also browse the web play videos on YouTube and stream music from your favorite services like Spotify.

If you’d rather not spend money on a new Chromebook you can protect your account using biometric security settings like your fingerprint or face. If your phone has a face scanner (like Apple’s FaceID) or a fingerprint reader you can use these to verify your logins. Check the Settings area of your bank’s app to see if biometric authentication is offered.

4. A little dishonesty won’t hurt

Most banks will have you set up security questions when you create your account. These questions are used to verify your identity in the event you get logged out or make a major change to your settings.

But what if a hacker or stalker knows more about your life than you expect? If you post details about your life on social media it can be easy to crack security questions without ever breaking into your account. Tap or click here to see if you’re oversharing on social media.

That’s why it’s important to remember that you don’t have to answer every security question accurately. In fact it’s better for your security to give fake answers and write them down rather than connect the answers to your real life.

The next time you have to set up an account and answer security questions pick answers that are easy enough to remember but aren’t necessarily true. Then take a piece of paper or a cheap journal and write down your answers. You’ll be glad you did.

5. Freeze your credit – It’s FREE!

All of us will eventually fall victim to a data breach at some point. But just because your data is compromised doesn’t mean you’re in danger just yet. If you take proactive steps like freezing your credit you can prevent the problem from getting much worse.

Here’s why: If your credit is frozen hackers won’t be able to open any new accounts in your name. It’s one of the most effective ways to curb identity theft and all it takes to set up a credit freeze is a quick phone call to one of the three national credit bureaus.

Best of all it’s free to request a freeze as of 2018. It’s security that you don’t even have to pay for!

6. Set up alerts and stay in the know

Every week Kim gets a message from her bank that shows her account balances. If anything seems unusual she can immediately contact her bank to find out what happened.

If you’re not checking your account regularly you could end up missing something major like a hack or password breach. Activating notifications through your bank’s website or official app is an easy way to stay in the know.

You can also set up alerts if you hit a low balance or if your bank detects fraudulent activity on your account. You can receive these in the form of text messages app notifications or emails — or even a combination of the three.

Here’s how to set up alerts for some of the biggest national banks. If your bank isn’t on this list download its official app and look for Alerts on the main menu. You can also search your bank’s website for instructions or chat with a bank representative to get help. You can easily reach one by calling the number on the back of your card.

Chase

Sign in to Chase from your browser. Choose Profile & settings > Alerts > Choose alerts in the left-hand menu under the Alerts section. Follow the instructions to set up alerts and choose your preferred delivery.

Wells Fargo

Sign in to the Wells Fargo website and choose the account you want to add or edit alerts to. Choose the alerts you want to receive and customize them. Save your edits. To get text alerts add your mobile number to receive text messages. You can do this by signing into your account and adding your phone number to your profile. Check the box labeled Allow Mobile Texts and accept the Consent to Receive Text Messages. Reply YES ENROLL to the text message you receive.

Bank of America

Download the Bank of American mobile app. Then use this link to pick your device. BoA will send a download link to your smartphone or tablet.

You can also sign in to your account from a browser to set up online banking alerts.

Citibank

To set up email or text alerts for your Citibank savings or checking accounts use this link to sign in.

The Lancaster-based bank holds 27.80% of all bank deposits in the county according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. report issued Friday making Fulton the leading bank here for the seventh consecutive year.

Fulton’s market share is slightly smaller than the 28.52% it captured in 2020. As a result its lead over runner-up Truist Bank (formerly BB&T) receded a little – by less than 1 percentage point. But it’s still a commanding edge of 11.93 percentage points.

Fulton has almost always been the local leader since at least 1994 which is as far back as the FDIC has publicly available data. The exception came in 2012-2014 when the top spot went to Lititz-based Susquehanna Bank.

In 2015 though Fulton regained the summit surpassing Susquehanna. It then topped Susquehanna successor BB&T from 2016 through 2019 and now has done the same to BB&T successor Truist in 2020 and this year.

The rest of the 10 biggest banks here fall into the nearly the same order as they did in 2020 with changes only to the ninth- and 10th-place banks. Here are the top 10 with their share of all bank deposits in the county:

First Fulton 27.80%; second Truist 15.87%; third PNC 11.84%; fourth Ephrata National 8.02%; fifth Wells Fargo 7.05%; sixth Northwest 4.13%; seventh M&T 3.70%; eighth Bank of Bird-in-Hand 3.47%; ninth First National 2.86% replacing S&T which dropped to 11th; and 10th Univest 2.77% replacing First National.

As has been the case for years the top three banks in the aggregate account for the majority of deposits here; this year together they hold 55.51%. In other words the top three combined hold more deposits than the remaining 20 institutions combined.

The report which tallies the total deposits held in Lancaster County as of June 30 by each bank that has a physical office here shows that the 23 banks operating here have a total of $15.99 billion in deposits across a combined 165 offices here.

That number of offices represents a 19.5% drop from the peak of 205 offices in 2008 and 2009 LNP | LancasterOnline files show although there are several more institutions operating here.

The decline is largely due to the biggest institutions trimming their branch networks as consumers switch to banking online as LNP | LancasterOnline has often reported. For instance Fulton had 31 offices here in 2010; it has 21 per the FDIC. Susquehanna had 40 in 2010; its successor Truist has 26."

Uber and Lyft said they'll pay the legal fees of drivers sued under Texas's new abortion law.

Under the law anyone who transports a woman to receive an abortion after six weeks of gestation can be sued.

""Drivers are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why"" Lyft said in a statement.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Uber and Lyft will cover any legal fees incurred by their drivers if they were sued for taking passengers to receive an abortion after six weeks of gestation under Texas' harsh new abortion law.

""Drivers are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why"" Lyft said in a statement Friday. ""Imagine being a driver and not knowing if you are breaking the law by giving someone a ride. Similarly riders never have to justify or even share where they are going and why.

""Imagine being a pregnant woman trying to get to a healthcare appointment and not knowing if your driver will cancel on you for fear of breaking a law. Both are completely unacceptable"" the ride-share company added.

Lyft said it established its Driver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of the legal fees that its drivers could potentially incur under the law. The legislation known as a heart ""heartbeat"" abortion ban bars abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected – about six weeks into a pregnancy – before some women are even aware they're pregnant as Insider previously reported.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi made a similar pledge to cover legal fees for drivers in a tweet on Friday afternoon.

""Right on @logangreen – drivers shouldn't be put at risk for getting people where they want to go"" Khosrowshahi said sharing a tweet from Lyft co-founder and CEO Logan Green announcing its policy. ""Team @Uber is in too and will cover legal fees in the same way. Thanks for the push.""

The legislation which is similar to abortion bans introduced in other GOP-led states was signed by Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May but it was met with legal challenges. The US Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to block the law allowing it to take effect September 1.

Unlike similar laws in other states the Texas legislation allows private Texas citizens to enforce the ban by reporting and suing individuals who they believe obtained an abortion or helped another person obtain an abortion – including those who drive others to get the procedure and those with no personal connection to the person who underwent the procedure.

Texas citizens can be awarded up to $10000 for every successful lawsuit and have their legal fees covered Insider previously reported.

While the ban has exceptions to allow abortions in the case of medical emergencies it contains no exceptions for instances of rape or incest.

The next time you apply for a job how would you feel if the person doing the interview asked to see your Uber rating? It is the number you get from Uber whose drivers score their passengers from 1 to 5 after drop-off and a few weeks ago one US boss went on Twitter to say he had made it part of his hiring process.

“If you treat strangers with respect then you will treat customers and co-workers well too” wrote Vitaliy Katsenelson chief executive of an investment firm in Denver.

“It seemed like a good idea” Katsenelson told me last week. He got the idea after noticing that Nassim Nicholas Taleb author of the 2007 best-seller The Black Swan had included his impressive 4.9 Uber rating on his Twitter profile.

As it happened Katsenelson had been looking for a new operations manager. An Uber score sounded like a smart unbiased way to see what applicants were really like.

The woman he hired had a 4.89 rating slightly higher than Katsenelson’s 4.86 and much better than my dismal 4.65 which is worse than it sounds. Some drivers won’t pick up anyone with a score below 4.6. But Katsenelson quickly discovered his Uber plan was flawed. Women told him their scores had dropped after they spurned Uber drivers’ advances. Men who lived in rough neighbourhoods suffered a similar fate after trying to get dropped off nearer their front doors than reluctant drivers wanted to venture.

To his shock he then learnt his assistant Barbara had the lowest score he had ever seen. This did not compute. She was in his words an incredibly kind wonderful person. “I wish I had a whole company of Barbaras”.

It turned out she hardly took Ubers at all and one time when she had ordered one there had been some sort of mix-up that meant she never made it into the car.

Katsenelson quickly dumped the idea. “I thought I was so clever but then I realised it’s not a silver bullet.”

Listening to him talk I began to wish more companies shared his scepticism about using algorithms to hire people.

The traditional face-to-face job interview a mainstay of assessing job applicants for at least a century has morphed into a gruesome tech shadow of itself.

Recruitment is widely outsourced to companies that scour websites for potential hires. Candidates’ online applications are scanned for key words and phrases hirers supposedly want to see. An array of digital tools using voice recognition body language software and the like are used to allegedly predict good recruits.

I know all this because it has been so well documented by management experts such as the Wharton School’s Professor Peter Cappelli.

As he wrote in Harvard Business Review not too long ago: “Businesses have never done as much hiring as they do today. They’ve never spent as much money doing it. And they’ve never done a worse job of it.”

We have very little idea if these practices produce good hires. Cappelli reckons only about a third of US companies report that they check to see if their hiring processes secure good workers. So what should they be doing? Give snazzy but unproven tech tools a wide berth. Check past performance and crucially test for basic skills. It is astonishing how often a business will demand drug tests but ignore the results of skill checks.

Ultimately hiring outsiders is always going to be fraught. But I think Katsenelson was on to something with a ploy he used a few years ago to recruit an analyst. Determined to find someone who really cared about investment research not just money he devised a tediously time-consuming job advert. It asked candidates to list all the books they had read in the past 12 months; talk about the three books — and two people — who had influenced them most; provide a stock idea analysis and write a cover letter to say why not hiring them would be a massive mistake.

About 50 applications came in only a dozen of which answered each question. But the successful candidate is still with the firm and for Katsenelson “it worked out great”. This tactic won’t suit every company or every job. But I bet it does better than the average algorithm.

Lyft co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Logan Green on Friday tweeted that the company was creating a Driver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees incurred by drivers sued for transporting women to get abortions and unveiled a $1 million donation to Planned Parenthood. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi responded on Twitter saying Uber will also cover legal fees and thanked Green “for the push.”

“This is an attack on women’s access to health care and their right to choose” Green wrote on Twitter. He said the Planned Parenthood donation would help ensure that “transportation is never a barrier to health care access” and invited other companies to do the same.

Texas has banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy but has left it to private parties to sue to enforce the law. The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this week rejected by a 5-4 vote a request to put the law on hold while its constitutional issues are litigated. The measure which went into effect Wednesday makes anyone who helps a women get an abortion in the state potentially liable.

Green and Lyft General Counsel Kristin Sverchek in a message posted on the company’s blog said “Drivers are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. This law is incompatible with people’s basic rights to privacy our community guidelines the spirit of rideshare and our s as a company.”

Other companies have responded to developments in Texas. Texas Right to Life a group that opposes abortion rights set up a website encouraging people to “enforce” the legislation by sending anonymous tips or information about alleged violations of the act. GoDaddy Inc. which provides web-hosting services said it informed Texas Right to Life on Thursday that it needs to find a new hosting provider within 24 hours because it violated the terms of service.

Texas Right to Life spokeswoman Kimberlyn Schwartz said Friday that assets were in the process of being transferred to another provider and the group’s site would be restored Sunday or earlier.

“We will not be silenced” she wrote in an email. “If anti-Lifers want to take our website down we’ll put it back up. We are not afraid of the mob.

GetMyBoat pairs non-boat owners with a boat or boat captain.

The app was created in 2013 by co-founders Sascha Morell and Rag Collado. The pair realized how many unused boats were sitting in boating docks and the lack of access non-boat owners have to boats.

""So many people want to have access to boating experiences but it could be very expensive and unrealistic for the average person. The average boat is used only about 8 percent of the year so they wanted to make it easier for people to gain access to boating experiences"" Val Streif Marketing Manager for GetMyBoat said. ""Also boat captains and boat owners to be able to earn a side income off of their boats when they aren’t using them"" Val Streif Marketing Manager for GetMyBoat said.

Cape Coral boat owner Captain Randy Busch said the app is like the Uber of the charter industry. He has been using the app for nearly 2 years. His boat requires a captain so he boats people around to their destinations. He said some people want to boat to the beach others want to be brought to a restaurant.

He said you might get a glimpse of wildlife as well.

“It’s a great time. We get to get to see a lot of dolphins out there a lot of manatees and a shark here and there"" Busch said.

The app takes around 8 percent commission from the boat charters. Busch said it's worth it.

""I don’t have to pay for a website. I don’t have to do all the paperwork that would normally have to be done for charter business"" he said.

GetMyBoat also advertises his charters for him.

“They run everything. They do the advertising for us. When I see the ads out there on Facebook or wherever they are doing all that and they pay for all that"" Busch said.

What's in it for the guest?

A unique experience and the opportunity for an affordable boat experience. Some boat owners allow you to drive the boat yourself and others like Busch's boat require a boat captain.

“Everything from the kayaks to the luxury yachts"" Streif said. "" I think Cape Coral Fort Myers that sort of area pontoons are the most popular and for pricing it’s going to be able $250 for a whole day.

She said boating allows people to be outside and socially distant. Streif also said each boat is kept clean -- even before the pandemic.

“Boat captains will tell you that they spend a ton of their time cleaning their boats. All boat surfaces can be easily sanitized"" Streif said.

Two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu won’t be featuring in either the Sudirman Cup or the Uber Cup after she requested to be left out citing recovery post the Tokyo Olympics where she won bronze. The Thomas Cup is a men’s only tournament.

In PV Sindhu’s absence London 2012 bronze medallist Saina Nehwal will be spearheading the Indian badminton team at the Uber Cup. B Sai Praneeth and Kidambi Srikanth meanwhile will be India’s star players in both the Thomas and Sudirman Cups.

The Uber Cup is the women’s team world championships event and will be played from October 9 to October 17 in Denmark alongside the Thomas Cup which is the men’s equivalent of the Uber Cup.

In the Uber Cup Saina Nehwal will be accompanied by the top three singles ranks from the selection trials - Malvika Bansod Aditi Bhatt and Tasnim Mir.

The 10-member team also includes three doubles pairs including Tanisha Crasto and Rutuparna Panda who claimed the top spot in the women’s doubles trials.

Gayatri Gopichand daughter of Indian badminton legend Pullela Gopichand and her partner Tressa Jolly who came third in the trials have also made the team.

India’s 10-member Thomas Cup squad comprises four singles players and three doubles pairs.

Alongside B Sai Praneeth and the former world No. 1 Kidambi Srikanth the top two players from the trials - Kiran George and Sameer - earned their places in the Thomas Cup team.

The country’s top men’s doubles pair Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy has also been selected alongside the top two pairs from the trials.

India have been placed alongside China the Netherlands and Tahiti in Group C for the Thomas Cup while India’s Uber Cup Group B opponents will be Thailand Spain and Scotland.

B Sai Praneeth and Kidambi Srikanth will also lead the 12-member Sudirman Cup squad.

The Sudirman Cup is a mixed-team badminton tournament and this year’s edition will be played in Vantaa Finland from September 26 to October 3. India have been drawn in Group A with defending champions China Thailand and hosts Finland in the Sudirman Cup.

The teams for all three tournaments were selected on the basis of their performances in the selection trials held earlier this week apart from the automatic selections of the players/ doubles pairs who are placed inside the top 20 in the world rankings.

All three tournaments were cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The rally was held on the corner of Route 14 and Main Street in Crystal Lake around 12 p.m. Saturday.

Dozens of demonstrators held signs and American flags in front of the Wendy’s protesting Illinois’ mask mandates for schools and businesses.

Adults and even children held signs referencing “unmask the kids” and “unmask our children.”

“We will not be silent we will not be masked” one protestor’s sign read.

A reporter with the Northwest Herald said on Twitter that a group of people who were maskless walked into several stores in Crystal Lake around 3:30 p.m. Saturday following the roadside protest.

The group entered Best Buy Ross Dress for Less TJ Maxx and Ulta Beauty to protest the state’s mask mandate the Northwest Herald reported.

The group of people entered Steinhafels a furniture store but employees kicked them out for refusing to wear a mask.

Video from a Northwest Herald reporter showed the protesters chanting “USA USA” on their way out of the store.

Employees at World Market refused to even let the protesters into their store and an argument took place at the entrance.

The store called the Crystal Lake Police Department the Northwest Herald reported.

“We don’t have to do what [Gov.] Pritzker is trying to force us to do” Joshua Alvarado of Rolling Meadows told the Northwest Herald. “He doesn’t have the authority to tell me what to do with myself.”

On August 14 a few dozen demonstrators gathered in Crystal Lake to protest Illinois’ mask mandate for schools.

That protest also took place on the corner of Route 14 and Main Street in Crystal Lake.

“Free their faces hearts and minds! They are our future! What are we teaching them?! Masks are child abuse!” one man’s sign read.

Some of the protesters took issue with Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker saying “this mask is as useless as our governor” and another sign saying “fire Pritzker.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL25ld3MvMTMwMTE1OS91bHRhcy0yMS1kYXlzLW9mLWJlYXV0eS1nZXQtNTAtb2ZmLWJlbmVmaXQtY29zbWV0aWNzLXR1bGEtY2xpbmlxdWUtbW9yZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ulta's 21 Days Of Beauty: Get 50% Off Benefit Cosmetics Tula & More,"Get three times the glow when you use Tula's Brightening Treatment Drops Triple Vitamin C Serum.

UAL,United Airlines Holdings,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbnRoYWlsYW5kLmNvbS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLzQwMDA1NzIw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philippine Airlines struggles to survive in pandemic,"Fleet reduction job cuts

Wider in scope than PAL’s rehabilitation program filed in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis the plea is a key piece in a sprawling restructuring plan that requires sizeable fleet cutbacks debt forgiveness and billions of pesos in fresh capital.

“We are grateful to our lenders aviation partners and other creditors for supporting the plan which empowers PAL to overcome the unprecedented impact of the global pandemic that has significantly disrupted businesses in all sectors especially aviation and emerge stronger for the long term” Tan said in a statement on Saturday.

A parallel filing would also be made in the Philippines under the Financial Insolvency and Rehabilitation Act of 2010 PAL said.

PAL will also return 21 planes that were no longer needed for its revised long-term business plan.

It was unclear whether the fleet reduction representing over 20 percent of PAL’s 95 aircraft would lead to further job cuts.

The carrier removed 2300 jobs or 30 percent of its workforce last March joining other airlines that reduced manpower to lower costs given the pandemic-induced slowdown.

Chance for ‘reset’

Aviation and banking sources told the Inquirer these steps would give the flag carrier the opportunity to “reset” and retool its business for the future.

They also agreed the airline’s near-term recovery was dependent on counterpandemic efforts and would test the commitment of the Tan family in supporting PAL through continued losses.

“It all depends on how much financial ‘rope’ Lucio Tan is willing to provide” Avelino Zapanta PAL’s president during the carrier’s 1999 rehabilitation told the Inquirer.

“Even until next year I don’t see normalization for airlines happening” he added.

While the global health crisis worsened PAL’s financial woes forcing the flag carrier to suspend debt payments as early as April last year signs of trouble were long-brewing for the airline.

After Tan regained full control of PAL in 2014 ending a two-year alliance with conglomerate San Miguel Corp. it pursued a new strategy to expand its international network modernize its fleet and achieve a coveted five-star status by 2020.

When it retired old planes and introduced next-generation Airbus A350-900s the airline opened nonstop flights from Manila to New York and appeared unstoppable in its mission to connect the Philippines to more global gateways.

Losses since 2016

But financial losses began gradually mounting in 2016 and by 2019 PAL Holdings Inc. its parent company had accumulated P22.9 billion in losses.

PAL Holdings lost a staggering P71.8 billion in 2020 alone after flights were disrupted by recurring quarantines.

A year earlier the company’s plans were thrown into disarray due to abrupt management changes culminating in the surprise retirement of Jaime Bautista PAL’s longtime president.

The Inquirer learned that current PAL president Gilbert Santa Maria personally flew to New York for the filing of the Chapter 11 plea.

In the statement Santa Maria thanked PAL’s employees around the world for continuing to deliver “the highest quality of service through these trying times.”

“Following the recent celebration of our 80th anniversary we move forward with renewed confidence as today’s actions enable us to continue serving our customers and the Philippine economy long into the future” he said.

PAL said Tan’s group as majority shareholder will infuse $505 million in equity and debt financing while another $150 million in debt was required from global private investors for “postrestructuring” activities.

The rehabilitation filing showed that PAL’s five largest secured claimants or those whose loans were tied to collateral such as planes and engines were owed a total of $866 million.

These included local banks such as Tan’s Philippine National Bank or PNB ($156.5 million) and the Sy family’s BDO Unibank Inc. ($80.42 million) and China Banking Corp. ($54.83 million).

Claims worth $1.4B

The airline’s top 40 creditors have unsecured claims worth over $1.4 billion.

They include dozens of international aircraft lessors local banks maintenance companies and even government agencies such as the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) and Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP).

The top unsecured bank lenders were PNB ($115.9 million) Asia United Bank ($75.3 million) China Banking ($65.27 million) and Union Bank of the Philippines ($20.1 million).

Tan’s own Buona Sorte Holdings was the largest unsecured creditor with $358.28 million while the CAAP and MIAA were owed $8.65 million and $21.7 million in regulatory fees.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The company is now moving cargo for outside customers in its latest move to compete directly with FedEx and UPS .

""They want to be a new kind of U.S. Postal Service where everything can get everywhere but also quickly"" said e-commerce consultant Chris McCabe who was a seller performance investigator at Amazon from 2006 to 2012.

Amazon said in its first-quarter earnings report that capital expenditures were up a whopping 80% from a year earlier helping it increase capacity of its in-house logistics network by 50% year over year. According to SJ Consulting Group Amazon is now shipping 72% of its own packages up from 46.6% in 2019.

In 2014 Amazon started building its global transportation network from scratch. Seven years and 10 billion deliveries later Amazon now has 400000 drivers worldwide 40000 semi-trucks 30000 vans and a fleet of more than 70 planes. Perhaps the biggest investment so far is the new $1.5 billion Amazon Air hub that opened in Kentucky in August.

For outside merchants Amazon already offers a variety of shipping services. In the U.K. Amazon has a ""logistics as a service"" program — a business model that researchers from DePaul University predict Amazon will launch in the U.S. in the next 18 months while Morgan Stanley predicted it could happen this year. According to one investigation Amazon has already begun quietly transporting cargo on its planes for the U.S. Postal Service although analysts say it won't try to replicate the vast array of services offered by FedEx and UPS.

""They're not going to be just this blanket carrier that will deliver whatever package that you want them to to whatever address"" said Dan Romanoff who researches Amazon for Morningstar. ""Amazon is sort of cherry-picking their routes. They want to run and sort the parcel sizes they want to deliver.""

Amazon's algorithms also allow sellers to take advantage of LTL (less than load) truck space at discounted rates while allowing Amazon to make money on otherwise wasted space. Amazon seller Keith Gregory just started using the program called Amazon Freight. Gregory's vitamin and supplement company Highland Laboratories is based in a 3500-person town in Oregon and does about $4 million of annual sales on Amazon. Gregory says Amazon charges up to $1700 less than FedEx or UPS for some of his routes from Oregon to Southern California.

""For us being in a rural community the fact that somebody is willing to cater to us and they're willing to accommodate pick-up schedules and not just say 'Okay we'll be there every day at 3:30' is also very attractive too. So not just not just the rate piece but the fact that they're also willing to use their vast fleet of vehicles to help us with our logistics as well which UPS and FedEx are not cooperative in that sense"" Gregory said.

Amazon also offers its Fulfilled By Amazon or FBA services for orders not made on Amazon.com which explains why some orders from eBay Walmart and others arrive at your door in Amazon packaging.

""There were points in time in our company's existence where really Amazon shipped 100% of our orders for all channels"" said Amazon seller Bernie Thompson who uses what Amazon calls multi-channel fulfillment for many of the consumer electronics sold by his company Plugable Technologies.

""If you go today and buy a Plugable product on eBay it's actually going to be coming from an Amazon warehouse and very often delivered by an Amazon delivery service"" Thompson said.

Former Amazon product safety manager Rachel Greer says the current shipping expansion is reminiscent of other times Amazon has used immense resources and data to disrupt an industry such as with Prime Video and Amazon Web Services.

""I was part of the process for making sure that FBA sellers were compliant more than a decade ago. And they were like 'Well we have excess capacity. Let's use it'"" Greer said. ""And then when AWS started we had excess capacity. Let's use it. So of course if Amazon develops a platform it works well and of course if it's going to have excess capacity they're going to try to sell it to someone.""

According to SJ Consulting Group Amazon is now shipping 72% of its own packages up from 46.6% in 2019.

Meanwhile Amazon has learned a lot about how to keep costs down from the shippers who handle the remaining 28% of its deliveries. For example Amazon still primarily outsources costly rural deliveries to the U.S Postal Service and outsources the expensive last-mile portion to delivery service partner contractors.

""What Amazon is able to do right now is sort of pick off probably the most attractive routes the most attractive packages and deliver to the most densely populated areas"" said Dan Romanoff who researches Amazon for Morningstar.

Some think there's a chance Amazon will try to buy other shippers outright.

""Down the road I think Amazon will be so big so powerful so wealthy they will simply absorb UPS"" said e-commerce consultant Chris McCabe who was a seller performance investigator at Amazon from 2006 to 2012.

Jason Boyce author of ""The Amazon Jungle"" said the big move is no surprise.

""If you look at all of the third-party services that they opened up to sellers over the years including AWS they had to become the best in the business to service their own"" Boyce said.

An Indigenous entrepreneur from Goulais River is hoping that her next business pitch wins her enough cash to take her tool and equipment rental shop to the next level.

Earlier this month Tiana Byrnes founder of Twin Equipment and Tool Rentals Ltd. was selected as a semifinalist for Pow Wow Pitch a competition for emerging Indigenous entrepreneurs in partnership with Royal Bank of Canada Shopify and Facebook.

Byrnes a registered member of Michipicoten First Nation was selected as one 156 semifinalists out of 1642 applications from across North America. She will go head-to-head with entrepreneurs from across the Ontario region and pitch to a panel of judges Sept. 22 for a chance to advance to the Pow Wow Pitch Finals in October.

“My hopes as a motivated entrepreneur is to diversify to a larger market by getting into the mines purchasing more equipment for long-term rentals and hiring more First Nations [staff]” said Byrnes speaking to SooToday Saturday. “This Pow Wow Pitch I applied for it because they are a community of Indigenous entrepreneurs and it’s to win $25000 to help your business grow.”

Twin Equipment and Tool Rentals Ltd. began earlier this year as an offshoot of Twin Mechanical Contracting Limited which is owned by her husband Daniel.

The couple purchased a building at the bottom of Mile Hill in December 2020 to house Twin Mechanical after the contracting business took off. But they saw yet another business opportunity present itself.

“We had a lot of people asking to rent our equipment because with the Twin Mechanical we purchased a lot of equipment along the way. We had seven excavators and skid steers lifts and all sorts of stuff” Byrnes said.

Twin Equipment and Tool Rentals Ltd. has grown ever since opening a Stihl dealership in March and adding a full-service shop to repair rental equipment. Twin Mechanical also operates out of the shop with a team of welders and pipefitters that do contracted fabrication work for Algoma Steel Inc.

Now Byrnes wants to diversify her heavy equipment rental business by doing business with the mining industry in northern Ontario.

“We are really pushing and hoping to get up into the mines up north” she said. “Because I’m status because I belong to Michipicoten First Nation I’m pushing to get equipment up into the mines for long-term rentals so that’s our long-term goal.”

Byrnes was recently announced as a Pow Wow Pitch semifinalist for the Ontario region after completing a virtual pitch before a panel of five judges Aug. 26 - on her 35th birthday no less.

“I was nervous only because I think when you sit down with somebody you kind of develop a relationship with somebody” said Byrnes. “But on the computer you have to have the pitch done within a minute and there's a timer on the screen and it counts down the seconds. And then a bell rings and then you’re like oh my god it’s over. Did I say everything properly?”

Byrnes says that she wants to grow the business for her four children.

“What I’ve noticed in the past year because of COVID the housing market out here has increased drastically. People want to move out of the city into the country because of COVID” she said. “I think that in the next 10 years Goulais River will be booming.”

“I have four boys so I’m just hoping to provide my children with a future. I want them to have a good business already established - and we’re already heading in that direction because my husband and I are the only owners and we work very hard and we’re very motivated. That’s all we do we just focus on getting our business developed so that our children someday will have a future.”

The Pow Wow Pitch semifinals can be viewed online Sept. 22 by submitting a registration form. The public can also vote for Byrnes to win the People’s Choice Prize of $500 and an express entry into the Grand Finale for the chance to win prizes ranging from $3000 to $25000.",,,,,,,,,

After months of uncertainty doctors and nurses finally saw a path for how they might end the public health crisis.

But now some nine months later caregivers are confronting the stress of responding to yet another COVID-19 surge with deeply conflicting emotions — their compassion for the sick at the bedside is accompanied by private moments of frustration over the suffering that might have been avoided had more patients opted for immunizations.

It's all been a recipe for what doctors and nurses are calling ""compassion fatigue"" and it's left many wondering whether they can continue managing burnout while responding to the call of duty.

""By and large our patients are unvaccinated and so much of the suffering … feels preventable"" said Dr. Jacob Lyons a critical care specialist at CentraCare in St. Cloud. ""That's where the heartbreak comes from …

""This didn't have to happen. It doesn't have to keep happening. And it looks like it will get worse.""

It's hard to know just how much burnout has contributed to staffing problems at Minnesota hospitals in recent weeks. Even though the health care industry sees it as a growing problem state officials say burnout hasn't been the primary driver for hiring in the past.

But after more than a year of treating pandemic patients many health care workers are talking about leaving the field altogether and some are retiring early. This summer caregivers have tried to reduce hours or take needed leaves and vacations. Some have transferred out of intensive care and other critical units searching for less stressful work.

""I'm not going to lie it takes a lot of hours of the day to try and fill those shifts"" said Chris Boese the chief nursing officer at Regions Hospital in St. Paul.

Hospitals are meeting the challenge and providing good care Boese said but the latest surge means patients again are lining up in the ER awaiting beds upstairs. Health care providers are wired to help patients she said but many are disappointed because they ""feel like we're battling in a war and there's no end in sight — and patients could have done something about this.""

Frustration and sadness

Jessica White worked as an ICU nurse during Minnesota's first three COVID waves. In June when her unit at North Memorial Health Hospital finally got quiet White was able to reflect on the experience and opted to make a change.

""I just decided I did not want to go through another wave of COVID dealing with all that loss and sickness"" said White 45 of Plymouth. ""I'm not a crier but I would cry all the time.""

White now works in a hospital unit that cares for patients before and after surgery. It's better for her mental health she said and sense of well-being. Even so every now and then White pulls a shift back in the intensive care unit.

The scenes she's witnessed recently of COVID patients struggling to survive are a painful contrast to her joyful memories of the spring when she volunteered giving shots at mass immunization events in Minneapolis. Having watched the pandemic arrive in the ICU White believed her work in the vaccine clinic was helping bring about its end.

""Now it feels like it's not hopeful — like this is never going to end because people are choosing to not get vaccinated"" she said. ""We've got people there who are so sick with COVID … and they're intubated and sedated and their family members still don't want to get vaccinated. For me it's frustration and it's sadness.""

Working in health care means caring for patients who smoke or eat unhealthy foods or who are sedentary or miss doctor visits — all of which can contribute to illness. Doctors and nurses are practiced at setting aside judgment so they can do everything possible to help the sick no matter the cause said Dr. Bryan Williams a pulmonary critical care specialist at M Health Fairview.

Health care providers are doing everything they can to help COVID patients who are unvaccinated too Williams said yet they find it hard to understand the decision to not get immunized with a vaccine that's been shown to be safe and effective.

""It's something easy that can be done"" he said. ""Stopping smoking is not easy. Avoiding some of the social determinants of health — not everybody has access to health care.

""But this is something we've worked really hard to make universally available"" he said. ""While some people still struggle to have the means to find it and get it and understand it we also know that a number of people have made the choice not to.""

Williams who is the chief well-being officer at M Health Fairview added: ""It's not personal when they come in — it's just frustrating in general. And it's a real blow to our compassion as it were. It's hard to keep going.""

'Struggling for hope'

As case counts rise and patients with COVID and other health problems fill her ICU nurse Ericka Larson Helling has felt torn by the text messages she regularly receives as the hospital looks to fill nursing shifts. She doesn't want to strand colleagues at work who need help but recognizes the need for time away too.

Larson Helling says she has some understanding for people who opt against vaccination. Even some nurses she points out believe they're adequately protected because of previous infection. But if people aren't going to get immunized they must be vigilant about stopping the spread in other ways she said like wearing masks and avoiding crowds. Yet many seem to deny COVID-19 is real.

""I didn't sign up to have people disbelieve the health care professionals — that we do have biology and science backgrounds and an understanding of vaccine"" Larson Helling said. ""For those folks who are kind of Google MDs — I don't mean to insult the public in any way but I wish you could see what I see.""

Amy Forkner is retiring later this year at 55 — much earlier than she ever expected. A nurse at St. John's Hospital in Maplewood she works in the operating room where patients are intubated a procedure that she says brings the chance of aerosolizing SARS-CoV-2.

The experience with personal protective equipment has shown that health care workers can work without getting sick but it weighs on you Forkner said. Of the delta variant that's driving the current COVID-19 surge she said: ""It's scary. You just don't know. It's so unknown. It's like we're starting the beginning of the pandemic all over again.""

Through it all there is still compassion for those sick with COVID-19 said Lyons the CentraCare physician. There's also sympathy he said for what doctors view as misunderstandings about the risks of the vaccine or alternative treatments pushed by some.

""We will still take care of anyone that comes to us"" he said. ""We're just really hoping not to have to.""

At the same time the profession is struggling.

Burnout mental health concerns and fatigue have driven nurses from intensive care units. Some nurses and doctors have entered counseling Lyons said for what is effectively ongoing post-traumatic stress disorder.

After summer's hopeful start the jump in COVID-19 patients during August was a terrible shock he said. Caregivers now are fearful about what coming months will bring particularly with large gatherings like the State Fair and the reopening of schools.

""I think the reality is that we're struggling for hope"" Lyons said. ""We have never been more joyful than when the vaccine got rolled out. The thought was that … it's not over but we've got a way to win. And the fact that that hasn't happened is the most defeating part of this last wave …

""We are today at an unexpected nadir of hope.""

VIRGINIA — The 2021 Forbes list of the best employers has been released with specific rankings for Virginia as well as the other 49 states and the District of Columbia.

To determine the rankings market research firm Statista surveyed 80000 Americans working for businesses with at least 500 employees. The respondents were asked to rate their employers on factors like work environment safety compensation opportunities for advancement and openness to telecommuting. Respondents were also asked how likely they would be to recommend their employers to others. Surveys were conducted from October 2020 to June 2021 accounting for some changes companies have made due to the coronavirus pandemic. The best employer in Virginia is Lockheed Martin according to Forbes' list issued recently. Microsoft NASA the Federal Reserve System and Wegmans Food Markets round out the top five in the rankings for Virginia.

Microsoft was ranked the top employer in DC. These are the top employers in Virginia according to Forbes:

Bank of America Home Depot and the U.S. Department of Defense are ranked in 29 states Walmart in 27 FedEx in 26 and UPS in 25. The full rankings are available online.

Although the pandemic hit the health care education and retail industries among the hardest employers in those fields dominated the rankings according to Forbes. They combined to account for 41 percent of the full 2021 list compared with 38 percent when the 2020 list came out. Microsoft for one has moved to adopt a hybrid work model even after the pandemic ends according to Forbes' report. The tech giant founded by Bill Gates had the No. 1 spot in four states on the lists. Costco Wholesale tied with Microsoft in states where it holds the top ranking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA5LzA1L3dhcmJ5LXBhcmtlci1pcy1nb2luZy1wdWJsaWMtc2hvdWxkLXlvdS1idXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warby Parker Is Going Public: Should You Buy?,"The direct-to-consumer eyewear retailer has a decade-long history of marketplace disruption.

Warby Parker the maker of affordable designer eyeglasses is going public. The direct-to-consumer (DTC) upstart was founded only 11 years ago but has already disrupted the eyewear industry with its range of styles and heavy attention to customer service that's spawned legions of loyal fans.

But rather than an initial public offering or the more faddish special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) the trendy eyeglass and sunglass maker will use a direct listing to circumvent the financial institutions and let insiders employees and early backers sell their shares directly to the public.

Yet while its sales are soaring Warby Parker hasn't been able to turn a profit. So let's look closer at whether the future's so bright the eyeglass maker will have to wear shades.

A unique way to sell glasses

Eyewear sales are soaring. Warby Parker ended 2020 with over $393 million in revenue. Over the last 12 months revenue jumped 33% higher to $487 million. Moreover sales keep accelerating: Over the first half of 2021 they've risen another 58% to more than $270 million indicating it still has plenty of runway for further expansion.

Warby Parker isn't your typical mall kiosk sunglass retailer or even a LensCrafters type of store (though it does have 145 retail locations). Instead it is an online retailer of eyewear which means it needed to overcome the reluctance consumers have for buying something sight unseen that reflects considerable individuality.

To do so it ships up to five styles to customers who can try them on at home to see which fits best and matches their personality (it also offers an iPhone app to try on frames virtually).

Buyers then upload their prescriptions to Warby Parker or use its prescription check app to get a new one and then wait for their new eyeglasses to arrive. It's also helpful that it has partnered with a number of insurance companies including Aetna Cigna Humana and UnitedHeath Group for in-network coverage.

Costly customer acquisition

The system seems to be working. Warby Parker had over 2 million active customers as of June 30 up from 1.81 million at the end of last year. Many were also attracted by the company's buy one give one program where for every pair of glasses purchased it donates a second pair to the needy. It says over 8 million pairs of glasses have been distributed through the program.

Yet just because a company does good in the world doesn't mean it's a good investment and that's where it gets a little murkier for investors.

After breaking even in 2019 Warby Parker ended last year with a net loss of $55.9 million. The bottom-line loss resulted from advertising costs jumping 35% over the previous year to $58.5 million. And while operating losses narrowed somewhat in the first six months of this year the company says it expects to keep posting operating losses for the foreseeable future as it tries to further expand its business.

And that's really the difficulty many DTC brands face: the ever-expanding costs of marketing and advertising to acquire customers which now represent almost 20% of Warby Parker's sales at the end of 2020 up from 13% the year before. Where it cost $27 to acquire a customer in 2019 last year it jumped to $40 each.

Moreover even though the average revenue per customer has risen to $218 the operating profit contribution per customer fell to $45. That led to direct customer-level operating margins of 21% a decline from the 26% earned in 2019.

A growing brick-and-mortar presence

What investors need to be wary of is that Warby Parker seems to be padding its customer acquisition numbers to soften the blow. Rather than just dividing the number of customers acquired by the amount it cost to acquire them as most companies do it includes all active customers which it defines as someone who's made a purchase over the past year.

So its figures include a mix of new and existing customers muddying the waters and indicating its chances of becoming profitable might not be easily achieved.

However Warby Parker has turned to stores as its primary revenue contributor (at least they were before the pandemic). In 2019 the stores represented 65% of total revenue but that fell to 40% after the COVID-19 outbreak shuttered them for a period. Retail outlets have risen back to 50% this year as the stores reopened but we may see the company continue to build out its physical footprint in a bid to lower some of those customer acquisition costs.

But stores are not cost-free either and were actually a hindrance during the pandemic to retailers that still had to pay rent on their closed stores. Look for Warby Parker's expenses to keep rising in the future.

Put on your green eyeshades

Warby Parker intends to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol WRBY but an investor might want to wait before jumping into the stock.

As more consumers shop online a DTC brand like Warby Parker should experience more growth but the eyeglass retailer hasn't indicated it will be profitable growth anytime soon. For that reason any initial euphoria over its debut could quickly fade under the harsh glare of close market scrutiny.

The trained health care workers who were women included community health workers nursing assistants and midwives who account for more than 90% of the health workforce providing care at the primary health care level in hard-to-reach communities in Guyana.

Recognizing the imperative to provide services for people with mental neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders in remote communities and bridge the gap between available resources and the large need for mental health services the PAHO Guyana country office over the last five years has been collaborating with the Ministry of Health to:

Strengthen advocacy effective leadership and governance for mental health neurological and substance use disorders;

Provide comprehensive integrated and responsive mental health and social care services in community-based settings for early recognition and evidence-based management of childhood mental disorders;

Implement strategies for the promotion of psychosocial well-being prevention of mental disorders and promotion of human rights of people with mental illnesses and;

Strengthen information systems evidence and research.

The Mental Health Global Action Programme -Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) was adapted to Guyana's unique local situation. To date approximately 440 health care professionals in the country have been trained in the use of this intervention guide. The mhGAP intervention will continue to be a key technical tool to deliver care for people with MNS disorders in Guyana leading us closer to achieving the goal of Universal Health Coverage.

The training methods included explanatory flowcharts quizzes games self-assessment tests and role-plays in the participants native dialects. As part of the plans for the new biennium 2022-23 PAHO will continue capacity building activities for improved metal health outcomes at the community level with a focus on indigenous and hard to reach communities.

As part of the workshop the Family and Community Health Units also collaborated with the Mental Health Unit of the Ministry of Health to conduct a combined health workshop. Nineteen (19) participants from the subdistricts of Kamarang Jawalla Phillipi Wax Creek Imbamadai Quebnang Wayalayeng Pariuma Kako and Chinoweing Village.

Over about 50% of the health workers have taken the COVID-19 vaccine from the ten districts. They were encouraged to be vaccinated to stop the spread of the pandemic.

During the sensitization sessions Healthcare workers (HCW) raised the issues of lack of EPI Manual not enough information on COVID-19 vaccines lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of health education materials. These are challenges faced by HCW in the regions.

The facilitator evaluated the MCH workers on the correct use of the Non-Pneumatic Anti Shock Garment (NASG) specifically regarding placement removal and storage of the NASG. The facilitator reviewed the basic concepts on Post-Partum Hemorrhage. The MCH workers mentioned that since acquiring the suit they did not have any patient with Post-Partum Haemorrhage that required the use of the garment.

The use of condom tamponade was taught as part of the Zero Maternal Death from hemorrhage training in Kamarang in 2018.

Participants were evaluated during the practical session to demonstrate the correct placement and use of this intervention

At the end of the training session the frontline workers and pregnant women were presented with 50 care packages to reduce COVID-19 transmission in this remote area.

To implement Section 35(b) of the Universal Healthcare Act (“UHC Act“) the Department of Health (DOH) has issued Administrative Order No. 2021-0036 entitled ‘Guidelines on Compliance with Section 35(b) of [the UHC Act]: All Drug Medical Device Biological and Medical Supplies Manufacturers to Submit Reports on Disclosure of Financial Relationships with Health Care Providers and Health Care Professionals’ (“Disclosure Guidelines” ). The Disclosure Guidelines require covered drug and medical device companies to submit Disclosure Reports on their financial relationships with healthcare providers and healthcare professionals (collectively HCP ) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1

The Disclosure Guidelines took effect on 24 July 2021 15 days from the date of publication in a newspaper of general circulation. Under FDA Advisory No. 2021-2035 dated 16 August 2021 the first Disclosure Report under the Disclosure Guidelines shall be due on 15 September 2021.

Implications for covered companies

The Disclosure Guidelines apply to FDA-licensed manufacturers traders re-packers distributor-importers and distributor-wholesalers of drugs medical devices and biological products including vaccines and medical supplies registered with the FDA (“Covered Persons“). These Covered Persons will now be subject to additional compliance obligations and greater transparency in their dealings with HCPs by requiring Covered Persons to file regular Disclosure Reports to the FDA.

What the regulation says

The Disclosure Guidelines require all Covered Persons to document maintain records submit to the DOH and FDA and make publicly available data and information on all financial relationships directly or indirectly with HCPs both in the private and public sectors.

Financial relationships with HCPs cover the following:

All sponsorship of events research and educational grants payment of services space rentals or facility fees donations for patients and other service arrangements All donations educational grants research funding sponsorship related to events travel and accommodation registration fees honoraria support for continuing professional development royalties current or prospective ownership or investment interest consultancy/speakership fees among other arrangements For drugstores payments for disease awareness partnership programs training of drugstore pharmacists conducted by companies or training of drugstore pharmacists conducted by third parties on behalf of companies or financial relationships of a similar nature

Under the implementing rules and regulations of the UHC Act (“UHC Act IRR“) ‘financial relationship’ includes ‘transfers of value’ which cover direct or indirect transfer of benefits or gains whether in cash in kind or otherwise made whether for promotional purposes or otherwise in connection with the development or sale of drugs medical devices and biological and medical supplies.

The Disclosure Report shall not include regular commercial or trade transactions2 between the Covered Persons and the HCPs. However the DOH Public Health Ethics Committee (PHEC) may request for information on such transactions in case of an investigation.

The Disclosure Reports must be submitted online through the FDA Online Disclosure Report System (ODRS) that can be accessed via https://odrs.fda.gov.ph.

Covered Persons shall be responsible to record track and check all financial relationships with HCPs3 by establishing an electronic database procedures and system for financial relationships which may be subject to inspection by the PHEC.

The president CEO chairperson owner or top management of all Covered Persons is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the Disclosure Reports. The FDA shall provide such person with the account and access to the ODRS which may be shared or delegated to their authorized officer or personnel for full compliance purposes.

The Disclosure Report must be submitted on a semi-annual basis as provided below:

Covered period Deadline for updating in the ODRS First half of the current year* 15 July of the current year Second half of the current year 15 January of the succeeding year

*As provided in FDA Advisory No. 2021-2035 the first Disclosure Report covering January 2021 to June 2021 is due for filing with the FDA on 15 September 2021.

The PHEC may request for updates at any time of the year for the purpose of determining potential or actual conflicts of interest especially when assessing evaluating or monitoring government or DOH projects or programs.

Failure of a Covered Person to submit and update the Disclosure Reports will constitute a violation of the FDA Act and its implementing rules and regulations and may be a basis or ground for the PHEC to investigate process and recommend to the FDA to conduct an inspection of the Covered Persons check on the financial relationship with HCPs and report the findings.

Actions to consider

Covered Persons should implement and have a system in place to record monitor and maintain records relating to all their financial relationships with HCPs to allow them to comply with the obligations under the Disclosure Guidelines.

To ensure compliance with the regulations affected establishments should also understand the financial relationships that are covered by the disclosure requirements and those that are exempt from disclosure.

The Chief Medical Director of the Federal Teaching Hospital Ido Ekiti (FETHI) Ekiti State Prof. Ebenezer Adekunle Ajayi who made the call said the support will enhance access to affordable healthcare.

He also canvassed for social health insurance as a way of achieving universal health coverage.

Professor Ajayi stated this in Ido Ekiti at the weekend during the maiden edition of FETHI stakeholders’ forum with the theme: Health Care Financing In Nigeria Harnessing Non-Governmental Contribution.

He said “Government is stretched out of its element in trying to manage something as complex and personal as healthcare with ensuring improved health outcomes in a tailspin.

“Therefore it is imperative to beef up the financing system of this sector by exploring non-governmental contributions.

“Collaborations must remain buttered up to ensure delivery of efficient effective and equitable services”.

He said the forum attracted hospital stakeholders from public and private sectors with direct bearings on operating territory at all government levels and equipped with the capacity to stir the institution in right directions.

“It was also to present our stewardship account for partners to witness our mileposts development reflection on past times and now as well as take stock of changes and fill gaps to the betterment of the institution”.

The CMD who noted that despite being entirely funded by the federal government and from its internally generated revenue said over 50 million indigent patients’ bills have been written off in the last two years due to their inability to pay.

He summarized the needs of the institution to four different initiatives which were discussed and reviewed by stakeholders and invited members of the public.

These according to him are hospital infrastructure improvement initiative adopt a ward initiative capacity building/training initiative for staff and indigent patients fund initiative(Alaanu Fund).

In his speech the Chairman FETHI Governing Board Hon Mohammed Sukababa said Nigeria sector is facing a tough time and all hands must be on deck at a period like this.

“As a matter of fact we need to know that the government cannot do it alone. Therefore the need to bring improvement into our health systems demands collective efforts.

“Our goal is to ensure that the standard of quality health service delivery that is affordable and accessible are not compromised” he said.

Among the dignitaries present at the forum were Afe Babalola Professor Joseph Oluwasanm Bishop of Ekiti State Catholic Diocese Bishop Felix Ajakaye Dr Kayode Akinlade representative of Commissioner for Health Dr Oyebanji Filani State Chairman of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) Special Adviser to the Governor on Diaspora Mr Femi Odere traditional rulers among others.",,,,,,

The smell of rotten eggs the signature scent of sulphur emissions lingered in the air. In an effort to burn off toxic chemicals before and after Hurricane Ida many industrial facilities sent the gases through smoke stacks topped with flares.

But the hurricane blew out some of those flares like candles allowing harmful pollution into the air.

Health concerns linked to potential toxic exposure underscore the array of long-term impacts brought by the category 4 storm that struck southeast Louisiana earlier this week. As of Thursday afternoon nearly a million homes and businesses were without power leaving hundreds of thousands more without access to clean water. And with hundreds of chemical facilities located within the path of the hurricane numerous air quality tracking systems were left out of commission. It’s unclear how long it will take to assess the full scope of the damage and its toll on residents.

The degree of the pollution is still unknown in part because phone lines have been down in portions of the state including the hotline for the Louisiana State Police which has deployed its hazardous materials unit to handle toxic emissions from industrial facilities in the past according to an Environmental Protection Agency report. So far the US Coast Guard has received 17 calls about air releases to the National Response Center including multiple reports of ammonia released into the air because flares were blown out by the storm.

About 50% of the US petroleum refining capacity and 51% of the US natural gas processing capacity are based along the Gulf of Mexico according to the US Energy Information Administration. The industrial facilities have become an added hazard when hurricanes come ashore. In a matter of just a few days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in 2017 air pollution levels added up to 39% of the total unauthorized emissions of the previous year in the Houston area said Luke Metzger the executive director for Environment Texas.

“These emissions absolutely can be big enough to contribute to health problems” he said.

The degree of the public health concern is harder to gauge in Louisiana where air monitoring efforts are often slow to capture peak emission levels directly after a storm when facilities are likely to belch pollution. After Hurricane Laura came ashore near the border of Texas and Louisiana in August last year the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality sent out a mobile air monitoring van to detect air pollution in the state within 15 hours. It was days before Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality did the same.

Four days after Hurricane Ida there was still no data posted to the state agency’s website from its mobile air monitors. A state mobile air monitoring lab was expected to deploy Thursday to Norco about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of New Orleans according to an EPA report. The Shell refinery there has indicated it will continue flaring until electricity is restored to its facility said Wilma Subra an environmental scientist with the Louisiana Environmental Action Network organization who was awarded the MacArthur grant for her work helping residents to understand the public health risks of industrial pollution.

But the refinery’s lack of electricity and inability to supply steam and nitrogen to the flares means chemicals are not being burned off properly causing thick black smoke to pour into the sky above residents who are repairing their damaged roofs and cutting broken branches from trees.

“Community members in Norco have a right to know what chemicals are in the air they are breathing” Subra said.

Shell is still assessing the impact of Hurricane Ida on the Norco refinery and another refinery in Geismar Louisiana said Curtis Smith a company spokesman. Essential personnel are staffing the facilities but it’s too early to know when they will resume full operations he added.

“While the site remains safe and secure we are experiencing elevated flaring. We expect this to continue until power is restored” Smith said. Smith did not respond to a question about whether neighbors should be concerned that their health could be impacted by the emissions.

A state air monitor in Norco stopped collecting data on the day of the storm. It’s among 17 state air monitoring sites that stopped working due to power outages according to an EPA report. The Valero refinery in St Bernard Parish notified the EPA that it shutdown its community air monitoring station to protect the equipment. The company was required to notify the federal agency because of past violations of the Clean Air Act at the refinery under its previous owner Murphy Oil. During Hurricane Katrina the refinery’s tank farm flooded leaking more than a million gallons of crude oil into 1800 homes according to the EPA.

It’s unclear how quickly Valero is required to get the air monitor back in operation. That’s because it’s owned by the company not the state said Greg Langley a spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. “We get readings submissions but the monitor is not part of our reporting system” he said. “LDEQ does not dictate when it is turned on and turned off.” After Hurricane Laura came ashore in the Lake Charles region air monitors in the area were out from one to four weeks.

In addition to the public health risks posed by hazardous air pollution and oil and gas spills during hurricanes fossil fuel companies have also damaged Louisiana’s natural storm defense system. Some of the oil and gas processed in industrial facilities were pulled from the state’s marshlands. To develop wells companies cut thousands of miles of canals through the wetlands. The canals allow saltwater to creep into the root systems of freshwater marsh plants killing and sinking wetlands.

Louisiana has lost 2000 sq miles (5000 sq km) of land since the 1930s. It’s estimated that about a third of that wetland loss is from oil and gas development said Alex Kolker a coastal scientist who serves on the science advisory group for the state’s Climate Initiatives Task Force. Without these wetlands coastal communities are more vulnerable to storm surge and flooding.

Hurricanes themselves also rip up wetlands and storms intensified by climate change are likely to do more damage. This creates a positive feedback loop where wetlands ripped up by hurricanes make communities more vulnerable to the next hurricane Kolker said.

Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards created the state’s Climate Initiatives Task Force with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the state to net zero by 2050. The majority of carbon emissions in the state – about 49% – are from the industrial sector. But the state’s reduction goals aren’t aimed at toxic emissions the bigger concern following storms.

“When I think about releases from a storm like this I’m more concerned about toxic releases than I am about greenhouse gas emissions” Kolker said.

Un vendedor de armas de un puesto del mercado de Panjwai en la provincia de Kandahar (sur de Afganistán) el 4 de septiembre de 2021 afp_tickers

2 minutos

La llegada al poder de los talibanes en Afganistán quizá haya sumido al país en la incertidumbre y agravado su situación económica pero el vendedor de armas Khan Mohammad le está sacando partido a la situación.

Situada entre una farmacia y una tienda de alimentación general su tienda situada en el distrito de Panjwai en Kandahar (sur) cuna de los talibanes ha renovado sus existencias.

Entre chalecos de camuflaje y cartucheras colgando de las paredes Khan Mohammad va mostrando todo lo que tiene: pistolas Smith & Wesson ametralladoras cinturones de munición granadas walkie-talkies vasijas llenas de balas…

El final del conflicto llevó a muchos a pensar que ya no necesitan sus armas por lo que decidieron venderlas explica Mohammad.

“Gente que tenía armas en casa desde hacía años nos las trajo” explicó.

“Nosotros las compramos y las vendemos […] a los muyahidines” explica en alusión a los talibanes. “Los talibanes no dejan que nadie más las tenga”.

Mohammad no solo vende armas sino también accesorios como gorras de béisbol blancas con la profesión de fe musulmana estampada y banderas del movimiento islamista.

Otro puesto del mercado decorado con banderas talibanas y fotografías de los principales líderes del movimiento propone rifles de asalto (variantes del AK-47 y M4 y M16 de fabricación estadounidense) y hasta ametralladoras ligeras.

Durante los años los talibanes han comprado sus armas y municiones en el mercado negro. También han recuperado armas y equipos encontrados en el campo de batalla indican la ONU y observadores occidentales.

El creciente colapso del ejército militar ha supuesto un maná de armas para los milicianos.

Ahora los talibanes cuentan no solo con armas de infantería de fabricación estadounidense sino también con equipos y vehículos punteros como los “humvee” vehículos blindados de transporte de tropas y al menos un helicóptero Black Hawk en buen estado de funcionamiento.

En paralelo continúan sacando provecho de las bases militares afganas y occidentales abandonadas.

En julio conquistaron el distrito de Panjwai aprovechando la retirada de las tropas lideradas por Estados Unidos de Afganistán.

En el polvoriento mercado de Panjwai todo lo que fue los talibanes encontraron en la base del distrito está puesto a la venta.

“Compramos todas estas cosas de los talibanes después de que se apoderaran de la base del ejército afgano” comenta Murtaza un mercader que prefirió callar su apellido. “Ahora venimos al mercado para venderlas”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL2RlcG9yLmNvbS9mdXRib2wtaW50ZXJuYWNpb25hbC9pbmdsYXRlcnJhL2xhLWNhbWlzZXRhLWRlLWNyaXN0aWFuby1yb25hbGRvLWVuLW1hbmNoZXN0ZXItdW5pdGVkLXJvbXBlLXJlY29yZC1lbi12ZW50YXMtZW4tc29sby0xMi1ob3Jhcy1uY3pkLW5vdGljaWEv0gGsAWh0dHBzOi8vZGVwb3IuY29tL2Z1dGJvbC1pbnRlcm5hY2lvbmFsL2luZ2xhdGVycmEvbGEtY2FtaXNldGEtZGUtY3Jpc3RpYW5vLXJvbmFsZG8tZW4tbWFuY2hlc3Rlci11bml0ZWQtcm9tcGUtcmVjb3JkLWVuLXZlbnRhcy1lbi1zb2xvLTEyLWhvcmFzLW5jemQtbm90aWNpYS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,En solo 12 horas: la camiseta de Cristiano Ronaldo rompe récord en ventas,"El retorno de Cristiano Ronaldo al Manchester United ha superado cualquier expectativa en la Premier League. El jugador portugués volverá a vestir la dorsal 7 siendo parte de los ‘Red Devil’s luego de que Edinson Cavani le cediera el número; y a solo doce horas de que se iniciara la venta de la camiseta del ‘Comandante’ la cantidad adquirida por los aficionados ya es un récord mundial.

Según información de ‘Fox Sports’ y el especialista en finanzas Kieran Maguire la venta por la camiseta de Cristiano llegó a la cifra de hasta el momento de la publicación 406 250 unidades vendidas en las primeras doce horas. Una cantidad que rompió un récord dentro de la Premier League.

Manchester United ingresó la cantidad de casi 38 millones de euros solo por camisetas vendidas. Sin embargo la cantidad que ingresó al club fue el 10% de las ganancias cantidad que acordó con los patrocinadores de la equipación.

De esta manera con la mitad de un día los ‘Red Devils’ completaron la cuarta parte del fichaje que pagó a la Juventus de Turín. En los próximos días se verá la cantidad que logrará recaudar CR7 solo en camisetas dado que las entradas para el partido contra Newcastle que sería su regreso a Old Trafford se encuentran agotadas.

Cavani le cedió el ‘7′ a Cristiano

Cristiano Ronaldo retornó por todo lo alto al Manchester United; sin embargo una de las primeras dudas que se generó estuvo relacionada a la dorsal que usaría dado que Edinson Cavani llevaba la 7. El club inglés dio a conocer la voluntad del futbolista uruguayo decidió ceder su camiseta al jugador portugués.

“El Manchester United puede confirmar que Cristiano usará la icónica camiseta número 7 después de regresar a Old Trafford. La superestrella portuguesa usó el legendario número de camiseta durante su primera etapa en el United y ahora podemos confirmar que Ronaldo lo tendrá en la espalda una vez más” dice el comunicado.

Juan Pellicer research analyst de IntoTheBlock compartió un análisis con Cointelegraph en Español en el que explicó qué es Axie Infinity y también mostró métricas para entender lo que está sucediendo en el ambiente gamer.

¿Qué es Axie Infinity?

Axie Infinity es un juego en línea multijugador desarrollado desde 2018 por la empresa vietnamita Sky Mavis. Es un juego de batallas en el que criaturas llamadas Axies pueden ser intercambiadas en la blockchain como tokens no fungibles (NFTs).

El juego emplea dos tokens llamados AXS (Axie Infinity Shards) y SLP (Smooth Love Potion). Únicamente por jugar al juego y completar misiones los jugadores pueden ganar estos tokens y venderlos en exchanges de criptomonedas consiguiendo así ingresos por jugar.

“Este factor está redefiniendo cómo entendemos los juegos tradicionales y ha dado lugar al fenómeno que conocemos como play-to-earn” remarcó Pellicer.

A continuación se analizarán las métricas de Axie Infinity así como la comunidad que hay detrás del juego desde un enfoque analítico ¿Dónde está el límite para Axie Infinity? ¿Pueden los traders de AXS beneficiarse también de este crecimiento? Pellicer trató de responder estas preguntas con un extenso trabajo de investigación.

Equipo desarrollo inversores y planes de futuro

El juego ha estado en desarrollo por parte de Sky Mavis durante más de tres años así que -según este analista- se encuentra en un estado muy maduro.

“Los smart contracts son públicos en su Github. Curiosamente el equipo quiere conseguir un juego donde los jugadores puedan convertirse en desarrolladores de parte del juego e interactuar con él mediante el desarrollo de mapas y diseños. Esto significa que gradualmente la creación del juego será descentralizada y cualquier persona podrá aportar. La comunidad de Axie Infinity es vibrante se reúnen en Discord donde el propio equipo de desarrolladores interactúan con frecuencia” detalló.

“El equipo de Axie Infinity ha celebrado tres rondas de inversión donde consiguieron un total de nueve millones de dólares gracias a inversores como Mark Cuban Hashed Consensys Blocktower Capital Konvoy Ventures Libertus Capital 500 Startups Vietnam y Collaborative Fund” agregó luego.

También explicó que el siguiente hito para Axie infinity es avanzar con el desarrollo del ecosistema de su token AXS y los staking rewards que ofrecerá.

“Además tienen planeado un lanzamiento móvil tanto para Android como para iOS así como el lanzamiento de una organización autónoma descentralizada (DAO) que ejercerá labores de gobernanza sobre el ecosistema de Axie Infinity. El año que viene se espera que se lance su Metaverso llamado Lunacia lo que permitirá el intercambio de parcelas digitales del juego” añadió Pellicer.

Métricas y crecimiento

Debido al crecimiento sin precedentes de Axie Infinity los datos de IntoTheBlock confirmaron que este mes se sobrepasaron los 1000 millones de dólares acumulados en volumen de ventas y un millón de usuarios activos diarios.

“Esta cifra de volumen era algo que hasta el momento solamente había sido logrado por OpenSea el mercado de NFTs. Para poner en perspectiva estas cifras vale la pena poner en contexto la de otros proyectos de NFTs populares como NBA Top Shot o Cryptopunks que están alcanzando los 700 millones de dólares en volumen de ventas acumulado” contrastó.

Fuente: Volumen de ventas acumulado de Axie Infinity y OpenSea datos por Axieworld y Etherscan

“No sería ninguna sorpresa que este crecimiento exponencial continuase considerando que los mercados de Axie Infinity como Open Sea están manejando volúmenes de venta que oscilan entre los 50 y 30 millones de dólares diarios” precisó el analista de IntoTheBlock.

Pellicer señaló que actualmente OpenSea vende algunos Axie que no fueron mudados a la red Ronin (la sidechain de Axie Infinity sobre Ethereum) pero su volumen es negligible. También dijo que otra métrica que sorprende son los ingresos que estos dos proyectos están consiguiendo: “Son tales que es difícil de apreciar su crecimiento sin una gráfica en escala logarítmica. A este ritmo están añadiendo un cero a sus cifras de ingresos cada par de meses”.

El analista reflexionó: “Es interesante comparar las cifras de ingresos con otras compañías cotizadas públicamente del sector de los videojuegos gracias a que publican de forma abierta sus cifras en los reportes trimestrales”.

Para esta comparación eligieron dos compañías muy populares como Nintendo y Activision Blizzard.

“Cabe mencionar que la comparación no es totalmente justa ya que Axie Infinity es un único juego mientras que otras compañías son propietarias de cientos de juegos. Además los costes del desarrollo de Axie Infinity no son públicos y no pueden ser descontados directamente. Además los inversores que poseen el token AXS todavía no tienen la capacidad de beneficiarse directamente de las ventas que ocurren en Axie Infinity. La forma de premiar a los inversores de AXS está siendo desarrollada y será discutida de una forma abierta y descentralizada cuando pronto Axie Infinity sea gobernada por un DAO” aclaró.

**Datos anualizados hasta Agosto

“El ratio Price-to-Earnings (P/E) define una manera de evaluar cuantitativamente a una empresa mediante la comparación entre su capitalización de mercado y sus ingresos. Un ratio P/E bajo significa que Axie Infinity está infravalorado comparado a estas otras empresas. Un ratio alto de ingresos por empleado mide la eficiencia de cada empleado para generar beneficio para la empresa. Ahora mismo los ingresos que cada empleado de Axie Infinity genera son 20-30 veces mayores que los de otras empresas tradicionales de videojuegos. Evidentemente a medida que una empresa crece este ratio necesariamente decrece pero esto es una buena muestra de cómo las empresas crypto pueden conseguir ingresos enormes con diez veces menos empleados que las compañías tradicionales” explicó.

Mecánicas de AXS

El motor central detrás del crecimiento de ingresos de Axie Infinity es el token de gobernanza AXS junto con la popularidad del juego. El 10 de Agosto AXS se incrementó en un 35% hasta alcanzar los 60 dólares. Este salto en el precio extiende el imparable rally que AXS empezó hace dos meses y ya acumula una apreciación de más del 900%.

Evolución del precio de AXS por IntoTheBlock app.

Según relató las mecánicas del token han sido diseñadas durante los últimos dos años y su propósito es el de alinear los incentivos tanto de los desarrolladores del juego como de los jugadores con un modelo que incremente la tesorería del juego gracias a las ventas dentro del mismo juegok a la vez que se premie a los gamers que participen activamente y formen parte de la comunidad.

También detalló que la fuente de ingresos de la tesorería de Axie Infinity viene de dos procesos: “La cría de Axies que cuesta AXS y una tarifa de 4.25% en cada transacción del mercado del juego. Los premios de los jugadores se pagan por jugar y son mayoritariamente en el token SLP dependiendo de las puntuaciones que se consigan y la cantidad de partidas jugadas por semana. También se pueden recibir pagos en AXS si se consigue puntuar por encima de la mayoría de jugadores. Estos premios en tokens podrían resultar en un aumento de la presión de venta de los tokens lo cual es minimizado con incentivos para que los jugadores mantengan los tokens. Estos incentivos son el poder participar en el futuro del juego mediante propuestas de gobernanza a través del DAO y la posibilidad de ganar premios por hacer staking lo cual se activará sobre este 2021”.

“Es probable que tanto jugadores como clanes empiecen a acumular incluso más AXS tan pronto como el DAO sea funcional y los premios por hacer staking sean activados dado que esto proporcionará una fuente de ingresos adicional” añadió.

Según él la descentralización de Axie Infinity está en camino y gradualmente supondrá el traslado del desarrollo del juego y sus decisiones económicas desde Sky Mavis a una organización descentralizada gestionada por la comunidad. “Esto es un cambio de paradigma donde un juego con un beneficio mensual de más de 100 millones de dólares estará en posesión y será completamente gobernado por la propia comunidad que lo juega. La aplicación en Crypto que más beneficio genera será gestionada de forma descentralizada sin una autoridad central que decida sobre él” destacó.

Datos on-chain de AXS

¿Pero qué dicen las métricas on-chain de AXS? Un buen termómetro del interés que tienen los inversores sobre el token son los datos de direcciones:

Métricas de total de direcciones datos por IntoTheBlock app.

Juan Pellicer aclaró que el crecimiento de direcciones con un balance es una muestra de que hay un afluencia de holders interesados en mantener o intercambiar el token. Y señaló que “Total Zero Balance” es una métrica en el que su crecimiento es bajista ya que indica la cantidad de traders que han vendido todos sus tokens.

Por otra parte dijo que es una métrica alcista que el crecimiento de direcciones “total with balance” crezca más rápido que las direcciones “Total Zero Balance” ya que significa que hay más inversores comprando el token que vendiendo todas sus posiciones.

“El sentimiento de inversores comprando y manteniendo el token es importante pero también lo es durante cuánto tiempo están dispuestos a mantener ese token. En el caso de AXS el token ha sido mantenido durante un 80% de su ciclo de vida. Esto significa que los holders de AXS tiene una perspectiva positiva a largo plazo” punutalizó.

Tiempo medio el token es mantenido por IntoTheBlock.

AXS está diseñado para aumentar en valor cuanta más gente empieza a jugar. El análisis de sentimiento es una métrica que pódría ser útil para medir el nivel del interés del juego generalizado y no solo por entusiastas del mundo crypto. Desde que Axie Infinity se hizo viral este verano especialmente en Filipinas el interés se ha mantenido notablemente alto como muestran las tendencias en motores de búsquedas:

Conclusión

Para el analista en este momento las métricas on-chain apuntan a una perspectiva positiva a largo plazo para Axie Infinity y AXS.

“Las cifras de volumen y beneficios actuales le posicionan entre las aplicaciones Crypto que más facturan. Además hay una expectación enorme de cómo la descentralización del juego se llevará a cabo a través de dotar de mayor poder a la propia comunidad del juego.

detenerte por hacer entregas o ventas en el Metro? Esto dice la ley,"Muchos mexicanos utilizan los torniquetes del Sistema de Transporte Colectivo (STC) Metro o incluso los andenes para realizar entregas y ventas; sin embargo algunos han sido detenidos por policías.

De acuerdo con varios testimonios algunos usuarios del Metro han acordado verse en algún punto de las instalaciones del transporte pero temen que puedan ser detenidos por las autoridades.

Y es que fue en 2020 cuando el Metro emitió un comunicado en el que asegura que las “actividades como el intercambio de bienes o entregas de productos no están prohibidos dentro de las instalaciones”.

No obstante las autoridades dejaron en claro que sólo se permitirá lo anterior “siempre y cuando no represente una actividad ilícita o propicie el ambulantaje”.

Específicamente también se aclara que tampoco son motivo de aseguramiento o remisión en tanto no se ponga en riesgo la seguridad de las personas usuarias las instalaciones o el servicio y permitan el libre tránsito.

Sin embargo las autoridades del Metro señalaron que los policías sí pueden actuar de manera administrativa ante la venta de productos al interior de las instalaciones.

“Al detectar a personas ejerciendo actividades como el intercambio de bienes o entregas de productos que no signifiquen una falta se actuará con todo comedimiento y los invitará a retirarse de las instalaciones” se lee.

Además agregaron que en caso de que las personas se nieguen a obedecer se actuará conforme a derecho corresponda lo que se refiere a los protocolos de seguridad de la Secretaría de Seguridad Ciudadana (SSC).

Es por esta razón que ante una venta en los torniquetes o andenes no se te puede detener sino sólo conminar a salir de las instalaciones para que puedas realizar tus negocios afuera."

LAPLACE — Amidst the sweltering heat limited water supply and lack of electricity following Hurricane Ida clean clothes and the ability to connect to the internet can seem like a luxury.

Companies like Verizon and Tide are aiming to provide a “load of hope” and alleviate some stress for residents at this time by setting up areas in the Walmart parking lot on West Airline Highway to provide laundry services and free Wi-Fi.

Laura Karnes of Matthew 25: Ministries which is partnering with Tide in the effort said volunteers are washing drying and folding one bag of laundry per household each day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Those who drop off a bag of laundry are notified via text or call when it’s ready. But since so many still have spotty cell reception Karnes said pick-up can be within a 24-hour period.

Only clothes and a few towels are eligible but bedding is not. Karnes said Tide and the ministry plan to be in the Walmart parking lot location indefinitely.

By noon Karnes had already reached capacity after receiving 200 loads of laundry. For those who asked she provided sample-sized laundry detergent.

LaPlace resident Mavis Drayton said it was “a beautiful idea.” Her home sustained significant damage to the roof master bedroom and hallway after the ceiling collapsed. And between going back-and-forth among friends and family for shelter it’s a lifesaver.

“I had nowhere to go to wash” Drayton said. “And no running water. I was going to have to ride all the way to Gonzales New Orleans or wherever has electricity.”

After dropping off her load it was ready within an hour and a half she said. Shortly after she was on her way back home to continue gathering her belongings.

LaPlace resident Heather James said with so much damage in the area the ability to do some laundry “is awesome.” While she lost the roof of her house she’s been trying to update as many locals as she can about the resources that are available.

“Everybody has been asking when they’ll be here” James said. “It helps especially being 100 degrees outside and no water.”

James is the mother of a 4-year-old and 6-year-old. She said it’s difficult for them to understand “why things are this way.”

“We’ve been helping everyone else but we need to help ourselves too” she added.

LaPlace resident Nichole Williams didn’t make it before capacity was reached at noon. But she vowed to be in the line early Sunday morning to have her laundry taken care of.

“It is a blessing” Williams said. “You never think something like this is available at a time like this. I’m so appreciative. Just to have clean clothes while we’re cleaning is perfect.”

A few hundred feet away is a Verizon trailer which is offering free Wi-Fi and charging stations for devices. Ryan Herd from New Jersey is part of Verizon’s Emergency Response Team and said another trailer is set up in Hammond with a third to be deployed soon.

“It’s the little things” Herd said. “Whatever it takes to help.”

But Herd finds himself in a situation similar to many of the people he’s assisting. He said Hurricane Ida hit his home as well resulting in a hole in the roof and water throughout the home. For that reason he’ll soon return home to begin his recovery efforts.

Barry Cummins who works at a local plant said being able to connect to Wi-Fi “makes a difference” for him.

Though the Verizon trailer operates 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Herd said the Wi-Fi is accessible 24 hours a day for anyone who needs it which may be helpful when it comes to getting in touch with insurance providers. The network name and password is posted for everyone to see.

House Republicans warned Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer not to comply with January riot-related-records requests.

But Mayer hasn't been CEO of the telecom giant since 2017.

Verizon Media – which includes Yahoo – was sold to a private-equity firm this year. Its CEO is Guru Gowrappan.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

House Republicans wrote a letter to Marissa Mayer – who they described as ""President and Chief Executive Officer"" of Yahoo – warning her of legal action should the company hand over private data to a committee investigating the January 6 riot.

However Mayer hasn't been CEO of Yahoo since 2017 when she resigned after spending five years attempting to pull the media giant back from a steady demise. She also stepped down from the company's board and now runs a startup called Lumi Labs.

The letter is one of 13 that GOP congressional leaders sent to telecommunication giants threatening ""legal remedies"" should they comply with the House Select Committee which is investigating the early January insurrection at the US Capitol.

Amazon Apple Facebook Google and other big tech power players also received the letters according to Congressman Andy Biggs' office one of the letter's signees.

The House in June green-lit a plan to create a partisan select committee specifically to dig into the happenings of the January attack which led to the deaths of five people. The group asked 35 telecom and social media companies to preserve the phone records and data of some individuals – including members of the Trump family and those charged in connection with the riot – in regard to the events of that day.

The Republican architects of these new letters say that would violate federal law and ""would put every American with a phone or computer in the crosshairs of a surveillance state run by Democrat politicians"" House Minority Leader Kein McCarthy said last week.

Many of the letter's signees including Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia could be among those whose records might be requested CNN reported.

Verizon bought Yahoo in 2017 and merged it with AOL rebranding the pair as Oath with Alibaba alum Guru Gowrappan serving as CEO.

Oath would later be called Verizon Media and just this year it was announced that the company – which includes Yahoo AOL and tech news publication TechCrunch – was being sold to private-equity firm Apollo Global Management. Gowrappan will remain CEO of the entity Business Insider previously reported.

Judge Landee Holloway addressed Johnston via ZOOM while he appeared from the Missoula County Jail wearing a garment designed to keep him from harming himself.

“You are appearing before the court today because the County Attorney's office has filed a complaint charging you with one count of deliberate homicide a felony punishable by life imprisonment or not less than 10 or more than 100 years at Montana State Prison” said Judge Holloway. “It's alleged that on or about September 2 2021 the defendant purposely or knowingly caused the death of Jane Doe. Do you understand what you've been charged with and what the possible penalties could be?”

“Yes” replied Johnston.

Deputy County Attorney Brian Lowney spoke for the prosecution.

“The state is asking for the court set a $ one million dollar bail here and that's largely based on the nature of this offense but also the effects of the offense as the court can see from the affidavit” said Lowney. “This involves Mr. Johnston committing a brutal murder of his partner with a ligature strangulation.”

Lowney also added mitigating factors in his bail argument.

“Additionally this crime was committed in front of his children and I worry to think about how law enforcement might have become aware of this were it not for the bravery of the 11 year old child that was in the house and so the state feels that Mr. Johnston is simply too dangerous to remain in the community.”

Judge Holloway agreed with the prosecution’s assessment.

“The court will set bond in the amount of $1 million dollars” she said. Conditions of your release Mr. Johnston are that you obey all laws; you must appear at your scheduled court appearances. You must remain in the state of Montana. You're not to have any contact with the victims or prosecution witnesses including your children. Your next court appearance will be on September 13 at 9:00 a.m. up in District Court.”

Johnston was led away and remanded to the Missoula County Jail.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9wdGktc3Rvcmllcy91YWUtYW5ub3VuY2VzLXBsYW4tdG8taW52ZXN0LWluLWVjb25vbXktbGliZXJhbGl6ZS1sYXdzLTEyMTA5MDUwMDgxNV8xLmh0bWzSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL3B0aS1zdG9yaWVzL3VhZS1hbm5vdW5jZXMtcGxhbi10by1pbnZlc3QtaW4tZWNvbm9teS1saWJlcmFsaXplLWxhd3MtMTIxMDkwNTAwODE1XzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UAE liberalises stringent residency law major boost for visa seekers,"Specific projects have yet to be announced but $1.36 billion has been earmarked for Emirates Development Bank to support the industrial sector.

The United Arab Emirates announced on Sunday a major plan to stimulate its economy and liberalise stringent residency rules for foreigners as the country seeks to overhaul its finances and attract visitors and investment.

The nation's plan to lure foreign talent over the next decades reflects an emerging contrast with the other sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf that are growing increasingly protectionist as they try to diversify their oil-bound economies.

Now marking its 50th anniversary the UAE is seeking to accelerate its economic and social reforms to rebrand for a post-pandemic future.

Portraying the country as a liberal bustling trade and finance hub the government promised to pour USD 13.6 billion into the economy in the next year and USD 150 billion by 2030.

Specific projects have yet to be announced but USD 1.36 billion has been earmarked for Emirates Development Bank to support the industrial sector.

We are building the new 50 years' economy Thani al-Zeyoudi the minister of state for foreign trade said in an interview adding that free trade and openness have long made UAE a major global entrepot.

Anyone who is trying to be more conservative and trying to close their markets the value is going to be only in the short term but in the long term they're harming their economies.

Friction has grown between the UAE and its heavyweight neighbour Saudi Arabia which has taken a different strategy under the young and brash Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

In a push to prepare for a post-oil future the Saudi government has announced billions of dollars of investments in far-flung tourist projects and tried to diminish the role of expats to get more Saudis working in the private sector.

Buried within the raft of the UAE's flashy economic development initiatives on Sunday was a far more practical and drastic change to the country's visa system that governs the legions of foreign workers from Africa the Middle East and elsewhere who power the country's economy.

Since the UAE's independence the state has tied employment to residency status lending employers outsized power and forcing people to immediately leave the country if they lose their jobs.

We want to rebuild the whole system ... so that the residency system is attracting people and making sure they feel the UAE is home for them"" al-Zeyoudi said. Openness is something which we're proud of.

The new plans give residents an additional three months to seek other jobs after being fired allow parents to sponsor their children's visas until the age of 25 and ease visa restrictions on freelancers widows and divorced people among other things.

It's a subtle shift from the Gulf Arab state's traditional way of treating its vast foreign labor force as an expendable underclass.

Ministers also said they sought to double the UAE's economy in the next decade through major trade agreements with countries including Turkey the United Kingdom and India as well as Israel after a recent breakthrough deal to normalize relations.

The new projects come as the UAE reels from the economic shock of the pandemic which triggered the collapse of oil prices and crucial tourism markets when lockdowns strangled business and authorities cut spending. The country's economy shrank over 6 per cent last year according to government data with credit agencies estimating that the tourist hub of Dubai saw an even sharper decline of 11 per cent.

As the virus wrought havoc with layoffs rippling across the economy and prompting an exodus of foreign workers authorities last year introduced a series of reforms to draw more people and capital.

The UAE offered wealthier expats the chance to retire in Dubai rolled out a 10-year golden visa to professionals and their families and passed a new law to allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of companies outside economic free zones.

Although such dramatic announcements have become common in the federation of seven sheikhdoms the government has offered few details about how and when it will deliver on its promises.

UAE to expand Asia Africa trade seeks $150-bn investment

The United Arab Emirates is deepening its trade ties in Asia and Africa as part of a broader plan to draw $150 billion in foreign investment and reposition itself as a global hub for business and finance.

The UAE is seeking 550 billion dirhams ($150 billion) of inward foreign investment over the next nine years and aims to be among the 10 biggest global investment destinations by 2030 UAE Economy Minister Abdulla bin Touq said. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel

It will focus on investments from countries including Russia Australia China and the U.K.

One of the most notable inward investments in recent years was Uber Technologies Inc’s acquisition of UAE-based ride-hailing company Careem in 2019 for $3.1 billion. That deal sparked interest from regional and international venture capital firms and appetite for backing Middle Eastern startups has picked up over the past few years buoyed by the rapid adoption of mobile technologies in the region.",,,,,,,,,

(LEX 18) — The family and friends of 17-year-old Berkley Parks paid their respects on Saturday afternoon.

Parks was shot and killed on Aug. 22 on Pemberton Lane near Stolle Poole Court.

""He has always been very caring"" says his aunt Suzann Parks Sparks. ""Always very polite. So very funny. Loved his family.""

""He always answered with yes ma'am"" says his aunt Karla Gregory-Martin. ""He was always ready to help someone else.""

Family members say Parks always had a smile on his face but he knew how to make others smile too.

""I was his Aunt Su Su"" said Sparks. ""Every time he saw you 'Aunt Su Su I love you.' Every time I FaceTimed him he's smiling Aunt Su Su. He was excellent. He was a star.""

The 17-year-old loved his family. When asked what Parks' hobbies were his family said he loved his family.

""Even when his mother couldn't attend family reunions Berkley got a ride so he could attend the family reunion"" Gregory-Martin says.

Parks loved to cook and planned to attend culinary school after graduating high school according to his obituary. Now his life is cut short because of an issue hurting communities. Lexington police say another juvenile is responsible for killing Parks.

""No one wins here"" Gregory-Martin says. ""No one has won anything. No parent has a child coming out of this okay. And when two people have a child they will never see again.""

""This is gut-wrenching"" Sparks says. ""I don't have the words to say how awful this is. Just pure evil.""

Lexington police have listed nearly 30 homicide investigations this year. Parks' family urges everyone to be a part of the solution so nobody has to lose a loved one this way again.

""You see something know something you need to go talk to the authorities"" Sparks says. ""It's too many deaths. This is tragic. And it really needs to change.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvaWNlbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8wNC9wbGVudHktb2YtdW5pcXVlLWhhbmRtYWRlLWZpbmRzLWF0LWJlcmtsZXktYXJ0LWJhc2gv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9pY2VuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzA0L3BsZW50eS1vZi11bmlxdWUtaGFuZG1hZGUtZmluZHMtYXQtYmVya2xleS1hcnQtYmFzaC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plenty of unique handmade finds at Berkley Art Bash,"Nearly 100 artists artisans and makers will fill 12 Mile Road in Berkley from 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Sept. 11 for a popular art fair that feels more like a festive block party.

The fun environment brings art to everyone with affordable handmade finds from talented people in the community. Some fan favorites returning to this year’s event are Sassy Olive stretchy headband Andy Ozark and his robot sculptures made out of discarded mechanical pieces and Blue Turtle garden art. Many artists are local or from across Michigan and offer unique pieces that can’t be found anywhere else including colorful jewelry carefully crafted stained glass candles signs woodwork soaps and more.

Focus will remain squarely on the artists especially since some of the elements the art bash has included in the past won’t be making an appearance this year. Because of the COVID-19 health pandemic organizers chose to skip live music and bounce houses. In addition artist tents will be more spread out to encourage better flow of patrons.

Still there will be plenty to see and do at the Berkley Art Bash. McCrumb said patrons will be able to enjoy sweet and savory treats and children can create cute crafts to take home with them.

“Plan to make an afternoon of it and enjoy lunch or dinner at one of many great restaurants” she suggested.

There will be plenty of free parking on the side streets off of 12 Mile Road.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

LAPLACE — Amidst the sweltering heat limited water supply and lack of electricity following Hurricane Ida clean clothes and the ability to connect to the internet can seem like a luxury.

Companies like Verizon and Tide are aiming to provide a “load of hope” and alleviate some stress for residents at this time by setting up areas in the Walmart parking lot on West Airline Highway to provide laundry services and free Wi-Fi.

Laura Karnes of Matthew 25: Ministries which is partnering with Tide in the effort said volunteers are washing drying and folding one bag of laundry per household each day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Those who drop off a bag of laundry are notified via text or call when it’s ready. But since so many still have spotty cell reception Karnes said pick-up can be within a 24-hour period.

Only clothes and a few towels are eligible but bedding is not. Karnes said Tide and the ministry plan to be in the Walmart parking lot location indefinitely.

By noon Karnes had already reached capacity after receiving 200 loads of laundry. For those who asked she provided sample-sized laundry detergent.

LaPlace resident Mavis Drayton said it was “a beautiful idea.” Her home sustained significant damage to the roof master bedroom and hallway after the ceiling collapsed. And between going back-and-forth among friends and family for shelter it’s a lifesaver.

“I had nowhere to go to wash” Drayton said. “And no running water. I was going to have to ride all the way to Gonzales New Orleans or wherever has electricity.”

After dropping off her load it was ready within an hour and a half she said. Shortly after she was on her way back home to continue gathering her belongings.

LaPlace resident Heather James said with so much damage in the area the ability to do some laundry “is awesome.” While she lost the roof of her house she’s been trying to update as many locals as she can about the resources that are available.

“Everybody has been asking when they’ll be here” James said. “It helps especially being 100 degrees outside and no water.”

James is the mother of a 4-year-old and 6-year-old. She said it’s difficult for them to understand “why things are this way.”

“We’ve been helping everyone else but we need to help ourselves too” she added.

LaPlace resident Nichole Williams didn’t make it before capacity was reached at noon. But she vowed to be in the line early Sunday morning to have her laundry taken care of.

“It is a blessing” Williams said. “You never think something like this is available at a time like this. I’m so appreciative. Just to have clean clothes while we’re cleaning is perfect.”

A few hundred feet away is a Verizon trailer which is offering free Wi-Fi and charging stations for devices. Ryan Herd from New Jersey is part of Verizon’s Emergency Response Team and said another trailer is set up in Hammond with a third to be deployed soon.

“It’s the little things” Herd said. “Whatever it takes to help.”

But Herd finds himself in a situation similar to many of the people he’s assisting. He said Hurricane Ida hit his home as well resulting in a hole in the roof and water throughout the home. For that reason he’ll soon return home to begin his recovery efforts.

Barry Cummins who works at a local plant said being able to connect to Wi-Fi “makes a difference” for him.

Though the Verizon trailer operates 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Herd said the Wi-Fi is accessible 24 hours a day for anyone who needs it which may be helpful when it comes to getting in touch with insurance providers. The network name and password is posted for everyone to see.

DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZGNsZmFuLmNvbS9wbGFubmluZy9ob3ctYm9hcmRpbmctYS1kaXNuZXktY3J1aXNlLWlzLWN1cnJlbnRseS1oYXBwZW5pbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The New Pre-Boarding/Boarding Process at Disney Cruise Line,"With cruising requirements changing rapidly I thought I’d take a moment and walk you all through our experience since things were a bit tricky to accomplish within the required timeframes. Now that Disney Cruise Line has updated its protocol in accordance with the CDC guidelines some things might be a little more tricky and the more you know about the process ahead of time the better off you’ll be.

On my recent experience cruising on the Disney Dream I was able to bring my 19-year old daughter who at the time of our sailing had only received one of her two required COVID vaccinations. So for the purposes of this specific cruise she was considered unvaccinated and there was a good bit of juggling to do prior to the cruise because of that.

Just as a reminder a person is not considered fully vaccinated until two weeks after receiving their second dose of the COVID vaccine. As we know all passengers ages 11 and under are unvaccinated and must go through these pre-boarding steps in order to be permitted on a Disney ship regardless of its destination.

When Disney Cruise Line returned to sailing last month they made it voluntary for passengers to share proof of vaccination in order to avoid additional testing prior to their cruise. Each member of your cruising party is required to create an online account on the Safe Passage website where they’ll upload either proof of vaccination or COVID test results. Anyone who chooses not to provide proof of vaccination is required to provide a negative PCR test result where the test is taken between 5-days and 24-hours prior to you boarding the ship. With Thursday’s update that window will shrink from 5 days to 3 days beginning September 13th. Friends this process was a struggle for me with a 5-day window and now that the window is shrinking you are really going to need to put in the effort.

Although everyone ages 12 and up will be required to be fully vaccinated prior to their cruise all guests ages 11 and under will still be required to go through the pre-boarding testing so if you’ve got kiddos joining you you’ll want to pay close attention.







Our debarkation day was Friday August 20th so I had to make an appointment for my daughter to have a PCR COVID test performed between Sunday and Tuesday. We live in Florida and with the Delta variant running rampant down here just getting an appointment (within a 50-mile radius) was a feat between her work schedule and available appointment times. Both CVS and Walgreens in our area offered the PCR test. Something else to keep in mind is that the PCR test results take 1 to 2 days – I wanted to have the full two days with the second day being the day prior to our departure. I like to leave extra time for just about everything in my world for the “just in case” issues that may pop up. The bottom line is that I wasn’t able to get an appointment for her until late Tuesday afternoon which had me moderately twitchy. We were staying at a Walt Disney World Resort the night prior to our cruise so we were essentially heading out of town on the second day of that window. Fortunately for us her negative test result was emailed on Wednesday afternoon so we were able to upload it to the Safe Passage site before their deadline of 48-hours prior to debarkation day.

Disney Cruise Line at the time of our cruise also required guests to purchase a travel insurance policy for anyone who chose not to provide proof of vaccination. The travel agents at Dreams Unlimited Travel recommend that you use insuremytrip.com which is a clearing house for travel insurance companies and will provide you with a list of different policies according to the parameters you set when you do your search. Never having purchased travel insurance through anywhere but Disney (which we couldn’t do this time due to the cruise being hosted) finding a policy for our 3-night cruise was very easy and also fairly inexpensive at less than $40. It is imperative that you print the policy out and bring it with you as they do ask to see it at the port check-in.

Fast forward to debarkation day as we arrived with all of the required documents securely in an envelope tucked into my purse. Once we parked our vehicle we were directed over to the check-in tents that were set up adjacent to the parking garage.

One thing I was able to do since we’d uploaded everything that was required prior to our arrival was to add the QR code for our Port Arrival Form right into the Mobile Wallet on my iPhone – I suggest that you do that if you are able. I had the printed forms with me as required in my handy little envelope but much to my surprise I didn’t need to pull it out at all as each crew member was able to scan my phone to get the information they needed from that code.

We were directed to stay together as we moved through the different areas during our check-in process. Our daughter was required to take a rapid COVID test and once she was finished we were directed to another tent to wait for her test results to either appear on the screen or via email. The $65 charge for her test at the port was added to our cruise portfolio.







I received the email prior to the “clear” status appearing on the screen so that was a good thing as we were pretty excited to board the ship. We only waited for 25 minutes from the time she took the test to the time we were allowed to head across the street and into the terminal where we proceeded through security and documentation checks.

It’s important to note again that we were traveling as Disney Cruise Line’s hosted guests so we were there far earlier than any other guests who were arriving that day.

Now that rules are changing again soon and requiring that all passengers be fully vaccinated the process and requirements to cruise will also change. If you’ve got a Disney cruise coming up it is imperative that you check the Know Before You Go page for any updated information. Also if you receive any emails from Disney Cruise Line please be sure to open them read them and do what they are asking so that you don’t have to go into the consultation tent.

All in all the extra legwork and additional cost we incurred were both WELL worth the trouble because experiencing a Disney Cruise Line vacation with the health and safety guidelines that are currently in practice was absolutely incredible!

Construction of Walt Disney World’s first park Magic Kingdom began on May 30th 1967. At the center was the 189-foot tall Cinderella Castle originally painted in grey blue and gold.

Disney said that portions of the castle like the base of it were meant to resemble a medieval fortress representing the Romanesque architecture and castles of the 11th through 13th centuries. However other parts like the upper portion of the castle were meant to reflect Gothic styles that were more prominent in later centuries.

Prior to its completion guests who visited the Walt Disney World Preview Center reportedly could see what the castle would look like through Herb Ryman’s rendering of the structure. In addition a model of its original design was on display in the preview center’s lobby.

Disney said that the castle took about 18 months to build coming to completion in July 1971. The structure is composed of concrete steel cement plaster and fiberglass. Not a single brick was used in its construction.

In early photos of the Cinderella Castle 13 gargoyles can be spotted on its outside. There are also 18 towers with corresponding spires.

Over the last 50 years the royal castle has taken on many different looks.

For example in 1996 the Cinderella Castle was turned into a birthday cake for Walt Disney World’s 25th anniversary. Disney said that the cake weighed in at about 40 million pounds utilizing 55040 tablespoons of pink paint in three different shades. It also had 50 gumballs 30 lollipops 4 Life Savers 12 gumdrops 16 red candy hearts and 16 green candy stars on it.

In 2005 the castle was decorated for Disneyland Resort’s milestone anniversary with gold accents and a massive stained glass magic mirror that rotated with images of castles from Disney theme parks around the world.

For the holidays in the late 2000s Disney said that castle looked as if it was ""dipped in sugar"" featuring thousands of LED lights.

The Cinderella Castle has undergone an ‘EARidescent’ renovation for Walt Disney World’s upcoming 50th anniversary celebration dubbed ’The World’s Most Magical Celebration.’ After months of work the castle now has a new color and decor. For instance jewels and royal blue ribbons adorn the castle as gold draping and turrets surround its towers.

""The entire castle will shimmer with pearls and jewels and the turrets and towers will be wrapped in iridescent gold and royal blue ribbons"" George Adams of Walt Disney Imagineering previously said. ""Above the castle gate a 50th-anniversary crest will warmly welcome guests to join the festivities.""

During the anniversary festivities the castle will illuminate Magic Kingdom at night with lighting enhancements creating ""a dazzling radiance that sparkles with pixie dust"" Disney added.

We tend to forget that there are many generations of child stars forged in Disney’s image and for some that start truly shaped their career.

One major Disney star that began at a very young age was Hayley Mills. Mills worked hand in hand with Walt Disney on many films like The Parent Trap That Darn Cat! and Summer Magic. Mills was featured in so many Disney films that although Disney did not “own” the actress her career became synonymous with the company. Recently Mills has dug back into her past to unearth what it was like growing up as a child star and her side of the story when it comes to her time with Disney as her memoir “Forever Young” preps for its debut.

In an interview Mills divulges how she was at times not allowed to take certain roles. Walt who was a father figure to Mills refused to have her star in any films with “heavy dramas or sex involvements”. When she was offered the lead role in Stanley Kubrick’s Lolita Walt turned it down and refused to allow her parents to “run the show”.

“I got some very interesting offers when I was working for Disney that I wasn’t able to do. Well one of them was Lolita. That would’ve given me a chance to work with Stanley Kubrick James Mason and Shelley Winters and play that marvelous part. This was a nymphet and a nymphet really didn’t gel with the Disney image.” Related: Jonas Brothers “Regret” Being on Disney Channel

The refusal of films did not end with Lolita. Acclaimed director Otto Preminger wanted Mills for his Oscar-winning film Exodus but Walt said no.

“The funny thing about that is that he offered me the part and again it was turned down because it was considered to be too adult. When it was first turned down Otto Preminger then offered my parents a small Renoir. Even that didn’t swing it.”

By the time Mills turned 19 she was ready to say goodbye to Disney even though Walt wanted to keep her around. Mills however was ready to take her acting career into her own control and did not want to have to be selective on what she could do based on Disney’s standards.

“Leaving Disney was a big step. My eternal gratitude but he did want me to sign another contract with him but by that time I was wanting to make my own decisions. I wanted to accept parts that were not necessarily things that Disney would have approved of.”

Although Mills was in a way heavily controlled by Disney for a large portion of her childhood the now 75-year-old actress still seems to hold no resentment towards Walt or the company for having to turn down what would become iconic roles in the film.

Until four years ago garbage disposal meant one thing to Savitri Bai Patil - stinking putrefied heaps of trash spread around her neighbourhood in Pune  in western India.But now the streets of the Ashok Meadows housing complex where she lives are clear with workers picking up garbage from residents' doorsteps each day and turning some of it into electricity.Since 2017 the complex has fed its food waste into a digester that converts it into biogas used to light the area's streetlights park social club and gym.""Clean energy from our rancid food leftovers  vegetable peels and other such throwaways? It is unbelievable how the concept of waste management has changed in the past few years"" Bai Patil 62 told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Biogas generators like the one used in Ashok Meadows are now installed in more than 75 locations across India.Developed by Xeon Waste Managers (XWM) based in Pune the EnergyBin systems let communities turn waste into free renewable energy  said company president Jalaj Kumar Chaturvedi.""It is a common sight to find overburdened landfills with garbage that grows by the day. But since these EnergyBins dispose of the waste at the source itself the landfills are spared"" he said.According to Ashok Meadows resident Rishika Mahalley the complex's system - operated and maintained by residents - has helped solve the problem of how to dispose of the nearly a tonne of garbage produced each day by the complex's 550 homes and common areas.Before the community bought the generator at the cost of 2.3 million Indian rupees ($31000) it struggled with unreliable municipal garbage collection which often left waste piling up Mahalley noted.But ""we have now gotten rid of the buzzing flies scourge of mosquitoes and other insects besides of course the stink that came from the vats where the garbage would be left until the municipal vehicles arrived to collect them"" she said.Each day waste pickers paid by the Ashok Meadows residents put between 550 kg and 600 kg (1300 pounds) of food waste into the biogas plant Mahalley said.As the organic matter breaks down it produces a flammable gas made up mainly of methane and carbon dioxide.The methane is then pressurized and piped into a power generator that burns the gas to convert it into 50 kilowatt-hours of electricity for the community each day.Mahalley said before the plant was installed the complex spend about 550 rupees ($7.50) a day on electricity for streetlights and other common facilities - a cost that has now virtually disappeared.It also saves the residents up to Rs 6000 ($82) every month on municipal garbage disposal costs she said.The biggest benefit of biogas plants - which are becoming increasingly popular around the world as a way to create climate-smart energy - is their ability to reduce emissions said Jitendra S. Sangwai a chemical engineering professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai.In particular by capturing climate-changing gases that would normally be released into the atmosphere when organic matter decays in the open such technology can curb emissions of methane gas a potent short-term driver of climate change.While many small-scale biogas digesters are in operation around the globe for now the costs and climate benefits of large biogas generators like EnergyBins are limited to communities that can afford them Sangwai added.The systems can be expensive to buy set up and maintain he said.But XWM president Chaturvedi said the digesters provide multiple benefits.Besides cutting electricity and rubbish collection costs some municipalities can tap into property tax rebates offered to residents who process their own organic waste part of an effort to ease the heavy burden on landfills he said.""With that tax concession and the other savings the generators pay for themselves in three years"" he said.At the South Eastern Railways (SER) headquarters a complex of offices and staff residences in Kolkata a 1000-kg-capacity XWM biogas generator has been operating since January 2020.It services a complex that houses 1200 homes a market a social club and a hospital which has a kitchen that generates food waste throughout the day.Prior to the installation of the digester a once-daily municipal collection was not enough to get rid of all of the food leftovers produced said the hospital's senior dietician Dr. Sanchita Mazumder.""It was a nightmare to dispose of so much waste. We had to dig holes in the backyard to dump it"" she said adding that stray animals would then dig up the garbage and spread it around the complex.That has not been a problem since the biogas unit was installed she said noting that the gas generated from the kitchen's garbage has helped the hospital reduce its use of LPG gas for cooking by 80%.Having a better way to dispose of waste has also cut littering around the complex said Altaf Hussain head of the SER conservancy department.""The best part is how the community is learning to adopt clean garbage disposal methods"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3lwL2Rpc2NvdmVyL25ld3MvaG9uZy1rb25nL2FydGljbGUvMzE0NzUzMS9ob3QtdG9waWNzLWV2ZXJ5dGhpbmcteW91LW5lZWQta25vdy1hYm91dC1ob25nLWtvbmdz0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20veXAvZGlzY292ZXIvbmV3cy9ob25nLWtvbmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTQ3NTMxL2hvdC10b3BpY3MtZXZlcnl0aGluZy15b3UtbmVlZC1rbm93LWFib3V0LWhvbmcta29uZ3M?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hot Topics: everything you need to know about Hong Kong’s waste-charging scheme,"Explorer

Context: Hong Kong’s waste charging scheme explained

Hong Kong’s legislature passed a waste-charging scheme on August 26. The government will spend around 18 months preparing for the new waste-collection programme. It will also be educating residents about how the scheme will work.

Under amendments to the Waste Disposal Ordinance the average Hong Kong household is likely to end up paying HK$33 to HK$55 each month to throw out trash.

Once lawmakers deem the situation right for the scheme to start residents will have a short grace period. During this time those who break the rules will be given warnings. After this window those who are not using the government-made rubbish bags could receive a HK$1500 fine.

The scheme is expected to encourage residents to recycle and reuse any materials they can. This will hopefully reduce the amount of rubbish sent to the landfills.

Hong Kong residents will soon pay for their rubbish

When details of the scheme were first announced in 2017 each resident threw out 1.45kg of municipal solid waste each day. That figure reached its peak the following year at 1.53kg. In 2019 it declined slightly to 1.47kg. But environmental groups warned the number could rise again in 2020. This is because residents used more disposable plastic tableware during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The recycling rate meanwhile has been decreasing in recent years. Last year about 29 per cent of municipal waste was recycled down from the peak of 52 per cent in 2010.

South Korea started a similar scheme in 1995 and in the following decade saw a 24 per cent reduction in the amount of rubbish in the country. But now more people are using plastic and the most recent statistics show an increase again in the amount of waste per capita (per person).

News: Hong Kong residents to pay for trash as lawmakers approve waste-charging scheme but launch date uncertain

Lawmakers passed a long-delayed legislation last month to charge Hong Kong residents for their household rubbish but it remained unclear when the scheme would launch after officials extended the implementation period indefinitely.

Environment minister Wong Kam-sing agreed to requests from legislators to allow at least 18 months to set up the system that will require residents to buy government-made bags to dispose of their trash.

Wong said the department would give out the designated rubbish bags without charge when the programme took effect but did not say how long the handouts would last. Residents on social welfare schemes would also be guaranteed free bags for a certain period.

While environmental groups welcomed the bill’s passage they were generally opposed to the extended implementation phase saying the lack of a clear timeline for implementation – originally set for between a year and 18 months – would prevent waste reduction from moving “full steam ahead”.

Environmental group Greenpeace said the period designated for laying the scheme’s groundwork meant the passage of the bill was “as good as nothing” as no clear timeline or targets existed for how much waste the government intended to cut.

The supply of free bags was also criticised with Greenpeace arguing they should be distributed for no longer than three months.

Helga Vanthournout a solid waste expert and founder of sustainability firm Wealth of Flows Consulting said the government must not rest even after the legislation took effect.

Explainer: How would Hong Kong’s waste charging scheme work?

“It’s nice to say we’re going to motivate [residents] to create less waste but if there are no alternatives – if every single item in the supermarket is overly packaged – there’s no way out of this” she said.

Vanthournout said the government must now introduce legislation targeting areas such as supermarket packaging and single-use plastic tableware.

It would also have to reconsider the design of public rubbish bins to discourage residents of buildings without centralised waste management systems from continuing to dispose of their trash there she added.

Question prompts:

List TWO concerns environmental groups have about the Hong Kong government distributing free bags.

Do you agree with Helga Vanthournout that the government needs to roll out other initiatives – such as reducing packaging and single-use plastic tableware in tandem with the waste-charging scheme – to tackle the city’s waste problem? Why or why not?

Issue 1: Concerns raised over cost borne by residents under new waste-charging scheme

Lawmakers have called on the Environmental Protection Department to clarify how it intended to enforce the new waste disposal measure which could cost the average household about HK$51 a month to buy the required bags.

Peter Shiu Ka-fai from the Liberal Party urged the government to consider how to help poorer residents pay the new fee but said the overall benefits of the waste charging scheme far outweighed the costs.

“If you want to increase the burden of some residents – even though you may be correct from an environmental angle – for them the extra cost might be too heavy” Shiu said.

A separate survey by a local think tank in May found that 68 per cent of respondents polled agreed on implementing the waste-charging scheme. The survey found support for the scheme was more than 60 per cent among the various demographic groups such as housewives executives service workers and production workers.

Two-thirds of more than 1000 residents polled by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute for Civic Exchange also said paying 11 cents per litre of rubbish was an acceptable price. Out of the portion of people who were opposed to the policy 34 per cent cited cost as the main concern.

“These results offer optimism for Hong Kong and reflect that residents support the Polluter Pays principle and understand they can lessen the burden on the recycling system if they work with industries to reduce waste at the source” said Lawrence Iu programme manager at Civic Exchange.

“However the results also show our recycling and waste disposal infrastructures require a significant update and trust [needs] to be rebuilt in the system.”

But Edwin Lau Che-feng founder and executive director of environmental group The Green Earth said the cost was not prohibitive at all. “It is just HK$33 per family each month. That’s less than what you would be paying for lunch” he said.

Lau added the waste-charging scheme was a must if Hong Kong wanted to reduce its waste but warned there were still more policies to be enacted to achieve the best outcome.

“You need other sorting facilities and public education to rebuild trust in the system” he added.

Glossary

Amendments to the Waste Disposal Ordinance: Once implemented those living in residential buildings and village houses and operators of street-level shops that use government refuse collection services will be required to buy any of 11 types of approved rubbish bags produced and sold by the government. Commercial and industrial buildings using private collection services will pay a landfill “gate fee” based on the weight of rubbish they produce set at HK$365 and HK$395 per tonne.

Government-made bags: The approved rubbish bags are available in 11 different sizes and sold in packs of 10. The smallest 3-litre bag will cost 30 cents while the largest 660-litre version will cost HK$73. Oversized items that cannot fit into any of the 11 bags must be separately tagged with a label that costs HK$11 for disposal."

Most of us stopped going to the bank during the pandemic and once you realize how easy it is to get things done from your phone or computer why go back?

But some of the biggest cyber threats we face today are banking Trojans — malicious programs that hunt for bank information while disguising themselves as harmless documents. They can scan what you type steal your money and compromise all of your most sensitive passwords. These often come loaded in malicious apps. Tap or click for more info on apps recently caught stealing bank credentials.

Your bank account is one of the most important things in your life to protect from hackers. Without strong cybersecurity you could end up losing money and critical personal data. If you haven’t given your online bank accounts a security checkup now’s the time. Here are the steps you need to take.

1. Create strong passwords

Creating strong passwords is the most fundamental step in securing your accounts. Weak options like 12345678 or Password can be easily guessed or cracked with software that hackers can download for free. And if you share a weak password across multiple accounts or profiles you’ll have a domino effect on your hands if one of them gets compromised.

To protect your accounts here are some good rules for making better passwords:

Always use a random (or non-sequential) set of upper and lowercase letters numbers and symbols. Always make your passwords eight characters or longer. Use unique passwords for every single account every single time.

If you’re having trouble figuring out strong passwords here’s an example we use here at Komando.com: T/V\ho2nnL. It comes from a random sentence — a Metallica lyric. “Take my hand off to never-never land.”

Use the first character from each word to get “tmhotnnl.” Then replace some words and letters with symbols and numbers. “M” becomes /V\ and “to” becomes 2. Finally capitalize a few of the letters to make a tough password that’s easy to remember: “T/V\ho2nnL”.

Tap or click here for even more ideas to help you generate stronger passwords.

2. Set up two-factor authentication

Activating two-factor authentication (2FA) for your bank accounts is a great way to keep hackers out. When it’s set up you can’t log in without a code that your bank sends to your phone via text message. Hackers won’t have access to your phone which means it’s unlikely they’ll be able to get in. Plus you’ll know any time someone tries to log in without your permission.

Here’s how you can set up 2FA for some of the nation’s biggest banks.

Chase: Chase automatically sets customers up with 2FA from the get-go. The first time you sign in to your account from a new device you’ll be asked to verify your identity with a text code. Your phone number and email address will need to be current on your account so if either is out of date call the support number on the back of your card.

Wells Fargo: Open the tab labeled Your Security Center from the Wells Fargo app or website or tap or click here to activate 2FA for your account. You’ll be asked to enter a phone number where you can receive your security code. Once you type in the code 2FA will be active the next time you log in.

Bank of America: Choose Profile & Settings in the upper left-hand corner of BoA’s website and click Manage SafePass. From here you can add any phone numbers you want your security code sent to. When you’re finished you’ll be asked to verify your debit or credit card details to complete the setup.

Citibank: Citibank customers already have 2FA active by default. The first time you sign in to your account from a new device you’ll be asked to verify your identity with a text code. Your phone number and email address will need to be current on your account so call the number on the back of your card if either is out of date.

If you don’t see your bank listed here you can usually find the option under the account settings or security settings for your bank’s website or app where you have the option to change your password.

In addition to 2FA some banks offer encrypted security tokens. These small handheld devices generate one-time passcodes you can use to log into your account. Because they’re physical devices owned by your bank and kept safe by you there isn’t a way for a hacker to gain access without physically handling one. Ask your banker for more information.

3. Stick to secure devices

Some devices are much better for checking your accounts than others. If your PC gets a virus for example you might have a hacker watching you type in your password without even realizing it.

One smart step you can take is securing every device you bank on with a strong antivirus and antimalware solution. Kim’s pick is TotalAV. Tap or click for more info and a link to get 85% off your first year.

To protect your accounts you can pick and choose a device that you only use for finances. For this we recommend a lightweight Chromebook computer. These affordable laptops run ChromeOS which means they aren’t vulnerable to the same kinds of malware as a full-fledged Windows PC.

This ASUS Chromebook retails for less than $200 and is secure enough to check your most sensitive bank accounts. It can also browse the web play videos on YouTube and stream music from your favorite services like Spotify.

If you’d rather not spend money on a new Chromebook you can protect your account using biometric security settings like your fingerprint or face. If your phone has a face scanner (like Apple’s FaceID) or a fingerprint reader you can use these to verify your logins. Check the Settings area of your bank’s app to see if biometric authentication is offered.

4. A little dishonesty won’t hurt

Most banks will have you set up security questions when you create your account. These questions are used to verify your identity in the event you get logged out or make a major change to your settings.

But what if a hacker or stalker knows more about your life than you expect? If you post details about your life on social media it can be easy to crack security questions without ever breaking into your account. Tap or click here to see if you’re oversharing on social media.

That’s why it’s important to remember that you don’t have to answer every security question accurately. In fact it’s better for your security to give fake answers and write them down rather than connect the answers to your real life.

The next time you have to set up an account and answer security questions pick answers that are easy enough to remember but aren’t necessarily true. Then take a piece of paper or a cheap journal and write down your answers. You’ll be glad you did.

5. Freeze your credit – It’s FREE!

All of us will eventually fall victim to a data breach at some point. But just because your data is compromised doesn’t mean you’re in danger just yet. If you take proactive steps like freezing your credit you can prevent the problem from getting much worse.

Here’s why: If your credit is frozen hackers won’t be able to open any new accounts in your name. It’s one of the most effective ways to curb identity theft and all it takes to set up a credit freeze is a quick phone call to one of the three national credit bureaus.

Best of all it’s free to request a freeze as of 2018. It’s security that you don’t even have to pay for!

6. Set up alerts and stay in the know

Every week Kim gets a message from her bank that shows her account balances. If anything seems unusual she can immediately contact her bank to find out what happened.

If you’re not checking your account regularly you could end up missing something major like a hack or password breach. Activating notifications through your bank’s website or official app is an easy way to stay in the know.

You can also set up alerts if you hit a low balance or if your bank detects fraudulent activity on your account. You can receive these in the form of text messages app notifications or emails — or even a combination of the three.

Here’s how to set up alerts for some of the biggest national banks. If your bank isn’t on this list download its official app and look for Alerts on the main menu. You can also search your bank’s website for instructions or chat with a bank representative to get help. You can easily reach one by calling the number on the back of your card.

Chase

Sign in to Chase from your browser. Choose Profile & settings > Alerts > Choose alerts in the left-hand menu under the Alerts section. Follow the instructions to set up alerts and choose your preferred delivery.

If there something that a beginner should know about golf it is that the sport’s highly unpredictable. A lot of skill is required to excel on the professional tour but sometimes luck plays a major part in determining success. Ask Wells Fargo Championship 54-hole leader Keith Mitchell and he’d tell you the same.

Keith Mitchell joined the PGA Tour in 2018 and it has not been smooth sailing ever since. He won the 2019 Honda Classic to secure his maiden title but the professional tour has not been treating him kindly.

Before entering the Wells Fargo Championship Mitchell had recorded just one Top 10 finish this season. He’s faced seven cuts in 17 starts so far but that did not stop him from pushing for success.

“I mean I didn’t play very well last year after the restart just didn’t have any didn’t have the energy didn’t have the really just the patients with that short of a season last year trying to climb the leaderboard and then felt like my game this year has really started to blossom. And it’s just really kind of all starting to shape up right now” Mitchell told the media at Wells Fargo Championship.

Playing with the flow is essential on the PGA Tour tells Keith Mitchell

Not everyone gets to sustain an incredible run of form on the PGA Tour. Good luck knocks on the door of everyone but it only lasts for a while. Contrastingly when Keith Mitchell knew he was troubled by bad luck he just kept going until he could see brighter light.

“Everything you need to know about it is it can be very lucky and very unlucky all at the same time. So you just gotta take it with ebbs and flows. You know there are ups and downs and last week I got unlucky this week right now I’ve had some good breaks so hopefully they’ll keep going on Sunday” Mitchell mentioned.



Mitchell closed out his performance at the 2021 Valspar Championship with a disastrous round. However he did not dwell on it too much and improved his game at the Wells Fargo Championship.

Keith Mitchell is currently at 9-under for the tournament at Quail Hollow. While he is not the outright favorite to win the 2021 Wells Fargo Championship the 29-year-old is loving his chances.

The Lancaster-based bank holds 27.80% of all bank deposits in the county according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. report issued Friday making Fulton the leading bank here for the seventh consecutive year.

Fulton’s market share is slightly smaller than the 28.52% it captured in 2020. As a result its lead over runner-up Truist Bank (formerly BB&T) receded a little – by less than 1 percentage point. But it’s still a commanding edge of 11.93 percentage points.

Fulton has almost always been the local leader since at least 1994 which is as far back as the FDIC has publicly available data. The exception came in 2012-2014 when the top spot went to Lititz-based Susquehanna Bank.

In 2015 though Fulton regained the summit surpassing Susquehanna. It then topped Susquehanna successor BB&T from 2016 through 2019 and now has done the same to BB&T successor Truist in 2020 and this year.

The rest of the 10 biggest banks here fall into the nearly the same order as they did in 2020 with changes only to the ninth- and 10th-place banks. Here are the top 10 with their share of all bank deposits in the county:

First Fulton 27.80%; second Truist 15.87%; third PNC 11.84%; fourth Ephrata National 8.02%; fifth Wells Fargo 7.05%; sixth Northwest 4.13%; seventh M&T 3.70%; eighth Bank of Bird-in-Hand 3.47%; ninth First National 2.86% replacing S&T which dropped to 11th; and 10th Univest 2.77% replacing First National.

As has been the case for years the top three banks in the aggregate account for the majority of deposits here; this year together they hold 55.51%. In other words the top three combined hold more deposits than the remaining 20 institutions combined.

The report which tallies the total deposits held in Lancaster County as of June 30 by each bank that has a physical office here shows that the 23 banks operating here have a total of $15.99 billion in deposits across a combined 165 offices here.

That number of offices represents a 19.5% drop from the peak of 205 offices in 2008 and 2009 LNP | LancasterOnline files show although there are several more institutions operating here.

The decline is largely due to the biggest institutions trimming their branch networks as consumers switch to banking online as LNP | LancasterOnline has often reported. For instance Fulton had 31 offices here in 2010; it has 21 per the FDIC. Susquehanna had 40 in 2010; its successor Truist has 26.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vYWxhc2thbGFuZG1pbmUuY29tL2xhbmRtaW5lcy90aGUtYWxhc2thLXN0YWxrZXItc2VwdGVtYmVyLTQtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Alaska Stalker - September 4 2021,"Neighbors-Do you want to win $49000?

Thursday was to be a celebration of Horizon Forbidden West and the amazing team at Guerrilla working to deliver it on February 18 2022. However it’s abundantly clear that the offerings we confirmed in our pre-order kickoff missed the mark. Last year we made a commitment to deliver free upgrades for our cross-gen launch titles which included Horizon Forbidden West. While the pandemic’s profound impact pushed Forbidden West out of the launch window we initially envisioned we will stand by our offer: Players who purchase Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 4 will be able to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version for free. I also want to confirm today that moving forward PlayStation first-party exclusive cross-gen titles (newly releasing on PS4 & PS5)–both digital and physical*–will offer a $10 USD digital upgrade option from PS4 to PS5. This will apply to the next God of War and Gran Turismo 7 and any other exclusive cross-gen PS4 & PS5 title published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. — Jim Ryan President & CEO Sony Interactive Entertainment



*To upgrade an eligible PS4 game on disc to the digital PS5 version you will need a PS5 console with a disc drive. PS4 game discs can’t be used with the PlayStation®5 Digital Edition.

Horizon Forbidden West is coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles on February 18 2022! We were ecstatic to finally be able to share the release date with you last week during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live and to see everyone’s reactions to our news.

Pre-orders for the game are available now across the globe so we wanted to share more details about the various editions that you can get your hands on.

Kevin Jiang president of China’s e-commerce giant JD.com talks to STYLE about the country’s digitisation of shopping for luxury products and on forging a relationship with LVMH.

While the pandemic has hit the global luxury market hard China is actually seeing rapid growth. In the meantime we also see trends that luxury consumers are becoming younger buying more full-price products and sales are gradually reaching the lower-tier markets. During JD’s “618 Grand Promotion” Gen Z customers buying luxury products increased 231 per cent year-on-year.

The pandemic has revealed just how important e-commerce is to the future of luxury goods. When many stores were forced to close brands have to transform and focus on digital sales – and often relied on more established platforms like JD.com to reach digital customers especially in lower-tier cities and in the absence of international travel and shopping.

This year luxury giant LVMH has inked a series of partnerships with JD for iconic brands including Givenchy Berluti Guerlain Sephora and Zenith with more on the horizon.

What drove LVMH and JD.com to form a partnership?

Luxury brands have very high requirements and pay extremely close attention to the brand image while pursuing the ultimate customer experience. Top luxury brands like LVMH the world’s largest luxury goods conglomerate  focus even more on these aspects. They value their own sales channels such as the brand’s official websites and are cautious about working with third-party platforms. Top brands rarely cooperate with e-commerce companies. With the continuous development of e-commerce luxury brands also see great potential especially in the Chinese market.

JD is keen to better understand brands’ needs and also offer more flexible digital solutions to our brand partners especially the top luxury ones. JD introduced a unique model when Louis Vuitton launched on JD in April 2021. Through the model consumers can type “LV” in the search bar on the JD app and enter LV’s official mini program to enjoy the brand’s exclusive shopping experience.

Will selling luxury watches and high jewellery online be the next big thing?

As millennials and Gen Z consumers are growing to be the major consumer group for luxury products and with the pandemic accelerating the development of e-commerce we’ve seen an increasing online penetration of luxury brands.

In terms of categories in addition to fashionable leather goods and beauty and make-up there will be great potential for the market of watches and jewellery. There will be more lifestyle and cultural trends in the future and brands will be more focused on content marketing and creating interactive experiences with consumers.

High-end watches and luxury jewellery are also benefiting from the general trend in self-gifting. The Chinese consumer used to buy jewellery for the weight of gold; now they’re buying it because it’s a wonderful way to show their personality. As more and more consumers move online to buy luxury products watches and jewellery are indispensable choices as gifts.

In China’s highly digitised society how important are physical stores for luxury retail?

Luxury brands entered China by opening flagship stores in high-end offline department stores and malls in first-tier cities addressing the store image and shopping experience. Digital transformation combined with the new shopping habits of the younger generation and the impact of Covid-19 has seen growing online penetration.

Technology and logistics infrastructure enable online platform JD.com to provide similar luxury shopping experiences as offline through AR/VR and JD Luxury Express for example.

In addition enormous demand from lower-tier markets cannot be met with limited [numbers of] luxury shops in big cities so the trend of online and offline synergy is ready to go ahead.

Sony was heavily criticised after it confirmed Horizon Forbidden West's standard and special editions did not include Dual Entitlement Sony's label for granting you both the PS4 and PS5 versions of the same game after Sony had previously said it would offer free upgrades for its cross-gen launch titles.

In an update issued to the PlayStation Blog Sony Interactive Entertainment boss Jim Ryan said its offers for Guerrilla's Horizon Forbidden West ""missed the mark"".

Ryan addressed the fact Sony had previously said it would offer free upgrades for its cross-gen launch titles pointing to Horizon Forbidden West's delay to February 2022 which pushed the game ""out of the launch window we initially envisioned"".

Sony will now stand by its original offer and let those who buy Horizon Forbidden West on PS4 upgrade to the PS5 version for free.

Not only that Ryan promised all PlayStation first-party exclusive cross-gen titles (newly releasing on PS4 & PS5) - both digital and physical - will offer a $10 digital upgrade option from PS4 to PS5.

This applies to the next God of War Gran Turismo 7 and any other exclusive cross-gen PS4 & PS5 title published by Sony Interactive Entertainment Sony said.

Of note: Sony said to upgrade an eligible PS4 game on disc to the digital PS5 version you need a PS5 console with a disc drive. ""PS4 game discs can't be used with the PS5 Digital Edition"" Sony pointed out.

Here's Ryan's statement in full:

""Thursday was to be a celebration of Horizon Forbidden West and the amazing team at Guerrilla working to deliver it on February 18 2022. However it's abundantly clear that the offerings we confirmed in our pre-order kickoff missed the mark.

""Last year we made a commitment to deliver free upgrades for our cross-gen launch titles which included Horizon Forbidden West. While the pandemic's profound impact pushed Forbidden West out of the launch window we initially envisioned we will stand by our offer: Players who purchase Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 4 will be able to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version for free.

""I also want to confirm today that moving forward PlayStation first-party exclusive cross-gen titles (newly releasing on PS4 & PS5) - both digital and physical - will offer a $10 USD digital upgrade option from PS4 to PS5. This will apply to the next God of War and Gran Turismo 7 and any other exclusive cross-gen PS4 & PS5 title published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.""

It's a decision sure to go down well among the gaming community after what has been a week of anger directed at PlayStation bosses. And it follows the similarly dramatic U-turn on its decision to shut down the PlayStation 3 and Vita digital stores following fan criticism.

And it's also worth pointing out Sony $10 digital upgrade option still falls short of Microsoft's Smart Delivery feature which grants you the upgraded version of an Xbox game for free."

Over the last five years dispatch logs show that Las Vegas officers have responded to more reports of fights and disturbances than any other police call for service each Labor Day.

In the Metropolitan Police Department dispatch logs such calls are coded as “416s.” Metro officer Larry Hadfield said a 416 call can include a fight or any general disturbance like loud music or people racing rumbling motorcycles up and down a street.

The calls are often reported in passing Hadfield said which means witnesses often leave the scene. Because of that they don’t often result in reports or arrests.

“A passerby may be likely to report some guys fighting and keep on driving” Hadfield said.

He compared the call to an assault which typically involves a person who has been hurt and calls with plans to file a police report.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal examined Metro dispatch logs for each Labor Day from 2016 to 2020. Last year fight or disturbance calls accounted for 500 of the more than 1700 calls police received on Labor Day.

Among those calls was for a brawl at Encore first reported as a 416 according to dispatch logs.

In a news conference after Labor Day last year Las Vegas police said officers arrested dozens of people on assault and battery charges. Wynn Las Vegas increased its room rates and filed a trespassing lawsuit against 20 people after the casino floor fight.

The second- and third-highest reported Labor Day calls each year were domestic disturbances — which include fights among people who live in the same home — followed by reports of suspicious people or cars.

Metro received an average of 222 domestic disturbance calls each Labor Day over the five-year period.

While in most cases your retail electric provider is your first point of contact for your electricity concerns it is your Transmission and Distribution Utility (TDU) that is responsible for responding to power outages and electricity-related emergencies. Nearly all TDUs have a 24/7 power outage phone number available and most have their own power outage map which includes the number of customers affected repair updates and estimated time the outage will last. Continue reading to find your TDU's contact information and what to do if you don't know which one to call.

Does it matter which power grid I am on?

The short answer: Nope.

If your lights suddenly go off and the electrical hum goes silent it is extremely unlikely that the power outage is stemming from the electricity grid itself. In nearly all cases an outage will come from a blown transformer power poles knocked over or power lines snapped by tree limbs. However in the smallest possibility that a power grid faces issues knowing which grid you are on may come in handy.

Texas power grids

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) service area which cover most of Texas is dominated by five deregulated (energy retail) transmission and distribution utility companies (TDUs). The remaining Texas areas that are not on the ERCOT grid are covered by three other national grids (below) which are regulated and not open to retail competition.

The non-ERCOT grids in Texas include (in order of largest to smallest coverage) the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC).

SPP area covers the majority of the Texas panhandle (Lubbock Amarillo Canyon Dumas Pampa Hereford and Panhandle) and the northeast/upper east corner of Texas (cities of Texarkana Henderson Marshall Jefferson Pittsburg Boston Carthage and Center) The MISO service area covers a segment of east-central Texas just bordering north of Harris County and powers Beaumont Tyler Huntsville Jasper Conroe Bryan Madisonville Livingston Woodville and surrounding communities. The grid with the smallest coverage in Texas the WECC has the western tip of Texas. WECC services all of El Paso County and Hudspeth County and portions of Culberson Jeff Davis and Presidio Counties. The major cities in this area include El Paso and Sierra Blanca.

How do I locate the utility company for my area?

Regardless of location and service area you should always communicate a power outage with your utility company not your electric provider. There are a few places to turn to when you need to find out which TDU services your area and exact location.

The monthly electric bill sent by your electric provider (in deregulated zones)

A surefire way to know which utility company works directly with your retail electric provider is to check out your monthly billing statement. Considering every electricity provider charges their customers the utility company's fees and energy rate charges the energy distributor charging those tariffs is most likely listed (by your electric provider) on that same bill.

If you have read this far ... ... that means either you haven't received a bill yet misplaced it or tossed it.

Whatever the case there are a couple other ways (below) to figure out which utility company services your address!

Find your utility company by location

Even though this is more of an estimation using a general location tends to be the fastest way to understand which utility company services an exact address. Below are the Texas power grids their coverage areas with larger cities and the utility company outage information for each.

Find your utility company using your electricity meter's ESID number

If you have a meter already installed and have access to it try to find the ESI ID (sometimes called the ESID) number. This is a unique X-digit number assigned to each meter by the utility company for the area..

ESID / ESI ID format The ESI ID is only numeric (no letters are included) and is found on the front face of the meter. The ESI ID may range anywhere from 17 to 22 digits in length and includes an identification code for each utility company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMDQvdGhyZWVzaXh0eS1qb3VybmFsaXNtLXRocmVlc2l4dHktYWx1bS1jZW50ZXJzLWhlci13b3JrLW9uLWNvbW11bml0eS1hbmQtaXRzLXBvd2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ThreeSixty Journalism: ThreeSixty alum centers her work on community and its power,"To place an obituary please include the information from the obituary checklist below in an email to obits@pioneerpress.com.

How are Different Players Utilizing SaMD in Healthcare?

Since its inception SaMD has been used in multiple ways through different technologies and is assisting medical professionals to deliver patient-centric treatments. Apart from medical device companies the quick adoption of SaMD can be seen in pharmaceutical companies start-ups and big tech giants. Discussed below are some of the SaMD applications in various industries and organizations:

1. Medical Device Companies:

It's difficult to discuss the medical device industry without acknowledging software's enormous contribution to medical innovation. Some of the key applications where medical device companies are using ‘SaMD’ are

Decision support system – Clinical Decision Support (CDS) is an area where AI can help clinicians collect analyze and infer from a large number of patients' data to make the best clinical decision. For e.g. Fujifilm partnered with Hera-MI a French start-up to create AI solutions to provide comprehensive analysis and decision support to clinicians and hospital staff. AI will detect difficult anomalies and aid radiologists by reducing their time spent on cases considered not problematic.

AI will detect difficult anomalies and aid radiologists by reducing their time spent on cases considered not problematic. Patient treatment lifecycle management – Patients can use SaMD to track their health activities and vital parameters in real-time communicate with health professions and request medical assistance if necessary. SaMD technologies aid physicians in generating personalized treatment plans for patients with chronic conditions based on data generated by the software. An example of this is Zimmer Biomet a leader in musculoskeletal surgery introduced the ZBEdgeTM Connected Intelligence Suite of Integrated Robotics and Digital Health Technologies. The Orthointel Orthopedic Intelligence Platform collects pre intra and post-operative data and gives insights to clinicians which in turn optimize patient care.

2. Pharmaceutical Companies:

SaMD is completely reimagining the way the pharmaceutical industry is operating. It is helping Pharma companies in engaging patients across their medication lifecycle. Here are a few trends in pharma where the applications of SaMD are being employed:

Preventive Care – The companies have demonstrated that digitally tracking a patient's condition using the technology can improve medication adherence and disease control while lowering hospital and emergency room visits. An example of this is Propeller Health a digital health company that has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. FDA for its connected platform developed in partnership with AstraZeneca to help improve the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Propeller sensors attach to patients' existing inhalers and send data on medication use to the Propeller app on their smartphones. The patients can then share the information with their clinician to formulate a personalized treatment plan.

The patients can then share the information with their clinician to formulate a personalized treatment plan. Precision Medicine – It is a valuable and effective tool for disease diagnosis and patient pre-care. The software will examine the patient's personal and genetic information and circumstances to diagnose and treat the disease. Pharma companies utilize this information for tailoring the treatment to patients' needs. For e.g. Javelin Biotech in collaboration with Pfizer aims to develop an industry-leading Organ-on-a-Chip” predictive pharmacokinetics platform It has the potential to be a market-leading platform for evaluating small molecule ADME (absorption distribution metabolism and excretion) properties. The ADME platform will combine a micro physiological system (MPS) also known as an ""organ-on-a-chip"" with interactive computational software to assist in informing human pharmacokinetic (PK) predictions.

Pharma digital ecosystems for treatment adherence – Using SaMD pharma companies are trying to completely engage patients by supporting them in all the possible aspects of care delivery. Software mitigates the challenges faced in medication adherence and provides a solution for personalized drug therapy management digital patient involvement and tele-pharmacy. Cardinal Health launched OutcomesTM a digital pharma ecosystem that connects pharmacists payers and pharmaceutical firms to tackle the medication non-adherence challenge. Outcomes' expanded connect platform which builds on its existing software offers an open architectural marketplace approach to delivering solutions to pharmacies quickly effectively and efficiently. Its digital ecosystem already serves a network of 23 million patients and 60000+ pharmacy locations across the country streamlining pharmacy procedures and improving patient interaction.

3. Tech Giants:

According to the McKinsey report the worldwide market for digital health was estimated to be worth $350 billion in 2019. Further markets for technologies used for SaMD such as precision medicine digital diagnostics telehealth etc. are predicted to rise at least 8% each year. No wonder that tech conglomerates are investing billions in research and acquisitions in the field of SaMD. Examples below discuss how eagerly tech giants are stepping into healthcare to bring advanced medical solutions with SaMD:

Apple has gained success by vertically integrating its experience and product. It appears that it is taking a similar approach to healthcare by connecting various components of the user experience such as the device health record platform and potentially telemedicine services. Apple has bolstered its overall software portfolio with several recent artificial intelligence acquisitions including Silk Labs. Apple’s ResearchKit and CareKit Software Developer Kits (SDKs) provide templates for easily creating an application an essential step in Apple's transition to a healthcare platform.

Google being specialized in technological development is also continuously making its way to attract healthcare stakeholders. A dermatology tool powered by artificial intelligence was demonstrated by Google Health researchers. Using a simple phone camera the program assists users in identifying dermatologic problems. Another significant innovation is AI algorithms that can detect ever-smaller lung tumors. Etemadi's technology which is a collaboration between Google Northwestern University and other institutions is one of several that are moving towards clinical adoption.

4. Start-Ups:

According to one report trends in healthcare start-ups are majorly towards clinical intelligence and enablement screening and diagnostics virtual care delivery and disease management and therapeutics. SaMD plays a significant role in all of these domains.

SaMD Life-Cycle

SaMD is frequently used as part of a clinical workflow sequence to improve diagnosis treatment and patient management. Regulations and protocols have had to keep up with the kind of development procedures medical devices require due to the emergence of Software as a Medical Device.

The necessary recommendations for designing a SaMD can be found in AAMI TIR45 a Technical Information Report (TIR) from the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). It explains the agile manifesto many techniques (such as Definition of Done) their implementation and tailoring to reference models such as IEC 62304 and ‘FDA CFR Title 21 Part 820.30'.

However problems with the design and/or implementation of SaMD into a workflow might cause users to make wrong choices/decisions and delays in making decisions can have negative repercussions for patients. All organizations need to look at the two aspects of the software lifecycle:

1. Quality management – To ensure quality organizations must follow ISO 13485:2016 which outlines the parameters for a quality management system that demonstrates an organization's ability to consistently offer medical devices and related services that comply with many region-specific and global regulatory standards.

– To ensure quality organizations must follow ISO 13485:2016 which outlines the parameters for a quality management system that demonstrates an organization's ability to consistently offer medical devices and related services that comply with many region-specific and global regulatory standards. 2. Risk management – Medical device manufacturers must identify potential risks associated with the devices. Estimate evaluate and control those risks and assess the effectiveness of the controls. For risk management they need to follow ISO 14971:2019 which applies to all SaMD life cycle phases.

Risk assessment and quality management of a SaMD are not only performed during the development phase but also need to be observed in the post-production and post-deployment stages. According to the real-world feedback on software performance there can be a modification and up-gradation which may create more risks; hence post-production liability must be treated with the utmost attention.

Parting Thoughts

The future of SaMD is promising not only for patients and practitioners but also for society. Moving ahead some of the most valuable technologies in the healthcare industry will not be new gadgets or large equipment but rather companion software that gathers crucial patient data to generate actionable insights to be used to create personalized healthcare plans.

In the healthcare software sector a long-term vision towards evolving patient care agility and flexibility is required to respond to frequent changes in consumer expectations and business requirements. Healthcare organizations need to take a very holistic and structured approach towards the SaMD lifecycle management process that leads to creating solutions that deliver maximum value in terms of patient outcomes within the digital healthcare ecosystem.
