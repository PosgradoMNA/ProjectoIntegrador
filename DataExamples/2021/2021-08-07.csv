Between 2011 and 2020 811105 homes were sold in the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan statistical area according to a report released Thursday by Texas Realtors.

The report “A Decade in Texas Real Estate” provides real estate sales data for Texas and 25 metropolitan statistical areas in Texas from 2011 to 2020. Real estate sales that occurred outside of an MLS are not reflected in the report.

During the 10 year period between 2011 and 2020 the Greater Houston area’s median home price increased $105500 from $154500 in 2011 to $260000 in 2020 -- a 68% increase.

All in all 3118089 homes were sold in Texas during the decade according to the report. Meanwhile median home price in the state increased $112200 from $146988 at the end of 2011 to $259188 at the end of 2020 -- a 76% jump.

Three-quarters of the Texas homes sold in the past decade were located in the state’s four largest metro areas -- Austin-Round Rock Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington Houston-The Woodlands-Sugarland San Antonio-New Braunfels. Recording 923528 home sales the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metro area sold the most homes during the ten-year period.

The report also details how the time homes spent on the market decreased both in the Houston area and statewide.

In 2011 Texas homes spent an average 93 days on the market. That metric dipped 44% to 55 days in 2020. Comparatively Houston homes spent an average of 89 days on the market in 2011 and an average of 54 days on the market in 2020.

Meanwhile the average price per square foot climbed more than 40% to a median $141 statewide while in Houston the average price per square foot increased from $83 in 2011 to $133 in 2020.

“We’ve had a dynamic real estate market in Texas over the past decade” Marvin Jolly chairman of Texas Realtors said in a statement. “Some of the factors that have affected real estate transactions and property ownership include significant population growth natural disasters big and small new home technologies and of course the pandemic. Through it all Realtors have helped buyers sellers and property owners achieve their goals.”

At the age of 11 she joined the province’s diving team and progressed to the national team after just two years of training.

A coastal province bordering Hong Kong Guangdong has become a cradle of world-class divers. While the Chinese national diving team is known as the “Dream Team” the Guangdong contingent could easily be nicknamed “the dream team within the dream team”.

The 14-year-old diver Quan Hongchan may be China’s breakout star of the Tokyo Games but she is just one of many elite athletes emerging from the southeastern province of Guangdong.

Since 1984 the Chinese diving team have bagged 46 gold medals at the Olympics 11 of which have been earned by Guangdong athletes.

Quan now joins Sun Shuwei (1990) Yang Jinghui (2004) Lao Lishi (2004) Hu Jia (2004) He Chong (2008) He Zi (2012) Luo Yutong (2012) Zhang Yanquan (2012) Chen Aisen (2016) and Xie Siyi (2021).

Just days before Quan Xie won gold in the men’s 3m springboard with a record-breaking score of 558.75 and another one in the synchronised 3m springboard with partner Wang Zongyuan.

The city of Shantou is home to Xie as well as pioneers Li Hongping Li Qiaoxian and Li Deliang. The three are honoured with a grand statue named “Rise Up” located in the city’s central business district.

Chen continued his stellar performance from Rio 2016 and won a silver medal this year in the synchronised 10m platform event with partner Cao Yuan.

Xie teared up after his victory in the 3m springboard on Tuesday mostly because of his provincial coach Wu Guocun who died suddenly in June.

“Before the competition I didn’t think too much but kept thinking of my coach’s voice. His voice was constantly on my mind” an emotional Xie said.

Provincial coaches play an important role as they pave the road for athletes to reach the world level. They are also responsible for picking young talent and to nurture them to be professional athletes.

On the day of Quan’s final the Guangdong diving team gathered together to watch the live broadcast of the competition. Zheng Guanzhi also known as the “Godmother of Guangdong Diving” revealed the secret of the team success to the Chinese media at the live watching party.

“I have always insisted that divers must maintain the two basics of good physical fitness and technique” Zheng said.

“Diving is a technically demanding sport which especially requires athletes to accumulate feeling and stability from thousands of times of basic training.

“Our generations of Guangdong diving stars have created many highly difficult moves but because they had deep basic skills they basically did not suffer any major injuries.”

She also credited the success of the diving team to the hard work of its coaches and athletes and a consistent flow of talent to the upper echelons within the province’s diving schools.

Ling Haichan the director of a diving centre said the natives of Guangdong are naturals in the pool because the south is a coastal province rich in water resources.

The older generation of divers accumulated a lot of experience when they practised diving on boats at river and sea. She added that the more petite size of the people serves as an ideal advantage in diving.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYWlybnNwb3N0LmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2NhaXJucy9jcm9jLWF0dGFjay10d28tbWVuLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktYml0dGVuLWJ5LWNyb2MtYXQtbG9ja2hhcnQtcml2ZXIvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS85NmE2ZDJkOTUwNDM4NjYyMzIxMjliNTMzMGQ4M2UyN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cape York croc: Soldier saves mate from jaws of 3m saltie,Full Digital Access 12 Month Plan costs $208 (min.cost) for the first 12 months charged as $16 every 4 weeks.

Tau scored for Albion in the previous friendly at Luton Town last Saturday but was not among the 23 players involved for the final tune-up against Getafe.

The South Africa striker who has made just one Premier League appearance for Brighton looks set to join Egyptian top flight club Al-Ahly where he would reunite with his former Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane.

Tau 27 has had little chance to impress at Brighton. He signed from Sundowns for around £3m in 2018 and had loan spells in Belgium with Union SG Club Brugge and Anderlecht.

His loan at Anderlecht was cut short last season and the skilful left-footed attacker joined Graham Potter's team and made his debut in an FA Cup penalty shoot-out victory at Newport.

He made a decent Premier League debut at champions Man City and was then used as a second half substitute in the next match at Leeds.

Tau then didn't feature in the league until May when he came on as a late substitute and claimed an assist with a nice throughball to Danny Welbeck during the 1-1 draw.

This season was always set to be now or never at Albion for the former Sundowns man and his excellent pre-season goal at Luton gave reason for optimism.

Tau was expected to see further first team opportunities at the start of this campaign especially following the summer exit of Alireza Jahanbakhsh and the fact that Welbeck remains injured.

But the news that Al Ahly who are second in the Egyptian Premier League behind Zamalek and his omission from Albion's final pre-season match suggests his Albion career is over before it ever started.

Former Leeds defender and South Africa skipper Lucas Radebe however thinks he should should stay with Brighton and fight for his place.

“I don’t think Percy must leave. I see no point in returning to Belgium because he’s been there before. He’s talented enough to play at Brighton. He must fight harder... show them he can do it” Radebe said speaking to the Sowetan."

Abbott visited New Delhi last week as Australia’s special trade envoy for India as the Australian government gives priority to sealing a bilateral trade deal.

In an opinion piece likely to anger Beijing that that was published in The Australian newspaper on Monday Abbott said the “answer to almost every question about China is India.”

“With the world’s other emerging superpower becoming more belligerent almost by the day it’s in everyone’s interests that India take its rightful place among the nations as quickly as possible” Abbott wrote.

“Because trade deals are about politics as much as economics a swift deal between India and Australia would be an important sign of the democratic world’s tilt away from China as well as boosting the long-term prosperity of both our countries” Abbott added.

Abbott was prime minister when China and Australia finalized a bilateral free trade deal which took effect in 2015. He also hosted a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping a year earlier.

Relations have since soured over issues including Australia banning Chinese telecom giant Huawei from major communications infrastructure projects outlawing covert foreign interference in Australian politics and calling for an independent investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abbott accused Beijing of “capricious boycotts” of Australian exports including coal barley wine and seafood that demonstrated Chinese use of trade as a “strategic weapon.”

“The basic problem is that China’s daunting power is a consequence of the free world’s decision to invite a communist dictatorship into global trading networks” Abbott said.

“China has exploited the West’s goodwill and wishful thinking to steal our technology and undercut our industries; and in the process become a much more powerful competitor than the old Soviet Union ever was because it’s now a first-rate economy that’s rapidly developing a military to match; and spoiling for a fight over Taiwan a pluralist democracy of 25 million that’s living proof there’s no totalitarian gene in the Chinese DNA” Abbott added.

The Chinese Embassy in Australia did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.

Negotiations between India and Australia on a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement began in 2011 but were suspended in 2015.

India is particularly concerned by freer trade in Australian farm exports. New Delhi’s demands for less restrictive visas for Indian workers is a major sticking point for Australia.

Australia’s current Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi last year upgraded the bilateral relationship with a raft of agreements that strengthened defense ties and committed both nations to expanding trade.

Abbott visited India last week to “propel our economic relationship to its full potential to the mutual benefit of the Indian and Australian people” Australian High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzA3L3RleGFzLWRlbW9jcmF0cy1zdWUtYWJib3R0LXZvdGluZy1sYXdz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Dems sue state GOP members over special legislative session,"Texas Democrats sued some of the state's top Republican leaders on Friday alleging that GOP efforts to get Democrats to return to Texas for a special legislative session infringes on their First Amendment rights. Driving the news: The lawsuit was filed one night before a special legislative session — called by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott — was set to convene in an effort to pass restrictive new election laws the Texas Tribune reported.

The lawsuit filed by 22 House lawmakers in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas names Abbott GOP House Speaker Dade Phelan and state Rep. James White as defendants.

The suit alleges they have tried to ""deny coerce threaten intimidate and prevent"" members and their constituents from exercising their rights to ""vote in all elections"" ""peacefully assemble to redress their grievances"" ""speak publicly about the exercise of their constitutional rights"" ""of association"" ""security of person"" and ""freedom from arrest except upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.""

The Democrats who filed the suit are asking for $5 in actual damages and $10 in punitive damages.

What they're saying: ""Texas House Democrats continue in our fight to stop Texas Republicans’ efforts to undermine our democracy by passing their anti-voter legislation"" Rep. Chris Turner chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus said in a statement.

""Day by day we will keep fighting with everything we have to protect Texans’ freedom to vote"" he said.

The big picture: Abbott called a special legislative session his third attempt for this weekend to push his election bill which puts limits on whether people can vote early vote by mail or vote from their cars.

The proposed bill also includes provisions that would increase the spending of federal COVID-19 relief funds and potentially change the legislative rules regarding quorums.

Phelan adjourned the chamber until Monday because not enough Democrats showed up at the Capitol on Saturday to reach the required quorum for the special legislative session AP reports.

After a prayer from a Republican noting ""a raging ocean of division and hostility in this chamber"" the House adjourned until 4 p.m. Monday. No other actions could be taken without a quorum.

Afterward 26 House Democrats issued a statement saying they will remain in Washington ""for as long as Congress is working and making progress on federal voting rights legislation"" — well below the 51 needed to continue a quorum break that began last month during the first special session.

The numbers indicate that the House might be back in business as early as Monday.

""We refuse to be party to the Republican plan to strip away the voting rights of the citizens we took a solemn oath to protect"" said the 26 Democrats including Austin Reps. Gina Hinojosa Eddie Rodriguez Celia Israel and Vikki Goodwin.

The Senate meantime set off at a sprint suspending several rules to speed consideration of bills on special session priorities set by Gov. Greg Abbott — including a rule that had required that the public receive at least 24-hour notice for hearings on bills.

Killing that rule meant one committee hearing began Saturday with less than 10 minutes of notice with two others beginning less than an hour later.

The goal is to pass most of Abbott's agenda in the first week of the new special session similar to the Senate's rapid action in the first overtime meeting of the Legislature that began in July Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said. Special sessions can last no more than 30 days.

""We have a lot of work to do over a short time"" Patrick told the Senate. ""I know you're ready to go to work.""

Most of the bills granted rapid public hearings Saturday were not controversial although Senate Bill 6 limiting bail opportunities for those accused of violent or sexual offenses was opposed by several witnesses who rushed to the Capitol to say it would force more people into the cash bail system disproportionately affecting Black Latino and low-income Texans.

""I think it's real important that we slow down a little bit"" Nick Hudson with the ACLU of Texas testified noting that anybody who lived more than 45 minutes from the Capitol was effectively barred from speaking on SB 6.

Hudson asked the Jurisprudence Committee to schedule another hearing to encourage a more thoughtful process on a bill that will affect thousands of Texans. Senators declined saying SB 6 was little changed from bills that received thorough hearings during the regular session and the first special session.

More contentious bills will be heard in the coming days.

Sparks will fly Sunday when a Senate committee takes action on SB 2 blocking transgender girls from participating in girls sports and SB 4 limiting the use of abortion-inducting drugs. That hearing is set to begin at 1:30 p.m.

In addition Democrats and civil rights groups have begun rallying opponents to attend a 9 a.m. Monday hearing on SB 1 the GOP overhaul of voting and elections law. Republicans say SB 1 is needed to protect election integrity but Democrats say it would erect unnecessary impediments to voting that were inspired by unsupported claims that fraud led to former President Donald Trump's defeat in 2020.

Similar GOP-backed voting bills led to hearings that lasted into the early morning hours of the first special session and inspired the House Democratic walkout.

More:Staring down 2nd special session absent Texas Democrats coy on plans

Those Democrats traveled to Washington to press Congress to pass federal voting protections and the 26 Democrats who will remain on the East Coast said that work won't stop during the new special session.

""Texas House Democrats continue in our fight to stop Texas Republicans’ efforts to undermine our democracy by passing their anti-voter legislation"" they said in a statement.

Also roiling the Texas House was a lawsuit filed Friday in Austin federal court in the name of 22 House Democrats that sought a temporary restraining order blocking Abbott and House Speaker Dade Phelan R-Beaumont from taking any action that violates their constitutional rights.

The lawsuit — which complained that the Democrats ""suffered much anxiety and distress over the separation from their families and much discomfort and embarrassment and their reputations impaired"" — produced immediate ridicule from Republicans.

At least three of the listed plaintiffs including Rep. Donna Howard D-Austin asked for their names to be removed from the lawsuit saying they had not agreed to be included or were not made aware of its contents before it was filed.

Howard said she had been told the lawsuit was going to be an attempt to ensure that Democrats would not be arrested — or have their attendance compelled as the Texas Constitution puts it — when they returned from their previous quorum break. That is not what was filed she said.

More:After his veto didn't lure Democrats back to work Gov. Abbott extends funding for legislative branch

A new more focused version of the lawsuit might be filed soon one Democrat said.

Saturday also produced a deluge of bill filings with more than 160 submitted before the session officially began around noon.

Several of those bills related to a new agenda item from Abbott who directed lawmakers to reconsider the quorum rule requiring two-thirds of senators and representatives to be present to conduct business. The rule halted action in the 150-member House when 57 Democrats traveled to Washington in the first special session which ended Friday.

Senate Joint Resolution 1 by Sen. Brian Birdwell R-Granbury would ask voters to amend the Texas Constitution to lower the number of lawmakers needed to establish quorum to a simple majority.

Another bill HB 33 by Rep. Steve Toth R-The Woodlands would punish lawmakers who break quorum by depriving them of state money to operate their offices for one year.

Additional quorum-related bills are expected to be filed in the coming days."

It also accelerated a dramatic shift in the logistics and delivery side of the supply chain equation as consumers moved from brick-and-mortar purchases to online shopping. The dynamic nature of the full supply chain is now a given demanding significant shifts in the way we view optimization.

The goal of a supply chain organization is to meet customer requirements while minimizing total supply chain costs. Businesses must be flexible enough to respond quickly when disruptions occur.

Unfortunately most of us aren’t as agile as we could be as this research from Ventana points out:

79% of companies use spreadsheets for supply chain planning.

Less than 25% say their supply chain plans are integrated with their company’s manufacturing procurement or sales departments.

54% say they have limited or no ability to measure supply chain trade offs across departments when making decisions.

Additionally the last mile grows even more complex. The last mile has always been the most expensive long-bemoaned challenge of the supply chain. With the “new normal” of changing consumption habits and channels creating unpredictable demand forecasts have become meaningless. This makes agility and speed to optimization that much more important to meet customers’ growing expectations for instant availability and near-immediate delivery.

A fixed logistics model is not designed to be flexible or fast. Capgemini Research Institute Supply Chain Survey 2020 found that 70% of companies are prioritizing inbound and outbound logistics as part of their supply chain sustainability efforts post Covid. Yet less than half of organizations asked by Accenture agree they’re currently meeting customer expectations for order fulfillment.

What happens when the industry becomes even more dynamic and customer expectations require that time cycles compress?

The Missing Link

Constrained optimization helps manufacturing supply chains by identifying the best path forward as dynamic conditions impact sourcing and logistics options. In simple terms constrained optimization guides you to decide how to do more with less or how to use less to do more.

Most economic business decisions require applying constraints such as cost volume or time to a set of variables such as trucks SKUs or people with an objective to minimize (cost) or maximize (profit) outcomes. Every organization has a multitude of such optimization problems to solve.

This sounds like something we should be using right? But there are a few reasons why we don’t:

Enterprises with major investments in big data and analytics may assume they have the analysis and reporting in place that’s needed. But classical computing can’t process the volumes of data we’re collecting. Analysts end up compressing and reducing the data to run a computation thereby reducing the data analyzed to get a result.

Information is analyzed and presented to management and decision makers. They apply their unique perspectives to the debate and decide — the way they’ve always done it. And they assume that’s enough. Constrained optimization takes the debate and personal filters out of the equation to show you the best decisions.

Data isn’t just data. It has interrelationships with other data you must consider to get accurate and high-quality answers to optimization requests. If a classical computer doesn’t completely falter it may only give a single probable answer and it may or may not be accurate.

Classical vs. Complex

Many of us have heard of the traveling salesman problem which can be compared to truck routing and how to optimize the routes as well as the trucks. The challenge is that traveling salesman problems like this grow in complexity by n! (n factorial). Routing problems are more constrained and complex for every variable (truck route driver etc.) that you add. For example a traveling salesman problem that has 10 stops results in 3628800 route options 40 stops will result in approximately 40! = 8159152832 00000000000000000000000000000000000000 options. Routing multiple trucks and packages is even more complex.



A classical computer would struggle under the weight and scale of a vast set of possibilities. This is where quantum computers promise to take on the task to quickly produce options to choose from to make the best decision based on your goals.

Complicated scenarios meant to solve for multiple variables are not achievable by a classical computing algorithm in a short span of time. However algorithms using quantum computing techniques can quickly achieve this simulation using a classical system applying quantum techniques or a hybrid solution that employs both quantum and classical today.

Accenture concurs stating “Route-optimization algorithms are helping reduce mileage and improve on-time delivery rates. In logistics quantum routing uses cloud-based quantum computing to calculate the fastest route for all vehicles taking into account millions of real-time data points about traffic congestion.”

Here are a few additional ways constrained optimization benefits manufacturing supply chains from inbound raw materials to outbound distribution:

Transportation efficiency. Constrained optimization is used to identify optimal locations for plants distribution facilities and other logistics hubs. Even a mile difference in placing a plant can make a significant difference in the costs and productivity of the overall network.

Warehouse management and distribution. Constrained optimization is applied to optimize global and local shipping and loads warehousing and delivery for lowest cost optimum efficiency and productivity. Imagine having to schedule shipments of thousands upon thousands of computers televisions or cars across the globe using a piece of paper or a spreadsheet.

Inbound logistics. From order levels to delivery to the production line optimization can drive maximum production levels at the best cost. Even one lost shipment or forgotten vendor can wreak havoc on a production line. Now imagine having to schedule and maintain all the parts of a car computer TV refrigerator or ATV using a spreadsheet especially when you’re managing hundreds of thousands of units.

IDC research concludes: “The ability to ingest broad and deep data sets to inform better decision making will be the single largest differentiator of supply chain performance in the future.” Quantum computing techniques empower constrained optimization to a new level of accuracy and performance.

Quantum computers process complex computations to return a diversity of answers not just one. Every answer that meets the optimized state you need is delivered to you. You get exposure to more viable options than with classical processors and can select the one that best matches your specific situation right now. This is a much better way to make decisions vs the classical software approaches that provide a single answer as your only option.

Quantum computing is one of the most promising technological innovations likely to shape streamline and optimize the future of the supply chain. It offers better insights to make better decisions. That’s why there’s so much excitement about it.

That includes $365000 given to Biden’s general election fundraising effort according to federal fundraising disclosures. Though they donated at least $1.1 million to support Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid they also gave $50000 that election to a group called “Draft Biden” which sought to get Biden to run in that year’s primary the records show.

Miller 41 and Gill 67 married in Boston in 2009 and according to the Gill FoundationExternal link are the largest contributors to LGBTQ equality in history.

Miller earned a Bachelor of Science with honours in business administration from the University of Colorado Boulder. He started his career as a management consultant for Accenture followed by a period as an event planner for global clientele.

It is not yet known when he will take up his post in Bern. First he has to appear before the US Senate for a hearing before presenting his credentials to the Swiss government. The US embassy post for Switzerland and Liechtenstein has been vacant since January.

Miller replaces Edward McMullen an early supporter of Donald Trump who helped steer Trump’s victory in the Republican primary in South Carolina.

Political appointees

Presidents often dispense prime ambassadorships as rewards to political allies and top donors. Those appointments often come with an expectation that the appointees can foot the bill for entertaining on behalf of the United States in pricey high-profile capitals.

About 44% of Trump’s ambassadorial appointments were political appointees compared with 31% for Barack Obama and 32% for George W. Bush according to the American Foreign Service Association. Biden hopes to keep political appointments to about 30% of ambassador picks according to an administration official who spoke to the AP news agency on the condition of anonymity to talk about internal discussions.

Most political appointees from the donor class a small population that’s made up of predominantly white men have historically had little impact on foreign policy.

(KERO) — Kern County is marking the reopening of its historic Adobe House at Hart Memorial Park.

“To connect people with not just the knowledge of the science but also a love and appreciation for this land is what we’re really excited to do"" said Lia Mendez.

Mendez is the project consultant for a plan to convert the adobe house in Hart Park into a Nature Center. The future site of the Kern River Parkway Nature Center is located on the east end of Hart Park at the adobe building affectionately known to many as ""The Peacock House.""

The adobe house in Hart Park was built in 1939. The historic structure served as a ranger station home for the ranger taking care of the park.

But it since has fallen into disrepair.

In 2019 the county was considering demolishing the building but the community rallied to preserve it instead.

“The community found out it was going to be slated for destruction and there were going to be taco trucks here. we said no this building has an important history"" said Jeff Flores Chief of Staff for Kern County Supervisor Mike Maggard.

In turning the adobe home into a nature center officials hope to use this project as a means to spread environmental awareness and education through Kern.

“The county’s investing a half a million dollars” Mendez said.

At the heart of the Nature Center will be a variety of exhibits and programs that highlight the history and natural science of Bakersfield's one and only Kern River.

“Even though it is a small space we have a curator we’re working with who’s going to help us dream up a good way to use that space and have rotating exhibits so that when you come in there’s something new and fresh every time” Mendez said.

The adobe will also serve as a visitor's center where travelers from both near and far will find information about all nature and outdoor-related places organizations and businesses in Kern County.

“There’s so much here to be taken advantage of for families of Kern County"" Flores said. ""We want to preserve that we want to highlight that. It truly is a regional asset.""

Before completion the house had to undergo studies for flood control but organizers behind this project pushed to see development by the end of the year. The new Nature Center is set to open Wednesday at 11 a.m.

“Personally one of the reasons why I’m so passionate about this project is because I believe that now more than ever what we need in this community is to come together in celebration of our common ground"" Mendez said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vaG93LXRvL2hvdy10by1lZGl0LWEtcGRmLWluLWdvb2dsZS1kb2Nz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to edit a PDF in Google Docs,"Not long ago you either needed to own a copy of Adobe Acrobat or use some third-party software you downloaded from a shady website to edit a PDF.

But the manufacturer doesn't use standard components here. On the contrary a custom-developed platform is used which is tailored to the needs of a workstation. In our test sample the well-designed and modular case is equipped with no less than the most powerful AMD processor at the moment and AMD's latest workstation graphics card.

The AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3995WX meets the AMD Radeon Pro W6800

The AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3995WX is a 64-core CPU with a total of 128 threads. The graphics card is the AMD Radeon Pro W6800 which succeeds the AMD Radeon Pro W5700 and is now based on RDNA2 like the current desktop gaming graphics cards. This means that the AMD Radeon Pro W6800 also offers hardware support for real-time ray tracing and can access 32 GB of VRAM. With a whopping 256 GB of DDR4 RAM even very memory-intensive applications can be mastered without issues because thanks to the AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3995WX there's octa-channel support which leads to very good RAM data transfer rates. At 256 GB the SSD installed in our test model of the P620 is very small in comparison. It would probably be better to choose the next larger model when selecting a configuration.

Speaking of the chosen configuration: You can customize the Lenovo ThinkStation P620 to your heart's content in Lenovo's online store. The manufacturer offers a variety of options here. However users who want to buy the device in the version that we're reviewing will have to dig deep into their pockets. The base price (3179 Euros (~$3739)) is very far away from the Ultimate configuration: The system used in our review costs around 13000 Euros (~$15292).

McLaren Racing and McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown have a bigger footprint in the NTT IndyCar Series after Sunday's announcement that McLaren has an agreement in place to acquire a majority share of the Arrow McLaren SP IndyCar team.

The deal will give McLaren a 75% stake in the team. The transaction expected to be completed by the end of 2021 restructures the leadership of the team. Brown who also heads the McLaren Formula 1 team will chair a five-person board that will include three McLaren appointees as well as Sam Schmidt and Ric Peterson.

Schmidt founded the team in 2001 and Peterson came on board in 2013 to form Schmidt Peterson Motorsports. McLaren joined the team that was re-branded as Arrow McLaren SP in 2o2o.

McLaren Racing has franchises in F1 IndyCar Extreme E and esports.



“Today’s announcement is a strong signal of our long-term commitment to IndyCar as both a racing series and a marketing platform for McLaren Racing and our sponsor partners"" Brown said. ""I want to pay tribute to Sam Schmidt and Ric Peterson who together with the commitment and support of Arrow Electronics have built a formidable team for us to keep growing and fulfill our common ambition of consistently challenging for wins Indy 500s and series titles. Key to this is the continued leadership of Taylor Kiel as president of the team who has been instrumental to the progress of the partnership so far.

“McLaren Racing believes IndyCar will continue to build our brand in North America serve our expanding U.S. fan and partner base across our racing portfolio and drive long-term value. The racing is second-to-none with world-class competitors in both drivers and teams and a passionate highly engaged fan base.""

Brown said that the time was right to capitalize on Roger Penske's ownership and leadership the NTT IndyCar Series. The team is firmly in the hunt for a championship in 2021 as driver Pato O'Ward entered the weekend second in the points standings.

Story continues

“We see real potential for the series’s continued growth under the stewardship of Penske Entertainment and will continue to play an active role supporting the sport’s success growing the global fan base and implementing our sustainability agenda to deliver on environmental and social commitments including progressing diversity and inclusion in the industry"" Brown said.

Schmidt who raced in the IndyCar Series from 1997 through 1999 before he was paralyzed in an crash during a test session in 2000 is happy to the McLaren name and more important the resources remaining with the IndyCar team.

""With McLaren we’re moving forward again"" Schmidt said. ""As we’ve seen we’re now a regular contender and ultimately for Ric and I we are here to win races win 500s and win championships. This next step ensures the resources to do that for a long time ahead.""

Eimantas Stanionis the young welterweight contender from Lithuania had landed dozens of damaging punches when the collision of heads in Round 4 rendered the 40-year-old New Yorker unable to continue Saturday at The Armory in Minneapolis.

The scheduled 10-round fight was ruled a no-decision because it didn’t go four full rounds which is required to go to the cards.

Stanionis (13-0 9 KOs) received resistance from Collazo who didn’t fight like a quadragenarian who hadn’t been in the ring for almost two years. He was active durable and determined to give his all.

The problem for him was that he couldn’t avoid Stanionis’ heavy blows which busted up Collazo’s face even before the clash of heads. He demonstrated a good chin but it seemed only a matter of time before the younger man would wear down Collazo and win by stoppage.

Their heads collided with about 30 seconds remaining in the Round 4 causing a cut in Collazo’s right eyelid and forcing him to the canvas. He was able to get up but was badly hurt which prompted referee Charlie Fitch to stop the action and give him time to recover.

However it became clear after several minutes that Collazo resting with his arms on the ropes was finished.

“If you can’t stand up I have to stop the fight” Fitch said to Collazo. The fighter responded “Do that.” And that was that.

The official time of the stoppage was 2:31 of Round 4.

Of course the result will have been disappointing for Stanionis who wanted to make a statement and continue his ascent in the welterweight division. Make no mistake though: He looked sharp landing his hard shots with regularity and accuracy against a crafty opponent.

He didn’t exit the ring with a victory but he probably enhanced his reputation which a step forward. He’s not far from a title shot.

Collazo? The Brooklyn native who has fought professional for more than 20 years said beforehand that the fight might be his last. It’s difficult to imagine him coming back after taking so much punishment including the fight-ending clash of heads.

Stanionis 26 is just getting started. We probably have seen the last of Collazo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zcGxpdC13aW5kb3ctYzgtY29ydmV0dGUtY29tZXMtMTYwMDAwODEyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Split-Window C8 Corvette Comes With So Many Questions,"⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious

Where oh where to begin with this one…

Automotive designer Rain Prisk took to Facebook to post this interesting renderingof a C8 Corvettewith a split rear window. It’s reminiscent of the 1963 Corvette the first year of the C2 when GM designers thought adding a split rear window to the coupe would be stylish. That design aesthetic lasted just one model year because people complained about the diminished rearward visibility and now collectors fawn over them.

See a junked 1963 Corvette Z06 split window here.

Not only has the Rain Prisk added a dividing element down the middle of the back window the glass has shrunk to more closely mimic the dimensions on the C2 Corvette. After all being able to see when reversing your car these days is easier thanks to rearview cameras which of course give you a commanding view far superior to a large rear window.

ADVERTISEMENT

That’s not all the changes incorporated into this rendering. The plastic element which almost mimics a rear quarter window has been deleted and that really changes up the looks of the C8. What’s more the designer added two sets of vents behind the side windows similar to what you find on the C2 but only they look to be made of black plastic (or maybe they’re carbon fiber).

You’ll also note there’s a “roof stinger” on this Stingray. A black stripe which looks like it starts out wide tapers as it swoops backward going along the split in the back window finally terminating right above the Corvette badge on the rear.

This modification would fulfill modern DOT safety standards since there’s no third brake light. With modern LED lighting tech the element could easily have been switched to under the Corvette badge but it wasn’t for reasons we can only guess at.

We don’t expect GM to even sort of kick this design idea around but maybe some aftermarket shop will? After all we have C7 Corvettes with C2-inspired kits fitted so why not this?

Well Nicki denied that in a now-viral tweet saying ""I didn't hear the song and ask to get on it. How would I have heard the song? Chile what am I the damn song monitor? This was said by another artist recently as well. Y'all gotta stop.""

Babe @JessieJ I didn’t hear the song & ask 2get on it. The label asked me2get on it & paid me. How would I have heard the song? 😩 chiiille what am I the damn song monitor?

THEN it was SENT to Nicki. According to this interview with Republic Records' president Wendy Goldstein Jessie did in fact mess up a few parts of the ""Bang Bang"" origin story. Turns out ""Bang Bang"" was written for Ariana who hated it. Then Jessie hopped on it. it wasto Nicki.

Well after being called out by Nicki Jessie J took to Instagram to address the situation. She posted a video of her trying to rap Nicki's verse but intentionally failing. ""I respect you publicly being yourself @nickiminaj so here I am being myself. This is a video of me back in 2015 onstage taking the piss out of myself which is basically an hour of my set.""

""[The video] was made into a meme about two weeks ago. Is that what this is really about? And where this weird energy between us began? Or maybe it was when you used me as a stair rail at the AMAs. That was also funny AF"" she continued.

We should of been known this beef was coming when nicki used Jessie j as a stair railing 03:27 AM - 06 Aug 2021

""If we can’t laugh in the lives we have been blessed with what’s the point?"" she said. ""It really isn’t that deep.""

""From the moment I met you to now I have shown you nothing but love and gratitude for how fucking blessed I was to have you and Ariana — who wrote 'Bang Bang' with the insanely talented Max Martin which I found out today. Jesus what a day. Sorry Ari. I never knew. Wild.""

""I’m sorry I got the story wrong all these years. I was told you heard the song and wanted to be on it by someone clearly gassing me up at the label"" she continued. ""Thank you for clarifying I was wrong on that and 'Do It Like a Dude.' Told me huh.""

Kevin Winter / Getty Images for MTV

""What a way for us to celebrate the seven-year anniversary of the song. Should we all go for dinner? No pobably not right. Too soon? 'Bang Bang' part two? No OK got it. 'Do It Like a Dude' remix? OK. I’ll stop.""

Michael Tran / FilmMagic

""Look the song did its damn thing"" she added. ""I will never say you asked to be on the song ever again. Although all this drama means memes — and man have the memes of me kept me entertained all day — [it's] always love and light from me babes.""

“It really shocked all of us and we were like what the heck just happened here?” said a man we spoke with who’s been an Airbnb host since 2018.

He works with army special operations so because of his job he wanted to remain anonymous but says the decision to ban Airbnb's in the city was like ripping his legs from under him.

“That’s our 401K basically that’s been working for us” he said. “So now being told what you can and cannot do on a property that I pay taxes on feels a bit like betrayal.

He says the council has been discussing this for a few months now after an incident at an Airbnb that he doesn't operate caused town officials to look into whether they wanted short term rentals in Steilacoom.

When the council was deliberating the decision Councilmember Pete Franklin said it had a lot to do with allowing short term rental properties like Airbnb’s in residential neighborhoods that are meant for permanent residents.

“To me” Franklin said “short term rentals have never been allowed in residential sections for this.”

But the man we interviewed says his wife spoke with the town council back in 2018 when they bought their property to make sure this was okay and was told it was.

Now if they don't receive proper permits to make it an official bed and breakfast a long-term rental property or move in themselves they could face daily fines of $250.

“What they didn’t consider was all of the money that’s going to be removed from that town” the man we spoke with said. “They’ve made it impossible to use our property so now we’re forced to sell our property.”

During that town council meeting where the decision was made to ban Airbnb in Steilacoom officials said regular bed and breakfasts are still allowed in the town and that they would be monitoring sites like VRBO or Airbnb to see if someone was trying to rent out their property and if that happens they would send out a compliance letter.

The only other area that has similarly banned Airbnb’s in residential areas like this is over in Chelan County in places like Leavenworth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ubHlpbnlvdXJzdGF0ZS5jb20vbm9ydGgtY2Fyb2xpbmEvbHV4dXJpb3VzLWdsYW1waW5nLWRvbWUtYWlyYm5iLW5jL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Luxurious Glamping Dome In North Carolina Is One Of The Most Unusual Airbnb Listings Ever,"As local travel experts we know what travelers are looking for when it comes to finding the perfect accommodations for their next trip.

Fans can take a short drive away from Disneyland to Fullerton California to stay at an Airbnb inspired by Disney’s Haunted Mansion. Get ready to meet your Ghost Host because this four-bedroom interactive stay will make you feel like you’re in an actual Disney attraction.

While there’s no shortage of pop culture-inspired Airbnbs (these Harry Potter and Mickey Mouse stays are definite favorites) this Haunted Mansion-esque Airbnb is so popular that a few Disney influencers have already booked their trips. Elite Daily spoke with Disney digital creator Francis Dominic (@francisdominiic) who spilled all the tea on what it was actually like staying at this Haunted Mansion-themed rental and the experience did not disappoint. Dominic said with all the hidden surprises and details in the house “it really felt that you were living in the Haunted Mansion.”

Each of the four bedrooms are themed to a different Haunted Mansion character meaning you could end up sleeping in the Master Gracey room the Madame Leota room the Hatbox Ghost room or the Raven room which is inspired by the raven who appears throughout the Disney attraction. In order to get to your room though you’ll first have to stroll through the the creepy hall of doors with the iconic Haunted Mansion wallpaper.

We only recommend places we love and that we think you will too. We may receive a portion of sales from bookings made from this article which was written by our Editorial team.

Inside the Master Gracey room you’ll find an elegant California king-sized bed big enough for you and your boo. Meanwhile the Madame Leota room features a crystal ball with the spirit herself surrounded by candles and floating musical instruments. The Raven room has a red-eyed raven keeping eye on you as you sleep and the Hatbox Ghost room has a beautifully decorated queen-sized bed.

While the bedrooms are impressively decorated it’s the game chamber inspired by the stretching room that Dominic says is the coolest room in the house. It not only looks like the famed chamber with “no windows and no doors” from the Haunted Mansion but there are speakers throughout that’ll play the actual soundtrack from the ride. Plus Dominic says it doubles as a seance as well as a game and movie room. So while you’re enjoying your breakfast or playing with the ouija board to “call in the spirits wherever they're at” you can listen to the Ghost Host go through his whole spiel. Unsurprisingly there are plenty of eerie photo opps. As a Disney influencer with over 91k followers on Instagram Dominic recommends the “outside wall going into the stretching room” as one of the most Insta-worthy spots in the house. You know what that means: Bring your camera.

Over in the main lounge you’ll find tons of “ghostly illusions” that mimic the ride like flicking lights glowing busts changing portraits and mirrors with disappearing hitchhiking ghosts. If you’re a fan of the Haunted Mansion film starring Eddie Murphy there are even real estate flyers for a fun little Easter egg.

The ghoulish delights continue outside the “mansion” too. The rental has a super fun private backyard that boasts a two-hole putting green and a cornhole game painted like the dueling portraits you’ll find in the real Haunted Mansion’s ballroom. You can also relax in the hot tub or enjoy a meal outside at the outdoor dining table. Don’t forget that the Airbnb is less than seven miles away from Disneyland so it’s the perfect place to stay if you’re going to visit the actual Haunted Mansion attraction as well.

If you’re thinking about booking a stay reservations are open now. The Airbnb sleeps up to eight people at about $545 per night so you’ll want to bring your happy haunt crew with you. Keep in mind the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages travelers to delay any trips until you’re fully vaccinated and continue to adhere to any local COVID-19 restrictions while you’re there. By staying at the Haunted Mansion Airbnb you never know what ghoulish delights you’ll find.

The CDC recommends traveling only after you’re fully vaccinated and your vaccine has become fully effective. If you’re not fully vaccinated and must travel check the CDC guidelines before you book. Check your destination’s vaccination and testing requirements before you depart.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYWxsZWFycy5uZXQvMjAyMS8wOC8wOC9waG90b3Mtc3RheS1pbi1hLWhhdW50ZWQtbWFuc2lvbi1pbnNwaXJlZC1ob3VzZS1uZWFyLWRpc25leWxhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHOTOS: Stay in a Haunted Mansion-Inspired House Near Disneyland!,"Disney lovers make some of the coolest fan creations!

Avail views itself as a tech platform facilitating car owners who are flying out of state to link up with incoming travelers who want to borrow a set of wheels. The airport however considered Avail a car rental company and wanted to charge it the same 10% of gross revenues fee it charges other off-site rental companies. When Avail declined to sign such a contract the airport required its partnering parking lot the Parking Spot to stop working with the company in late May.

“This is the first time we’ve had a conflict like this in any airport we’ve pursued” said Avail CEO Mike Osborn.

The move forced several abrupt canceled reservations during the busy Memorial Day travel season. But Avail resumed operations Thursday after agreeing to pay the airport its 10% fee.

“All’s well that ends well” Osborn said adding it took only two brief meetings with airport officials to reach a deal. “We had great engagement that quickly showed we had the types of interests that aligned with their interests.”

The company will continue to partnering with the Parking Spot to store cars and with Allstate to provide insurance for vehicles that get rented.

In a brief statement an airport spokesperson called its “unique” agreement a win-win for the airport and Avail as well as car rental companies and travelers who want more choices.

“The SLC Airport embraces innovative business models that ensure fair competition at the airport” the statement said. “... In essence the agreement mirrors the off-airport car rental agreement which provides a level playing field for all parties involved.”

Osborn had previously speculated that the airport was trying to shut down Avail because of the powerful car rental lobby which provides a substantial amount of airports’ revenue.

“They’re in a difficult position” Osborn said of the airport’s operators “because they have a lot of stakeholders they need to keep satisfied.”

An Avail customer loaning out a car stands to make some spare cash if a traveler opts to rent it. But even if the vehicle sits unused the owner still gets perks like a free place to park near the airport as well as complimentary cleaning and sanitization of the car. Those renting the vehicles have perks like lower rates and included liability insurance.

Despite turbulence at Salt Lake City new airport over the past few months Avail reports about 45 cars are available for booking.

Josh Odom who splits his time between Park City and San Antonio owns one of those cars. He said he averaged around $100 a week loaning out his Nissan Pathfinder using Avail.

“We got an email notice pretty abruptly in May right before Memorial Day weekend telling us they canceled future reservations” Odom said. “The car sat idle and dormant which is crazy with the shortage in rental cars. I’d rather someone get use and value out of the car.”

Odom said he and his family opted to take a ride-hailing Uber to and from the airport in the meantime.

More than losing out on the extra cash Odom said he mostly felt sorry for Avail’s idle employees.

“We had the car in the system for seven months and hadn’t had any issues with how people take care of it” he said. “It’s been a good experience. I’ve had several friends who have checked their vehicles in and had equally great [feedback].”

An Avail spokesperson said the company was able to reassign its Salt Lake City workers during the shutdown.

Avail also operates at airports in Atlanta; Baltimore-Washington; Chicago; Dallas; Denver; Houston; Los Angeles; Miami; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Austin Texas; Charlotte N.C.; and Nashville Tenn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRicmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL2RlYXRocy9hbGxhbi1wYXVsLXdhdGVycy1odXNiYW5kLW9mLXNlbWlub2xlLW1heW9yLWRpZXMv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGJyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vZGVhdGhzL2FsbGFuLXBhdWwtd2F0ZXJzLWh1c2JhbmQtb2Ytc2VtaW5vbGUtbWF5b3ItZGllcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Allan Paul Waters Husband of Seminole Mayor Dies,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.tbreporter.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /deaths/allan-paul-waters-husband-of-seminole-mayor-dies/ (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: certificate has expired (_ssl.c:1006)'))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRicmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL2RlYXRocy9hbGxhbi1wYXVsLXdhdGVycy1odXNiYW5kLW9mLXNlbWlub2xlLW1heW9yLWRpZXMv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGJyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vZGVhdGhzL2FsbGFuLXBhdWwtd2F0ZXJzLWh1c2JhbmQtb2Ytc2VtaW5vbGUtbWF5b3ItZGllcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

Image courtesy of Apple.

Apple Inc. will roll out a system for checking photos for child abuse imagery on a country-by-country basis depending on local laws the company said this week.

Apple officials also said the company would implement a system that screens photos for such images before they are uploaded from iPhones in the U.S. to its iCloud storage.

Child safety groups praised Apple as it joined Facebook Inc. Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in taking such measures.

But Apple’s photo check on the iPhone itself raised concerns that the company is probing into users’ devices in ways that could be exploited by governments. Many other technology companies check photos after they are uploaded to servers.

In a media briefing on Friday Apple said it would make plans to expand the service based on the laws of each country where it operates.

The company said nuances in its system such as “safety vouchers” passed from the iPhone to Apple’s servers that do not contain useful data will protect Apple from government pressure to identify material other than child abuse images.

We’ve had personal computers for decades and there has never been a mandate to scan the private content of all desktops laptops or phones globally for unlawful content. It’s not how technology built in free countries works. — Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) August 6 2021

Apple has a human review process that acts as a backstop against government abuse it added. The company will not pass reports from its photo checking system to law enforcement if the review finds no child abuse imagery.

Regulators are increasingly demanding that tech companies do more to take down illegal content. For the past few years law enforcement and politicians have wielded the scourge of child abuse to decry strong encryption in the way they had previously cited the need to curb terrorism.

A few resulting laws including in Britain could be used to force tech companies to act against their users in secret.

While Apple’s strategy may deflect government meddling by showing its initiative or complying with anticipated directives in Europe many security experts said the privacy champion was making a big mistake by showing its willingness to reach into customer phones.

“It may have deflected U.S. regulators’ attention for this one topic but it will attract regulators internationally to do the same thing with terrorist and extremist content” said Riana Pfefferkorn a research scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory.

Politically influential copyright holders in Hollywood and elsewhere could even argue that their digital rights should be enforced in such a way she said.

Facebook’s WhatsApp the world’s largest fully encrypted messaging service is also under pressure from governments that want to see what people are saying and it fears that will now increase. WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart tweeted a barrage of criticism Friday against Apple for the new architecture.

“We’ve had personal computers for decades and there has never been a mandate to scan the private content of all desktops laptops or phones globally for unlawful content” he wrote. “It’s not how technology built in free countries works.”

Apple’s experts argued that they were not really going into people’s phones because data sent on its devices must clear multiple hurdles. For example banned material is flagged by watchdog groups and the identifiers are bundled into Apple’s operating systems worldwide making them harder to manipulate.

Some experts said they had one reason to hope Apple had not truly changed direction in a fundamental way.

As Reuters reported last year the company had been working to make iCloud backups end-to-end encrypted meaning the company could not turn over readable versions of them to law enforcement. It dropped the project after the FBI objected.

Apple may be setting the stage to turn on the encryption later this year using this week’s measures to head off anticipated criticism of that change said Stanford Observatory founder Alex Stamos.

Apple declined to comment on future product plans.

A spin-off is when a business unit of an existing public company is separated and becomes its own public company. For example PayPal Holdings used to be a part of eBay until it was spun off in 2015. Spin-offs can be an interesting place to look for investment ideas because unlike IPOs they don't tend to attract a lot of attention or excitement.

Last year IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC -2.27%) spun off its online dating app Match Group which went on to perform well in its first year as a public company. Last month IAC gave investors another spin-off to chew on with video publishing platform Vimeo (VMEO 0.51%).

Given the success of Match Group should investors pay attention to Vimeo?

What exactly is Vimeo?

Many people are familiar with Vimeo as a sort of little brother to Alphabet's YouTube. This was true five years ago but Vimeo pivoted its business model in 2017 from serving as a viewing platform to operating as a software company helping businesses and creators edit and publish high-quality ad-free videos.

Vimeo still operates its viewing platform which counts over 200 million users but it also allows creators to upload edit and publish videos that push to other websites including TikTok YouTube and Twitter. Vimeo's value proposition is two-fold. First it makes the process of editing and publishing videos online easy by providing tools that anyone can use. For example Vimeo recently acquired a company that harnesses artificial intelligence to help users create quality product videos in just a few clicks. Second Vimeo provides its tools and platform at a very low cost compared to other available options. The combination of cheap and easy-to-use is very powerful.

Vimeo also serves larger enterprises with features including live streaming video on demand subscription management viewer analytics and developer APIs that allow endless customization. During the COVID-19 pandemic Vimeo added many enterprise customers to enable ""town halls"" for communications between employees within organizations.

Vimeo has a compelling suite of products and has benefited from the increased need for powerful video solutions in recent years. The company appears to be in the right space at the right time.

Why did IAC spin off Vimeo?

If Vimeo is so promising then why did IAC decide to spin the company off? Well buying businesses building them up and spinning them off is a game IAC tends to play. IAC was founded by legendary media investor Barry Diller and has a storied track record of running this playbook. IAC has been the force behind many well-known media companies including Expedia Match Group and Angi formerly Angie's list to name a few examples.

This is exactly what IAC has done with Vimeo. IAC acquired Vimeo in 2006 as part of a package deal with a few other internet properties. In 2017 Anjali Sud was promoted as CEO to take the company in a new direction. Sud led the company on its journey from serving as a media viewing platform to selling its software and publishing solutions to creators and enterprises over the past four years.

Under IAC's stewardship Vimeo has bolstered its offering by acquiring several companies including Livestream (for its live stream capabilities) VHX (for its video distribution platforms) and Magistro (for its video editing capabilities).

The combination of putting new management in place funding acquisitions and providing the company the room to grow has resulted in a spin-off worth over $8 billion. This has been a home run investment for IAC and has initiated a new chapter for Vimeo to pursue its own destiny as an independent company.

New Zealand has in recent years earned a reputation for attracting tech billionaires keen to purchase a bolt hole in case of an impending apocalypse.

Page has been riding out the pandemic in Fiji with his wife Lucinda Southworth 42 and their two sons aged 12 and 10.

Page applied for a special visa on November 3 2020 and first flew into the country on January 11 2021 after his child became ill in Fiji according to Stuff.

His residency was approved on February 4 2021 - after Page entered the country.

He has since left Stuff reported.

Page's residency visa is known as the Investor Plus which allows anyone into the country provided they have at least $10 million to invest.

The country's immigration chief Kris Faafoi told reporters that Page had requested an exemption 'to make sure his son got the treatment that was required.'

New Zealand a country of just five million people has seen 2880 cases of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic and 26 deaths - one of the lowest rates of infection and death in the world.

The country is a haven of normality despite the pandemic ravaging the rest of the world and locals are unimpressed by the idea of rich people buying their way in.

Health minister Andrew Little was interrogated about the visit in parliament saying that an application was approved in January for a child accompanied by an adult to be medically evacuated from Fiji.

He said anyone accepted for treatment is considered to require immediate care and could not be treated locally.

'I'm advised all of the normal steps occurred in this case' Little said.

Ardern said she was not briefed at the time Page was in New Zealand.

Immigration New Zealand general manager of border and visa operations Nicola Hogg told AFP that Page 'met relevant requirements' to be approved entry.

'Mr Page is not a permanent resident. Citizenship is a matter for the Department of Internal Affairs. Due to privacy reasons we are unable to comment further without a privacy waiver.'

Hogg did not address the question of whether Page spent two weeks in quarantine as required of people entering New Zealand.

New Zealand's opposition ACT Party called on Ardern's government to be more open about his visit.

'The Government has questions to answer about why billionaire Google co-founder Larry Page was allowed into New Zealand when desperate Kiwis and separated families can't get through the border' ACT leader David Seymour said.

Seymour said while he had sympathy for Page's situation there were numerous people with similar issues who could not get in.

'I have had to tell them 'sorry but there is no way you can get through the border government policy will not allow it'' he added.

'New Zealanders stranded overseas who are desperate to get home deserve answers.'

Page founded Google with Sergey Brin in the 1990s and is listed by Bloomberg as the eighth-richest person in the world with a reported wealth of $116 billion.

Page has reportedly become become reclusive over the past several years - avoiding being photographed except for a handful of times since stepping down as CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. in 2019.

He has spent months in Fiji during the coronavirus pandemic - mostly on the island of Tavarua - and it has been rumored the billionaire has bought at least one island in the country's Mamanuca archipelago sources told Insider.

Page has also been spotted an a smaller island called Namotu - which a sailor claimed Page had bought in a blog post in August.

He had taken his private jet to donate COVID-19 medical supplies to Fiji in June as a second wave of the pandemic hit the country - which was reported by Fijian Broadcasting Company News on June 19 according to Insider.

However that story has since disappeared from the state-owned news site - and sources told Insider that health officials in Fiji asked for it to come down claiming that the information should not have been made public.

A source confirmed to DailyMail.com that the article had been removed after health officials asked for the story to be taken down because 'they didn't want the donation highlighted.'

The article appears to have also since been scrubbed from Google.

According to Insider the story had reported that Page flew from Hawaii to Fiji's Nadi International Airport to provide the country with medical supplies including masks gowns and gloves.

A photo of Page's jet was posted to Twitter on June 19 by a Fijian journalist who captioned the post: 'One of the Co-Founders of Google Larry Page donated cartons of COVID-19 supplies to Fiji as the country battles its second wave of the virus.'

Earlier this week it was revealed the American billionaire travelled here from Fiji in January because his child needed medical treatment.

Immigration New Zealand (INZ) said Page submitted his application under the investor plus category in November 2020.

It could not be processed until he entered the country so it was approved in February.

The investor plus category requires applicants to invest at least $10 million in New Zealand over three years.

INZ said the application included the necessary documentation and was assessed as meeting immigration requirements.

Act Party deputy leader Brooke van Velden has questioned how Page was able to get his application processed so quickly.

""The government does need to answer the question whether there was a different process for somebody in the investor category rather than those people who are skilled migrants - our chefs our doctors and nurses - who cannot get residency and are waiting over two years for their visas to be processed.""

Immigration adviser Katy Armstrong said Page's case highlighted inequities with the system.

""We have got these GPs or nurses who are stuck in an interminable waiting room to get their residence whereas Larry [Page] comes in and boom straight away can become a resident.""

Armstrong said it was a ""kick in the guts"" for those people.

""I think it is leaving them feeling that they need to just get out of New Zealand they need to get the hell out because there is no future for them here they are not valued and that the bureaucracy is just broken.""

Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi said he did not comment on individual cases.

But he understood proper process was followed by Immigation New Zealand in handling Page's residency application.

Faafoi said he had no involvement in deciding the case.

Page arrived in Auckland with his child in January after the Ministry of Health approved a request for a medevac flight.

When they arrived in New Zealand his child were taken to an isolation area in the hospital and Page went into managed isolation.

Asked if it was aware of Page's application for residence before the flight was approved the ministry said it was unable to confirm details about individual patients to protect their privacy.

Health Minister Andrew Little confirmed in Parliament earlier this week the application met all the necessary requirements.

The Ministry of Health said the costs of any medevac must be covered by either a government to government agreement private insurance or direct payment.

Costs of any medical treatment in New Zealand must also be covered for individuals not eligible for publicly funded services.

Page and his child have since left the country."

Image courtesy of Apple.

Apple Inc. will roll out a system for checking photos for child abuse imagery on a country-by-country basis depending on local laws the company said this week.

Apple officials also said the company would implement a system that screens photos for such images before they are uploaded from iPhones in the U.S. to its iCloud storage.

Child safety groups praised Apple as it joined Facebook Inc. Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in taking such measures.

But Apple’s photo check on the iPhone itself raised concerns that the company is probing into users’ devices in ways that could be exploited by governments. Many other technology companies check photos after they are uploaded to servers.

In a media briefing on Friday Apple said it would make plans to expand the service based on the laws of each country where it operates.

The company said nuances in its system such as “safety vouchers” passed from the iPhone to Apple’s servers that do not contain useful data will protect Apple from government pressure to identify material other than child abuse images.

We’ve had personal computers for decades and there has never been a mandate to scan the private content of all desktops laptops or phones globally for unlawful content. It’s not how technology built in free countries works. — Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) August 6 2021

Apple has a human review process that acts as a backstop against government abuse it added. The company will not pass reports from its photo checking system to law enforcement if the review finds no child abuse imagery.

Regulators are increasingly demanding that tech companies do more to take down illegal content. For the past few years law enforcement and politicians have wielded the scourge of child abuse to decry strong encryption in the way they had previously cited the need to curb terrorism.

A few resulting laws including in Britain could be used to force tech companies to act against their users in secret.

While Apple’s strategy may deflect government meddling by showing its initiative or complying with anticipated directives in Europe many security experts said the privacy champion was making a big mistake by showing its willingness to reach into customer phones.

“It may have deflected U.S. regulators’ attention for this one topic but it will attract regulators internationally to do the same thing with terrorist and extremist content” said Riana Pfefferkorn a research scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory.

Politically influential copyright holders in Hollywood and elsewhere could even argue that their digital rights should be enforced in such a way she said.

Facebook’s WhatsApp the world’s largest fully encrypted messaging service is also under pressure from governments that want to see what people are saying and it fears that will now increase. WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart tweeted a barrage of criticism Friday against Apple for the new architecture.

“We’ve had personal computers for decades and there has never been a mandate to scan the private content of all desktops laptops or phones globally for unlawful content” he wrote. “It’s not how technology built in free countries works.”

Apple’s experts argued that they were not really going into people’s phones because data sent on its devices must clear multiple hurdles. For example banned material is flagged by watchdog groups and the identifiers are bundled into Apple’s operating systems worldwide making them harder to manipulate.

Some experts said they had one reason to hope Apple had not truly changed direction in a fundamental way.

As Reuters reported last year the company had been working to make iCloud backups end-to-end encrypted meaning the company could not turn over readable versions of them to law enforcement. It dropped the project after the FBI objected.

A source confirmed to DailyMail.com that the article had been removed after health officials asked for the story to be taken down because 'they didn't want the donation highlighted.'

The article appears to have also since been scrubbed from Google.

According to Insider the story had reported that Page flew from Hawaii to Fiji's Nadi International Airport to provide the country with medical supplies including masks gowns and gloves.

A photo of Page's jet was posted to Twitter on June 19 by a Fijian journalist who captioned the post: 'One of the Co-Founders of Google Larry Page donated cartons of COVID-19 supplies to Fiji as the country battles its second wave of the virus.'

The plane's call sign 813QS pictured on one of its engines is licensed to Blue City Holdings according to the Federal Communications Commission .

Sources said that Page and his wife Southworth have been seen surfing on traditional and electronic surfboards near the country's islands and that 'he's good at it too.'

Southworth is a research scientist and is the sister of actress Carrie Southworth.

The couple are very private and have not revealed the names of their two children who were born in 2009 and 2011.

Earlier this week it was revealed the American billionaire travelled here from Fiji in January because his child needed medical treatment.

Immigration New Zealand (INZ) said Page submitted his application under the investor plus category in November 2020.

It could not be processed until he entered the country so it was approved in February.

The investor plus category requires applicants to invest at least $10 million in New Zealand over three years.

INZ said the application included the necessary documentation and was assessed as meeting immigration requirements.

Act Party deputy leader Brooke van Velden has questioned how Page was able to get his application processed so quickly.

""The government does need to answer the question whether there was a different process for somebody in the investor category rather than those people who are skilled migrants - our chefs our doctors and nurses - who cannot get residency and are waiting over two years for their visas to be processed.""

Immigration adviser Katy Armstrong said Page's case highlighted inequities with the system.

""We have got these GPs or nurses who are stuck in an interminable waiting room to get their residence whereas Larry [Page] comes in and boom straight away can become a resident.""

Armstrong said it was a ""kick in the guts"" for those people.

""I think it is leaving them feeling that they need to just get out of New Zealand they need to get the hell out because there is no future for them here they are not valued and that the bureaucracy is just broken.""

Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi said he did not comment on individual cases.

But he understood proper process was followed by Immigation New Zealand in handling Page's residency application.

Faafoi said he had no involvement in deciding the case.

Page arrived in Auckland with his child in January after the Ministry of Health approved a request for a medevac flight.

When they arrived in New Zealand his child were taken to an isolation area in the hospital and Page went into managed isolation.

Asked if it was aware of Page's application for residence before the flight was approved the ministry said it was unable to confirm details about individual patients to protect their privacy.

Health Minister Andrew Little confirmed in Parliament earlier this week the application met all the necessary requirements.

The Ministry of Health said the costs of any medevac must be covered by either a government to government agreement private insurance or direct payment.

Costs of any medical treatment in New Zealand must also be covered for individuals not eligible for publicly funded services.

Page and his child have since left the country."

Few institutions held up better during the COVID pandemic than Amazon. Its supply chains successfully accommodated a massive surge in demand and continued to provide products to hundreds of millions of customers. No wonder its stock price has almost doubled since March 2020. And yet Amazon faces an uncertain future. Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO and policymakers have grown increasingly vocal about their desire to break up Big Tech companies like Amazon. So what’s next for this retail giant? I recently discussed that question and much more with Brad Stone.

Brad is the senior executive editor for global technology at Bloomberg News as well as a writer for Bloomberg Businessweek. He is also the author of four books the most recent of which is Amazon Unbound: Jeff Bezos and the Invention of a Global Empire released last May.

What follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation. You can download the episode here and don’t forget to subscribe to my podcast on iTunes or Stitcher. Tell your friends leave a review.

Pethokoukis: I remember when Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress and one thing that really struck me is that the people questioning him really did not understand how Facebook made money. And to me it seems Facebook is a much simpler company than Amazon.

So as you’ve been doing interviews about the book do you sense that people understand how Amazon works?

That’s a really good question. They certainly understand how the oldest — and maybe still the largest — part of Amazon works primarily because they’re customers. When you go to any city (but particularly Washington DC) and talk to regulators and legislators they understand Amazon in part because they interact with it every single day probably like the rest of us. And so when you talk about the retail business the third-party marketplace maybe Alexa and definitely the movies and TV shows I think there’s an understanding. Maybe there’s not a full appreciation for the complexity as it pertains to things like Amazon Web Services and how it all fits together. But I think because Amazon is known as a store there is an understanding of a large part of what it does.

Sometimes I get the sense talking to people — even regulators and staffers — that they believe Amazon would love to be able to own and sell everything. It seems like they believe Amazon is looking to destroy all those small businesses and take data from them. Are they right? And if not what is the strategy of the bulk of Amazon’s business?

Maybe you’re right in that there are now critics on both sides of the aisle. There’s this rare bipartisan consensus against the Big Tech companies — in particular Amazon. And I think they may often attribute the very worst motives to the company.

So let’s just take the specific issue of Amazon’s private-label business and how it gleans data from its third-party sellers to figure out what to sell and what to put under the Amazon Basics mantle. To a certain extent maybe I’m not so sure that they don’t understand it — you know there’s a political argument being made here. But the fact is that most retailers have very large private label businesses and of course they look at what’s selling to figure out what they should sell. And Amazon does it too. They’ve been caught with their hand in the cookie jar because they’ve proclaimed to have an internal policy against letting employees look at the data from third-party sellers. And as I recount in my book (and others have recounted as well) clearly employees have vaulted over the wall.

But when it comes to actual policy that might prohibit Amazon from rolling out private label products it’s unrealistic because then you have to consider Costco Walmart Walgreens and everyone else who does it. So I don’t know . . . we’re in the realm of the political argument and there’s not a lot of room for nuance about how retail operates in general.

One of my favorite writings on Amazon is from the tech analyst Benedict Evans who had a great blog post maybe a couple of years ago called “Amazon is a Boring Retailer.” And let me just read what he wrote about Amazon and get your thoughts:

I sometimes think that if you could look in the safe behind Jeff Bezos’s desk instead of the sports almanac from Back to the Future you’d find an Encyclopedia of Retail written in maybe 1985. There would be Post-It notes on every page and every one of those notes has been turned into a team or maybe a product. Amazon is so new and so dramatic in its speed and scale and aggression that we can easily forget how many of the things it’s doing are actually very old. And we can forget how many of the slightly dusty incumbent retailers we all grew up with were also once radical daring piratical new businesses that made people angry with their new ideas.

What I’m getting at is that people just don’t have a good sense of the history of business. They may understand regulation and law but they don’t understand the history of business and how what Amazon is doing is very old. They’re just doing it way faster and way bigger.

Yes and no. In my first book about Amazon The Everything Store I do talk about how Bezos and his executives read the Sam Walton autobiography and took certain pieces from it. And clearly they do utilize best practices from retail. But there’s so much about Amazon that is unique. The shelves are endless. The variety is potentially endless.

There are also all these pieces at Amazon where the connections are very opaque but they clearly reinforce each other. So there’s the way in which retail operates on Amazon Web Services and ostensibly gets a pretty hefty discount for Amazon’s cloud infrastructure which then turns around and sells to other competitors at a markup. Or there’s the way in which Amazon’s Alexa devices sit in people’s homes with a backend on AWS and integrate other thriving pieces of the tech ecosystem like music streaming surveillance cameras and other things.

Amazon is a collection of self-reinforcing parts — all adhering to the same business principles but with these very opaque and fuzzy connections between them and then throwing off tremendous amounts of cash and allowing Amazon to invest in new things. So I think yes the manual’s there but Amazon’s really pioneering new territory as well.

You mentioned the previous book The Everything Store and I would recommend to listeners that it makes a fantastic companion to Amazon Unbound. Can they buy that in a beautiful box set or something? Have you produced that?

No unfortunately not. Maybe one day Jim but you’re right. I really felt like it was a little bit like The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II. They’re two pieces of the same epic story.

I’ve talked to a lot of authors and you get the sense that when they’ve written about something they may be forced to talk about it because they’re promoting it but they don’t want to go back to it. They are just done with it. But you apparently were not Amazon-ed out. You were not Bezos-ed out. You returned to it. What did you find so compelling about this story that you wanted to devote a whole lot of time to talking and writing more about it?

Mostly I was very proud of The Everything Store and I was talking about Amazon a lot and came to realize that it was all outdated. The company that I had written about in 2013 was a giant and was interesting but it had a $100 billion market cap with maybe 40000 or 50000 employees. Bezos was interesting but certainly wasn’t the most famous guy in business.

And that all shifted. The market cap zoomed to $1.5 trillion and Bezos became the richest person in the world and changed before our very eyes — physically his personal life the things that he was interested in. And when I started Amazon Unbound I certainly didn’t know that he was going to retire as CEO get divorced or further commit to his private space company Blue Origin. So the landscape was changing and I needed to update my history. And then really as I started to work on it I was just surprised by how good the story was.

I’ve written quite a few blog posts about The Everything Store. I just think it’s such an amazing story. Jeff Bezos could have had a fantastic career on Wall Street but he sees an opportunity and ends up in the basement of some other store in Seattle packing books by hand. It’s a great entrepreneurial story. And when people used to think about Jeff Bezos back then they thought of the guffawing laugh — he was really a charming character.

Now he’s depicted as Lex Luther. How did that happen?

I don’t know that I’m depicting him as Lex Luther but it’s funny because I have gotten that question: Is Bezos an evil villain?

Maybe we have to disassociate our generalized distaste for extraordinary wealth at a time of huge and worrying income inequality with the particulars of Bezos. He obviously gets criticized — and duly so — in my book and elsewhere for Amazon’s relationship with its employees the corporate culture and some of the pressures that it’s exerting on small businesses.

But I still feel like his intentions are good. He’s investing in opening space with his private space company Blue Origin because he feels like this is something that humanity will need generations from now. And he wants to start it same as Elon Musk. And for all of Amazon’s faults I don’t think I would have written two books if I didn’t generally believe that in the end it’s brought a lot of conveniences to our lives. It’s got a lot of things it needs to fix but it’s also managed to innovate at scale and obviously was a complete lifeline during the pandemic. So I don’t really think that it’s fair to call him a Lex Luther type.

I will say he can do a fairly poor job of evangelizing for his own interests — like at the recent space launch when he inadvertently thanked Amazon employees for paying for the whole thing. He’s unlike Elon Musk who manages to use his charisma to spin his followers into fans. Bezos just has a much harder time doing that. And as a result I think he’s easier to caricature.

And it seems like that caricature — which is obviously a function of the size of the company Bezos’s wealth and broader concerns about inequality — has caused a revisionist reframing. I remember that for a long time there were questions about whether Amazon was really a buyable business because they weren’t recording profits. People didn’t understand that strategy.

Now we look back at that strategy and say “Oh this is a predatory company that was not making money because it was undermining other companies and underpricing its product.” And that’s part of why I think people just always have been befuddled by the business strategy of this company. They thought it didn’t make sense and then they thought it made too much sense and represented this intentionally predatory approach to business.

Yeah that’s interesting. In my book I have this chapter that looks at how Amazon developed the ad business. And one of the interesting anecdotes there is how Bezos really pushed back on his retail business using advertising money to subsidize their unprofitability. He wanted the retail business to stand on its own. And this in a way runs counter to that narrative.

As for the fact that Amazon has lost money in some years and probably could be even more profitable than it is currently I think that speaks more to Bezos’s — and now Andy Jassy’s — interest in just funding new things. For example Amazon is going to spend $12 billion this year on Prime Video through licensing TV shows and movies as well as making their own. So Amazon’s profits go to this expansionist zeal — new industries new inventions things like Alexa whatever the new thing is that they’re going to launch. It’s not really from undercutting prices or pricing below competitors. Bezos wants those older Amazon businesses to stand on their own and be profitable. It’s a little bit more complex than “Amazon hides the ball to undercut competitors.”

Did Jeff Bezos think — and does current management think — that they have a PR problem? Certainly a lot of what you read about Amazon used to focus on pay issues. And now it’s about life inside the warehouses drivers not getting bathroom breaks all that stuff. But then you’ll look at customers’ brand ratings and Amazon scores very very high.

So does Amazon management think they have a problem? Or do they just think business reporters the media and politicians like to attack the company but actual customers and regular people think Amazon’s great?

That’s a good question. You know I would point to the last Bezos shareholder letter and some of the things that Andy Jassy has said recently. They’ve added a couple of principles to their 14 sacrosanct leadership values that they all study religiously. They talk about being more employee-centric and employee-focused and also about looking at some of the possible ramifications of their actions for society. To me that suggests a receptiveness to the criticism.

So I don’t think they’re fully in their shells of denial even if it’s sometimes their public posture to say “Okay sure people are going to criticize us. They just don’t understand.” I think that these recent changes and some of the recent rhetoric suggests that while the halo might still be over their heads given these brand surveys some of the criticism is going to accumulate and make people question whether they want to continue to support the company and click on the “buy now” button. So I do think that maybe some of the attempts to be a friendlier Amazon are in response to a criticism that they do see as a bit of an existential problem.

You mentioned Elon Musk earlier. He and Bezos are two very very wealthy individuals but with very different personalities. And the same goes for their space ambitions. You have Musk talking about being on Mars and being a multi-planetary civilization. Blue Origin’s mission statement is very different. It’s all about Earth creating a space economy and lowering our environmental footprint. It just seems far more rooted — maybe more customer-centric if you assume the customer is humanity. Any thoughts on that?

It’s really funny because in the short term the companies are direct competitors. Putting aside all the space tourism and suborbital flights we’ve seen over the past couple of weeks Blue Origin is competing and trying to catch up with SpaceX for contracts to send orbital rockets into space carry commercial and government satellites and take astronauts to the space station and then ultimately to the moon. And Blue Origin keeps losing those contracts and then protesting. That’s because New Glenn their rocket is years away from fruition and SpaceX has a complete collection of functioning rockets.

But the long-term goal is different. It’s like we have these different visions attributed to the two CEOs. Musk thinks that to ensure humanity’s survival we need to be a multi-planetary species. So he wants to go to Mars and set up a colony there. And Bezos simply thinks you might as well go to the North Pole because it’s going to be much more pleasant than Mars — you can actually breathe the air! So instead his long-term goal is to have huge space stations orbiting the earth comprised of material from the moon and harvesting the energy of the sun and that’s humanity’s future. It’s like we have these two science fiction geeks who read different books and have different visions.

Is Bezos in this for the long run? He may be behind now but is he going to keep putting resources towards Blue Origin and do what we can because this is his legacy?

We’re talking during a week in which Bezos wrote an open letter to the NASA administrator basically pledging $2 billion of his own money to cover the development of a moon lander because NASA only had the funding to go and award SpaceX the contract. So this guy is in it for the long term.

The question I think for people who are watching is “Should that money be deployed to more terrestrial philanthropic goals with a larger impact?” But for Bezos this is his dream. He gave his high school valedictorian speech about opening up the economy in space. This is what he’s going to do. So yes in his remaining time on this planet I expect him to be fully into Blue Origin and funding this goal. And look he basically just put his own life on the line to take the maiden crew voyage of the suborbital rocket New Shepherd. So I think he’s fully in it.

Is he as fully committed to The Washington Post?

I have no reason to think that he’s not. Right now he has put The Washington Post on firm footing. They’ve got a new editor. My understanding is it’s profitable a great subscription business. My only question is “Would he ever consider that his work is ‘done’ there and move on?” But I have no reason to believe it. I think that this has been successful for him and to some extent has probably burnished his image. He appears to really love living in Washington DC. He’s got a home there. So yeah I think he’s probably in that for the long term as well.

The book is called “Amazon Unbound.” But certainly here in Washington people see that as a problem — they believe it needs to be “bound.” Do you think the company perceives a real regulatory risk?

I mean definitely a risk. They’re realistic. They understand that the darts are aimed at them and that they will be coming from all sides — from Europe from the FTC from the state AGs and from Congress. But I think they’re ready for a fight.

And look breaking up a company — or even trying to reform a company — is a multi-year effort. You also have a conservative judiciary that just bounced back the FTC’s lawsuit against Facebook. And I think it’s really going to be difficult for regulators to make a case that Amazon has any kind of a monopoly considering that it competes in these really large diverse markets from retail to enterprise computing. And so I think in some ways they’re ready for battle and they realize it’s going to be a challenge. But they’re probably confident that despite the public rhetoric they’ve got some advantages in the fight.

Will the new CEO Andy Jassy be someone that people know? Will Jassy be like a Tim Cook-type of CEO where a lot of people know who he is?

I think so. I think the difference is that Cook could emerge from the shadow of Steve Jobs because unfortunately Jobs passed away. Whereas Bezos will be very much with us. And I expect stories about Amazon will still feature at least some Bezos smiling photos or laughing photos.

They’re going to try to bring Jassy out. He presents such a humbler target because he’s not the wealthiest guy in the world. He’s very down to earth and he’s quite an eloquent speaker. And he’s got an inspirational story starting at Amazon almost at the very beginning. So I do think they’ll try to introduce him to the world. And the question will be whether the media really focuses on Jassy if Bezos is still giving space press conferences and dipping in to launch Amazon products.

Do you think there’s going to be a third volume to finish out an Amazon trilogy? What do you think might be the themes in that trilogy?

Well I’m in recovery now from barely getting through volume two. I suppose in 10 years if the story is as good as it’s been Bezos has carved a whole new chapter the story of the regulatory pushback against Amazon and the other tech companies comes to some satisfying conclusion . . . yeah I would never rule it out. I’m not smart enough to have foreseen what Amazon became after I published The Everything Store so it’s hard to imagine where the story goes from here. But I’ll be watching it closely just like everybody else.

All right. So pencil it in: July 2031 back on this podcast.

Thank you Jim.

Yet recently I’ve found myself gravitating towards Amazon Prime Video when searching for someone to watch on lazy weekends.

No one is more surprised at this development than me. I’ve always viewed Prime Video as little more than a bonus that comes (essentially) free with a Prime subscription. My reason for paying a monthly fee to Amazon was always the express shipping Prime Video was a rarely used extra.

In the last few months my perspective has shifted and Prime Video has become a staple app on my television. I’m not even using it to watch flagship content offerings like The Boys. In fact I still haven’t finished the latest season of the violent superhero show as I was underwhelmed by its second outing (my editor tells me I should keep going).

I so rarely hear Prime Video mentioned when the topic of the best streaming services comes up (around Tom Guide's online HQ that's a more common conversation than you might expect). So I felt it was time to shine a spotlight on Amazon’s streamer and explain why I think it’s worth your monthly subscription – and your time if you already have it via Prime.

Prime Video has some of the best movies around

I’ve previously written about how movies make a streaming service for me. I’m seemingly in the minority on that. When it comes to streaming binge-able series tend to gain the most attention.

Nevertheless as a self-confessed movie buff if a service can offer me a constantly growing plethora of features worth watching then it will retain my subscription fee each month. Prime Video does just that.

Sure the service’s original content offering is regularly questionable. Although I will admit I found The Map of Tiny Perfect Things very endearing and I sort of enjoyed The Tomorrow War if only because I love anything that involves time travel. Though the less said about the likes of Jexi and After We Collided the better.

However Prime Video really excels in the movie department thanks to its practically unmatched collection of notable films from other studios. Awards fare like Parasite and 1917 were promptly added to the service last year and the entire Matrix trilogy was just recently made available ahead of The Matrix 4 releasing (admittedly on HBO Max) this winter.

Whenever I load up Prime Video there always seems to be something from a major studio worth watching. Whenever I boot up Netflix (in the UK) if there aren’t any new Netflix Originals added then you’re typically faced with a collection of movies usually found in the $1 DVD bin at Walmart.

If they don’t have it you can rent it

Another feature of Prime Video that I’ve come to really appreciate is alongside the service’s content library it offers the ability to rent just about any film in existence.

There are third-party services like JustWatch which will tell you where you can rent movies but the convenience on Prime Video of being able to search for a movie in the catalog and if it’s not available instantly buy or rent it cannot be overstated.

(Image credit: Lionsgate)

For example last weekend I wanted to watch Chaos Walking as I’ve read the book it’s based on. When I searched on Netflix it wasn't there. Instead I got a range of titles that Netflix deemed “related” from the vaguely connected like The Devil All the Time (Tom Holland is in both) to the completely unrelated television series Ginny & Georgia.

Whereas when I search on Prime Video I was informed the film wasn’t in the streaming catalog but for £1.99 I could rent it. An option I duly took. Then ultimately regretted when the movie turned out to be absolutely terrible — good job I only rented it.

Other streaming services like Apple TV Plus do offer the same feature allowing you to rent movies through iTunes but in my experience films are often cheaper on Prime. For example Choas Walking was £4.49 to rent through Apple and it’s definitely not worth that much.

The perfect supplemental service

Ultimately Amazon Prime Video probably works best as a supplemental service. I’m not suggesting that if you can only subscribe to a single service then it’s the one to pick — I’d probably still advise Netflix in that scenario. But for a solid starting point for those moments when you're looking to discover something or find a movie it's more than solid — it's reliable.

However Prime Video offers a lot more than it’s typically given credit for. So here’s to you Amazon Prime Video.

Some of the biggest Amazon aggregators Thrasio and Perch  have valuations in the billions of dollars. In July they were among the many companies in the space attending the Prosper Show  a popular conference for Amazon sellers.

Amazon aggregators are in the midst of a buying frenzy . They're trying to entice sellers who have successful brands on Amazon with incentives like Tesla giveaways and exclusive parties.

Performers entertain Amazon sellers at an exclusive after party thrown by Amazon aggregator Thrasio at The Bellagio in Las Vegas Nevada on July 14 2021.

""People giving away a Tesla just a lot of talk on the commissions if you're able to bring in a deal and just to be honest it's like the talk of the town"" said Casey Gauss a vice president at Thrasio which has raised $1.75 billion and acquired more than 125 Amazon brands since it was founded in 2018.

CNBC ranked Thrasio whose investors include Oaktree Capital and Upper90 Capital 22nd on the 2021 Disruptor 50 list.

Following the success of Thrasio and others the number of aggregators has grown rapidly in the past few months. There are now at least 69 Amazon aggregators based in at least 12 countries and they've raised more than $7 billion collectively since April 2020 according to Marketplace Pulse.

""Micro brands have been taking off for a long time and I think it's getting to this tipping point"" said Chris Bell who founded Perch in 2019. Perch has raised $900 million from investors including Spark Capital and Tectonic Ventures and acquired more than 70 brands.

Bell sees a few likely reasons why the momentum has picked up so dramatically.

""I think there was a confluence of Amazon's marketplace becoming more mature and kind of hardening if you will around the edges to make it more trusted"" he said. ""And then the pandemic and I think just a lot of people noticing that this was possible and coming after it.""

Aggregators give venture capitalists a foothold in the mom-and-pop world of Amazon sellers which until now has largely been dominated by individual entrepreneurs and brands. Usually the aggregator buys out the seller and then tries to boost sales with large-scale marketing and software solutions.

""The brands that we're acquiring they don't have experts in literally every kind of field that we are able to: from [search engine optimization] to copywriting and creative"" Gauss said. ""We're able to put all of these brands through this checklist and make sure that we're optimizing them far better than the average seller can.""

Some aggregators like Heyday are focused on a smaller number of acquisitions with high potential. Heyday has raised $250 million and acquired 16 brands. Backers include Desjardins Capital and Innovobot.

""We're not looking to acquire 100 brands"" said Chas Woodward head of business development at Heyday. ""We're looking to take our brands and 10x them. We think an attractive statistic is the ability to identify underwrite acquire and then truly drive growth and improvement to the brands that already exist.""

Amazon acknowledges that a new trend is underway but the company still sees a prominent role for the entrepreneur.

""We expect the majority of sellers and brands will remain independent and continue to use our store for its scale and reach"" an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.

Walton founded his company on the idea that retail could succeed by offering great value and great service. His competitors thought his idea was doomed to fail. Today almost sixty years later Walmart has transformed itself into a multinational corporate supergiant ranked as the largest company in the United States by gross sales in 2020 according to the Fortune 500.

Today the well-known multinational retail corporation is the world’s largest in terms of revenue and its largest private employer. Still owned and controlled by the Walton family Walmart has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1972.

In this article we’ll compare Walmart with its main digital rival Amazon and explore two unique AI use-cases deployed by Walmart today.

We’ve broken this article out into four sections:

Walmart vs. Amazon

Walmart’s Transition to eCommerce

Use-Case 1 – Item Substitutions for Grocery Orders

Use-Case 2 – Remote Fitting Rooms

Walmart vs. Amazon – A Comparison in Performance and AI Adoption

While Walmart holds the distinction of being the country’s largest company with 2020 revenues exceeding $559 billion Amazon its chief and up-and-coming rival is quickly closing in. Amazon’s 2020 revenues totaled $386 billion.

The firms differ significantly in terms of their growth. In 2010 Amazon’s revenue was $34.61 (under 10% of its 2020 revenue) and Walmart’s revenue was $404.74 (72% of its 2020 revenue). Hence Amazon’s market cap of $1.56 trillion (over 400% of revenue) compared to Walmart’s $382 billion (68% of revenue). But revenue growth is only one part of the market cap disparity – technology adoption and innovation is another.

In Bellevue Washington there’s a full-size grocery store where customers can “Just Walk Out.” From 7 AM to 10 PM every day you can grab fruits vegetables meats and prepared foods from its shelves go to the front of the store and skip the checkout line. Customers happily report saving time … and reducing contact with others.

The store isn’t a Walmart Supercenter. It’s an Amazon Fresh. The first Amazon Fresh opened in Bellevue Washington in August 2020. The chain has since grown to include fourteen additional locations in California Illinois Virginia and Washington DC.

Walmart’s grocery stores haven’t caught up. While Walmart offers self-checkouts pickup and delivery (and of course traditional staffed checkouts) the chain hasn’t yet brought all the innovations promised by computer vision deep learning and sensor fusion to its checkout process. Why?

In many ways Walmart’s brick-and-mortar birth in Arkansas in 1962 has lengthened its path to the AI world of the 21st century. Walmart for its part piloted its “Scan & Go” program in 125 stores in 2017 and 2018. When it canceled the program three years ago Walmart claimed that empowering customers to scan their own items via smartphones never really caught on.

Soon after at the 2019 National Retail Federation’s Big Show Walmart EVP and CTO Jeremy King went on to say that he was “really excited” for computer vision and what it promised in the “next couple of years.”

Fast forward to 2021 and Scan-and-Go is back available to Walmart+ members who pay the membership fee. While it’s a way of capitalizing on the promise of computer vision customers still have to scan each item with their smartphone’s camera. And that seems much less futuristic than say just walking out of a store with your account all settled.

Walmart’s Transition to eCommerce

Lagging Amazon in digital maturity Walmart is trying to put its nearly 60 years of brick-and-mortar success to work as it faces new decades and technologies.

Walmart has been a leading mass merchandiser of consumer goods for a really long time but its road to AI has not always been smooth. Now it’s starting to catch on to the value that AI can bring to its business model.

In its 10-K discussion about its strategic risks Walmart recognizes the potential pitfalls of failing to keep up with investments in technology and in failing to timely or effectively respond to consumer trends and preferences. Walmart clearly notes these exposures in its Risk 1A Risk Factors in its most recent 10-K.

“The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping” Walmart writes. “As a result the portion of total consumer expenditures … occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate.”

Spurred on by pandemic spending Walmart’s e-commerce sales grew by nearly 80% during 2020 a stat that bodes well for Amazon’s future digital investments. Walmart has made some visible investments into its digital future by exploring the innovations that AI brings to the mass merchandising consumer goods business. Below we explore the rivalry between Walmart and Amazon and two important AI-related initiatives at Walmart and the problems they solve for the chain’s customers.

Use-Case 1 – Item Substitutions for Grocery Orders

Many of us have been there. You place an order online for groceries. You submit the order and pay. Then when you arrive at the store for pick-up a store employee delivers the list of substitutions. Sometimes it’s just one brand of eggs for another. Once in a while you find out that you’re out of luck: you’ll be short taco shells for Tuesday night tacos.

Unexpected substitutions lead to a negative customer experience – and potentially lost revenue or market share (to competitors like Amazon) for Walmart.

Walmart wants to make it easier for its employees to decide on the right substitute when your requested item isn’t on the shelf — a timely innovation with surging demand for online grocery shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The decision on how to substitute is complex and highly personal to each customer. If the wrong choice is made it can negatively impact customer satisfaction and increase costs” wrote Srini Venkatesan Executive Vice President Walmart Global Tech in a June 24 2021 article for Walmart’s website.

Walmart claims that its item substitution solution incorporates deep-learning AI that evaluates hundreds of variables like:

Brand and price

Individual customer preferences

Current inventory levels

Aggregate shopper demand

The solution then communicates in real-time with the customer asking them to approve or reject the item substitution. If the customer turns the substitution down they are prompted to provide a reason. These data are then fed back into the solution’s dataset and used to inform its algorithms and improve future recommendations.

The solution also helps Walmart’s associates. Its AI delivers informed substitutions to Personal Shoppers as they navigate Walmart’s stores to complete shoppers’ orders and it also tells them just where to find the item in the store making their order fulfillment more efficient.

After implementing this AI-enabled substitution solution Walmart claims that customer acceptance of substitutions has increased to over 95%. We can estimate that this purported improvement of acceptance will help to improve Walmart’s customer satisfaction and help the firm to maintain market share. Walmart doesn’t list the before-and-after acceptance rate of substitutions.

Use-Case 2 – Remote Fitting Rooms

When you buy clothes online it’s hard to know how they’ll look and fit. Beyond that shoppers navigate the complexities of shipping charges and return policies. Even in a world where online interactions have moved recently to new and surprising facets of our lives the comfort of buying clothes in person has persisted if only because fitting rooms answer many of our concerns before we purchase new clothing.

For retailers returns of ill-fitting clothes can exert real downward pressure on otherwise healthy sales. Up to 40% of merchandise purchased online gets returned David Sobie co-founder and CEO of Happy Returns told CNBC in a 2019 interview. That means real money leaving Walmart’s P&L in reduced net sales as well as other processing and handling expenses that the retail giant must absorb.

Enter Walmart’s AI aspirations. In May Walmart announced plans to acquire Zeekit an Israeli company that makes the virtual trying-on of clothes a fun and social experience. When Zeekit’s solution goes live on Walmart.com customers will upload their photos choose a model that best represents their height body type and skin tone and then try on clothes virtually. The solution will also allow them to share their picture with friends—the equivalent of having a trusted advisor outside the fitting room door to deliver a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.

Zeekit’s short one-minute clip from their coverage on Good Morning America highlights the basic features and user experience of the app:

How does it work? The Zeekit tech breaks—into thousands of segments—both the image of the person and the clothing. It then recombines them to approximate what the clothing will look like when worn. The tech can also help shoppers visualize how different pieces of clothing will appear when paired.

As part of the acquisition Zeekit’s CEO CTO and VP of R&D will join the Walmart team bringing a wealth of AI computer vision and real-time image technology to the consumer goods giant.

Just two months post-announcement it’s too early to cite gains to Walmart’s customer satisfaction levels or its bottom line. However if remote fitting rooms can help build consumer confidence before they add an item to a cart that can go a long way to helping reduce returns and restocking expenses for retailers like Walmart."

He booked the conference room at the American Airlines Admirals Club for a pre-trip party. He went in early and got it decorated too. Most people don’t realize it’s possible to customize a celebration at the airport but Palcher was all over this. And he was taking advantage of a service American offers – that United and Delta do not.

This is brilliant on several levels

Admirals Club conference rooms are accessible to both club members and non-club members



Members can’t visit the club when they aren’t flying American but conference room guests can be traveling on any airline.



You don’t even have to be flying – the Admirals Club will write gate passes for meeting guests.



Geoffey’s fiancé Katie credit: Geoffrey Palcher

With the American Airlines premium co-brand that comes with lounge access (Citi Executive card) a cardmember can add up to 10 authorized users at no additional fee and everyone with a card can bring in two guests so if there’s room one person could potentially sponsor a group of 33 in an Admirals Club.

However as a one-off with people who aren’t members there’s nothing like inviting them into a private room in an airport that you can customize for your party. Here you’ll even see wine with the bottle procured from the Admirals Club bar.

Which Airlines Let You Rent Conference Rooms

United Airlines stopped taking conference room reservations in 2016. Spokesperson Jonathan Guerin tells me “The privacy (phone) booths replaced conference rooms in direct response to customers wanting more private spaces to take calls.”

Delta too converted its conference rooms to seating in its clubs and business meetings are not permitted there.

American Airlines though offers conference room rental at 13 locations: Boston; Washington National B and C clubs; Dallas – Fort Worth A B and C; Newark; Houston; Los Angeles terminal 4; New York LaGuardia; Miami D30; Chicago O’Hare H/K San Francisco. Pricing is:

$65 per hour for members ($90 for more than 10 people)



$85 per hour for non-members ($110 for more than 10 people)

Bookings can be made directly at the club or via Member Services (1-800-237-7971 Monday – Friday 8:00 a.m. – 6:30 p.m. Eastern) at least 24 hours in advance and providing names and dates of birth of guests. Payment is required at time of booking.

Once inside the lounge all of your non-club members flying or not can go get free drinks from the bar of course!

This is an under-advertised and under-appreciated opportunity that American Airlines provides and one that should be earning them some revenue if it was publicized better.

A Cost-Effective Way To Access A Club

An American Airlines Admirals Club day pass is $59 per person though it allows visits to multiple clubs on the same day. A family of 6 stuck at the airport would pay $354 to access the club without memberships. Renting a conference room in the club is cheaper and it even gives you private space not merely a license to hunt for a seat.

Use The Airline Lounge Even When You’re Not Flying That Carrier

United Delta and American have all placed restrictions on lounge access so that members can only access their respective clubs when they are flying that airline or eligible partners on the same day. American and Delta make an exception for lifetime club members. United does not – not even for Cleveland-based members who no longer even have a hub to make selecting United travel a viable option.

I can no longer use the American Airlines club in Austin for instance when I’m flying Southwest. Unfortunately the Austin club became so crowded (and the airline put off its investment in expanding the space into adjacent offices the airport no longer uses) that they converted their conference room into additional seating. They converted their entryway into additional seating too. And the club still was packed at peak times – before quadrupling the number of destinations they serve from the airport.

This doesn’t help me at my home airport but in cities where it’s an option you can rent a conference room in the club before your flight on another airline when your membership doesn’t give you access.

Meet Your Friends At The Gate When You Aren’t Flying

Gate passes are hard to come by these days. Some people will buy a ticket even when they don’t intend to fly just to get through security. (Then they’ll cancel the trip either for a refund or future travel credit.) That’s not exactly kosher but it’s not that uncommon either. Just don’t try this trick to access lounges Lufthansa won a judgment against someone who used their lounges this way when they weren’t really flying.

Getting an actual invitation that lets you through security is so much better! The only downside is that gate passes aren’t eligible for PreCheck so you have to clear regular security remove your shoes and take out your laptop.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRtei5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8wNy9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1waWxvdC1waG90by1zdWljaWRhbC1tb2xlc3RlZC_SAU9odHRwczovL2FtcC50bXouY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtcGlsb3QtcGhvdG8tc3VpY2lkYWwtbW9sZXN0ZWQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Pilot Upset His Photo Was Used in Story About Unhinged Pilot,"An American Airlines pilot is upset his photo was used in a story about a pilot who went off the rails during an announcement to passengers revealing he had been molested as a child.

The audio is alarming ... passengers listened as the pilot explained how his life spiraled out of control and how he became a sex addict with encounters with both men and women. It sounds like he's pushing religion in the audio but it's not clear. It's a deeply disturbing video ... a pilot seemingly unhinged on a plane full of passengers.

Several blogs posted the audio with a photo of a pilot ... a black bar covering a portion of his face. The American Airlines pilot in the photo is Rodrigo Ribeiro. It's clear to anyone who knows Rodrigo ... it's a photo of him. Problem is ... he was NOT the pilot who made the announcement.

American Airlines owns the photo which it had posted several years before celebrating Pride month.

Rodrigo was understandably upset ... being a pilot is a reputationally-based job ... in other words reputation is everything and if Rodrigo's fellow pilots and bosses think he was the one who made the announcement it could derail his career.

Rodrigo says he worked with American to help him get the photo removed from the blogs but it lingered there for days. People he knew were getting in touch with him asking if he was OK and if there was anything they could do to help him.

The photo was finally removed Saturday from at least one of the blogs and Rodrigo wants people to know -- it wasn't him on that audio.

American Airlines tells TMZ the pilot who made the announcement was in uniform but not flying the plane that day. The airline says he got on a mic and began speaking. The airline says the story was posted on a number of blogs and it has tried to get it taken down.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXRydWx5LWFubm95ZWQtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy10aGVuLWl0LW1hZGUtdGhpbmdzLXdvcnNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines truly annoyed passengers. Then it made things worse,"It may have taken off 12 hours late. But hey 30 minutes of TikTok. Screenshot by ZDNet

It's been uglier than a blobfish after one too many pints of lager.

Attempting to fly around America recently -- on more than one local airline -- has been akin to volunteering to eat only Cheetos in a windowless room for 10 consecutive days.

The champion perhaps has been Spirit Airlines which seems to have undergone a painful implosion.

In the same explosive discussion however is American Airlines. It's canceled hundreds of flights. It's claimed the weather has been severe in its inclemency. It's created thousands of unhappy customers. And that's just on Twitter.

I know this because one wrote: ""After being diverted to OKC my brother (and rest of the passengers) SAT ON THE PLANE for 12 hrs with NO food & no explanation! Flight finally made it to DFW to find not a single employee working. No idea of where bags are or how to get to his final destination. WTF @AmericanAir.""

And that was famed presidential associate Stormy Daniels.

I also know things were really bad because someone else opined: ""You can't blame the weather on everything. The system is collapsing on the passengers gate agents and pilots.""

This system this person said is ""antiquated."" And anyone with awareness of hardware and software systems will likely know that antiquation is not a good characteristic.

The person revealing the alleged system failures was Dennis Tajer spokesman for American Airlines' pilots union. You'd think he might know something about what's happening.

At times like this it's worth focusing entirely on mollifying your customers telling them how you might offer them compensation even promising that you'll introduce new systems that will make things better in the future.

Less wise perhaps is crowing about something that is -- for some -- marginally exciting and then the fine print reveals that it's not so exciting at all. (Which some might describe the airline ticket-buying experience over the last 18 months.)

You see in the midst of the mayhem the tears the promises never to fly American Airlines again the airline offered a press release last Monday.

Its headline clutched at excitement with the tightness of a man who's slipped over a cliff and is being held from the depths by our movie's hero: ""American Airlines Takes TikTok to New Heights with Free Inflight Access for Customers.""

The subhead made it even better: ""Only on American.""

Wow I hear at least three of you cry. This is good. This is cool. This is well something. And the kids all love TikTok right?

This was my initial reaction too. Sadly I made the error of reading further.

First there was the quite large proviso that the free TikTok would only be available on narrowbody planes equipped with Viasat Wi-Fi.

My optimism narrowed but still throbbed for those passengers who are on such planes and appreciate what American calls ""an entertainment platform powered by a global community of creatives."" (And there you were thinking TikTok was just a lot of questionable dancing videos and exposés of bad conditions in fast-food restaurants.)

But then I read the painfully defining print. This exciting offer actually gives you a mere 30 minutes of free TikTok. After that you have to pay for the wifi which as so many travelers have learned costs actual money.

It's understandable that this is a promotion. I fear however it feels like a promotion that tries to get kids to pester their parents to pay for wifi. Because who can go to TikTok and only stay for half an hour?

Perhaps in more pleasant flying times such an announcement may have earned a ripple of favor. Sometimes though it's worth withholding your excessive excitement -- and your press release -- until your customers stop screaming at you for wrecking their trips their last nerves and costing them in some cases a lot of money.

A lot of wonderful people work for American. Many especially gate agents and flight attendants are having to deal with hellbound passengers every day. Many say it's far worse than it's ever been. To then undergo entirely uncooperative weather and computer systems seems the height of cruelty.

So I wonder how many over the last week encountered passengers delightedly thanking them for 30 minutes of free TikTok.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5YnJlZXplLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzA4L3RoZS1vZmZzcHJpbmctYW5kLXRoZS1tYWluZS1wYXJ0eS13aXRoLWNoYXJnZXJzLWZhbnMtb3V0c2lkZS1zb2ZpLXN0YWRpdW0v0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlicmVlemUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDgvdGhlLW9mZnNwcmluZy1hbmQtdGhlLW1haW5lLXBhcnR5LXdpdGgtY2hhcmdlcnMtZmFucy1vdXRzaWRlLXNvZmktc3RhZGl1bS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Offspring and The Maine party with Chargers fans outside SoFi Stadium,"The afternoon of Sunday Aug. 8 was special for Orange County rock band The Offspring. It was the band’s first live show since March 15 2020 and the opportunity to debut new music off of its long-awaited 10th studio album “Let the Bad Times Roll” which was released April 16.

“I’m trying to censor myself because I want to cuss out of pure joy … that was the first time we ever played that song live!” guitarist Kevin “Noodles” Wasserman said after ripping through the new album’s title track in front of a few thousand enthusiastic fans in the American Airlines Plaza just outside SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.

The band played a free show as part of iHeartMedia Los Angeles’ ALT 98.7 FM and the Los Angeles Chargers FanFest at the stadium. Though the show was free — and hosted by the station’s “The Woody Show” and featured DJ Scotty Fox in between sets — fans did have to sign up in advance for tickets to keep the attendance limited. Masks were not mandatory though numerous patrons still sported them.

“This is so exciting” Lisa Worden vice president of rock and alternative for iHeartMedia and program director for ALT 98.7 FM said. “I didn’t know what I’d be walking into today like are people going to show up? It feels really good. I was in my office and talking to Woody and some of the team and we were like ‘Should we do a party for people?’ Granted we planned this before the Delta variant was raging but we thought we could still do it and people are here and they’re masked up. I think both of these bands are going to be amazing and they both want to be safe and take precautions but I think they’re so stoked to be here.”

The Offspring’s set was pretty much all killer no filler with hits coming fast and furious from a band that was clearly ready to face the masses once again. The set kicked off with “Self Esteem” and moved into “Come Out and Play” with vocalist Dexter Holland’s voice in peak form. “All I Want” got the crowd stirring and mini mosh pits of three or four people broke out. The band dusted off “Original Prankster” and of course hit everyone with “Bad Habit” to give the audience the chance to blow off some pent-up energy by screaming out a series of curse words in the song.

Offspring also offered “The Opioid Diaries” off the new album and Noodles was able to showcase his chops by playing a warp speed version of Edvard Grieg’s classical song “In the Hall of the Mountain King” on guitar. They finished off the set with “Why Don’t You Get a Job?” “Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)” and Noodles donned a personalized Chargers’ jersey for the encore which included “You’re Gonna Go Far Kid” and “The Kids Aren’t Alright.”

There’s been a shakeup more recently in the Offspring line-up with longtime bassist Greg Kriesel out and touring guitarist Todd Morse stepping in. On Sunday Vandals’ drummer Josh Freese was a last-minute replacement for Pete Parada who announced a mutual parting of ways on social media on Aug. 2 after Parada said he decided against getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

Sunday’s opening act Arizona rock band The Maine had a lot of fun with the crowd. The group which played as part of the Sad Summer Fest at City National Grove of Anaheim on Saturday performed a couple tracks off its new album “XOXO: From Love and Anxiety in Real Time” including “Sticky” and “Pretender.” They also did their hit “Black Butterflies and Déjà Vu” and a fun Rihanna cover.

The band was so energetic and got the people most of which had no idea who they were dancing and participating in the set. The biggest moment came when a flying beetle crash landed on stage and wound up in vocalist John O’Callaghan’s hand. He jokingly said he would eat it if someone dared him and then handed off to an audience member who proceeded to eat the bug to a roar of cheers that ended in “ewwwwwws.”

“I’m a vegetarian so I wasn’t about to eat that thing” he said during an interview after the show noting it will be a moment he’ll never forget. “One single tear fell down my face when he ate it. as if this entire atmosphere wasn’t crazy enough … that was wild.”

The Maine has been a band for 15 years but is just now starting to enjoy some more mainstream success. O’Callaghan and bassist Garrett Nickelsen said it was an honor to get to open for The Offspring.

“I am pumped and was kind of geeking out over their setlist” O’Callaghan said.

“We woke up at 10 a.m. to sound check and I hear a kick drum and I run over there and all of their stuff was up and the set list was up and I was like ‘John look what they’re playing’” Nickelsen said. “Like every song is a hit!”

Coming out of lockdown and heading back out on tour is exciting the guys said but things are different. They’re not able to go and meet the fans face to face and are gauging excitement over the new material based on audience reaction alone.

“This feels completely normal but also since we’ve been adults we haven’t really had that amount of time at home ever” Nickelsen said. “We started touring when we were 17 and having been at home for almost two years without doing a show was crazy. But as soon as you get on the bus it’s like ‘Oh this smells the same. Everybody stinks!’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1pbnRyb2R1Y2luZy1uZXctNDkwMDAwLW1pbGUtb25lLXdheS1hd2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Introducing New 490000 Mile One-Way Award,"American Airlines has a new unpublished award chart level for flights between the U.S. and China now charging as much as 490000 miles one-way for a redemption This includes American Airlines flights to Hong Kong as well.

American AAdvantage says they’re planning to eliminate award charts. It’s the one thing left still separating the program from strong value and the abyss which has already swallowed up the Delta SkyMiles and United MileagePlus programs.

The real value is in partner award charts . Partner awards are only available at the ‘saver’ or lowest award level. Even though Delta and United only offer that saver inventory to members they devalue their partner pricing frequently without award charts. Opaque pricing means the destruction of member value.

For American’s own flights they often offer the lowest points prices at the revenue-based ‘web special’ level which doesn’t allow changes. Those prices vary tremendously and get quite granular. However they still have a saver award chart and an ‘Anytime’ chart where you can spend points even for the last available seat on the plane.

The US Airways takeover of American was the end of the double miles award where last seat availability cost twice the price of a saver redemption. That was part of the April 8th massAAcre.

The award chart for American Airlines flights now has multiple levels though they only publish levels one and two and mention that “there are select dates that require a higher number of miles (in addition to Level 1 and 2 awards).” I’ve written about 5 anytime award price levels in the past.

For flights between the U.S. and China and Hong Kong they’ve now introduced a new most-expensive 6th anytime award price level. As with other similar awards employees get a 20% discount on these redemptions just as they’re eligible for ‘AA20’ pricing on revenue fares.

At level 6 American now charges as much as 490000 miles one way according to an internatl reference document:

In practice because of web saver awards you’ll almost never see pricing reach exactly this level – but inflexible award pricing will come close:

American is at least modest in their representations of first class asking just 10000 miles more than business class for a questionable product at best.

Still at prices like these you might as well swim."

The firm’s disclosure came in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Trump administration agreed to buy 110 million doses of vaccine from Novavax as part of its crash vaccine development program.

Although the company reported in June that its vaccine had an efficacy of 90 percent against symptomatic Covid-19 cases and 100 percent against severe disease Novavax has struggled for months to mass manufacture its product. Its vaccine has not been authorized for distribution in the United States and federal officials said it is unclear when or if it will be.

London CNN Business —

When investors purchase a stock what they’re doing is buying a percentage of the company. Right?

Wrong! At least when it comes to many of the Chinese companies listed on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.

That’s because Chinese companies use a structure called a variable interest entity or VIE in order to raise money from foreign investors.

What’s a VIE? The structure uses two entities. The first is a shell company based somewhere outside China usually the Cayman Islands. The second is a Chinese company that holds the licenses needed to do business in the country. The two entities are connected via a series of contracts.

When foreign investors buy shares in a company that uses a VIE they’re purchasing stock in the foreign shell company — not the business in China.

For example when US investors buy shares in Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi which went public in June on the New York Stock Exchange what they’re actually doing is buying stock in a Cayman Islands company called Didi Global.

Didi Global doesn’t own the business in China that connects riders to drivers. But it does have contracts in place that entitle its shareholders to the economic benefits produced by that business.

The upshot: When Americans fire up their trading app and buy shares in Didi they are not getting a direct equity stake in the Chinese company. This arrangement is explained in Didi’s prospectus but not everyone is aware. Alibaba Pinduoduo and JD.com also use VIEs to name a few.

Why use a VIE?

Chinese firms have been using the structure for decades because foreign investors are not really allowed to own stakes in local firms in industries including tech. Still Chinese companies want to raise money abroad.

Creating an offshore holding company that goes public helps Chinese companies get around those rules. Wall Street and US regulators have long been cool with the arrangement which gives American investors easy exposure to dynamic companies that are powering the world’s second largest economy.

But there are huge risks. First it’s not clear that the contracts that entitle foreign investors to the economic benefits produced by Chinese companies are enforceable. It’s also not clear whether VIEs are legal under Chinese law.

Here’s what Didi says about the arrangement: Didi says in its prospectus that its legal counsel believes that its VIE “is not in violation of mandatory provisions of applicable PRC [Chinese] laws” and that its contracts are “valid and binding.”

But it also included a warning to potential investors.

“We have been further advised by our PRC legal counsel that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future PRC laws and regulations” Didi cautioned. “The PRC government may ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel.”

Think about the problem this way: Chinese companies are essentially telling Beijing that they are 100% owned by Chinese citizens. Meanwhile the same companies are telling foreign shareholders that they’re the real owners.

After decades of both Chinese and US regulators taking a relaxed approach there are signs that both are becoming uncomfortable with VIEs.

Hello regulators: US Securities and Exchange Commission boss Gary Gensler announced new disclosure rules on July 30 targeting VIEs saying Chinese companies need to be clearer with US investors about the risks.

“I worry that average investors may not realize that they hold stock in a shell company rather than a China-based operating company” he said.

One of the new SEC provisions will require Chinese companies to disclose “whether the operating company and the issuer when applicable received or were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on US exchanges.”

That provision appears to be aimed at Didi. Just days after its massive IPO Chinese regulators targeted the company with a cybersecurity investigation after it reportedly went ahead with the listing despite Beijing’s objections.

“I believe these changes will enhance the overall quality of disclosure in registration statements of offshore issuers that have affiliations with China-based operating companies” Gensler said.

China is also taking a closer look at foreign listings. The powerful Cyberspace Administration of China proposed in July that any company with data on more than 1 million users must seek the agency’s approval before listing its shares overseas.

Investors beware.

Biden’s electric vehicle sales goal won’t be too hard to reach

President Joe Biden announced an agreement last week that aims to push the US auto industry to sell more electric vehicles. The goals include a “shared aspiration” that 40% to 50% of vehicles sold in the US will be electric plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered.

This will be a challenge some experts say — but it isn’t really as hard as it might seem reports my colleague Peter Valdes-Dapena.

Battery-powered vehicle sales including both all-electric and plug-in hybrids are expected to make up just 4.3% of all vehicles sold in the US this year according to IHS Markit.

General Motors (GM) said months ago it hopes to sell only zero-emission vehicles including electric and hydrogen-powered by 2035. It could be expected then that at least 40% of its vehicle sales should be emissions-free by 2030. Stellantis the company that owns the Dodge Chrysler and Jeep brands also recently said it planned for 40% of its US sales to be either electric or plug-in hybrid by the end of 2025 well ahead of the goal set by the Biden administration. Ford has also already announced that 40% of the vehicles it sells globally will be electric by 2030.

Automakers have been setting these goals for a number of reasons. Regulations are already changing in other parts of the world such as in Europe where there are plans to ban internal combustion vehicles by 2035. Consumer tastes are also changing – as the increasing popularity of Tesla (TSLA) has shown said Jessica Caldwell an industry analyst with Edmunds.

“No one really wants to be seen as the holdout or the dinosaur the one that’s fighting this progress” she said.

So will Poland. But a men’s team from the United States birthplace of basketball and winner of 15 of 19 men’s gold medals in the traditional five-on-five game will not.

The Americans were eliminated from a qualifying tournament in Austria on Sunday 21-16 by the Netherlands.

How did this happen?

One clue is the American men’s roster. It consisted of Dominique Jones Robbie Hummel Kareem Maddox and Joey King. All were capable college players. All have honed their games in three-on-three play for several years in preparation for the Games. But they hardly represent the best players the U.S. could offer.

Several factors prevented the U.S. from rolling out a threesome like LeBron James Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant. For one the best N.B.A. players are currently in the middle of the playoffs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcva2V2aW4tZHVyYW50LXRlYW0tdXNhLW9seW1waWMtY2hhbXBpb25zL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcva2V2aW4tZHVyYW50LXRlYW0tdXNhLW9seW1waWMtY2hhbXBpb25zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kiszla: Kevin Durant scores 29 points in Olympic championship game then scoffs at suggestion world has caught up with American basketball. “Come on man … This skill is unmatched you dig?”,"SAITAMA Japan — Down the hall from where the old man of USA basketball choked back tears Draymond Green cranked up the volume on a rant directed at every American critic who worried for one second about this team beating France for the Olympic gold medal.

“A lot of doubters. You turn on America sports talk TV whatever and you got guys like (ESPN analyst and former NBA player) Kendrick Perkins doubting us. Somebody needs to teach these people some loyalty. How about you cheer for your country?” Green said Saturday after his teammates got out of the way and let Kevin Durant carry them to an 87-82 victory in the championship game.

“When guys don’t play (for the USA) it’s: ‘Oh you need to go represent the country.’ And then you lose hit a little bump in the road and everybody’s like “Oh (other international teams have) caught America.’ You’re an American too. Act like it.”

The tirade was Dray being Dray. The same passionate heart that makes Green a special player also fuels his big mouth’s roar. So it’s no surprise he’s making a list of haters that predicted U.S. failure.

“You better be sure that you’re right. And a lot of people got it wrong” Green said. “Trust me … I’ll be posting everybody who said something. Nobody holds anybody accountable anymore. But I will.”

It was a good day for American basketball. Whenever France threatened Durant had an answer. The leading scorer in U.S. Olympic history dazzled with 29 points.

“I’m pretty emotional over the whole thing” said USA Basketball general manager Jerry Colangelo his voice cracking with emotion when I stopped him on his way to a champagne celebration.

We can still shoot hoops in the USA but the dynasty has seen better days. There will be more great nights and medals down the road. But the world is catching up. The party’s over. Let’s raise a toast to the once and (future?) kings of the court.

“We represent the country well” said Colangelo who is retiring after a glorious time that saw American men win gold at the Summer Games four times in a row.

At age 81 he has been the chief recruiter of players and coaches for the Olympic squad for so long he recalls meeting Durant for the first time when he was a skinny freshman at the University of Texas. Colangelo also knows when Team USA isn’t dominating the moaning from every corner of the country is intense.

Standing in a back hallway of Saitama Super Arena grateful for one more piece of gold as a farewell gift he recalled the tough early days of Mike Krzyzewski’s stint as coach when young Nuggets forward Carmelo Anthony’s 25 points weren’t sufficient to prevent an embarrassing 101-95 loss to Greece at the 2006 FIBA world championships on this very same court in Japan.

“The first time I walked in this arena a week or so ago it brought back all those memories of ’06” said Colangelo who definitely did not enjoy the feeling of deja vu. “I got that monkey off my back.”

The weakness of basketball in America at the moment is as big as a crater. There’s a hole in the middle of the paint.

Amid a renaissance of multi-dimensional centers around the globe from our friend Nikola Jokic of Serbia to Joel Embiid from Cameroon I’m afraid not too many big guys in the USA give a hoot about post play. When the Americans struggled this summer losing exhibitions in Las Vegas to Nigeria and Australia as well as their clunker against France in the opener of the Olympic tourney it was often due to a lack of rim protection and an over-reliance on outside shooting.

OK let me also add: Gold is great. Can’t do better than first place.

“Everybody who said we were going to take the L . . . They had some power rankings out. They had us fourth behind Slovenia. Come on man” Durant said referring to the FIBA power rankings that put Team USA behind Slovenia France and Australia in medal projections. “Talking about they’re catching up to us like are you serious? This skill is unmatched you dig?”

But a serious perhaps even seismic shake-up in the power structure of USA basketball is rumbling in the distance.

At age 36 LeBron James is done putting on a red white and blue uniform. Steph Curry and James Harden both on the wrong side of their 30th birthdays would seem to be unlikely participants in the 2024 Summer Games only three summers away. Now 72 years old the act of coach Gregg Popovich as everyone’s favorite irascible uncle is running out Pop of vinegar.

The future of USA Basketball is about to be placed in the hands of Devin Booker Ja Morant and Zion Williamson. Are they ready willing and able to deal with the unrelenting expectation for American exceptionalism on the court?

Former NBA star Grant Hill who fell in love with hoops as a kid watching the 1984 Olympics is taking the reigns from Colangelo who had extensive administrative experience with the Phoenix Suns prior to tackling one of the more thankless chores in American sports.

“I’m available to Grant anytime he wants to talk” Colangelo said.

You can bet the advice will begin and end with three words:

It has the best players always has always will. But Team USA is not the most well-oiled well-tuned and synchronized machine in the international game. It is not and for a host of reasons.

Saturday night Team USA defeated France 87-82 to win the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics. The victory was expected in this hemisphere of the globe and truth be told it wasn’t exactly a shocker on other continents. Any team led by Kevin Durant with Jayson Tatum coming off the bench is among the most formidable in the world.

Yet expectations should not overshadow their accomplishment. I would submit that these men some of them household names embodied everything anyone could desire in an Olympic athlete.

Playing for no compensation they put on Red White & Blue uniforms that come with huge targets sewn on their backs. They came together to represent their country and this they did to the best of their ability. They embodied the highest level of individual resolve collective national spirit and soaring athletic achievement.

They kept the basketball gold where it belongs.

After the final horn Durant beamed with relief and joy and draped the flag over his shoulders. In that moment he looked like any 5-foot gymnast or Speedo-clad swimmer or muscle-ripped sprinter who’d beaten the world on the sport’s biggest stage.

But there is a difference. Durant now the greatest U.S. international basketball player of all time (think about that for a second) was on a stage that is relatively smaller for him and for NBA fans who might tune in for the gold-medal game every four years. But for most of the rest of the world the Olympics are the biggest stage. Full stop.

As Slovenian star Luka Doncic said last month he’d rather lead his country to Olympic gold than carry the Dallas Mavericks to a Larry O’Brien trophy. Doncic is one of 41 internationals in the NBA and most every one of them thinks just like Doncic.

Ask Nikola Jokic of Serbia the reigning league MVP or Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece who has won two MVPs and an NBA title and they would say the same thing. Oh the Greek Freak might hedge a little but if given truth serum he’d admit that bringing Olympic basketball glory to Greece rates ahead of delivering a Larry O’Brien trophy to Milwaukee.

In the rest of the world national federations play a long game to achieve this ultimate goal. France is a good example.

The Bleu Blanc et Rouge have eight players on their roster with NBA experience including five players who are currently active in the world’s greatest club league. The combined NBA experience of the French (39 years) does not equal the combined experience of Team USA’s starters (42 years) but — unlike Team USA — this French team has been playing together in international tournaments since they were teenagers.

The same is true for Australia Spain Slovenia and Argentina among other national powers in a game played worldwide. One can argue that these countries have better teams if not better players than Team USA. I would argue that this is certainly the case with France Australia and maybe Spain. They may not have the same depth of talent as the U.S. but they make up for it with a chemistry that has been mixed through a generation and they play beautiful basketball.

At the last FIBA World Cup Spain beat Argentina in the final. Team USA lost to France in the quarterfinals and finished seventh the worst international showing ever for the Americans. Coach Gregg Popovich was pilloried.

Two weeks ago after Team USA lost to France in the first game of the group stage of the Olympic tournament Popovich was written off as a man who didn’t know what he was doing when it came to the international game. His association with the disaster of 2004 — he was an assistant to Larry Brown when Team USA’s global hegemony was deflated with a bronze medal at the Athens Games — was dredged up as supporting evidence.

Popovich’s problem is Team USA’s problem: cobbling together a team virtually at the last minute and satisfying America’s huge expectations. LeBron James Stephen Curry and James Harden — the last U.S.-born player to win an NBA MVP — turned down their invitations. Jrue Holiday Khris Middleton and Devin Booker basically flew in from the NBA Finals and barely had time to dress before they got whacked by France in the preliminary round.

Somehow Popovich got the team together. They didn’t lose again. They avenged their loss(es) to France and won gold. If it wasn’t exactly an upset it certainly wasn’t a given either.

Props to Durant who embraced the task and was equal to the moment. Props to Bam Adebayo Booker Jerami Grant Draymond Green Holiday Keldon Johnson Zach LaVine Damian Lillard JaVale McGee Middleton and Tatum.

Since 1936 when basketball was introduced to the Olympic Games Team USA is 143-6 with 16 gold medals a silver and two bronzes. The 12 men who represented us in Tokyo upheld a tradition that is becoming more onerous as basketball talent has diffused throughout the world. Their achievement is Olympian.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIxLzA4LzA3L3NhbmRlci1sZXZpbi1jYXJlZXIvMjUyNjAyOTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Career of U.S. Rep.

A historical look,"What’s the tallest building in Cincinnati?

Since 2011 the answer has been the Great American Tower. Before that Carew Tower held that distinction for more than 80 years. What about the other buildings that at one time have been the Queen City’s tallest?

Tallest spire

Dedicated in 1845 St. Peter in Chains Cathedral on Plum Street is the second-oldest church building in Cincinnati four years younger than Old St. Mary’s in Over-the-Rhine. The Greek Revival-style church with Corinthian columns is an unusual design for a Catholic cathedral.

Though its octagonal spire is what made it stand above all others. The spire telescopes to a height of 225 feet with a cross at the tip the tallest point in the city for many years.

In 1876 Cincinnati Commercial reporter Lafcadio Hearn wrote about accompanying a steeplejack to climb to the top of the spire. Hearn had poor vision but used a spyglass to describe for readers what he could see from the cross at the top “225 feet above terra firma.”

Burnham buildings

Acclaimed Chicago architect Daniel Burnham designed two buildings on Fourth Street that each held the title for a few years.

The Bartlett Building formerly the Union Trade Building and now the Renaissance Cincinnati Downtown Hotel on the north side of Fourth Street at Walnut was dedicated in 1901. At 252 feet tall the 19-story building was the tallest for three years.

Then Burnham’s Clopay Building now the Fourth & Walnut Center was erected across the street in 1904 reaching 255 feet topping the Barlett by three feet.

Distinctive skyline

When Union Central Tower was built in 1913 it was not only the tallest building in Cincinnati at 495 feet but the fifth tallest in the U.S. at the time. The distinctive design by architect Cass Gilbert with Hellenistic architecture and a peak inspired by the ancient Mausoleum at Halicarnassus made it one of the most recognizable buildings in the city skyline. It was featured in the introduction of Procter & Gamble’s soap opera “The Edge of Night.”

The name has changed many times – Central Trust Bank Building PNC Tower and now is officially Fourth and Vine Tower. It is still the third tallest building in Cincinnati.

Tallest for 81 years

The monumental Carew Tower has defined Cincinnati since it was constructed in 1930. Built in just one year the art deco landmark was a remarkable achievement of construction during the Great Depression. It was one of the first mixed-use buildings with office space retail space and a hotel – the Netherlands Plaza Hotel – and was an inspiration for Rockefeller Center in New York City.

At 574 feet tall Carew Tower stood well above all other buildings allowing for stunning panoramic views of Cincinnati from its 49th floor observation deck.

Developer John J. Emery named Carew Tower for the Carew Building built by Mabley & Carew partner J.T. Carew that had been on the site previously.

Takes the crown

By unwritten rule nothing was built in Cincinnati to be taller than Carew Tower until Great American Tower took the crown – or is that tiara? – in 2011. At 665 feet it features a headdress that architect Gyo Obata designed based on one of Princess Diana’s tiaras. Despite some reticence about a building topping Carew Tower’s record height Great American Tower has become another iconic shape of the Queen City.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8wNy91cy92ZXNzZWwtaHVkc29uLXlhcmRzLXN1aWNpZGUtd2VsbG5lc3MvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBSmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvdXMvdmVzc2VsLWh1ZHNvbi15YXJkcy1zdWljaWRlLXdlbGxuZXNz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After latest suicide the Vessel in New York City's Hudson Yards ponders its future,"CNN —

In a December 2016 article for The Architect’s Newspaper journalist Audrey Wachs noted a glaring issue with the Vessel the 150-foot-tall tourist attraction that was set to open in New York City’s gleaming new Hudson Yards neighborhood.

“As one climbs up Vessel the railings stay just above waist height all the way up to the structure’s top” she wrote “but when you build high folks will jump.”

That warning has proved tragically prescient. Last week a 14-year-old died by suicide at the climbable structure – the fourth such fatal incident since the landmark opened to the public in March 2019.

“We are heartbroken by this tragedy and our thoughts are with the family of the young person who lost their life” Hudson Yards spokesperson Kimberly Winston said in a statement. “We are conducting a full investigation. The Vessel is currently closed.”

It’s the second time the Vessel has closed due to suicides. In January after the third death the Vessel closed for several months and reopened in May with new safety measures in place including increased security a buddy system and signs about mental health resources.

Now the Vessel’s future as the Instagrammable centerpiece of the largest development in Manhattan since Rockefeller Center is in limbo. Can it be saved?

Its corporate backers will certainly try. Heatherwick Studio which designed the Vessel said in a statement it was working with Related Companies the real estate firm run by billionaire Stephen M. Ross on finding “physical” solutions to the issue.

“Working with our partners at Related the team exhaustively explored physical solutions that would increase safety and they require further rigorous tests and while we have not identified one yet we continue to work to identify a solution that is feasible in terms of engineering and installation” the studio’s spokesperson said.

Raising the barriers several feet higher would be one such solution. Indeed physical barriers or netting have long been used to try to prevent such tragedies at high-standing structures. The Golden Gate Bridge in California where more than a thousand people have died by suicide over the years is installing nets to minimize fatal injuries; the George Washington Bridge did something similar several years ago.

Still adding a simple physical barrier or net addresses only part of the Vessel’s problem.

The central point of architecture and design is that the constructed environment influences how we feel and act. And the Vessel – surrounded on all sides by concrete glass skyscrapers and crass commercialism – has a more fundamental issue according to Jacob Alspector a distinguished lecturer at the Spitzer School of Architecture at The City College of New York.

“The Vessel is like some MC Escher nightmare” he said referring to the famed graphic artist known for his staircases to nowhere. “It’s kind of relentless. It’s very gaudy it’s very cold. It’s thrilling … It’s not the most friendly and life-affirming and inclusive kind of space or structure. It’s kind of empty. What’s the point of it? Just to walk up and walk down?”

He added: “People who feel alienated with the world may not be supported very well by an experience like that.”

How architects and designers try to prevent suicides

Alspector knows this challenge firsthand.

More than a decade ago he oversaw the renovations of New York University’s Bobst Library less than two miles from where the Vessel sits which had a similar problem.

In 2003 two students jumped to their death in the library’s open atrium. The school then installed an 8-foot-tall plexiglass barrier to prevent such incidents but another student managed to climb over that barrier and jump to his death in 2009. NYU wanted to solve the problem once and for all.

The solution debuted in 2012 was the Bobst Pixel Veil – a series of laser-cut aluminum panels that enclosed the space but also allowed sunlight to shine through in an intricate pattern.

“It’s an example of making something a positive thing rather than a barrier thing” Alspector told CNN. “The trick is to transform something to make it seem like you’re not in a cage.”

Wachs the journalist who warned about the Vessel in 2016 specifically cited the deaths at the library as an example of what might go wrong. Stephen Ross and Heatherwick she wrote at the time “seem not to have learned from Bobst or from the city’s bridges and iconic tall buildings.”

Toronto’s Bloor Viaduct provides another relevant example of one possible solution. Hundreds of people had died by suicide at the viaduct so local leaders in 2003 commissioned the installation of the Luminous Veil – a barrier made up of thin steel rods that also light up in bright colors.

“It is designed both as a deterrent to suicide and as a kinesthetic field of reflection” according to architecture and design platform RVTR.

Dr. Mark Sinyor a psychiatrist and suicide prevention expert at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre studied the impact of the barrier in 2010 and again in 2017 and uncovered an unusual result.

As expected the Luminous Veil worked as designed and stopped suicides at the Bloor Viaduct. However the 2010 study found that in the first few years after the barrier was installed the rate of deaths by jumping across Toronto remained unchanged suggesting the suicides simply moved elsewhere. However the 2017 study found that in the long-term suicides by jumping had declined across the city with no associated increase in suicide by other means.

“When you limit people’s access to lethal methods you see fewer deaths in an area” Sinyor said. “That is because people who are suicidal ultimately can find other ways of coping if in the moment a means of death is not readily available.”

Taken together the studies show that preventing suicide is about more than just a barrier at a single location Sinyor told CNN. In particular he criticized the media coverage at the time that pushed the harmful myth that suicidal people aren’t worth saving.

“The lesson of the Bloor Viaduct is that a suicide prevention barrier is a component of an effective suicide prevention program but needs to be paired with safe public messaging” Sinyor said.

“Suicide never has to happen” he added. “It is preventable. And people who are struggling should seek help because help is out there.”

The Vessel has a deeper issue

Safe public messaging was a key part of the Vessel’s plan when it reopened in May with new safety measures. Rather than making physical changes the Vessel charged a $10 fee for entry required people to come with another person hired staff and security to watch for distress and set up signs informing visitors how to get help.

Last week’s tragedy showed the flaw in that plan without a physical barrier. The 14-year-old victim had been with his family when he died authorities told CNN affiliate WCBS.

Lowell Kern the chairman of the advisory Manhattan Community Board Four told CNN that raising the height of the barriers was the “obvious” solution.

How to get help: In the US call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.

“There is no reason to have a 4-foot high barrier that’s easy for someone to get over either impulsively or planned. In terms of aesthetic it seems to me that’s an easy solution” he said.

Related Companies did not do so though – and the fatal incidents since confirmed his worst fears. “I’ve never been so unhappy to be proven right” he said.

A higher barrier is not always necessary for an elevated platform. For example the Guggenheim Museum also has an open area with a low barrier but there has never been a suicide there.

“I think it’s because the space is so beautiful so magical so affirming so wonderful” said Alspector the architect and professor. “I don’t know that I’ve heard anyone describe the Vessel as beautiful.”

He said he was skeptical an 8-foot-tall barrier at the Vessel would be sufficient given that it was ineffective at NYU’s library. He instead suggested a continuous enclosed barrier.

“I would urge it to be something that’s humane life-affirming not prison-like not like a fishbowl necessarily” he said. “It’s a tough design problem.”

Not the American one of course but a replica situated in the parking lot of the Manhattan Project commercial center only a few minutes’ walk away.

The city in Israel’s south has mainly been known as the location of the grave of the Baba Sali a Moroccan-born Kabbalist of high renown. Like China or Las Vegas both of which have copies of world-famous structures Netivot now has two recently erected monuments – the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower. The replica of the French landmark is located in the Oded Shriki Paris Center which was completed earlier this year.

As the name suggests both the Manhattan and Paris projects are the vision of developer and contractor Oded Shriki owner of the Arzey Hanegev construction firm. He has garnered some publicity in recent years for among other things his automobile collection and his palatial home which has served as a backdrop for wedding photos and television sketches.

Shriki also designed his Netivot mansion which stands out in the neighborhood of relatively modest single-family homes.

Shriki’s architectural taste is also evident in the city’s two newer projects. He stresses that he is the one who outlined the design’s particulars aided by architects who were responsible for the blueprints and execution. Both of the Netivot projects were the work of architect Ron Golan.

An atomic choice

The unfortunately-named Manhattan Project comprises 15 15-story residential buildings with some of the apartments sold under a reduced-price program for first-time home buyers. Unlike the commercial center the residential towers look like typical Israeli buildings with a 15-dunam (3.7 acre) park being developed at its center. The Statue of Liberty is of course painted gold.

“I wanted the commercial center to be half-American half-European” Shriki tells Haaretz. His office where he met with this reporter also reflects his ostentatious taste. The chair he sits on is ornate and at the entrance stands an enormous wooden statue. The railings that surround the offices are similar to those in the new commercial complexes. “I was in Manhattan and I saw some beautiful buildings there. All the buildings there are tall” he says explaining his inspiration for the project that also gave it its name. “This is the first time such tall buildings are going up in Netivot.”

Shriki a Netivot native stresses that the Statue of Liberty is just another “motif.” What’s important is the city in which he’s building other projects as well. “I built thousands of units for young couples in the city where I grew up and the fun for me is in seeing the project. My goal is unique projects that do something good for the soul.” At the time of our interview all except a few of the 5-room apartments had been sold. For interested parties: it’ll just set you back by 1.1 million shekels (about $342400).

The 47-year-old father of four grew up in a crowded apartment in a modest housing project. He dropped out of school at the age of 13 and worked in a bakery as a wedding photographer and later in construction. His first project in Netivot was 100 apartments in six-story buildings. He makes a point of stressing that he builds all over the country and not just in Netivot. His company is building in Be’er Sheva Be’er Yaakov Bnei Brak Bat Hefer and Ramat Hahayal.

Aux Shatnez-Elysées

The Paris Center on Netivot’s Baalei Hamelakha Street is not far from Shriki’s office. To get into the mood visitors are greeted by a large clock styled after the ones found in European train stations – four round clock faces with Roman numerals joined together on one narrow pole. The project is full of ornaments details and materials and it has retail chain shops at street level along with numerous eateries. Above the stores are several floors of office space.

The center’s underground parking allows for a stronger connection between the project and the street via a plaza located on top of the parking lot. Descent to the parking lot is through a pavilion decorated with photos of the Champs-Elysees and topped by a gabled roof.

The 32-meter-high replica of the Eiffel Tower stands in the center of the project. It is lit up at night by color-changing lights. The floor of the project is made of black and white checkboard tiles. The fronts of the shops are decorated with gilded snake-shaped frames and the stores are fronted by an avenue of beige Corinthian columns. In the center of the project are other stores with awnings in black and gold and columns also coated in gold paint reminiscent of an inverted cake. The place is lit by huge chandeliers and black light posts like in Europe.

Every floor of office space is wrapped in beams whose design was inspired by classical elements like friezes and architraves. They are adorned with cornices and medallions and bound by a wrought-iron railing decorated with a symbol reminiscent of a lotus or an urn. To analyze the architecture of Shriki’s buildings one is advised to open a dictionary of classical architecture terms. There has been great attention to detail even if it may not be to one’s taste.

One might be tempted to make fun of the heavy kitschy design of Shriki’s projects but they have become pilgrimage sites. Even under the coronavirus restrictions when the stores weren’t yet open people were coming to the Paris Center to gawk and be photographed there. Some make it clear that they’re not fans of the design but acknowledge that it will draw visitors to the city.

Costs for the project were relatively high and it is unclear how long it’ll take for it to be profitable. “I’m not looking at the profit right now” Shriki said. “I built it because I know that Netivot will get to very high places in the future. Most commercial centers are built along the same model and I wanted the country to get some innovation.” He imported the Eiffel Tower replica from China which is also where most of his workers come from. “The Chinese are honest people and top-class professionals” he says. “The Chinese are like artists.”

His design ideas as expected he pulled from Paris. “When you get to Paris your soul opens” he says. As to why the Eiffel Tower instead of focusing on some local icon he said “People like it. I was in Las Vegas and Macau and saw that it attracts tourists. I knew it would draw a crowd. I’m also planning for a hotel.”

Shriki is far from finished; he has other projects planned for Netivot. At the city’s entrance he is planning to build a structure in his unique style for his company; another commercial project is to be situated near the Paris Center and include a replica of London’s Big Ben. And there’s another 10-story residential project in the works. He says that in his own city he builds in a style that he likes “But I also want to do special things in the rest of the country.”

Will there be a pyramid? He says he’s not interested. And what does the municipality think about your having become a design influence in the city? “The mayor [Yehiel Zohar] likes what I do. I’m not responsible for the city there are a lot of developers. Every developer who chooses can build their own fantasies. My fantasy is that people should have a good time.” Shriki says that he knew people would be interested in the project and that people send him pictures that they’ve taken at the site.

Paris Center is situated in an area with lots of potential that’s easy to walk through. It’s not far from the city’s main thoroughfare Jerusalem Street which connects to the entrance to Netivot. A plan in the area is being advanced by the National Planning and Building Commission for Priority Residential Areas planned by architect Erez Ella. The plan encompasses 867 dunams (214 acres) in an L-shape adjacent to Route 25 and includes City Hall.

The new plan provides a tenfold increase in building rights for business and commerce and a significant hike in the space allowed for public buildings and creates a new urban avenue. The municipality is also seeking to include residential buildings in the area and the plan combines low-rise construction with a few towers. Illustrations of the plan include the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben along with a huge Ferris wheel. Inspired by Las Vegas Baalei Hamelakha Street is dubbed “The Strip.”

In 2017 Netivot signed an agreement with the government to enlarge the city and it is now one of the fastest-growing cities in Israel. The city looks like one huge construction site; new neighborhoods are going up alongside commercial compounds. There’s also an urban nature strip and a number of new parks have been built.

Zohar is one of the country’s longest serving mayors having been in office since 1989. “I came when I was six years old and I will stay till the end of my days” he says. He is unmoved by the fact that his city has become an attraction due to Shriki’s icons. “That’s one man’s craziness; it’s fine for him to do with his money whatever he wants. He builds crazy things of quality. There are 14 developers and contractors building here and our dreams are starting to come true.”

The city has 42000 residents and according to its master plan could grow to 100000. The plan is being updated to allow up to 150000 people. Since the agreement was signed with the state some 6000 apartments have been sold. “Three thousand people move here every year” says Zohar. “It’s a green city and by marketing land we are getting funds that enable us to improve the older areas.”

Do you think it’s proper for a developer to be delineating the city’s icons? “I have no problem with it. He’s a colorful person. In the residential neighborhoods there are rules and the contractors work according to the urban building plans. With commercial buildings we are more flexible and his construction adds something to the city.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pYW1paGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NvbW11bml0eS9taWFtaS1kYWRlL21pYW1pLWJlYWNoL2FydGljbGUyNTMyMDAyMjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Design of collapsed condo was weak and violated building code,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.miamiherald.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The journey begins in the sky when rain and snow fall on the mountainside; water then flows into the Owens River and travels a human-built route for the next 200-plus miles. Pipes tunnels and canals—all mapped out a century ago—navigate hills valleys and desert terrain en route to North America’s third-largest city .

Yet the most remarkable aspect of this system the Los Angeles Aqueduct  might be its reliance on the most basic concept of drinking water engineering. Because the water comes from the mountains the aqueduct is built on a downhill slope. To get to its destination all the water needs is gravity.

Of all the water on the planet only about 3 percent is fresh—that is largely saltless and generally drinkable. Of that 3 percent about two-thirds is frozen in the world’s melting glacial ice. The remainder lies underground and in lakes rivers ponds and springs; it has sustained life on land for millennia.

“There are very few true universals in the human condition” says James Salzman the author of Drinking Water: A History. “But drinking safe water is one of them.”

Most of our ancestors lived nomadically  and in that lifestyle finding a drink was as simple as filling a gourd on the side of a river. But as humans settled and societies expanded crowding close to fresh water became impossible. That’s where the engineering history of drinking water truly begins and it starts in the Neolithic Age.

Moving Rivers

Early societies developed several methods to meet the challenges of importing water. Canals wells and cisterns were prevalent thousands of years ago across the ancient world. In present-day Jordan the first known dam was constructed of compacted earth and masonry to hold back water and sustain the city of Jawa.

Up through antiquity no civilization dreamed bigger than Rome. In population alone Rome was the first “modern” city with an estimated one million people—at least 10 times more than almost any other ancient city . To supply its residents the city’s engineers designed an infrastructure project on an unprecedented scale. From 312 BCE to 226 CE they built 11 structures that delivered water from springs and lakes as far as 57 miles away. They called these life-giving structures aquae ductus Latin for “water” and “conduit.”

The aqueducts operated almost entirely through pipes and tunnels built at a declining slope. To cross shallow valleys and maintain that gradient the Romans created grand arched bridges that became enduring symbols of their ingenuity. Where the land dropped too deeply to construct a bridge they built a series of pipes that plunged down and rose back up the next hill at a slightly shorter elevation. This design allowed the water to fall from the higher position and maintain enough force to reach the shorter side. It also enabled the entire system to operate by gravity alone. This was two millennia before the planning of the Los Angeles Aqueduct.

FILIPPO MONTEFORTE // Getty Images A section of the Anio Vetus aqueduct outside Rome.

“We think about the Roman water system as the archetype” says David Sedlak author of Water 4.0: The Past Present and Future of the World’s Most Vital Resource “because it essentially established the model that all future water supplies would follow.”

When the water entered the city it flowed to bathhouses and extravagant street fountains. With no faucets back then the water ran continuously and overflow cleaned the streets and drained into the city’s sewer system (a whole other engineering marvel).

As the empire declined in the 5th century many of the aqueducts fell into disrepair. Some were restored during the Renaissance and one of them—the Aqua Virgo which the engineer Sextus Julius Frontinus meticulously documented at “14105 paces” in length—still brings water to the Trevi Fountain . But it took more than a millennium before the world pushed to the brink by deadly pandemics improved on Rome’s hydrological genius.

Smelly Cities and Disease

The fall of the Roman Empire sent Europe into a tailspin of terrible sanitation that turned streets into dumps. For centuries people threw garbage and the contents of their chamber pots out of their windows. Much of that waste seeped right into Europe’s wells and rivers and in the 17th and 18th centuries the Europeans brought their unsanitary practices across the Atlantic.

New York was notorious for its filth. In 1785 an observer for the New York Journal described people gathering by their drinking source the long-gone Collect Pond to scrub “things too nauseous to mention; all their sudds [sic] and filth are emptied into this pond besides dead dogs cats etc. thrown in daily and no doubt many buckets [of excrement] from that quarter of the town.”

Pungent odors permeated New York and other cities in the early 19th century and disease followed. In 1831 alone more than 50000 people in Great Britain died from typhoid fever. A year later New York City recorded 3500 deaths from cholera. The world still decades away from understanding waterborne pathogens blamed the smelly air.

New York’s leaders at least understood that their pond was repugnant and that it would never supply enough water to sustain a growing city. After years of surveying they determined that the closest and most reliable source of clean water was outside Manhattan flowing in the Croton River 40 miles north .

William England // Getty Images High Bridge over the Harlem River part of the Croton Aqueduct carrying water to New York City.

About 1600 years had passed since Rome built its last aqueduct. Even after all those centuries moving water over such a distance was a massive undertaking . The project’s chief engineer John B. Jervis designed an aqueduct emulating the ancient model with a 55-foot-tall masonry dam and tunnels descending 13 inches per mile . To maintain that slope thousands of workers blew up rock and carved straight through hills. When the aqueduct reached the city it crossed the Harlem River over a 1420-foot-long arched bridge inspired by the Roman aesthetic. The water then flowed into iron pipes underground and filled reservoirs and street hydrants with drinking water. When it opened in 1842 the Croton Aqueduct became the template for projects in Boston Philadelphia and other American cities including Los Angeles decades later.

Within New York City itself the water system could do something maybe even more extraordinary. Between the slope and the gravitational pull the water accrued enough pressure to ascend into buildings as high as six stories . Over the next several decades the city transformed its closets into rooms with toilets sinks and tubs. Running water had entered the home revolutionizing the way we could fill a glass. As Manhattan grew taller thousands of wooden towers sprang up across the city’s rooftops  where water was pumped for storage before trickling down once again by gravity.

This concept was replicated around the world. Most water towers by design are taller than the buildings surrounding them. Suppliers pump the water into this one structure after which it drops down and then rises back up into shorter buildings.

As New York City’s population skyrocketed into the millions  the city expanded the Croton Aqueduct and built two more each about 100 miles long from the late 19th century through 1965 . Together the three aqueducts convey about 1.2 billion gallons of water to the city and to towns along the way—every single day. Almost all of that water has remained pristine and persists as the largest unfiltered supply in the United States.

But New York is lucky—most cities don’t have such clean sources. Instead they rely on filtration. That story begins with the solution for typhoid and cholera.

Cleaning Our Water

In 1829 London’s Chelsea Waterworks Company prototyped a filter designed to make the water from the city’s polluted Thames River look clearer and taste better. It comprised a layer of sand atop a bed of gravel with a tank built underneath to capture the cleaned water that trickled through. After a few weeks of pouring water over the sand a gooey biofilm formed on top. The biofilm did the trick—the water in the tank looked and tasted cleaner—but what the engineers didn’t know was that the biofilm consumed organic matter including cholera and typhoid bacteria.

Only one man physician John Snow suspected the pathogens to be waterborne and noted in The Medical Times and Gazette that the company had “in every epidemic very much less cholera in their district.” But without definitive proof Londoners still blamed the city’s stench.

Snow made his case in the summer of 1854  when more than 500 people in the city’s Soho district died of cholera in a 10-day span. After delving into the victims’ public records he discovered that nearly all of them lived by a well on Broad Street. Of the minority who lived elsewhere Snow learned from their surviving family members that those victims had recently drank water delivered from the same source. It turned out that the well adjoined a cesspool and bacteria had moved from the waste to the water.

Snow presented his findings to community leaders who agreed to take the well out of service. The move ended the outbreak and the investigation became one of the earliest studies to support the germ theory of disease.

“That’s really the field of epidemiology” Salzman says. “The field of public health starts there.”

The Chelsea Waterworks Company’s filter—called the “slow sand filter” for the many hours the water took to pass through the goo—began operating on a large scale through a new piped water supply at this time and the technology spread throughout the world.

Impressive Water Projects Around the World Qanats Originating 3000 years ago in Persia the qanat is one of the earliest known gravity-powered aqueducts. They consisted of tunnels dug almost entirely underground beginning from a source in the mountains and continuing steadily toward fountains and gardens. Millennia later they are still in use in the Middle East. Cisterns of Constantinople Under the rule of Emperor Justinian I the city of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) was prepared in advance for a water shortage. The emperor ordered the construction of subterranean cisterns beneath the city’s streets and some including the ornate Basilica Cistern still survive today with a small fish population. Stepwells of Ancient India Monsoon rains and aquifers have supplied water to India for millennia. Stepwells massive flights of stairs that descended to the water table below street level stored water from both sources. While mostly out of use today many still exist and they inspired the set design for the pit in The Dark Knight Rises. AGF Machu Picchu A 2500-foot-long stone aqueduct still carries water from a spring to this abandoned 15th-century Incan city. The water arrives at Emperor Pachacuti’s fountain where a drain leads into the next spouting structure. This process continues through a total of 16 fountains dropping 85 feet in elevation from the first fountain to the last. Singapore The city-state of Singapore is at the cutting edge in sustainable water supply technology today. Its Public Utilities Board supplies desalinated seawater captured rainwater and recycled wastewater to the homes and businesses of 5.7 million people.

Near the end of the century scientists in Louisville Kentucky adapted this filter to remove mud from its local supply. Because mud is just earth mixed with water the scientists developed a scheme to separate out the earth. They stirred the water in a basin and added a metal salt which caused the particles to collide and connect into larger pieces. The earth settled at the bottom of the basin while the water flowed to the sand where any remaining pieces could be taken out . The sand didn’t even require a biofilm (it was backwashed to prevent one from forming) so the water moved much faster.

More than a century later we still use both slow and rapid sand filtration in modern water treatment. In many places these are supplemented by filtration of the sewage itself especially where effluent is returned to the river from which the water originated. These processes include screening out debris detaching solid materials from the water and breaking down organic matter with microbes.

All this filtration is also regularly combined with another treatment the final step before water is sent to our homes: disinfection.

Smith Collection/Gado // Getty Images Chlorinators used inside a Minneapolis water filtration plant 1917

Since at least the 1850s the scientific community has known that chlorine can destroy bacteria. The chemical is abundant in salt brine but it was difficult to extract on a large scale until the early 20th century when electrolysis became mainstream and gave treatment plants a means to pry it loose on site.

Chlorine caught on in the U.S. starting in 1908  when a legal battle between Jersey City New Jersey and a local water supply company ignited a debate in chemistry. The city contended that its new water supply needed filtration while the company argued just for cheaper chlorination.

The company added chlorine to the water and the chemical proved to be according to the judge  “effective and capable” of disinfecting known germs. Ever since then chlorine has been such an effective disinfectant that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers it one of the most important achievements in public health in the past century. Sometimes it’s combined with or replaced by newer disinfection methods such as ultraviolet radiation  but the chemical is used almost everywhere in the country.



New Century New Problems

Despite so much progress modern drinking water technology has had its flaws. About 6 to 10 million water service lines in the United States are made of lead a malleable metal that’s easy to shape into pipes but toxic to the human brain and nervous system . The federal government outlawed lead in pipe construction in the 1980s and additives like orthophosphate prevent it from corroding into the water.

Brett Carlsen // Getty Images Flint Michigan residents receive bottled water in January 2016 after the city’s contaminated water supply led to a federal state of emergency.

The world witnessed the dire consequences of omitting the compound in 2014 when officials in Flint Michigan failed to properly treat its new water supply from the Flint River. This disastrous decision caused lead to enter taps at quantities 50 times higher than the threshold set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The crisis took years to fix  and has fractured residents’ trust in the city’s water.

Like much of America’s infrastructure crucial arteries of drinking water are breaking down. Many conduits date back at least a century and constantly need repairs. Earlier this year the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimated that a U.S. water main breaks every two minutes leaking about 6 million gallons of treated water every day.

“Our underground infrastructure is past its design life” Sedlak says “and one of the most expensive parts about maintaining a city’s water infrastructure is repairing the pipes as they wear out.”

Repairs will cost billions of dollars according to the ASCE and in the long run it may not even be the right solution. There is an unintended consequence to the construction of much of our water infrastructure: when we draw water from one place we deprive it from another. Rivers lakes and aquifers no longer refill at the same rate at which they’re tapped. When the Los Angeles Aqueduct was built it diverted water away from Owens Lake drying the landscape and enabling air-polluting dust storms .

Overdrafting conflates with climate change which is reducing the amount of fresh water that returns to the planet’s surface through snow and rain. A case in point: the Colorado River a water source for almost 40 million Americans now receives less snowfall from the Rocky Mountains and no longer reaches Mexico.

We can address these challenges in many ways from capturing stormwater for irrigation to using high-efficiency washing machines . But to tackle a global crisis our drinking water needs to adapt. The world has two practicable solutions:

Turning to the Sea More than 70 percent of our planet’s surface is covered in ocean and every drop of ocean water is undrinkable—but it doesn’t have to be. In dry places like Texas distillation facilities can heat saltwater and capture the vapors for drinking. Upon the opening of a distillation plant in Freeport Texas in 1961 President John F. Kennedy said  “No water resources program is of greater long-range importance than our efforts to convert water from the world’s greatest and cheapest natural resources—our oceans—into water fit for our homes and industry.” Around this time scientists at UCLA developed an organic cellulosic membrane with gaps large enough to allow water molecules—but not salt—to pass through. Pumps pushed the water across the barrier making the process resemble a reversed form of natural osmosis. Today reverse osmosis is the main desalination method in the United States and produces hundreds of millions of gallons of saltless seawater every day. Yet while drawing from the ocean has clear advantages desalination is limited to the coasts and it can also cause environmental damage. The intake pipes must be placed away from dense fish populations to minimize the amount of aquatic life that gets sucked in. Pumping through the membrane requires a ton of power and only renewable energy can offset the impact. Also the process makes a lot of salt brine which must often be jet mixed back into the ocean to maintain oxygen levels for marine life. Popular Mechanics From Toilet to Tap About 32 billion gallons of water flow down America’s drains every day according to the EPA’s 2017 Potable Reuse Compendium . The sewage often empties into natural bodies of water and Cincinnati Nashville and Atlanta are just a sampling of U.S. cities that receive and treat the effluent of upstream communities into drinking water. As the EPA suggests in the compendium reusing our own wastewater may be the most efficient way to increase and maintain a water supply. Orange County California pioneered potable water reuse in the 1970s when its population grew to 1.5 million from about 150000 in the mid-1940s. Local groundwater depleted so much that it fell below sea level creating a path for the Pacific Ocean to enter the aquifer. Rather than attempt seawater desalination the county replenished the aquifer. With its only available water source flowing through the sewers officials built 23 wells capable of depositing a combined 30 million gallons of wastewater into the aquifer every day. A new facility Water Factory 21 cleaned the water using everything from filtration and chlorination to reverse osmosis which required less energy due to wastewater’s low salt concentration. Almost 50 years later the county’s groundbreaking system has reduced reliance on faraway rivers and remained impervious to drought . And while only a tiny fraction of American wastewater is recycled into drinking water today—it took decades for San Diego to come around on the “yuck factor”—the toilet-to-tap approach represents one of the most viable solutions to building a sustainable future. Popular Mechanics

As fresh water levels continue to decline  we can no longer replicate the aqueducts built for Rome New York and Los Angeles. But between potable water reuse and desalination scientists and engineers have developed some of the first technological solutions to this challenge. And if this history has taught us anything it’s that a crisis will propel a new wave of innovation—whether it’s a booming population in the Mediterranean a devastating pandemic or an increasingly warming (and inhospitable) world.

It was originally published on October 1 2020.

Decades’ worth of Gatorade commercials have taught us two things: Sports drinks hydrate you better than water and it’s normal to sweat orange or blue liquid. Neither of these statements is true but it does bring us to another interesting point which is that the reason sports drinks work probably isn’t what you think.

The reason many of us drink stuff like Gatorade to begin with is probably a combination of the sweet neurochemical reward that comes from ingesting sugar and the subliminal messaging inherent in sports drinks commercials that tells us real athletes drink [insert your favorite sports drink here]. But that’s not why we think we drink them. We probably think that scientifically speaking beverages like Gatorade or Powerade are doing something for our bodies that water isn’t—and that’s actually true. It’s just not clear how much the average exerciser really needs those extra features especially when you consider the massive quantity of sugar that most sports drinks contain. So let’s break down exactly when you might need to down a big bottle of luridly colored liquid during your next workout—and when you probably don’t need to at all.

It hydrates you

This myth comes from a study funded by Gatorade that found people who drank their product were better hydrated than if they drank water—but only because they drank more fluids. If you drank the same volume of water versus Gatorade you’d be equally hydrated. This is not to say though that Gatorade didn’t have a point. “It is well documented that people drink more when the beverage tastes good!” says Dominique Adair a registered dietician and member of the American Council on Exercise’s Scientific Advisory Panel. “So just the fact that these beverages are more palatable for some people than water might encourage people to drink more.”

Lots of people are used to drinking non-water beverages and to them water might taste boring or even bad. If you’re one of those people maybe drinking a flavored beverage would encourage you to drink more during and after your workout—and that’s a good thing. Depending on how much you sweat you need to replenish your body’s supply of water (though keep in mind that food also contains water and that the eight-glasses-a-day thing is more complicated than you might think).

That said a 12-ounce bottle of Gatorade or Powerade contains 21 grams of sugar which is about as much as two Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups or half a can of soda. So just keep in mind that along with that water comes a lot of sugar which spike your blood glucose levels and can contribute to developing metabolic issues like type 2 diabetes. A typical bottle of Gatorade contains more than half of an adult’s recommended daily sugar intake.

To replace lost electrolytes

Electrolytes became a buzzword when sports drinks first started coming out even though most of us probably don’t really know what they are or what they do. To simplify electrolytes are basically ions (charged atoms) that serve a huge variety of functions around our body often involving transporting other molecules across cell membranes—they are quite literally essential to life. We would die without electrolytes.

BUT—and this is a big but—it’s not really clear how much you need to replace those electrolytes with a drink. You are already getting the key electrolytes like potassium sodium and magnesium through your diet. Every individual loses electrolytes at a different rate depending on the person and the type of workout though in general if you sweat a lot you’re probably losing more of them.

Fortunately Adair has a good rule of thumb to go by: If you’re exercising for more than an hour and your t-shirt or hat dries with a white residue that’s a pretty good indicator that you’re losing a lot of sodium and might benefit from a sports drink (along with getting sodium in your diet).

To replace carbohydrates

One of the main benefits of all that sugar in sports drinks is the carbs it provides. During exercise your muscles are using up your energy stores primarily from the stashes of the glycogen found in your muscles and liver. That glycogen can run out if you work out for long enough which is why marathon runners and other endurance athletes often choose to down a little jelly cube full of carbohydrates—because it provides needed fuel for their muscles.

Sports drinks can serve the same function but there’s a key point to remember here: “Most recreational exercisers don’t deplete their glycogen stores” Adair says. “In fact if one of the goals for exercise is weight loss taking in additional sugar and calories won’t help.” Water is thus a perfectly good way to rehydrate for those of us not working out intensely for long periods of time. If you do—like say if you’re working out hard for more than an hour at a time—you may truly need a sports drink. Some good signs that you need one would be if you have serious fatigue nausea or headaches after working out. Adair says these are signs that you’re either dehydrated or hyponatremic meaning you have too much fluid compared to electrolytes. In both cases a sports drink will help. But if you’re going on half-hour jogs that Powerade may be doing more harm than good.

This also means that if what you’re seeking is at least in part the energy boost from taking on carbs during a workout don’t go for the sugar-free varieties—the sugar is where the energy comes from. If however you’re looking to drink something that you find tasty and don’t want the extra calories Adair says the zero-sugar options may be the way to go.

Bottom line: If your workout lasts for more than an hour is rigorous and leaves you with a salty band of sweat on your face and clothes you’d probably benefit from some kind of sports drink. If not you probably don’t need one though you should feel free to drink the sugar-free variety if you don’t like drinking plain water. But at the end of the day between drinking plenty of water and eating a healthy balanced diet you’re probably already getting everything you need."

In some cases you might worry about an extra couple dB’s of load regulation as long as noise can be filtered but applications requiring ultra-precise timing and components with very narrow input voltage ranges need very stable DC voltage with low noise content. So how can you qualify the exact limits of low noise and what types of regulators are best for these applications?

If you’re never looked through voltage regulator specifications you’ll probably have to rely on marketing-speak to find a low-noise voltage regulator for your next system. However the regulator itself is not the whole story and there are other components and layout strategies needed to ensure a regulator provides stable low-noise DC output. Here’s what you need to know about different types of low-noise regulators and how to select the best component for your needs.

Low-Noise Voltage Regulator Fundamentals

A low-noise voltage regulator can technically be built from any topology; how you get noise low enough for practical use is another matter to be dealt with by the component or circuit designer. The regulator component you choose will have many important specifications but the following three will tell you basically everything you need about a regulator’s handling of noise (both internally generated and external).

Power supply rejection ratio (PSRR). In short this spec tells you how much conducted noise (in dB) from the upstream power supply is rejected by the regulator. The error amplifier in an LDO ensures high PSRR (similar to a switching converter) although they are inefficient if high step-down is required.

Output regulation. This can be measured in dB with respect to a nominal value or as a percentage. Truly low-noise regulators should have very low output regulation value; the best components will have regulation ratings below 1%. This specification might also be defined in terms of an RMS output as a fraction of the nominal voltage output.

Noise power density. This shows the amount of noise you’ll expect to see over an arbitrary frequency range. The relevant range can be taken from DC up to very high frequency (100 kHz to 1 MHz) or up to the switching frequency for a switching regulator.

All three quantities listed above are frequency-dependent. Note that the noise power density encompasses all sources of internally generated noise including any internal switching noise. These three specifications need to be considered together when selecting a low-noise voltage regulator. For example low output regulation and noise power density are meaningless if the input has 0 dB PSRR. Similarly PSRR doesn’t matter if the output regulation value is very high.

Building a Regulator from Discrete Components

Other supporting circuitry on the output from a voltage regulator or within a regulator IC itself can help further reduce noise on the regulator output. For example if you’re building your own linear regulator from discrete components using a capacitance multiplier is a simple but powerful way to bring down noise; this topology is often used in audio or low-frequency RF regulators without the need for exotic components. Another example is an active regulator which provides theoretically perfect noise reduction.

If you want to get even further noise reduction you need additional filtering on the input/output or you need to use a highly engineered integrated solution. You should also consider how filtration on the output and your switching frequency influence noise content in your regulator.

The Role of Switching Frequency and Filtration

If you’re looking for a switching converter you’ll be adding some extra noise onto the output from the regulator. In essence a switching regulator exchanges low frequency ripple from an AC source into high frequency noise which is spread across the bandwidth of the PWM signal. This should illustrate the reason why many low-noise voltage regulator components are LDOs; they don’t have any switching noise. Take a look at this article to learn more about switching converter design and how to choose the best frequency for your converter.

Finally if you need very low noise content from your regulator a higher order low-pass filter can be used to remove some noise content from the device. These filters can be designed from passives although be careful with your layout when working at high current with a switching regulator; the switching action generates a high magnetic field that can induce a current on the filter output which then propagates downstream to other components.

Two Example Low-Noise Voltage Regulators

STMicroelectronics LD56100

For low-voltage moderate current applications the LD56100 series from STMicroelectronics is a low-noise LDO providing up to 5.5 V output with 1 A current. It provides very low dropout voltage of 120 mV with output stabilized using an integrated ceramic capacitor. PSRR is rated at 70 dB (1 kHz frequency) with 0.13 mV RMS noise at the 3 V output.

Analog Devices LTC7151S

One example of a low-cost low-noise voltage regulator is the LTC7151S from Analog Devices . This SMD low-noise regulator provides user-controlled adjustable switching frequency from 400 kHz to 3 MHz with an integrated PWM driver making it an excellent choice for systems that need a high power switching converter with low loss. Input range spans up to 20 V and output spans up to 5.5 V with 15 A delivered to a load. Two supply regulation modes are offered both of which maintain output load regulation below 0.25% over the entire output current range.

Other Components for Power Systems

A low-noise voltage regulator doesn’t get down to low noise on its own and your regulator section will require other components to provide the desired power output and noise floor. For very precise regulation in high power systems maintaining stability and ensuring low noise simultaneously is a major challenge requiring a range of other power management components. Here are some other components you might need for your product:

Image courtesy of Apple.

Apple Inc. will roll out a system for checking photos for child abuse imagery on a country-by-country basis depending on local laws the company said this week.

Apple officials also said the company would implement a system that screens photos for such images before they are uploaded from iPhones in the U.S. to its iCloud storage.

Child safety groups praised Apple as it joined Facebook Inc. Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in taking such measures.

But Apple’s photo check on the iPhone itself raised concerns that the company is probing into users’ devices in ways that could be exploited by governments. Many other technology companies check photos after they are uploaded to servers.

In a media briefing on Friday Apple said it would make plans to expand the service based on the laws of each country where it operates.

The company said nuances in its system such as “safety vouchers” passed from the iPhone to Apple’s servers that do not contain useful data will protect Apple from government pressure to identify material other than child abuse images.

We’ve had personal computers for decades and there has never been a mandate to scan the private content of all desktops laptops or phones globally for unlawful content. It’s not how technology built in free countries works. — Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) August 6 2021

Apple has a human review process that acts as a backstop against government abuse it added. The company will not pass reports from its photo checking system to law enforcement if the review finds no child abuse imagery.

Regulators are increasingly demanding that tech companies do more to take down illegal content. For the past few years law enforcement and politicians have wielded the scourge of child abuse to decry strong encryption in the way they had previously cited the need to curb terrorism.

A few resulting laws including in Britain could be used to force tech companies to act against their users in secret.

While Apple’s strategy may deflect government meddling by showing its initiative or complying with anticipated directives in Europe many security experts said the privacy champion was making a big mistake by showing its willingness to reach into customer phones.

“It may have deflected U.S. regulators’ attention for this one topic but it will attract regulators internationally to do the same thing with terrorist and extremist content” said Riana Pfefferkorn a research scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory.

Politically influential copyright holders in Hollywood and elsewhere could even argue that their digital rights should be enforced in such a way she said.

Facebook’s WhatsApp the world’s largest fully encrypted messaging service is also under pressure from governments that want to see what people are saying and it fears that will now increase. WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart tweeted a barrage of criticism Friday against Apple for the new architecture.

“We’ve had personal computers for decades and there has never been a mandate to scan the private content of all desktops laptops or phones globally for unlawful content” he wrote. “It’s not how technology built in free countries works.”

Apple’s experts argued that they were not really going into people’s phones because data sent on its devices must clear multiple hurdles. For example banned material is flagged by watchdog groups and the identifiers are bundled into Apple’s operating systems worldwide making them harder to manipulate.

Some experts said they had one reason to hope Apple had not truly changed direction in a fundamental way.

As Reuters reported last year the company had been working to make iCloud backups end-to-end encrypted meaning the company could not turn over readable versions of them to law enforcement. It dropped the project after the FBI objected.

Apple may be setting the stage to turn on the encryption later this year using this week’s measures to head off anticipated criticism of that change said Stanford Observatory founder Alex Stamos.

Apple declined to comment on future product plans.

He says scammers target both e-gift cards and physical gift cards. In stores they steal the account and pin numbers before the cards are sold.

""Fraudsters are able to get into that card. They have a tool that allows them to remove that scratch-off"" said Fletcher. ""And then they can replace it with a new transparent sticker so that it looks like it has never been touched or never been used. And ultimately that card is tried throughout the day every day until it goes through and that's how the cards in the retail stores are stolen before you even buy it.""

He says they access e-gift cards through company hacks or computer malware.

""Fraudsters are able to create these bots that look for buzzwords so as emails are coming in they typically look for things such as 'gift card' 'balance' 'banking' receipts anything like that will get flagged and they will get their information'"" said Fletcher. ""And so ultimately what happens is that gift card gets emailed and no sooner did you receive that email … that card is either sold or being used within the next hour to two hours. That's how fast it happens.""

What can you do to protect yourself?

When you are buying gift cards stick to stores you know and trust and keep your receipt.

If you buy one at a retail store inspect it thoroughly to make sure it hasn't been tampered with.

And Fletcher says timing is key.

""Don't make the purchase until you're ready to use it. If you're buying it as a gift for someone else don't make that purchase until you're about to give it to them"" he said. ""And if you're a recipient of a gift card like that you need to use it as fast as possible. It's very common for that fraud to happen.""

If your gift card value is stolen don't expect the merchant will reimburse you for the money lost. If you bought the gift card with your credit card you can dispute the charge with your credit card company and try to get reimbursed that way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYXVnLzA3L2FwcGxlLXRvLXNjYW4taXBob25lcy1mb3ItY2hpbGQtcG9ybi1pbWFnZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple to scan iPhones for child-porn images | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Apple unveiled plans to scan U.S. iPhones for images of child sexual abuse drawing applause from child-protection groups but raising concern among some security researchers that the system could be misused by governments looking to surveil their citizens.

Apple said its messaging app will use on-device machine learning to warn about sensitive content without making private communications readable by the company. The tool Apple calls ""NeuralHASH"" will detect known images of child sexual abuse without decrypting people's messages. If it finds a match the image will be reviewed by a human who can notify law enforcement agencies if necessary.

But researchers say the tool could be put to other purposes such as government surveillance of dissidents or protesters.

Matthew Green of Johns Hopkins a top cryptography researcher was concerned that it could be used to frame innocent people by sending them harmless but malicious images designed to appear as matches for child porn fooling Apple's algorithm and alerting law enforcement agencies -- essentially framing people. ""Researchers have been able to do this pretty easily"" he said.

Tech companies including Microsoft Google Facebook and others have for years been providing ""hash lists"" of known images of child sexual abuse. Apple has also been scanning user files stored in its iCloud service which is not as securely encrypted as its messages for such images.

Some say this technology could leave the company vulnerable to political pressure in authoritarian states such as China. ""What happens when the Chinese government says 'Here is a list of files that we want you to scan for'"" Green said. ""Does Apple say no? I hope they say no but their technology won't say no.""

The company has been under pressure from governments and law enforcement officials to allow for surveillance of encrypted data. Coming up with the security measures required Apple to perform a delicate balancing act between cracking down on the exploitation of children while keeping its high-profile commitment to protecting users' privacy.

Apple believes it pulled off that feat with technology that it developed in consultation with several prominent cryptographers including Stanford University professor Dan Boneh whose work in the field has won a Turing Award often called technology's version of the Nobel Prize.

The computer scientist who more than a decade ago invented PhotoDNA the technology used by law enforcement agencies to identify child pornography online acknowledged the potential for abuse of Apple's system but said it was far outweighed by the imperative of battling child sexual abuse.

Abuse of the system is possible ""but is it something that I'm concerned about? No"" said Hany Farid a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley who argues that plenty of other programs designed to secure devices from various threats haven't seen ""this type of mission creep."" For example WhatsApp provides users with end-to-end encryption to protect their privacy but employs a system for detecting malware and warning users not to click on harmful links.

Apple was one of the first major companies to embrace ""end-to-end"" encryption in which messages are scrambled so that only their senders and recipients can read them. Law enforcement agencies however has long pressured for access to that information in order to investigate crimes such as terrorism or child sexual exploitation.

""Apple's expanded protection for children is a game-changer"" John Clark president and CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said in a statement. ""With so many people using Apple products these new safety measures have lifesaving potential for children who are being enticed online and whose horrific images are being circulated in child sexual abuse material.""

(NYSE:AJG) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions as insider selling can have various explanations. However shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.

The Corporate VP & Chief Human Resource Officer Susan Pietrucha made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$212 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$206. We generally don't like to see insider selling but the lower the sale price the more it concerns us.

Faire le tour de l'Étang Neuf c'est possible. D'un côté s'étend la très grande région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes qui jouxte la Suisse et l'Italie et de l'autre l'immense région Nouvelle-Aquitaine qui frôle l'Espagne. Au milieu l'Étang neuf et ses 22 hectares d'étendue d'eau ne font pas de vagues lovés dans un écrin de forêts et de prairies humides. Ce plan d'eau situé à la frontière des départements de la Creuse et du Puy-de-Dôme fédère les élus de Dontreix et du Montel-de-Gelat (*) autour de projets qui ont pour but de valoriser le site en gardant son authenticité.

Dans la perspective d'atteindre cet objectif un Sivu (Syndicat intercommunal à vocation unique) a été créé il y a une dizaine d'années pour assurer la gestion technique et financière de l'étang et de ses abords. Plusieurs terrains ont été acquis entre 2014 et 2020 afin d'aménager les accès autour d'un étang jusque-là principalement réservé aux pêcheurs.

L'ouverture d'un sentier avec la création d'une passerelle en bois de 80 mètres a été concrétisée en juin assurant la continuité entre deux rives au-dessus d'une zone humide. Cette réalisation permet de préserver les écosystèmes aquatiques. Les promeneurs peuvent désormais parcourir une boucle autour du plan d'eau et profiter de la période estivale pour découvrir quelques secrets de la faune et de la flore des Hautes-Combrailles. L'ensemble des travaux d'un montant de 23.782 € HT a été subventionné à 60 % par l'agence de l'Eau Loire-Bretagne. D'autres projets sont actuellement à l'étude du Sivu dont la présidence est assurée par Pierre Mousselon suite à la démission pour raisons de santé de Gaël Galhié.

« Les conditions fixées visent à protéger l’intérêt public en maintenant le siège et l’activité en Espagne en assurant une gestion financière prudente en soutenant les investissements essentiels à la transition énergétique et en maintenant les échanges en Bourse et les obligations de transparence associées » a précisé le même communiqué.

Le fonds d’investissement australien IFM devra maintenir le siège social et le siège effectif pour la gestion et la direction des entreprises en Espagne.

Il devra également accompagner le maintien d’une partie significative des effectifs du groupe en Espagne.

Le fonds d’investissement devra soutenir une politique de dividende prudente permettant d’engager la politique d’investissement liée à la transition énergétique.

Le fonds d’investissement IFM ne devra soutenir aucune proposition de cession présentée au Conseil d’administration ou à l’Assemblée générale des actionnaires de la société qui implique que cette dernière perd le contrôle de filiales qui pourraient mettre en péril le bon fonctionnement des activités de transport et de distribution d’énergie et de gaz naturel en Espagne.

Le fonds avait annoncé le 26 janvier dernier sa volonté de lancer une offre publique d’achat (OPA) sur 2268% du capital du géant énergétique espagnol Naturgy pour un montant maximum de 5 milliards d’euros.

Naturgy possède notamment 49% du gazoduc Medgaz qui relie l’Espagne à l’Algérie son principal fournisseur de gaz.

Smith is disappointed with Patrick Beverley for his behavior toward a fan and a producer following the Bucks' loss. (2:30)

INDIANAPOLIS -- Indianapolis police announced Wednesday they've opened an investigation into an ""NBA player and citizen"" altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Milwaukee Bucks guard Patrick Beverley threw a ball at a fan in the final minutes of a season-ending loss to the Indiana Pacers.

Police said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives ""who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.""

Detectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office at the conclusion of the investigation the release stated.

Cameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands hitting a fan in the head with about 2½ minutes left in Thursday's contest. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley who was holding his arm out for it the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.

Beverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of ""The Pat Bev Podcast"" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before but added that his own actions were ""still inexcusable.""

""I will be better"" he said. ""I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

Beverley added the atmosphere in Indianapolis ""was great"" aside from ""a handful of fans"" who crossed a line. The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98 eliminating Milwaukee in six games in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

""I will be better. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

""I ain't bringing a basketball on the bench no more"" Beverley said. ""That ... threw my whole vibe off.""

After the game Beverley wouldn't allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.

On his podcast Wednesday Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that ""it was never my intent to disrespect you.""

A day after the loss Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley's behavior was ""not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.""

""We're better than that"" Rivers said. ""Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally -- this is an emotional game and things happen -- unfortunately you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9zdHlsZS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L3RoZS1vZmZpY2UtcmV0dXJucy0yMDI0LXJlYm9vdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Office' spinoff to take place at a daily newspaper - The Washington Post,The new untitled series which starts production in June will center on a newsroom whose publisher is trying to save it with “volunteer reporters” per the announcement.

Destruction in Gaza: Side-by-side aerial look at the Israel-Hamas war's devastating damage

Thousands of mosques churches homes restaurants colleges and other buildings have been turned to rubble across the Gaza Strip as the Israel-Hamas war continues.

On Oct. 7 Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and Israel retaliated with ongoing military operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the retaliation at least 34735 people in Gaza have been killed and 78108 have been injured according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.

At least 1700 Israelis have been killed and 8700 others injured according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Since then many of the once-bustling streetscapes -- home to roughly 2.3 million people -- have been flattened.

A report from the United Nations Development Programme found that the war has set back human development in Gaza more than 20 years. That setback will increase the longer the war goes on according to the U.N.

Roughly 86000 housing units have been destroyed and almost 300000 more have been damaged in the Palestinian territories according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.

Additionally 25000 buildings have been destroyed 32 hospitals forced out of service and three churches 341 mosques and 100 universities and schools destroyed according to the Palestinian agency.

Thousands more Gazans are estimated to be missing under the debris according to the Palestinian Civil Defense.

“Math science and technology are critical to human kind. The program recognizes high-achieving students with significant potential in science mathematics and related fields” an announcement provided by Montclair High School science teacher Lynn English who co-directs the program with fellow teacher Dee Portas said.

Through the program 38 students in six cohorts are spending five weeks using the scientific method “to study everything from racism to jellyfish” the university said in its own announcement of the 2021 program. Topics of research include astrophysics marine biology evolutionary/DNA biology hydrogeology and neuroscience among others English’s announcement said.

In addition the students study a mathematics component of statistics and calculus pertinent to their research English said. The students presented their results at a colloquium on July 28.

The program was founded by former Automatic Data Processing CEO Josh Weston 93 and his late wife Judy with the college and public school district 22 years ago.

Weston “showed that his enthusiasm for the summer science program remains as high as ever as he peppered this year’s cohort of high school students with questions hopping among various buildings laboratories and classrooms on the Montclair State campus to learn about experiments in marine biology physics genomic sequencing cybersecurity magnetic imaging and more” the university announcement said.

The mentored laboratory research experience helps teach students what it means to fail and succeed English said in her announcement of the program.

Students also hear from guest speakers in various aspects of STEM careers. English said field excursions will resume once the Montclair Board of Education approves such activities. School plans for the fall are still evolving because of the ongoing threat of coronavirus transmission.

The students can earn high school credits in science toward graduation if all requirements are met for the program. They also conduct several hours of community service in order to achieve full credit.

Higher costs for products shipping containers and labor will result in auto part prices rising another 5% by year-end CarParts CEO Lev Peker said. Prices have already increased about 5% to 7% this year.

""Everything is back ordered"" Peker told FOX Business. ""Everything takes weeks or months. It's a very tight supply chain right now.""

Ticker Security Last Change Change % PRTS CARPARTS.COM INC. 1.13 -0.03 -2.59%

He added that the whole process of moving product through the supply chain takes two months longer now than before the pandemic.

The industry like many others has grappled with a shortage of containers and cargo ships which has expanded shipping times. Once the ships arrive at port they face another delay due to slow unloading times caused by a labor shortage. Then a shortage of delivery truck drivers adds to wait times.

All of that has resulted in higher costs that are being passed onto the consumer.

JEEP RAISED THE PRICE OF BEST-SELLING PLUG-IN HYBRID WRANGLER 4XE THAT BIDEN DROVE

The auto-part industry has historically been able to raise prices on the customer due to the infrequent nature of purchases. Customers typically don’t need to buy the same part for one or two years or longer and don’t really know how much those components should cost.

Peker believes the current period of higher prices is likely transitory but he doesn't know when there will be a leveling off.

""Is it going to go for six months nine months 12 months that I'm not sure about"" he said.

CarParts.com isn’t alone in warning that auto parts prices are headed higher.

""We're beginning to see some pretty significant inflation on certain product categories"" said AutoZone CEO William Rhodes on the company’s third-quarter earnings call in May adding that his firm would ""pass those costs along"" to customers.

Advance Auto Parts CFO Jeff Shepherd said on his company’s quarterly conference call in June that higher costs for product freight and labor caused the company to model 3% inflation going forward.

Both Advanced Auto Parts and AutoZone are scheduled to report their quarterly results on Aug. 24.

CarParts.com on Thursday evening reported strong quarterly results.

Second-quarter sales surged 32% year over year to a record $157.5 million. Net income was $2.1 million or 4 cents per diluted share up from $1.6 million last year.

Earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization hit a record $8.3 million.

Peker says his company has benefitted from the do-it-yourself mentality spurred by the pandemic and the wide availability of videos on YouTube and elsewhere that show consumers how to care for their cars themselves.

A third driver of growth although less significant was the used-car boom caused by the chip shortage. CarParts.com expects to see a bigger benefit from the recent surge in used-car sales down the road as the vehicles go out of warranty and owners are more apt to fix issues on their own.

CarParts.com’s typical customer has a vehicle that is 6-14 years old. The average age of a customer’s car is 12 years and getting older.

Peker is enthusiastic that his company’s recent success is just the beginning.

MAS issued a plea to the community Saturday to provide a foster home until Friday the next time dogs will be transported to other facilities. Placing animals in foster homes is an alternative to euthanizing healthy dogs.

According to Alexis Pugh director of Memphis Animal Services the dog kennels are at a 65% higher capacity than what’s typically expected a recent influx caused by an imbalance of intakes and adoptions of dogs.

The recent surge in dogs has come from confiscations from unfit environments in extreme weather conditions. Pugh speculates that adopting a pet may not be a priority to prospective adopters with the pressures of COVID and the upcoming school year.

To follow social distancing guidelines at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic MAS had to cut down on staff and as a result overwhelming the few kennel technicians available.

“When COVID restrictions started to lift in May June [of 2021] and we started not limiting the number of people in our building and bringing back more staff. It seemed like organically the demand for us to bring in or manage more animals just sort of followed with that. And so for the past several months we've really been you know seeing the numbers of animals coming in higher than we wanted to” Pugh said.

How to foster a dog

So how can you help?

“One of the most important ways and one of the biggest focuses within animal welfare now is really dramatically increasing the number of animals that are in your system that are out in foster homes” Pugh said.

Anyone 18 and older can foster a dog and anyone younger than 18 can foster with their parent or guardian’s authorization. MAS provides medical care food a crate leash and collar to foster homes.

“You don't have to be any kind of an expert. It is simply a matter of being willing to to be a part of the solution” Pugh says.

“If you have other pets at home. We will have you bring them up to the shelter if and we can do a meet and greet and make sure your foster pets going to get along with your owned pets. If you don't have any pets at home we try to be a support network through that so if there are questions concerns things you don't know about if you've never done this before that's okay.

The completion of the next-gen OPIR subsystems and payload CDR will allow Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace team to manufacture integrate and test the flight mission payload. Delivery to Lockheed Martin who is responsible for delivering the satellites for the geosynchronous orbit is scheduled for 2023.

In addition to developing a payload design for the Next-Gen GEO program Northrop Grumman was selected by the Space Force to design and develop two polar-orbiting Next-Gen OPIR space vehicles under a $2.37 billion contract from May 2020.

The first block of the new constellation will include five satellites three of which will be in geosynchronous orbit and two will be in polar orbit. Lockheed Martin will deliver the satellites for the geosynchronous orbit while Northrop Grumman will deliver polar orbit satellites.

“The Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace team brings deep mission expertise in missile warning and tracking to this program” said Scott Lee vice president and general manager payload and ground systems Northrop Grumman. “Together we’re delivering another generation of unblinking eyes in space as part of our nation’s strategic deterrence.”

As the successor to the space based infrared system (SBIRS) Next-Gen OPIR will provide an improved more resilient missile warning system to counter current and emerging threats.

The Next-Gen OPIR GEO satellites are being designed and built by Lockheed Martin. Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace are one of two teams selected by Lockheed Martin in 2018 to develop a competitive payload design for the program. Raytheon is the other competitor.

“Decades of mission experience with modern agile infrared sensor development are the hallmarks of the Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace team” said Deirdre Walsh vice president Strategic Operations Ball Aerospace. “This collaborative effort has enabled us to successfully execute the critical design review of the Next-Gen OPIR GEO Block 0 mission payload – a mission critical to our nation’s security.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Independent Order of St. Luke Annual Convention

August 20 1901 Beginnings of the Bank At the 1901 annual convention of the Independent Order of St. Luke (IOSL) Maggie Walker laid out her goals for her organization including the formation of a bank an emporium a newspaper and a factory. Of these objectives the creation of a bank was foremost in her mind. Banks represented the pinnacle of financial achievement to many people. To Walker a bank would combat the oppressive conditions of racial segregation while encouraging economic independence and thrift in the black community. Relegated to second-class citizenship African Americans were denied rights in all aspects of life: education employment politics and business. Walker's bank along with other black-owned businesses provided spaces to conduct business away from the racism and harsh treatment often found in white-owned businesses. Mrs. Walker's idea for a bank was not new. Several fraternal orders also opened banks in turn-of-the-century Richmond including the Grand Fountain of the United Order of the True Reformers. Led by William Washington Browne the True Reformers became one of the largest African American fraternal and business orders in America. In March of 1888 the True Reformers made history by receiving the first charter granted to African Americans to open a bank. Between 1888 and 1920 five other black-owned banks opened in Richmond including Walker's St. Luke Penny Savings Bank and the Mechanics Savings Bank which served as the main depository for another fraternal order the Knights of Pythias. Numerous reasons compelled African Americans to open and patronize banks within their own community. Racial stereotypes discouraged many white bankers from loaning money to African Americans fearing that loans would never be repaid. If black customers were issued loans they were often charged a higher rate of interest than white customers. While many white-owned banks accepted deposits from black customers some did not. These white bank managers feared that black customers would scare away white patrons. Mrs. Walker understood that using white-owned banks in such an environment merely served to ""feed the lion of prejudice."" By patronizing black-owned banks African Americans in Richmond kept money in their own community and gained economic empowerment. While Maggie Walker first announced her vision of a bank in 1901 it would take over two years to see the dream realized. During that time the Independent Order of St. Luke focused on recruiting new members financing and building a new headquarters and publishing the St. Luke Herald. The bank however was never far from Mrs. Walker's mind. St. Luke attorney James Hayes drew up the charter which was approved by Virginia's Corporation Commission on July 28 1903. Local newspapers carried the story many noting the distinction that the bank would be led by an African American woman. Walker's notoriety grew when the Virginia Banker's Association extended membership to her. This offer had not been extended to any of the other presidents of the black-owned banks in Richmond. She accepted the invitation and remarked ""I shall hope to conduct myself so as to reflect credit upon my race and people."" As the plans came together Walker used the network of St. Luke councils to promote the bank. At the annual IOSL convention in August of 1903 she encouraged each council to open an account and buy bank stock. She also urged each individual member to open an account. Walker realized that if the bank was to succeed she would need the full support of her fraternal community. The Executive Committee of the IOSL served as the initial Board of Directors for the bank. At the first board meeting held on August 19 1903 the group set an opening date for the business sold 200 shares of stock to the Grand Council of the IOSL and decided that most stock would be sold only to IOSL members. At another meeting held on August 21 the board approved the hiring of clerks and set their salaries. The board appointed Emmett C. Burke as cashier at a salary of $50 per month Mary Dawson as assistant cashier at $25 per month and Maggie Walker as president earning $25 a week for her work. To prepare herself for the position Walker spent two hours a day at the white-owned Merchants National Bank of Richmond studying procedures and operations of the bank. On November 2 1903 the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank opened for business at the St. Luke Headquarters Building at 900 St. James Street. While music played and speeches were given nearly 300 eager customers many of them members of the IOSL waited patiently to open bank accounts. While some people deposited more than one hundred dollars others started accounts with just a few dollars including one person who deposited just 31 cents. At the end of the day the bank had 280 deposits totaling over $8000 and sold $1247.00 worth of stock bringing the total to $9340.44. Mrs. Walker originally hoped for deposits exceeding $75000 but she was pleased with the first day's success. At the same time she recognized the hard work ahead to find success and security for the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank.

Maggie L. Walker and the officers of the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank c. 1917 Maggie L Walker National Historic Site The Bank Expansions and Successes In an attempt to encourage deposits by children Walker distributed penny banks among St. Luke families. Walker hoped the banks would teach children how to save their money and learn the importance of thrift. Once children had one hundred pennies in their bank they could open an account at the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. As a shrewd businesswoman Walker also realized that every penny counted and that each deposit opened by a child would help strengthen the bank. To further the success of the bank and expand the empire of the IOSL Walker recommended that the bank's Board of Directors purchase a building to house a department store and the bank. The vision of an emporium run by African American women was first vocalized by Walker in 1901 at the same time she announced her dream for the bank and the St. Luke Herald. As the bank slowly prospered the time seemed ripe for the IOSL to further its influence in Richmond. In September 1904 the IOSL purchased a building at 112 Broad Street to house the St. Luke Emporium and the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. The bank moved to this new location in October 1905. The bank would continue to grow steadily at this location. The year 1910 brought many changes not only to the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank but banks throughout the state. The Virginia General Assembly added legislation that required all state banks to be examined annually by the State Corporation Committee. This law resulted in the closure of a number of banks across the state. The St. Luke Penny Savings Bank however successfully passed the examination and continued to operate. One bank not so fortunate was the True Reformers Bank. The Corporation Committee ordered the closure of the bank in October of 1910. Unsecured loans lax operations and embezzlement by a clerk led to its downfall with most depositors losing their savings. The fall of the first black-owned bank in Richmond shattered the confidence of African Americans in the city.



Although St. Luke Penny Savings Bank remained financially healthy during this time the Emporium suffered from low sales. Likely in view of the department store's impending closure the bank's Board of Directors voted to erect a new bank building in 1910. Charles T. Russell one of the first black licensed architects in the state designed the plans. In November 1911 the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank opened its doors at the corner of First and Marshall Streets. That same month the St. Luke Emporium shut its doors for good.



While the bank continued to do moderately well it would never again see the growth experienced in the previous years. In 1920 two other black owned banks were chartered in Richmond-Commercial Bank and Trust and Second Street Savings Bank-creating more competition. In 1922 the Mechanics Savings Bank operated by John Mitchell Jr. was closed by the State Corporation Committee again causing confidence in black-owned banks to decline. By 1928 resources of the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank dropped below their 1926 totals. To save the bank and to ensure that depositors' assets were secure Walker took action. The Merging of Ideas to Survive Difficult Times In 1929 Walker met with officers and directors for the Second Street Savings Bank and the Commercial Bank and Trust to discuss a merger. While the Commercial Bank dropped out of discussions the two remaining banks adopted a resolution to merge. The new institution the Consolidated Bank and Trust opened for business on January 2 1930 at the 1st and Marshall Street location of the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. Still facing financial troubles Commercial Bank and Trust merged with Consolidated in 1931. Walker served as Chairman to the Board of Directors for Consolidated Bank and Trust a position she would hold until her death in 1934. While many banks did not survive the Great Depression Consolidated Bank and Trust not only survived but thrived into the twenty-first century. In 2005 Abigail Adams National Bank purchased Consolidated Bank and Trust ending Consolidated's distinction as a black-run independently-owned bank. It is believed to have been the oldest continuously black-owned bank in the country until then. In 2009 Premiere Bank merged with Abigail Adams. Two years later Consolidated Bank and Trust was renamed Premiere Bank. It still operates today at the corner of 1st and Marshall Streets. During its long history the bank founded by Maggie Walker benefited the African American community in Richmond. By 1920 for example it had issued more than 600 mortgages to black families allowing many to realize the dream of home ownership. It provided employment for African Americans giving some a chance to leave the menial labor intensive jobs to which African Americans were often relegated. More than anything the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank-turned-Consolidated Bank and Trust was a source of pride for black Richmonders. The bank served as a reminder of the lasting impact that Maggie Walker's vision and perseverance had on an entire community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlbmRpbmd0cmVlLmNvbS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMvYmVzdC9jYXNoLWFkdmFuY2UtY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Cash Advance Credit Cards in 2024 | LendingTree,"Citi is an advertising partner.

Financial emergencies happen to everyone — and usually at the worst possible time. When your car breaks down and it’s still five days until payday a cash advance may seem like a good idea because of its convenience. But you should avoid credit card cash advances because of their fees and high interest rates. Instead we recommend using a card with a long 0% intro APR so you can pay off large purchases over time without paying interest. Or you can take out a personal loan as a lower-cost option with more flexible terms.

There are lots of things that go into Met Gala prep. Kim Kardashian had to learn the art of breathing in a corset for example. If you’re Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That’s five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal’s the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use “at least” two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have “water as hot as you can take it.” Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then “drink tons of water” and “off to bed early.” Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there’s no way you wouldn’t be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that’s like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don’t think it’s a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel’s method could have negative side effects. “Overuse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose” she told the website.

Long story short you don’t need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and — I’m just guessing on this one — so will your pipes. (That much salt can’t be good for them right?)

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

“I was part of the fraternity that started Exodus 90” he notes “which has been the heart of my work over the past four years. Exodus 90 is a challenging 90-day period of prayer and asceticism supported by a fraternity of likeminded men. The 90-day framework is rooted in neurological research and the spirituality represents to men the ascetical tradition of the Desert Fathers of the third and fourth centuries.”

The goal of the program is to gradually and consistently achieve greater personal and spiritual freedom modeled after the story of the Israelites in Exodus. By the end men are less entangled with those things that might have enslaved them before.

“They are more focused on the essential” says Baxter “contemplation vocation and good work. The importance of our mission is in some way emphasized by recent negative examples. The Pennsylvania grand jury report and the chaos that has overcome the Church in its wake are what happens when men do not pray mortify their flesh or practice accountability.”

Baxter said he spent a lot of time looking outside the Church for successful business models and growth strategies and tried to implement them into the Exodus 90 mission. “I could only do that because I had confidence in the union of faith and reason” he says. “I made a series of decisions that most in the Church world would not immediately appreciate: Our brand mark is secular we spread first through digital strategies we didn’t make the program easier but called men on to a grander life. Looking back I think I did so because I knew that faith is the highest form of reasoning and our theological virtue operates at all times and upon everything if we are in the right position.”

Baxter calls his time in Catholic studies “a sheer grace” that “shaped my vision for life.” After four years in Catholic studies Baxter had the opportunity to study at the International Centre of Newman Friends at Littlemore Oxford. There he read Newman for a solid month. “During that time” he recalls “I distilled my Catholic Studies experience to one principle that I wanted to live from – that the Cross of Jesus Christ is the measure of everything. All truth unites in his face and no culture or subject or industry or experience is untinged by the fact of the Incarnation. This has considerably shaped my work and vocation to marriage. Reality is a gift from the hands of a God who is present. I did not know that before Catholic Studies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJ1Z2J5cGFwZXIuY28udWsvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MvMzQwNTcwL2V4ZXRlci1yb2ItYmF4dGVyLWtlZW4tb24tYXVzc2llLWdpYW50LXJ5YW4tbWNjYXVsZXkv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcnVnYnlwYXBlci5jby51ay9sYXRlc3QtbmV3cy8zNDA1NzAvZXhldGVyLXJvYi1iYXh0ZXIta2Vlbi1vbi1hdXNzaWUtZ2lhbnQtcnlhbi1tY2NhdWxleS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exeter boss Rob Baxter keen on Aussie giant McCauley,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 503 Server Error: Service Unavailable for url: https://www.therugbypaper.co.uk/latest-news/340570/exeter-rob-baxter-keen-on-aussie-giant-ryan-mccauley/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJ1Z2J5cGFwZXIuY28udWsvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MvMzQwNTcwL2V4ZXRlci1yb2ItYmF4dGVyLWtlZW4tb24tYXVzc2llLWdpYW50LXJ5YW4tbWNjYXVsZXkv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcnVnYnlwYXBlci5jby51ay9sYXRlc3QtbmV3cy8zNDA1NzAvZXhldGVyLXJvYi1iYXh0ZXIta2Vlbi1vbi1hdXNzaWUtZ2lhbnQtcnlhbi1tY2NhdWxleS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Nintendo obviously knows that and will certainly try to prevent that from happening. But even with preventive measures in place you can never be too cautious.

And recently a Best Buy employee whose area of expertise happens to be TVs and screens has said some things concerning how people could be more careful with the new Switch with an OLED screen.

Nintendo Switch OLED: tips to keep the screen safe

The first tip is just to play it safe and not keep the same image on the screen for a long time. If you have to pursue any activity away from Switch just switch it off. When you see shadows of parts of the previous screen/image looking like a ghost on your current screen that’s image retention. If you notice something like this reduce the brightness of the screen and ensure you turn off the device from time to time. This will give your device time to rest.

These are two ways to prevent image retention/burn-in.

Are retention and burn-in different?

As has been mentioned before preventive measures are in place but there are also things the user can do to alleviate the likelihood of facing burn-in or image retention issues.

Image retention is slightly different from image burn-in in the sense that it can lead to image burn-in issues. But more often than not the effects are temporary.

On the other hand image burn-in is permanent.

But they’re also similar in terms of how they occur. Both occur from keeping the same image on the screen for a long period of time. With image retention the long period of time could be as little as 10-15 mins. And with image burn-in it could mean days or weeks.

Be it photos files or applications storage requirements continue to grow. Instead of keeping up with those demands by deleting precious files or photos (or miscellaneous documents you don't remember creating) investing in an external drive is a move you won't regret making.

Aside from keeping extra files safe you can also use an external drive as a backup for your laptop or phone or even for extending your Xbox Series X or PS5 game storage. Whatever your needs is for buying an external storage solution we've got a pick for you. Here are the best HDDs and SSDs on the market.

HDD vs. SSD

Why you can trust Laptop Mag Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

Hard drive disks (HDD) traditional spinning hard drives are a much more affordable storage option. They use moving magnetic disks to store data while read/write heads manipulate data as needed. Because all of the data storage is physical you get the classic whirring sound as it operates. They also tend to be the larger option because of the space the spinning discs require. Unfortunately all the moving parts leave the device vulnerable to internal damage and transfer speeds are slow by today's standards.

Solid-state drives (SSD) on the other hand use an integrated circuit known as a microchip to store data. This means that they use electric pulses instead of moving parts to read write and store data. Without the need for moving parts SSDs process data much faster and can be built on a much more compact scale.

Why choose an HDD over an SSD?

Typically SSDs are the better choice for performance and portability. However this doesn’t always mean that they’ll be the right choice for you. While SSDs are becoming more affordable as they grow in popularity HDDs are a still much more affordable solution if you’re looking to store more “static” data. So if you’re just looking to store files such as documents photos and other files that aren’t needed on a day-to-day basis an HDD could be the perfect solution for you.

The WD My Passport Ultra HDD is a classic and affordable choice of an external hard drive that costs just $79. It’s a compact stylish storage solution for anyone looking to keep their essential photos or files within easy reach of their home setup but it's not great for traveling given the large design that lacks shock absorption. While it isn’t the most speedy solution offering top speeds of 115MB/s it’s reliable enough for storing large files.

3. Samsung T7 Touch Portable SSD The most secure external SSD Specifications Capacity: 500GB 1TB 2TB Interface: USB 3.2 Type-C Size: ‎3.4 x 2.2 x 0.3 inches Weight: 6.4 ounces Transfer Speed: Up to 1000 MB/s Color Options: Black Silver Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Reasons to buy + AES 256-bit encryption + Unlock with fingerprint OR password + Stylish design Reasons to avoid - Expensive - No water or dust resistance

Keeping information secure is the Samsung T7 Touch’s specialty. Whether you want to use it for personal or professional use the AES 256-bit encryption will keep your files private while a built-in fingerprint scanner provides quick access to your files. Keep in mind that software is required to set up the security features initially. After that it's relatively software-free. Aside from that the stylish brushed aluminum build also provides extra protection from impacts if dropped up to 6 feet which adds another layer of security to your device. However at $109 for 500GB of storage it does stray a little out of the budget-friendly ideal.

If you’re a creative professional on the go then you understand how hard it can be to cart around all of your editing software plus your documents and equipment. The LaCie rugged SSD Pro has you covered with 2TB storage speeds of up to 2800 MB/s and a build that’s both drop-resistant up to 3 meters and has an IP67 water-resistant rating. However $739 is a pretty penny to pay for 2TB of data and should really only be considered by those who can truly take advantage of its industry-leading high speeds and extra ruggedized protection.

It can hold up to 2TB in a convenient package that can easily be clipped into a keyring or carabiner to bring with you on all your adventures. And while it is disappointing that the USB port isn’t protected it does have an IP55 water and dust-resistant rating. SanDisk offers an older generation with transfer speeds up to 550MB/s starting at $72 for 250GB or the newer generation with up to 1000MB/s starting at $87 for 500GB.

Extra storage can be handy but it can get really expensive really fast. One of the more accessible options is the Seagate One Touch Portable HDD which starts at just $54 for 1TB. And while the transfer speeds aren't anything to write home about up to 5TB of storage and a 2-year data recovery plan are enough to make this thrifty external HDD more than worth the money. Just be sure to treat it with care because there's really no shock resistance built into the device.

The Samsung T7 is a stellar choice for those looking to upgrade their console station.

It’s a $59.99 wired model available in black or white that doesn’t feel all that different from Microsoft’s wireless controller. What little it does change design-wise is ultimately successful and I’ll get into all of that shortly. But I want to focus first on the Recon’s killer feature: customization.

When you plug headphones into its 3.5mm headphone jack the panel of buttons at the top of the Recon can be used to make a host of changes to your game and chat audio as well as your microphone. You can choose between four equalizer presets that range from focusing more on bass to a treble-dominated sound. Mic monitoring can be adjusted and you can opt to let more of your voice come through in your headphones if you want should they have a built-in mic or you can mute the mic altogether.

Not the slickest-looking controller $60 at Best Buy$60 at Amazon How we rate and review products

The Recon also lets you adjust the game audio and the chat volume independently with two rockers one at each side. (Note: the chat mix function works on Xbox consoles only not on PCs.) Turtle Beach even put in a “Superhuman Hearing” button — a signature feature from its headset lineup that emphasizes easy-to-miss sounds like footsteps doors opening and other key sounds that might help clue you in ahead of the competition.

Essentially the Recon brings must-have headset features to a controller lowering the barrier to entry for how many gaming accessories you need. That’s great and all but you’ll need patience and practice to conquer the inelegant button layout that enables these features and the others mentioned below. Everything works as intended but you’ll need to keep the instruction manual within reach.

These two rear buttons are mappable to any input outside of analog stick movement.

In addition to tweaking the sound the aforementioned buttons also let you make several adjustments to how the controller well controls. The Recon lets you map any function from the controller (aside from analog stick movement) to one of two macro buttons located behind the controller grips. The last feature is called Pro-Aim which lets you toggle between four levels of slowed-down sensitivity for the right-hand stick. When you activate the setting and toggle through the options to find your preferred level of sensitivity holding down the rear right macro button will slow the stick’s movement speed accordingly making it potentially easier to line up your shots compared. It works fantastically though it’s programmed to work only on the right rear button so it’ll overwrite a custom function if you’ve assigned one to the same button.

Rear buttons aside the Recon feels similar to the Microsoft Xbox controller that debuted alongside the Xbox Series X / S consoles. This wired version has rubber-coated grips and I really like that its shoulder buttons are completely covered in little raised dots that make them less slippery. (Microsoft’s controller has these too but they cover a smaller surface area on the buttons.) Turtle Beach includes a lengthy 10-foot braided cable so it should be able to work with most entertainment center arrangements.

It’s a small touch but I like that Turtle Beach completely covered the shoulder buttons in raised bumps for extra grip.

Compared again to Microsoft’s latest controller the Recon controller’s face buttons and triggers require a similar amount of force to press. The Recon’s sticks require a bit more force to click in. There’s also an eight-way d-pad that will feel like a big improvement if you’re still using the older Xbox wireless controller made during the Xbox One days. Otherwise you won’t notice much difference if you’ve used Microsoft’s new controller.

One final note: this controller supports rumble on Xbox consoles but PC support for rumble is very spotty. The Recon worked just fine on my PC with Death Stranding and Streets of Rage 4 but other titles that I tried didn’t provide rumble feedback.

If you already have a wireless controller and a wireless headset that you like the Recon controller isn’t really for you. It’s meant more for people who already own a set of headphones that they like and want to extend its capabilities without spending more than they need to. Despite Turtle Beach’s less-than-perfect execution with how to access its many customization features I’m still glad that those features exist in a $59.99 controller."

Everyone loves a bargain and investors certainly aren't immune to that desire. However there's a difference between cheap and underpriced stocks. ""Cheap"" is in the eye of the beholder. An underpriced stock though is one that has a lower share price than its fundamentals say it should.

Three such stocks that fit in the latter category all of which are connected in some way to diagnostic testing are Quest Diagnostics (DGX -0.58%) Hologic (HOLX -0.32%) and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO -4.16%).

Try Quest Diagnostics if you're seeking a deal

Quest Diagnostics is the world's largest provider of medical diagnostic services. Basically if your physician requests bloodwork on you the chances are pretty good (one in three according to Quest) that the company will analyze the test.

The stock us up more than 23% for the year yet its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a miserly 8.7. This is for a company that has three years of revenue growth including last year when a lot of medical tests were deferred.

Quest just reported its second-quarter earnings and through the first six months of the year it had revenue of $5.3 billion up 44% year over year. Net income jumped a reported 284% to $1.1 billion through six months. The company said in its outlook that it expects to have yearly revenue this year between $9.54 billion and $9.79 billion compared to $9.4 billion in 2020.

The reason Quest's stock isn't higher -- along with its P/E ratio -- is investors are concerned that once the pandemic ebbs the need for COVID-19 testing will subside. That has been a revenue driver for more than a year for Quest. However the delta variant's spread shows that the need for COVID-19 testing may likely remain steady or even increase at least through the end of the year as businesses and schools increase testing requirements for employees and students to return.

Looking past that as the pandemic eases more typical medical procedures and testing will likely pick up. Quest has been a consistent stock whose total return has outperformed the S&P 500 Healthcare and Equipment Services Index three of the past five years including last year.

Hologic keeps growing revenue

Hologic focuses on women's health through the early detection of cervical sexual and vaginal issues. The company operates in four segments: breast health diagnostics GYN surgical and skeletal health and makes a variety of diagnostic detection and surgical products from assays to mammography systems and radiographs. The company's stock is up over 4% for the year but despite that it has a P/E ratio of only 9.7.

Hologic's stock hasn't fully rebounded yet from a second-quarter earnings miss despite reporting very strong third-quarter numbers.

Like Quest Hologic is active in COVID-19 testing but according to Hologic CEO Steve MacMillan it has seen an upswing in more traditional healthcare procedures.

In the third quarter the company reported revenue of $1.17 billion up 42% year over year and earnings per share of $1.04 up 96.2% compared to the third quarter in 2020. While diagnostics the segment that includes revenue from Hologic's COVID-19 assays was up 25% the growth in the other segments was more pronounced. GYN surgical was up 148.4% skeletal health grew 70.4% and breast health was up 55.8%. All three of those groups are bouncing back after being slowed by the pandemic last year.

Through nine months the company reported revenue of $3.8 billion already surpassing last year's total for the year of $3.78 billion and making it the 11th consecutive year Hologic has grown revenue. Through nine months the company also lists net income of $1.5 billion more than double the $616 million it reported last year through nine months.

Bio-Rad Laboratories keeps trending upward

Bio-Rad stock is up more than 29% for the year but even with that growth its P/E ratio is a tiny 5.6. The life science research and clinical diagnostics company's stock has grown annual revenue for five consecutive years giving investors a total return of 410.6% over that period.

Bio-Rad has diagnostic tests for nearly everything from veterinary care to food-borne pathogens and CRISPR gene-editing kits.

The company reported second-quarter revenue of $715.9 million up 33.4% year over year with gross margin increasing to 56.1% compared to 54.6 in the same period in 2020.

Bio-Rad's revenue streams are diverse. Chief Financial Officer Ilan Daskal on the company's second-quarter earnings call said that it made $68 million from COVID-19 testing in the quarter which represented about 9.5% of its total revenue.

The one downside in the quarterly report was that net income of $914.1 million was down from $966.4 million in the same period in 2020. That drop was related to changes in the company's Sartorius holdings management said. Taking a further look back at the company's comparative six-month numbers the company reported $1.89 billion in net income compared to $1.65 billion the year before.

A difficult decision

Of the three healthcare stocks Bio-Rad's low valuation diversity beyond COVID-19 testing and history of total return growth make it the most enticing stock for me. But in reality all three stocks should do well as things reopen as none of them are too dependent on COVID-19 testing. Quest's sheer size gives it some advantages of scale and its lower multiple gives it the edge to me over Hologic though that company has the longest track record of revenue increases.",,,,,,,,,,,,

From the late-1700s onward the healthy and the infirm sought out the mineral and thermal springs in the southern Appalachian Range: one group for social relaxation and the other hoping to “take the cure” for one malady or another.

Today only a handful of those once-highly-favored destinations survive most others having fallen victim to fires evolving social patterns the automobile era and more reliable medicines.

One such summer destination was the Union Chalybeate Springs established c.1830s nearby the corners of Albemarle Augusta and Rockingham counties that coincide on the summit of the Blue Ridge. Its name and condition changed through the years with its varied owners but since 1869 it was more commonly known as Black Rock Springs.

The most storied era in that summer resort’s history 1885–1909 began with a land purchase made by what some may have considered an unlikely group of investors. In August 1890 the Rockingham Register wrote “The springs are in a cul-de-sac of the moun­tains and are owned by a company of farmers from Rockingham Albemarle Augusta and Greene counties originally bought by a company of twenty who conveyed to the Black Rock Springs Improve­ment Company 100 acres of land including the springs. The balance of the purchase comprising over 1400 acres of rich mineral land was retained by the original company. The spring grounds were divided into lots roads and promenades and cabins erected around an elliptical drive-way. There are over twenty cabins—as they are called here; elsewhere they would be termed cottages—already erected and a good hotel capable of entertaining over fifty guests.

“This ho­tel is managed by Mr. Wm. P. Mayo of Charlottesville who has for a number of years been the manager of the University of Va. boarding house. The terms are very moderate $25 per month; $7.50 per week; $1.50 per day. These terms are certainly moderate enough but this resort was built ‘of the farmers by the farmers and for the farmers.’

“There are two small stores on the ground ten pin alley &c. a magnifi­cent ball room and during the season danc­ing every night. There are at pres­ent between two and three hundred on the grounds the majority of who are from the neighboring counties with a sprinkling from other States and by the 10th every cabin will be filled.

“Balls parties high teas walks ten-pin parties cards visiting glee clubs trout fishing and hunting are some of the pleasures indulged in. The Friday night balls are a feature of the springs and attract large crowds from adjoining counties.”

Sattie Della (Good) Mundy lived near Port Republic in Rockingham County. She said “My father [John M. Good (1854–1936)] and his brother owned one lot that was on the lower row and they had a cabin two rooms upstairs and two down for bedrooms. They had a big long shed kitchen that ran the length of the whole house and had their horses tethered in along the backside of the cabin.

“There was a big platform there close to the springs and they had a long trough that all the people who lived there brought their milk their butter their fruit or what have you and put it in containers in that trough of water. That preserved it ’til they could get it used.

“We would go in the summer time. The families would load up their vehicle with vegetables and go and stay two weeks but not all of them at one time. There’d have to be somebody to take care of the farm. They’d milk cows. They didn’t milk to sell milk cream or anything but they always had cows on the farm. They were all farmers and there were things that had to be tended to. The family would divide up and different ones go. Then they would leave and somebody else would come in the cabin.”

Minor C. Miller (1889–1968) of Mt. Sidney Augusta County wrote “My grandfather’s cottage had four main rooms and a kitch­en and most of the other cottages had been built on the same plan. All of the cottages had wide porches. There were easy chairs couches hammocks and a fair amount of read­ing matter. Kerosene lamps and lanterns gave light but when the sun had gone down and supper had been digested most people thought about going to bed. It was always possible for men and women to assemble on the porches and talk about the experiences of the day or other things of common interest or to plan for short or long hikes the next day. People came to Black Rock Springs to find a change in the daily routine of life and Black Rock Springs gave them just that.

“There were always lots of children at the springs. Most of them were the grandchildren of the people who sat on the porches. I remember carriage-loads of cousins and a few invited friends who made weekly visits to the springs and brought their ‘folks’ good things to eat and enough to last through next week.”

Staunton’s Vindicator newspaper noted in August 1899 “Black Rock Springs resort seems to be on a boom. Great trains of wagons and buggies are coming and going daily. This is the farmers retreat. After the hard summer’s work is over they come here for a much needed rest and if there is a place on earth that a man can rest it is at these springs for there is nothing here to disturb his peace of mind.”

“My parents and my grandparents descended from a long line of industrious and hard-working people” continued Minor Miller “but they usually found time to give a proper concern to things or values which were generally regarded as belonging to the lighter side of life. My father and mother enjoyed the quiet life which they had together in the mountains. They enjoyed reading and being out of doors. With each succeeding year they looked forward eagerly to going to the springs.”

Following its total destruction by fire in November 1909 Black Rock Springs was rebuilt to a degree but never regained its earlier charm. By 1932 having been unceremoniously absorbed inside the borders of Shenandoah National Park it passed into pleasant memory shared only by those who had experienced its former pleasures.

Hello Sunshine Deal Points To Bold New Era In Media M&A: “We Have Money To Spend And It’s A Relative World”,"Hollywood and media industry financing sources have tended to be cyclical with new money refreshing the old every few years. The current cycle of private equity investment though is bucking that history and could extend the M&A wave for years to come dealmakers say.

Transactions like the $900 million takeover of Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine via a partnership between Blackstone and former Disney execs Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs set tongues wagging. The sky-high valuation (reportedly at more than seven times revenue) for a company with few owned assets prompted speculation about froth in the market. Still virtually any firm with a claim to any intellectual property is believed to be for sale either wholesale or in parts. Among the sellers are LeBron James’ SpringHill Imagine and Legendary. Even though the deal doesn’t rely on private funds Amazon’s pending $8.45 billion acquisition of MGM shows the nearly insatiable appetite for content in a mushrooming streaming marketplace.

“The private equity mentality is ‘We have money to spend and it’s a relative world'” said David Lazarus a partner at real estate investment bank Eastdil Secured in an interview with Deadline. The bank has worked with Blackstone and a number of other PE firms on transactions in real estate another booming sector. Among its projects is Wildflower Studios a $400 million soundstage complex in Astoria Queens that is backed by Robert De Niro.

“Just as they believe with biotech they believe there’s a real opportunity” in entertainment added Stephen Somer a managing director at Eastdil. “The model has evolved from distribution – a ‘push’ format – to a ‘feed’ format where consumers say what they want to watch when they want to watch it.” Technology he continued “is the big driver. We don’t see this slowing down anytime soon.”

Macroeconomic conditions are helping to pump oxygen into the deal furnace. Interest rates are near all-time lows and the economy has rebounded from a Covid-19 recession that lasted mere months. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has indicated recently that the central bank may raise rates in 2023 but for the moment it is using other levels to control the threat of inflation.

“Borrowing is cheap” noted one veteran of the M&A trenches who spoke to Deadline on the condition that he not be identified due to his ties to a number of current deals. Private equity firms have also been opened up to individual investors one reason the amount of private funding in search of a home has reached a record $1.5 trillion. “People have committed to funds but they’re not drawn down so they’re looking for deals” the dealmaker continued. “There’s a lot of money that’s looking to come off the sidelines and into the game. And in the content space you have a frenzy with streamers looking for more content.”

Between late-2019 and March 2021 six major streaming services lit up from Apple Disney NBCUniversal WarnerMedia Discovery and ViacomCBS. A seventh — Quibi — fizzled out quickly but not before vacuuming up $1.75 billion in start-up capital. Streaming players chasing Netflix and Amazon Prime Video a 180-degree strategic turn from when they were content to sell their programming to them are no longer constrained by shelf space. A popular franchise can be exploited in more directions than ever.

Financiers are paying close heed to the evolution of the marketplace looking for upside. “As PE firms deploy their dry powder” consulting firm Deloitte noted in a recent report “they appear to be taking a very close look at the future prospects of target businesses and portfolio companies.” Their involvement is also occurring against a backdrop of industry consolidation with mergers like AT&T-Time Warner Disney-Fox and Discovery-Scripps in recent years creating fewer large players even as consumer demand increases.

Unlike in past financing cycles which propped up media and entertainment businesses that operated by their own clubby rules Hollywood is now chasing Big Tech. Investing in Hello Sunshine puts Blackstone and its partners in the podcasting and streaming business effectively in the mix with Spotify Apple and Amazon. While that is hardly a guarantee of success it is a more appealing prospect than that of previous eras when the risk of being the “dumb money” in a Hollywood deal was ever-present.

Echoing comments from Mayer and Staggs after the Hello Sunshine was announced Lazarus points out “Streamers have much more data … That makes an operation like Hello Sunshine interesting. It has a particular audience.” Reese’s Book Club launched by Witherspoon in 2017 is showing Oprah Winfrey-like potential with 2 million Instagram followers. “They have great data feedback from viewership.”

Skeptics of the boom say it is nothing more than fulfilment of former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan’s famous caution about the “irrational exuberance” of early internet investors. They point to recent sideways movement in the oversaturated U.S. SPAC market as a sign that the good times can’t last. These special-purpose acquisition companies also known as “blank-check” firms took 248 companies public in 2020 more than quadruple the level of 2019. (Mayer and Staggs are among many media vets in the SPAC game along with former CBS CEO Joe Ianniello BuzzFeed and former Hollywood execs Harry Sloan and Jeff Sagansky.)

The structure of SPACs which have come and gone in prior economic cycles is more inherently risky given their two-year time horizon for investors. Market conditions have to be right for public offerings. Endeavor the content and agency giant backed by Silver Lake and other private funds finally had its IPO last spring after opting to pull it back in the fall of 2019 citing market coditions. A SPAC deal for Vice Media recently stalled over concerns from investors about valuation. Bidding wars among SPACs became counter-productive prompting investors to look to emerging markets overseas “People are finding two Stanford dropouts with a twinkle in their eye and a plan to colonize Venus and giving them $2 billion” Callaway Capital Management founder Daniel Freifeld told the Wall Street Journal.

Somer distinguishes the open playing field for private equity generally from the specific mandate of a SPAC saying the former is less constrained by market fluctuations or other factors. “When conditions are improving or conditions are deteriorating there’s opportunity” he said.

While there are still doubters about the durability of the private equity wave for Hollywood veterans licking their wounds over Netflix’s disruptive rise to dominance it is a welcome development. Worldwide private equity assets under management are predicted to reach $5.8 trillion by 2025 according to Deloitte which would be a doubling in a decade. “There are only so many companies with a track record of creating great content” the dealmaking vet observed. “If they come to be known as a reliable supplier they’ll get bought.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWluc2lkZXIvbmV3LXlvcmstZmlybXMtYmV0dGluZy1iaWxsaW9ucy1vbi1zdHJpcC1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS0yNDE1Mjk1L9IBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWluc2lkZXIvbmV3LXlvcmstZmlybXMtYmV0dGluZy1iaWxsaW9ucy1vbi1zdHJpcC1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS0yNDE1Mjk1L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York firms betting billions on Strip real estate,"Vici Properties and The Blackstone Group are emerging as two of the biggest players on Las Vegas Boulevard.

You won’t see their names on Las Vegas Boulevard marquees and you may not have even heard of them.

But two heavyweight firms Vici Properties and The Blackstone Group are emerging as two of the biggest players on the Strip.

Their role? Collecting rent.

Vici a Caesars Entertainment spinoff announced a $17.2 billion deal Wednesday to acquire MGM Resorts International spinoff MGM Growth Properties giving Vici real estate ownership of many of the biggest hotel-casinos on the Strip.

Blackstone has its own growing portfolio of hotels on Las Vegas Boulevard and overall the two companies are slated to own more than a dozen megaresorts combined along the famed casino corridor mostly as landlords.

All this wheeling and dealing probably has little if any effect on guests at the properties or any immediate impact on the employees other than changing where companies send their rent checks.

But the two New York firms are betting billions that tourism here will thrive — and that casino operators can pay a fortune in rent.

‘On time and in cash’

Vici a casino landlord and Blackstone a financial conglomerate are buying hotels as Las Vegas bounces back from the still-raging coronavirus outbreak which dealt a catastrophic economic blow to Southern Nevada.

The pandemic temporarily turned the Strip into a ghost town of shuttered resorts last year sparked huge job losses in the casino-heavy region and kept people home and away from crowds for fear of getting infected devastating the tourism industry.

The landlords’ line of business however seems to be fine.

Vici CEO Ed Pitoniak said on a conference call Wednesday that both MGM Growth and his company have collected “100 percent of our rent so far through COVID on time and in cash.”

Vici’s real estate holdings include Caesars Palace and Harrah’s Las Vegas. In early March it also announced a deal with Apollo Global Management to purchase The Venetian Palazzo and Sands Expo and Convention Center for about $6.25 billion from casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp. with Vici acquiring the real estate and Apollo buying the operations side. The deal is expected to close early next year.

With its purchase of MGM Growth Vici is buying several MGM Resorts-operated properties including The Mirage Park MGM Luxor New York-New York and Excalibur.

Betting billions

Blackstone not only dropped $1.73 billion in 2014 for The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas it also has a history of multibillion-dollar real estate deals with MGM Resorts.

As announced in early July Blackstone is buying the Aria and Vdara hotels for nearly $3.9 billion and leasing them back to MGM. Blackstone also partnered with MGM Growth on a $4.6 billion deal early last year to acquire the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay’s real estate and lease them back to MGM Resorts with Vici saying this week it will retain MGM Growth’s stake in the venture.

Moreover Blackstone bought the Bellagio in 2019 for about $4.2 billion from MGM Resorts and leased it back.

As you can imagine leasing a resort with thousands of rooms is not cheap. The Bellagio sale for instance called for an initial annual rent of $245 million.

Las Vegas’ tourism industry has by no means fully recovered from the pandemic and the public health crisis is far from over. But the local economy has come a long way since the early chaos of the outbreak and Las Vegas is still a place where people spend big on hotels — not to mention gambling and booze.

“As much as parents like to spend money on their kids whether in Orlando and other locations I don’t think anybody’s ever spent $10000 on a bottle of apple juice” Pitoniak said this week.

The Review-Journal is owned by the family of Dr. Miriam Adelson the majority shareholder of Las Vegas Sands Corp. Las Vegas Sands operates The Venetian Palazzo and Sands Expo and Convention Center.

How she made her fortune,"Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon is to sell her media company Hello Sunshine to private equity firm Blackstone Group. The stunning deal which was just announced is valued at around US$900 million cementing her place as one of Hollywood’s most successful female entrepreneurs.

In the industry from a relatively young age Witherspoon has grown from young teenage film star to blockbuster Hollywood actress and has worn numerous other hats since then including entrepreneur book club founder and Draper James clothing line owner to name but a few. As a result she’s managed to build an empire that’s all her own and has amassed enviable wealth in the process.

The actress is now worth around US$400 million according to Forbes. Let’s take a look at all her various income streams.

Star of the big and small screen

Ritherspoon’s breakthrough role as high school student Annette Hargrove in teen romantic drama Cruel Intentions bagged the actress a not-too-shabby US$250000 at the time and certainly got her noticed.

But it wasn’t until the phenomenal success of Legally Blonde that Witherspoon reached global superstardom – and her pay cheques skyrocketed into the millions. She brought home US$15 million for her role in Legally Blonde 2: Red White & Blonde and US$12.5 million for starring in 2002’s romantic comedy Sweet Home Alabama.

Such seven figure pay cheques became the standard for Witherspoon to play the lead in subsequent films such as Four Christmases and Walk the Line with the latter winning her an Academy Award for best actress.

In 2016 she made a move into television executive producing and acting in Big Little Lies – and reportedly earning at least US$1 million per episode. She raked even more per episode (US$1.2 million) for Apple TV’s The Morning Show.

Media company mogul

In addition to her successful acting career Witherspoon is also a visionary businesswoman. Establishing her first media company Type A Films back in 2000 in a bid to produce quality films for young women the company then became Pacific Standard and finally Hello Sunshine through a series of successful mergers.

Thanks to her aptitude for great stories her production company has brought to life many critically acclaimed box office hits such as Gone Girl Wild Little Fires Everywhere and The Dry.

Book club guru

Hello Sunshine operates a number of subsidiaries including the online and now mobile-app-based Reese’s Book Club which has more than two million followers on Instagram alone.

Many of the Club’s favourite picks have turned into bestselling books and then films produced by Hello Sunshine later on leading some to compare her to Oprah Winfrey

Then there’s fashion beauty and even property

Along the line Witherspoon added a ready-to-wear clothing line called Draper James to her business portfolio which immediately secured US$10 million in funding from Forerunner Ventures and two other investors after launching in 2015.

Witherspoon has also earned plenty of cash from being brand ambassador for several companies including Amyris’s Biossance Crate & Barrel Elizabeth Arden and Avon. And she’s netted great returns on some of her real estate investments in the past few years.

For example she reportedly sold her Malibu farm for US$6.7 million in late 2020 making a profit of almost half a million dollars after owning it for just one year. She is currently believed to own several other estates including in her hometown of Nashville as well as in Tennessee Malibu and the Bahamas.

The airliner made a three-sector 7567-nm trip from Seattle to Shanghai to start validation flight trials with Chinese aviation safety officials.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zdGFybGluZXItaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1jb250aW51ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starliner investigation continues,"WASHINGTON — Boeing is continuing its investigation into the thruster issue that delayed the launch of its CST-100 Starliner commercial crew vehicle but could soon run into schedule conflicts on both the International Space Station and with its launch vehicle.

In an Aug. 6 statement Boeing said it was continuing to study why several valves in the propulsion system of the spacecraft were unexpectedly in the closed position during the countdown to the Aug. 3 launch attempt of the Orbital Flight Test (OFT) 2 mission an uncrewed test flight. Boeing scrubbed the launch about three hours before the scheduled liftoff because of the problem.

The Starliner atop its Atlas 5 rocket is back in the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) at Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral allowing engineers access to the spacecraft. They were able to open some valves by issuing a new set of commands.

“Cautiously optimistic is a good way to describe how the team is feeling” John Vollmer Boeing vice president and commercial crew program manager said in a statement.

What caused the valves to malfunction isn’t clear although Boeing said in an earlier statement that they had ruled out software problems. One possibility is damage such as water intrusion during a severe thunderstorm shortly after the rocket was rolled out to the pad Aug. 2.

Neither NASA nor Boeing have set a new launch date for the OFT-2 mission. Boeing said in its statement that it is “assessing multiple launch opportunities for Starliner in August” and will work with NASA and United Launch Alliance to determine an appropriate launch date.

NASA in its own statement Aug. 6 said it and Boeing “will continue to evaluate schedules based on where the troubleshooting efforts take them before deciding when the next official launch for the OFT-2 mission will take place.”

A combination of factors could force an extended delay if the OFT-2 mission does not launch by late August. A Falcon 9 is scheduled to launch the CRS-23 cargo mission to the ISS Aug. 28. It will use the same docking port as Starliner will for OFT-2 meaning that if OFT-2 does not complete its mission by late August NASA will either have to postpone CRS-23 or wait until that mission is done likely no earlier than late September.

By that point however ULA will need to focus on preparations for its next Atlas 5 launch NASA’s Lucy asteroid mission. That mission has a three-week launch window that opens in mid-October. The Atlas 5 for OFT-2 would have to be “de-stacked” and the one for Lucy assembled in the VIF with the spacecraft then installed and tested. Given the narrow window for Lucy additional testing of the vehicle is likely to find any problems well ahead of the opening of the launch window.

An additional complication is that this will be taking place during the height of the tropical weather season with the potential for tropical storms and hurricanes delaying launches or launch preparations by days.

If OFT-2 does not launch by the time its Atlas 5 needs to be de-stacked to prepare for the Lucy mission the next opportunity may not be until November after the SpaceX Crew Dragon Crew-3 mission launches at the end of October and the Crew-2 mission returns home freeing up a docking port for Starliner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvZ2xvYmFsLWVjb25vbXkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTQ0MDk1L2FpcmJ1cy1lZGdlLW92ZXItYm9laW5nLWNoaW5hLXVuZGVyLXRocmVhdC1jb21hY3MtbmV3LWM5MTnSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2dsb2JhbC1lY29ub215L2FydGljbGUvMzE0NDA5NS9haXJidXMtZWRnZS1vdmVyLWJvZWluZy1jaGluYS11bmRlci10aHJlYXQtY29tYWNzLW5ldy1jOTE5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could Boeing and Airbus have their wings clipped by China’s C919 jet?,"China has spent tens of billions of dollars to bring its aviation industry up to international standards in recent years and has high hopes in particular for its C919 a narrow body medium-haul passenger jet designed to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. It is expected to be certified to fly in China by the end of this year.

Both Airbus and Boeing assemble jets in China for the domestic market savvy political moves to help them each carve out a portion of the nation’s vast and rapidly growing aviation market. But they will soon have to share the spotlight with Comac a company that has a built-in advantage in dealing with Chinese airlines.

Despite investing heavily in aircraft assembly facilities in China Airbus may soon see its edge over rival Boeing eaten away as the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) is expected to enter the narrow-body plane market with its C919 jet next year.

In November 2020 Boeing estimated Chinese airlines would acquire 8600 new aeroplanes valued at US$1.4 trillion and commercial aviation services valued at $1.7 trillion over the next 20 years. Both Boeing and Airbus have stepped up their presence in China to try to secure a piece of the pie.

Airbus has provided China Eastern Airlines with single aisle A320 family jets from its Tianjin assembly line for years and last month delivered its first A350 widebody passenger jet.

The Tianjin assembly line which was established in 2008 is a joint venture between Airbus the Tianjin Free Trade Zone and the state-owned aerospace and defence company China Aviation Industry Corporation

“Given the expected future strength of the Chinese market and the rise of Comac it is strategically highly important for Airbus to maintain its strong local presence” said John Strickland director of the aviation consultancy JLS Consulting.

While assembly plants are only a small part of the manufacturing process analysts say having in-country facilities is important to win business in the critical Chinese aviation market.

China is already about 25 per cent of the global market. They both need to be there Andrew Charlton

Airbus has a first mover advantage over Boeing which only set up its first assembly plant in Zhoushan Zhejiang province in 2018 in a joint venture with Comac.

Despite the global pandemic Airbus delivered 99 planes to China last year and 64 more in the first half this year.

“Assembly plants in China are very important to both Airbus and Boeing” said Andrew Charlton managing director of Aviation Advocacy.

“China is already about 25 per cent of the global market. They both need to be there.”

But he added the C919 will “eat into their narrow-body jet market” and the international aviation giants are likely to place more focus on their widebody planes for which Comac does not yet have an answer.

While investing in an assembly facility is vital to growing business in China there is no guarantee it will help navigate political tensions.

Boeing’s sales in the world’s second largest economy have taken a dive amid growing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. The company’s 737 MAX is also still grounded in China after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2019.

Boeing’s president and chief executive David Calhoun said in an earnings call on July 28 he anticipated the narrow body passenger jet would be recertified in China by the end of this year.

Before China grounded the 737 MAX in March 2019 after the second fatal crash Boeing was selling a quarter of the planes it built annually to Chinese buyers.

As evidence of progress a Boeing 737 MAX jet departed the United States for China on Wednesday to conduct a flight test as part of efforts to gain approval from Chinese authorities Reuters reported.

“I’m very encouraged about the constructive nature of [recertifying the 737 MAX in China] … hopefully bigger trade issues don’t get in the way. I don’t believe they will. Both sides are incentivised for this industry to move forward” Calhoun told analysts on the call.

“I don’t want to imply that anything is risk-free on this front. It’s not it never will be. Especially as it relates to China relations which are real. ”

Beijing wants to reduce its reliance on imports and become a world leader in aviation manufacturing something made clear in – among other policy documents – its “Made in China 2025” industrial modernisation plan.

As a result Airbus and Boeing are also likely to be careful with their outsourcing strategy said David Yu professor of finance at New York University Shanghai and an aviation financing expert.

“The point is not to outsource everything the point is to have some items completed in these facilities” he said. “From a manufacturing point of view it’s about intellectual property protection and the safeguarding of that.

“The point is to develop a long-term perspective on China to grow relations with stakeholders the airlines and regulators such as Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) – it’s helping them to get planes here.”

In June the US and the European Union (EU) agreed to a truce in their near 17-year conflict over subsidies to Boeing and Airbus and to establish a working group to address “non-market practises” in other countries most notably China.

The truce is unlikely to see Boeing and Airbus cooperate but could allow them to focus on dealing with new threats like Comac said Yu.

Airbus and Boeing have so far favoured working with Comac rather than against it because of the huge size of China’s aviation market Charlton said.

Both companies have also accepted that competition with the state-owned firm is inevitable when the C919 comes into service.

“That Airbus is ahead of Boeing is in no small measure a political thing not a technology thing” Charlton said. “For Airbus to start too with the A350 which is a widebody means there is no direct competition and is politically astute.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHA6Ly9hc2lhdGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvYm9laW5nLWV5ZXMtY2hpbmEtZ3JlZW4tbGlnaHQtZm9yLXRyb3VibGVkLTczNy1tYXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing eyes China green light for troubled 737 MAX,"The problem plagued Boeing 737 MAX which was involved in two deadly crashes is back flying in Europe and North America.

The world’s top aviation regulators such as the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Transport Canada (TC) have since OK’d it for commercial use after the company reportedly dealt with all the issues related to aircraft safety.

However the elephant in the room — the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) — is one of the last major aviation bodies that has yet to reapprove its operation.

According to a report at Aerotime Hub online Boeing may still be facing a rocky path to gain approval for its 737 MAX to return to China but progress was reported this week.

On August 4 one Boeing 737 MAX aircraft reportedly departed to conduct a key test flight in China — a step towards aircraft’s return in one of the most significant markets.

According to insider sources quoted by Reuters “Boeing and the Chinese aviation body scheduled recertification flights and testing in the coming days.”

China was the first country to ground the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2019 after two deadly crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia claimed 346 lives.

It would end up being grounded for 20 lengthy months causing havoc with Boeing’s financial picture and drawing the ire of US legislators in Washington who did not hold back their disgust for the aircraft giant’s highly paid executives.

It is estimated that to date the grounding may have cost Chicago-based Boeing at least US$20 billion.

The operational approval by the Chinese authorities plays a significant role for Boeing since China is a crucial aerospace market the report said. A green light from China would go a long way toward the plane’s eventual commercial success.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has warned that an extended impasse between the US and China over long-simmering trade issues will have competitive consequences for the largest American exporter Bloomberg reported.

CEO David Calhoun said Boeing has carried out a “top-to-bottom” overhaul and “turned the place upside down” as it learned lessons internally from two deadly crashes. Credit: Boeing.

“We can’t afford to be locked out of that market. Our competitor will jump right in” Calhoun said of European rival Airbus during an aviation summit hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce in June.

“Nothing good comes from restricted trade.”

Calhoun praised the Biden administration for making progress with the European Union to end aircraft tariffs while acknowledging the complex disagreements with China will be far tougher to untangle Bloomberg reported.

“I hope we can separate intellectual property and rights from trade and continue to encourage a free-trade environment between these two economic juggernauts” Calhoun said. “I think it’s critically important.”

Beijing increasingly faces tensions with the West over its treatment of ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang and has warned foreign companies not to step into politics.

Meanwhile the UK’s SkyNews reported that the 737 MAX fleet has been placed under a safety directive by US regulators over fire-related concerns.

The FAA said all Boeing MAX planes and some other 737 models were affected by the precautionary measure.

The watchdog — itself hugely criticized last year for its oversight of the MAX fleet in its development stages — said on Thursday that the aircraft may have a failed electronic flow control in the air conditioning packs that vent air into the hold from other areas of the plane.

The directive prohibits operators from transporting cargo in the cargo hold if airplanes are operating with this condition unless they can verify items are non-flammable and non-combustible.

The airworthiness directive impacts 663 airplanes registered in the US and approximately 2204 worldwide the FAA said.

It potentially means that operators would be unable or struggle to take passenger baggage in the hold at the height of the holiday season.

Production for the GWM dual inverter is currently underway with and without a DC/DC converter option which was launched on several 2021 GWM models. The project with the other major Chinese OEM is planned for 2023 models.

BorgWarner’s dual inverter range combines different power electronic technologies into one compact package. A single unit can control and drive two electric motors while delivering cost and weight reductions as well as enabling flexible packaging and easier installations. Additionally BorgWarner’s dual inverter provides propulsion energy generation and re-capturing of energy in hybrid powertrains.

iDM220 integrated drive module. BorgWarner also recently announced it will be supplying its iDM220 integrated drive module to a leading Chinese luxury New Energy Vehicle (NEV) brand. After the recent award of an iDM for a Korean customer this is now the first business in China. The start of production for this business will be in Q1 2023.





Designed developed and manufactured by BorgWarner the iDM220 is a high-performance electric drive system. Operating at 400V it also addresses upcoming market needs and allows for performance upgrades. The solution combines high-efficiency motor-controller technology with BorgWarner’s award-winning hairpin stator winding technology and advanced transmission system in a scalable compact package that empowers global automakers to produce cleaner and more efficient vehicles.

The advanced electric drive product offers a high degree of integration high efficiency and smooth and quiet operation while also delivering exceptional performance through its hairpin-wound stator motor technology.

The iDM incorporates an electric motor with a compact stator with an outer diameter of 220 mm and integrates a gearbox and 400V silicon-based inverter significantly reducing the weight and size of the entire system.

All of the components used in the iDM are part of BorgWarner’s technology portfolio and available either as a fully integrated module or as stand-alone solutions for new energy vehicles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzUyNTIwMS9mb3JkLW1hY2hlLXJlYXItZHJpdmUtdW5pdC_SAUFodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWV2cy5jb20vbmV3cy81MjUyMDEvZm9yZC1tYWNoZS1yZWFyLWRyaXZlLXVuaXQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sandy Munro Examines Ford Mustang Mach-E's Rear Drive Unit,"The latest episode of Munro Live is about the Ford Mustang Mach-E's rear-drive unit which consists of a permanent magnet electric motor single-speed planetary gearbox and silicon carbide (SiC) inverter.

One of the first things that Munro Live's Sandy Munro noted is the housing for the motor as well as an extra part for electric connections inside. We guess that it's kind of a universal approach to handle various motors and components from various suppliers.

Let's remember that the Integrated Drive Modules (iDM) comes from BorgWarner:

""The iDM consists within one compact assembly a BorgWarner thermal-management system (liquid cooling) lubrication solution and single-speed gearbox (with a park module) integrated with a motor and power electronics from other (undisclosed) suppliers.""

According to Sandy Munro a lot of elements could be removed or at least designed better to allow easier service.

One of the most interesting things is the discussion about the inverter assembly which turns out to be extremely complex.

Overall the drive units of the Mach-E do not excite Munro Live like some of the other things in the electric Ford. It appears that there is tremendous room for improvement in the future - maybe when Ford develops its own solution instead of using off the shelf components.

In brief India’s contract research organizations (CROs) are no longer just low-cost compound synthesizers. Over the past 15 years they have asserted themselves as world-class chemistry-service providers. Now the country’s top CROs are setting up labs in the West fostering global teams and courting biotechnology companies. The goal of their executives is nothing less than becoming integrated partners for global drugmakers and going head to head with China as the world’s powerhouse drug discovery partner.

The diversification effort started before the pandemic says Ramesh Subramanian chief commercial officer at Aragen Life Sciences one of India’s leading contract research organizations (CROs). “What we’re seeing is a significant focus from companies on diversifying their geographical footprint” he says. “It goes both ways: companies that are fully ensconced in India look to China for diversification. Companies that are fully ensconced in China look to India.”

But India is the clear winner in the drive to diversify executives in the country say. Pharmaceutical companies have historically been more invested in China—Asia’s largest market and home to the world’s largest CRO Shanghai-based WuXi AppTec—and are now expanding into India. And China’s tensions with the US are helping fuel the shift.

Hyderabad India–headquartered Aragen is already profiting. The company which employs 3200 people just celebrated its best year yet Subramanian says and local reports peg the company’s value at $1 billion. Formerly known as GVK Biosciences the company recently rebranded as Aragen the name of its US subsidiary. The change was motivated in part by a desire to appeal to a customer base that is almost exclusively Western according to Subramanian.

Western drug companies have been looking seriously at India for research help since 2005 when the country started to comply with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights or TRIPS a globally recognized intellectual property pact says Nailesh Bhatt CEO of the US specialty pharmaceutical company Vgyaan. The new law roused the drug industry’s interest in India for cheap access to highly qualified scientists and the potential for selling patented drugs in India Bhatt says.

Part of the industry is still low cost Bhatt says but India’s largest CROs have evolved since then from cut-rate service providers to powerhouses for high-quality chemistry and biology serving the Western market. “The evolution of the Indian drug discovery services has been quite drastic” Bhatt says. “If you look at the number of contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) that were in India in the late 2000s versus what is there now the clear winners have really emerged.”

Now India’s top CROs and CDMOs are asserting themselves on the global stage. They are courting biotechnology companies by setting up satellite labs in the US and Europe. And they are hiring managers with Big Pharma or chemical experience. Their goal: go head to head with China while becoming less of an assistant and more of a partner for their drug industry customers.

Western standards

Jonathan Hunt the CEO of Syngene International says the window of India’s operating cost advantage is narrowing. The country’s successful CROs have had to keep up with globally recognized processes quality standards and operating models to compete in the world market. State-of-the-art facilities and top-notch teams are not compatible with offering low-cost services he says. But if India’s cost advantage is fading the country’s place in the outsourcing industry is holding firm Hunt says.

Founded in 1993 by Biocon a leading Indian drug company Syngene is one of the Indian CROs that have moved beyond the rote performance of research tasks and into fuller discovery collaborations.

Hunt credits the company’s success in part to a relationship with Bristol Myers Squibb that dates back to 1998. Syngene established a dedicated research facility for the US drugmaker in 2009. Earlier this year Syngene announced the addition of a 4600 m2 lab to the facility. The company will additionally add 200 researchers to the facility’s staff as part of an extension of the contract with Bristol Myers Squibb.

There aren’t many places on the planet where you can access that volume of young talent regularly. Jonathan Hunt CEO Syngene International

The partnership Hunt says has committed Syngene to processes and quality standards that are equal to global ones. In hindsight this commitment was key to Syngene’s success with future clients. “From day 1 we gained a well-founded reputation that if you go inside our walls in Bangalore our operations reflect the quality and safety standards that you find in the global markets” he says.

If Indian companies’ cost advantage is narrowing what still sets them apart from CROs in the West is the benefits of the country’s population of more than 1 billion. Syngene has more than 5400 employees of whom 87% are scientists. “There aren’t many places on the planet where you can access that volume of young talent regularly” Hunt says.

Large pharmaceutical companies turn to India to fill a gap between the type of R&D that they need and the number of people at their companies who are qualified to do it Aragen’s Subramanian says. His company has around 1600 people dedicated to drug discovery. “Scale is something very tough to reproduce. And companies’ needs evolve dramatically. You might need x number of people today and twice as many tomorrow” he says.

Not all of India’s drug discovery talent is local. Western scientists have long been hires at companies like Syngene and Aragen. And increasingly the top CROs are hiring outside managers with large pharmaceutical or chemical experience.

One example is Marcel Velterop president of drug discovery and CDMO services at the Bangalore India–based CRO Jubilant Biosys. Velterop held positions with DSM and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories before joining the CRO. And before Hunt who is British was appointed Syngene’s CEO in 2015 he was an executive at AstraZeneca.

Vgyaan’s Bhatt says the recruitment of such leaders proves companies are serious about playing the global field. “They need credibility leadership expertise and a real global perspective if they want to be able to sit with the head of R&D at AstraZeneca or GSK [GlaxoSmithKline] and say ‘Not only should we work for you; we should be partners in drug discovery’ ” he says.

Hunt who lives in Manchester England and travels between the continents when COVID-19 restrictions allow says his appointment represents not a strategy to increase Syngene’s ties with Western customers but rather the global nature of top-tier CROs. Most of Syngene’s clients are from outside India. “It’s no surprise that your talent base and your leadership increasingly represent the geographical spread and diversity of the customers in the industry” he says.

Western footholds

To Syngene the company’s geographic presence doesn’t need to mirror this diversity. The firm has been strengthening its sales staff in key markets like the US and UK but all its discovery and manufacturing facilities are in India. While Hunt says Syngene is open to establishing a base in the West he says the absence of one “hasn’t held us back so far.”

Other Indian CROs consider a site in the West necessary if they are to form more integrated relationships with their clients—especially relationships that extend beyond preclinical drug discovery and encompass the manufacturing of drug candidates that might enter clinical trials. “At some point not having a site in the West was really hurting us” says Tuneer Ghosh global head of chemistry manufacturing and controls business development at Sai Life Sciences.

Hyderabad-based Sai opened a development and manufacturing site in Manchester England in August 2020. Despite challenges posed by the pandemic the site was a success. Less than 6 months after opening Sai announced plans to double its head count and expand the site to offer active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production particle science and engineering in silico modeling and flow chemistry. A further expansion later this year will add a kilogram-scale lab that follows good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards.

Located in Alderley Park a former country estate that is now a 160-hectare life sciences center Sai’s site in Greater Manchester has opened new opportunities with UK- and European Union–based drug companies and biotechs Ghosh says. “Historically Sai has been doing really good business with large pharma in the West but for critical projects which need speedy delivery or for complex chemistry they would still look to CDMOs that are closer to them.”

Echoing other executives in India Ghosh says that some customers are nervous about taking their intellectual property to CROs or CDMOs in India but are happy to hire a team in the UK. Last year Sai began working with a drug industry client that has a policy of not outsourcing the synthesis of new chemical entities to India. The Manchester site Ghosh says “gave us a direct cutting edge. We had been trying to get into that big pharma for several years.”

The Manchester team comes mostly from Big Pharma and Western CDMOs creating a cultural link to customers says Dean Edney Sai’s global head of process R&D. Edney who came to Sai after 26 years at GlaxoSmithKline divides his time between Manchester and Hyderabad when the pandemic doesn’t thwart travel.

Sai wants to create teams on two continents that can tap into each other’s expertise. The talent pools in Manchester and Hyderabad are different Edney says and the transfer of knowledge is “absolutely key” in Sai’s strategy to build a global organization. The plan to expand into flow chemistry in Manchester for example will be aided by the team in Hyderabad where flow-chemistry experience is more readily available. And once travel is possible again team members will rotate between sites.

Sai is not the only Indian CRO that sees advantages to a Western base. In 2014 before the rebranding GVK Biosciences acquired the US CRO Aragen. Officially the rationale was to get involved on the biologics side of the drug industry. But Subramanian says GVK was also keen to gain access to US-educated talent and strengthen its relationships with Western pharma.

Similarly Kolkata-based TCG Lifesciences established a US subsidiary TCG GreenChem earlier this year. It currently occupies 5000 m2 of laboratory space across sites in Ewing New Jersey near Princeton and Richmond Virginia. TCG GreenChem’s CEO Chris Senanayake who previously worked at Boehringer Ingelheim Sepracor and Merck & Co. became the chief science officer of TCG Lifesciences in 2019 before founding TCG GreenChem.

The idea Senanayake says is to make TCG GreenChem the drug development engine for TCG Lifesciences and its clients with innovation spearheaded in the US and most manufacturing done in India. If used well this system will allow TCG Lifesciences to engineer complex molecules at low cost he says.

Newer smaller CROs are also taking this approach. Naresh Jain founded NJ Bio with the aim of leveraging India’s R&D expertise and bringing it to the US. “The expertise in CRO work large-scale manufacturing and APIs that India has grown over the last decades is stronger than that in the US now” Jain says.

The cost of labor is still an incentive for an Indian base he says: the annual price of employing a scientist in India is as low as $30000 compared with $180000 in the US. India’s chemists “produce similar results if not better” Jain says. But he also speaks highly of chemists trained in the US who bring a more innovative approach. Working together on sites in India and the US the two sides bring a lot of value for NJ Bio’s clients Jain says. “Whenever you mix two different cultures it’s very refreshing. Diversity brings innovation.”

Founded in 2019 NJ Bio occupies about 3200 m2 of a former Bristol Myers Squibb facility in Princeton. Jain also helped to launch an affiliated company Amar Chemistry in Mumbai India around the same time. Between its sites in India and NJ the CRO specializes in bioconjugation nucleotide chemistry custom synthesis biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance and flow chemistry. Jain’s ambition is to grow it into one of the largest niche-expertise CROs in the US.

To achieve this NJ Bio has to convince its potential clients that it is safe to entrust their intellectual property (IP) to a team that works partially out of India Jain says. “When we try to sell our services to most clients their main concern is their IP” he says as US companies are nervous about sending sensitive information to other continents. NJ Bio’s model gives clients the option to get early-stage work done in India and later-stage work in the US. “For example a compound that requires a 25-step synthesis has the first 10 steps done in India and the other 15 in the US” he explains. “Clients are much more comfortable with this model.”

Miles Congreve chief scientific officer at the biotech firm Sosei Heptares is an example of such a client. He is used to working with Asian CROs on drug discovery but draws the line at the manufacturing of drug candidates under GMP standards.

“We would struggle with using Indian and Chinese groups for GMP just because you can more easily audit sites in the West” he says. “You don’t want an issue with manufacturing that you don’t have control over.” This is a common hurdle for CROs that want to become one-stop shops offering both research and manufacturing services.

If Syngene for example had a site near Sosei Heptares’s base in Cambridge England then Congreve would consider the company a one-stop shop he says. As it is Sosei Heptares employs a jigsaw puzzle of CROs and CDMOs picking them for different projects according to their individual strengths and locations.

Once you start getting professional investors I think the doors will open wide for India. Ramesh Subramanian chief commercial officer Aragen Life Sciences

Last year the biotech worked with six CROs on designing inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease to find an oral drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Syngene supported chemical synthesis enzyme inhibition screening and characterization of pharmacokinetic properties of key compounds. UK-based Domainex and Croatia-based Fidelta contributed to assay development and screening. Piramal Pharma and WuXi contributed to the synthesis work alongside O2h Group a CRO based in India and Cambridge England.

O2h is Sosei Heptares’s biggest external team and receives a budget of more than $1 million each year. Run by the Indian British brothers Sunil and Prashant Shah O2h was built on a premise similar to NJ Bio’s. “We saw the strength in chemistry that India had in the early 2000s and the emergence of the biotech scene in Cambridge and put those two observations together” Prashant Shah says.

The brothers geared their business to help start-up biotech companies from the get-go. Besides drug discovery services they offer seed funding and incubation support as well as mentoring and connections to clients in the vibrant Cambridge scene.

“Having a presence in the UK was essential for building those relationships with customers and supporting them with their drug discovery requirements” Prashant Shah says. The advantage of doing most of its chemistry and biologics in India he says is the ability to scale up a project quickly.

Sosei Heptares started working with O2h in 2008. It was the first CRO the young biotech hired. Would the relationship have been this successful if O2h had only had a site in India or only in the UK? “That’s a good question” Congreve says. “It was certainly a factor in the beginning because I liked being able to go to their office in Cambridge and visit the site. But today we work with companies where we’ve never even seen their site.”

Cozying up to biotechs

To India’s CROs courting biotechs like Sosei Heptares is arguably the biggest part of their business plans and the biggest motivation behind setting up shop in the West. “Yes we are absolutely going after biotechs” Sai’s Ghosh says. When biotechs stopped partnering with Big Pharma firms for all their promising compounds and began taking some drugs to market themselves Sai changed its business model to cater to them he says.

Like NJ Bio O2h TCG and Aragen Sai is leveraging its multiple sites to provide biotechs with speed infrastructure support and reassurance that their IP is secure and in a familiar setting. Besides the Manchester site Sai has placed business development representatives in Massachusetts San Francisco and European hubs like Barcelona.

The focus on biotechs also gives CROs a chance to shake off their reputation as rote makers of compounds. Rather than settle into the service role often expected by big drug companies CROs can enjoy relationships that are more symbiotic as young companies take help from experienced contract research partners to craft their strategies for drug development.

The desire for more equal client relationships runs through all of India’s most successful CROs although none go as far as to say that gaining access to intellectual property is a part of the plan. Syngene’s Hunt says the leap from providing simple repeatable chemistry tasks to doing integrated drug discovery is natural for the industry. “We’re just a biotech company in disguise” he says. “We don’t need to own the IP but we create IP in a way that’s indistinguishable from a biotech or pharma.”

The difference may be indistinguishable but it continues to be important. CROs typically charge their customers for an agreed-upon number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. Under an FTE contract the client pays the CRO a fixed amount without regard for the project’s eventual success or failure.

Some Indian CROs are keen to establish risk-sharing agreements with their customers under which they receive less money than in a straight FTE contract but qualify to earn royalties if their contribution helps the customer launch a new product.

But biotechs tend to be skeptical of these contracts which rely on the CRO’s providing input that is worth its share of the profit. “True risk means true money on the table and sometimes the CROs overvalue the input they can give” says Robert Boyle the CEO of Sentinel Oncology a biotech in Cambridge England that outsources all its chemistry research. Sentinel has done one risk-sharing agreement with O2h in the 16 years since its foundation. Sentinel paid for five FTE chemists. O2h provided another five for free and took a share of royalties in the program.

Although Boyle was happy with the project he is not convinced that CROs can cross the bridge from being a set of helping hands to becoming a true partner for biotechs. “It’s a different business model. Contract research was driven by being a cost-efficient professional outsourcing arm” he says. “I can see more risk sharing as some CROs try to differentiate themselves as a one-stop shop but I think it’s proven hard to get that off the ground.”

Indeed Boyle still sees the financial advantage of Indian CROs as their main draw. “It would be very hard for us to suddenly flip to a UK chemistry service provider who would want to charge $200000 for an FTE agreement when we pay $75000 in India” he says. “That’s a lot of money for a young biotech.”

True risk means true money on the table and sometimes the CROs overvalue the input they can give. Robert Boyle CEO Sentinel Oncology

Eclipsing China

If money is the deciding factor for biotechs China’s CROs are as competitive as India’s. Sentinel uses both and Boyle says he has no preference for doing business with one or the other although he says working with Chinese firms can be hampered by the language barrier.

Industry watchers name language as China’s biggest hurdle for contract research dominance. India with its English-savvy population has the upper hand. And while it’s not challenging for big corporations to employ translators or local staff smaller companies such as most biotechs will struggle to create a partnership with a Chinese CRO TCG’s Senanayake says. “Communication is the only downside to China. This is where we can differentiate ourselves and support the biotech industry.”

If India’s CROs have ever had a chance to eclipse China’s this is the time. Political tensions between the US and China and the drive to reclaim the manufacturing supply chain by the pharmaceutical industry and government during the pandemic highlight the extent to which China dominates the world’s supply of pharmaceutical chemicals. These tensions have tempted some potential customers to edge away from the contract research giant.

But although some business may move to India the shift doesn’t seem to be making a visible dent in China’s prominence. WuXi for one recently forecast its net profit for the first half of 2021 to increase by more than 50% from a year ago. Another leading Chinese player Pharmaron said its profit shot up 140% in the first quarter of 2021 from last year.

Aragen’s Subramanian is optimistic that India will gain more business from China in the near future. The ingredient missing to propel India’s contract research industry to the top is investment he says. And here private equity companies are beginning to fill the gap.

Last year the Carlyle Group took a 20% stake in Piramal Pharma a CDMO headquartered in Mumbai. In November Syngene signed a 5-year agreement with the drug discovery and development subsidiary of Deerfield Management a venture capital firm. And Goldman Sachs took a significant stake in Aragen this year. Subramanian says there are “several other deals that we know are in the works.”

One of the things that differentiated China from India when research outsourcing took off between 2001 and 2010 was China’s access to government-provided capital Subramanian says. Without it Indian companies were unable to scale in the same way. “The science was always there. The talent was always there. What was lacking was financial capital” he says. “Once you start getting professional investors I think the doors will open wide for India.”

Sosei Heptares’s Congreve expects consolidation over the next decade with at least some of India’s star players being bought by or acquiring companies that will give them wider global reach. It would be good news for their clients Congreve says. “It’s attractive to work with companies that are widening their network so you can access their services around the world” he says. “Clearly in another 10 years from now there will be huge corporations that have swallowed up others as part of a group.”

And financial machinations aside O2h’s Prashant Shah adds that Indian CROs themselves have become “extremely confident” in their ability to drive the country’s industry forward. “They’ve got very strong balance sheets. They can invest and make decisions and move quite aggressively to take up new opportunities across the entire pharmaceutical landscape” he says. “India is genuinely a powerhouse in terms of its capabilities now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvaGVhbHRoL2FydGljbGUtOTg3MTgyOS9QYXRpZW50cy1keWluZy1ib3dlbC1jYW5jZXItZ2l2ZW4tZnJlc2gtaG9wZS10aGFua3MtYnJlYWt0aHJvdWdoLWRydWctY29tYmluYXRpb24uaHRtbNIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvaGVhbHRoL2FydGljbGUtOTg3MTgyOS9hbXAvUGF0aWVudHMtZHlpbmctYm93ZWwtY2FuY2VyLWdpdmVuLWZyZXNoLWhvcGUtdGhhbmtzLWJyZWFrdGhyb3VnaC1kcnVnLWNvbWJpbmF0aW9uLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patients dying of bowel cancer are given fresh hope thanks to a breakthrough drug combination,"People facing a death sentence from bowel cancer could soon be given new hope thanks to a breakthrough drug combination to be offered on the NHS.

Clinical trials found more than half of patients given the treatment who had all failed to respond to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy were still alive five years later.

Professor John Bridgewater consultant oncologist at University College Hospital in London said many were now cancer-free adding: 'For the first time this group of advanced cancer patients has some expectation of being cured.'

The drug combination has been approved for use in bowel cancer patients whose tumours have spread to other parts of the body and don't respond to chemotherapy – roughly 800 people every year.

People facing a death sentence from bowel cancer could soon be given new hope thanks to a breakthrough drug combination to be offered on the NHS. Clinical trials found more than half of patients given the treatment who had all failed to respond to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy were still alive five years later

Previously there was no option for these patients. Their tumours carry a rare genetic mutation called microsatellite instability high or MSI-H which causes it to spread at speed making it impossible to control with chemotherapy.

Prof Bridgewater said: 'Chemo isn't enough to stop the spread of the cancer. For the majority of MSI-H patients it is a death sentence.'

But in recent years specialists became increasingly hopeful that a combination of drugs held the key to battling the otherwise terminal disease.

Worldwide trials carried out by US drug manufacturer Bristol Myers Squibb found that prescribing the immunotherapy drugs nivolumab and ipilimumab gave highly positive results.

Both drugs train the immune system to seek out and destroy cancer cells.

The high number of mutations in MSI-H tumours means they are uniquely receptive to immunotherapy Prof Bridgewater said: 'The mutations are so extreme they stick out like a sore thumb to the immune system.

'In patients suffering from conventional bowel cancer this treatment would be near useless as the cancer while more controllable with chemotherapy is more effective at hiding from the immune system. But in MSI-H patients the drugs give the body the necessary boost to find and fight the cancer.'

Weird science: Man whose hiccups lasted for 68 years Charles Osborne (above) from Iowa started hiccupping in 1922 - and didn't stop for seven decades Struggle to get rid of hiccups? Count yourself lucky you're not Charles Osborne from Iowa whose hiccups lasted 68 years. In 1922 Osborne was weighing a pig for slaughter and fell over. When he stood up he began hiccupping – and did not stop for nearly seven decades. Hiccups are involuntary contractions of your diaphragm usually caused by eating too quickly or drinking too much alcohol. At its worst Osborne hiccupped 40 times a minute. Sadly doctors were never able to find a cure. In February 1990 Osborne's hiccups suddenly stopped. A year later he died. Advertisement

Patients attend hospital for the treatment and receive both drugs intravenously. They are given four doses of ipilimumab once every three weeks.

Nivolumab is given monthly and this is continued for two years or as long as the treatment remains effective.

Recommending the treatment for NHS use spending watchdog the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) noted it was far less debilitating than chemotherapy and also offered a better quality of life for patients.

Results from the Bristol Myers Squibb trial published last year show that 65 per cent of patients see tumour shrinkage after two-and-a-half months.

What's more in a high proportion of patients the cancer shrinks so small that it is no longer visible on a scan. In these cases doctors say patients are cancer-free.

Prof Bridgewater said: 'Patients are going from being told they may have just months to live to having over a 50 per cent chance of being alive or totally cured five years on.'

One patient to benefit is 39-year-old Tom Bartlett from Oxfordshire who was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in July 2018.

Tom who works in the food industry went to his GP with stomach pains and after seeing blood in his faeces and was referred for urgent tests.

'The [colonoscopy] camera turned a corner and I saw the scariest thing I've ever seen' said Tom.

'The tumour filled the entire bowel cavity. I just stared at it completely terrified. It had burst through the bowel wall and spread to the lymph nodes.'

Tom was given chemotherapy which initially reduced the size of his tumour. But nine months later scans showed it had grown even larger and moved further outside the bowel.

Tom was then given nivolumab and ipilimumab and scans later showed the tumour had completely disappeared.

Tom said: 'I had virtually no side effects especially compared with chemotherapy which can be very unpleasant. I feel incredibly lucky.

'I now live a pretty normal life playing cricket and golf and just have to go for regular check-ups at the hospital.'

Your amazing body

It's possible to become so hot that you stop sweating.

Sweating helps to regulate body temperature typically keeping it somewhere between 37C and 38C.

If body temperature rises above 40C heatstroke can occur – where vital organs are unable to function.

Perhaps confusingly the first sign of heatstroke can be a lack of sweat since the body prioritises keeping water around vital organs to protect them.

If a person is extremely hot and not sweating it is vital that they swiftly seek medical attention.",,,,,,,,,

BRO,Brown & Brown,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaGVjaGluZ2VycmVwb3J0Lm9yZy9wcm9vZi1wb2ludHMtNS10YWtlYXdheXMtc2VncmVnYXRpb24tNzAteWVhcnMtYWZ0ZXItYnJvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PROOF POINTS: 5 takeaways about segregation 70 years after the Brown decision,"It was one of the most significant days in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court. On May 17 1954 the nine justices unanimously ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that schools segregated by race did not provide an equal education. Students could no longer be barred from a school because of the color of their skin. To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Brown decision I wanted to look at how far we’ve come in integrating our schools and how far we still have to go.

Two sociologists Sean Reardon at Stanford University and Ann Owens at the University of Southern California have teamed up to analyze both historical and recent trends. Reardon and Owens were slated to present their analysis at a Stanford University conference on May 6 and they shared their presentation with me in advance. They also expect to launch a new website to display segregation trends for individual school districts around the country.

Here are five takeaways from their work:

The long view shows progress but a worrying uptick especially in big cities

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

Not much changed for almost 15 years after the Brown decision. Although Black students had the right to attend another school the onus was on their families to demand a seat and figure out how to get their child to the school. Many schools remained entirely Black or entirely white.

Desegregation began in earnest in 1968 with a series of court orders beginning with Virginia’s New Kent County schools. That year the Supreme Court required the county to abolish its separate Black and white schools and students were reassigned to different schools to integrate them.

This graph above produced by Reardon and Owens shows how segregation plummeted across the country between 1968 and 1973. The researchers focused on roughly 500 larger school districts where there were at least 2500 Black students. That captures nearly two-thirds of all Black students in the nation and avoids clouding the analysis with thousands of small districts of mostly white residents.

Reardon’s and Owens’s measurement of segregation compares classmates of the average white student with the classmates of the average Black student. For example in North Carolina’s Charlotte-Mecklenburg district the average white student in 1968 attended a school where 90 percent of his peers were white and only 10 percent were Black. The average Black student attended a school where 76 percent of his peers were Black and 24 percent were white. Reardon and Owens then calculated the gap in exposure to each race. White students had 90 percent white classmates while Black students had 24 percent white classmates. The difference was 66 percentage points. On the flip side Black students had 76 percent Black classmates while white students had 10 percent Black classmates. Again the difference was 66 percentage points which translates to 0.66 on the segregation index.

But in 1973 after court-ordered desegregation went into effect the average white student attended a school that was 69 percent white and 31 percent Black. The average Black student attended a school that was 34 percent Black and 66 percent white. In five short years the racial exposure gap fell from 66 percentage points to 3 percentage points. Schools reflected Charlotte-Mecklenberg’s demographics. In the graph above Reardon and Owens averaged the segregation index figures for all 533 districts with substantial Black populations. That’s what each dot represents.

In the early 1990s this measure of segregation began to creep up again as depicted by the red tail in the graph above. Owens calls it a “slow and steady uptick” in contrast to the drastic decline in segregation after 1968. Segregation has not bounced back or returned to pre-Brown levels. “There’s a misconception that segregation is worse than ever” Reardon said.

Although the red line from 1990 to the present looks nearly flat when you zoom in on it you can see that Black-white segregation grew by 25 percent between 1991 and 2019. During the pandemic segregation declined slightly again.

It’s important to emphasize that these Black-white segregation levels are tiny compared with the degree of segregation in the late 1960s. A 25 percent increase can seem like a lot but it’s less than 4 percentage points.

“It’s big enough that it makes me worried” said Owens. “Now is the moment to keep an eye on this. If it continues in this direction it would take a long time to get back up to Brown. But let’s not let it keep going up.”

Even more troubling is the fact that segregation increased substantially if you zero in on the nation’s biggest cities. White-Black segregation in the largest 100 school districts increased by 64 percent from 1988 to 2019 Owens and Reardon calculated.

School choice plays a role in recent segregation

Why is segregation creeping back up again?

The expiration of court orders that mandated school integration and the expansion of school choice policies including the rapid growth of charter schools explains all of the increase in segregation from 2000 onward said Reardon. Over 200 medium-sized and large districts were released from desegregation court orders from 1991 to 2009 and racial school segregation in these districts gradually increased in the years afterward.

School choice however appears to be the dominant force. More than half of the increase in segregation in the 2000s can be attributed to the rise of charter schools whose numbers began to increase rapidly in the late 1990s. In many cases either white or Black families flocked to different charter schools leaving behind a less diverse student body in traditional public schools.

The reason for the rise in segregation in the 1990s before the number of charter schools soared is harder to understand. Owens speculates that other school choice policies such as the option to attend any public school within a district or the creation of new magnet schools may have played a role but she doesn’t have the data to prove that. White gentrification of cities in the 1990s could also be a factor she said as the white newcomers favored a small set of schools or sent their children to private schools.

“We might just be catching a moment where there’s been an influx of one group before the other group leaves” said Owens. “It’s hard to say how the numbers will look 10 years from now.”

It’s important to disentangle demographic shifts from segregation increases

There’s a popular narrative that segregation has increased because Black students are more likely to attend school with other students who are not white especially Hispanic students. But Reardon and Owens say this analysis conflates demographic shifts in the U.S. population with segregation. The share of Hispanic students in U.S. schools now approaches 30 percent and everyone is attending schools with more Hispanic classmates. White students who used to represent 85 percent of the U.S. student population in 1970 now make up less than half.

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

The blue line in the graph above shows how the classmates of the average Black Hispanic or Native American student have increased from about 55 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students in the early 1970s to nearly 80 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students today. That means that the average student who is not white is attending a school that is overwhelmingly made up of students who are not white.

But look at how the red line which depicts white students is following the same path. The average white student is attending a school that moved from 35 percent students who are not white in the 1970s to nearly 70 percent students who are not white today. “It’s entirely driven by Hispanic students” said Owens. “Even the ‘white’ schools in L.A. are 40 percent Hispanic.”

I dug into U.S. Department of Education data to show how extremely segregated schools have become less common. The percentage of Black students attending a school that is 90 percent or more Black fell from 23 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2022. Only 1 in 10 Black students attends an all-Black or a nearly all-Black school. Meanwhile the percentage of white students attending a school that is 90 percent or more white fell from 44 percent to 14 percent during this same time period. That’s 1 in 7. Far fewer Black or white students are learning in schools that are almost entirely made up of students of their same race.

At the same time the percentage of Black students attending a school where 90 percent of students are not white grew from 37 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2022. But notice the sharp growth of Hispanic students during this period. They went from 7.6 million (fewer than the number of Black students) to more than 13.9 million (almost double the number of Black students).

Most segregation falls across school district boundaries

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

This bar chart shows how schools are segregated for two reasons. One is that people of different races live on opposite sides of school district lines. Detroit is an extreme example. The city schools are dominated by Black students. Meanwhile the Detroit suburbs which operate independent school systems are dominated by white students. Almost all the segregation is because people of different races live in different districts. Meanwhile in the Charlotte North Carolina metropolitan area over half of the segregation reflects the uneven distribution of students within school districts.

Nationally 60 percent of the segregation occurs because of the Detroit scenario: people live across administrative borders Reardon and Owens calculated. Still 40 percent of current segregation is within administrative borders that policymakers can control.

Residential segregation is decreasing

People often say there’s little that can be done about school segregation until we integrate neighborhoods. I was surprised to learn that residential segregation has been declining over the past 30 years according to Reardon’s and Owens’s analysis of census tracts. More Black and white people live in proximity to each other. And yet at the same time school segregation is getting worse.

All this matters Reardon said because kids are learning at different rates in more segregated systems. “We know that more integrated schools provide more equal educational opportunities” he said. “The things we’re doing with our school systems are making segregation worse.”

Reardon recommends more reforms to housing policy to integrate neighborhoods and more “guard rails” on school choice systems so that they cannot be allowed to produce highly segregated schools.

The elite schools took $10 million from 2017 to 2023 from entities within the “State of Palestine” according to the analysis by Open the Books a Republican-owned nonprofit dedicated to revealing government spending.

Brown University Harvard University and non-Ivy Indiana University of Pennsylvania are among the schools to accept funding from donors located in the nation that technically doesn’t exist at least by UN standards.

The “State of Palestine” is not a recognized entity by the United Nations or the US — though some 140 countries do officially recognize it.

3 Brown University in February 2020 received a $643000 gift from the Munib and Angela Masri Foundation based in the West Bank.

Brown University in February 2020 received a $643000 gift from a foundation located within the “State of Palestine” to create a professorship in Palestinian Studies as part of the college’s Middle East Studies program according to federal disclosures reviewed by Open the Books.

Though the financial filing does not disclose the donor’s name Brown previously said the money was gifted by the Munib and Angela Masri Foundation based in the West Bank.

Nine different donors — including multiple Brown alumni and the foundation — came together to fund the “Mahmoud Darwish Professorship in Palestinian Studies” according to a 2020 press release.

Meanwhile Harvard took in $1.6 million from donors within the “State of Palestine” and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania received $6.4 million from entities within the “State of Palestine” and another $900000 from a donor from “Palestinian Territory Occupied” according to the review of the financial disclosure documents.

The donors are not identified in the filings. Harvard previously said that monies it received from Palestinian donors in 2017 2018 and 2019 did not come from the Palestinian Authority though the Ivy League would not disclose the donor names in a 2020 news report.

Most of the money helped pay for Palestinian students from the occupied territories to receive an education at American universities according to the filings.

They were often reported as “payment of tuition and fees for students from Palestine. Funds are also utilized to pay for educational-related expenses incurred by the university for these students through their enrollment in this program” the documents state according to Open the Books.

Indiana University of Pennsylvania received at least $2.3 million from the West Bank-based Arab American University to cover the tuition and other expenses for Palestinian students attending the US college according to the same 2020 report.

In addition to the funding the US universities have had ongoing relationships with universities in the West Bank.

Brown’s inaugural professor of Palestinian Studies Beshara Doumani was granted permission to simultaneously serve as the president of Birzeit University in the West Bank for two years.

The Palestinian university was criticized after its Union of Professors and Employees penned an op-ed days after Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack stating “2023 will be recorded historically as the year that Palestinians stood boldly in the face of colonial fascism and screamed in defense of their homes humanity and lives.”

For its part Indiana University of Pennsylvania offers business Ph.D. and master’s programs in partnership with Arab American University.

You won’t see their names on Las Vegas Boulevard marquees and you may not have even heard of them.

But two heavyweight firms Vici Properties and The Blackstone Group are emerging as two of the biggest players on the Strip.

Their role? Collecting rent.

Vici a Caesars Entertainment spinoff announced a $17.2 billion deal Wednesday to acquire MGM Resorts International spinoff MGM Growth Properties giving Vici real estate ownership of many of the biggest hotel-casinos on the Strip.

Blackstone has its own growing portfolio of hotels on Las Vegas Boulevard and overall the two companies are slated to own more than a dozen megaresorts combined along the famed casino corridor mostly as landlords.

All this wheeling and dealing probably has little if any effect on guests at the properties or any immediate impact on the employees other than changing where companies send their rent checks.

But the two New York firms are betting billions that tourism here will thrive — and that casino operators can pay a fortune in rent.

‘On time and in cash’

Vici a casino landlord and Blackstone a financial conglomerate are buying hotels as Las Vegas bounces back from the still-raging coronavirus outbreak which dealt a catastrophic economic blow to Southern Nevada.

The pandemic temporarily turned the Strip into a ghost town of shuttered resorts last year sparked huge job losses in the casino-heavy region and kept people home and away from crowds for fear of getting infected devastating the tourism industry.

The landlords’ line of business however seems to be fine.

Vici CEO Ed Pitoniak said on a conference call Wednesday that both MGM Growth and his company have collected “100 percent of our rent so far through COVID on time and in cash.”

Vici’s real estate holdings include Caesars Palace and Harrah’s Las Vegas. In early March it also announced a deal with Apollo Global Management to purchase The Venetian Palazzo and Sands Expo and Convention Center for about $6.25 billion from casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp. with Vici acquiring the real estate and Apollo buying the operations side. The deal is expected to close early next year.

With its purchase of MGM Growth Vici is buying several MGM Resorts-operated properties including The Mirage Park MGM Luxor New York-New York and Excalibur.

Betting billions

Blackstone not only dropped $1.73 billion in 2014 for The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas it also has a history of multibillion-dollar real estate deals with MGM Resorts.

As announced in early July Blackstone is buying the Aria and Vdara hotels for nearly $3.9 billion and leasing them back to MGM. Blackstone also partnered with MGM Growth on a $4.6 billion deal early last year to acquire the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay’s real estate and lease them back to MGM Resorts with Vici saying this week it will retain MGM Growth’s stake in the venture.

Moreover Blackstone bought the Bellagio in 2019 for about $4.2 billion from MGM Resorts and leased it back.

As you can imagine leasing a resort with thousands of rooms is not cheap. The Bellagio sale for instance called for an initial annual rent of $245 million.

Las Vegas’ tourism industry has by no means fully recovered from the pandemic and the public health crisis is far from over. But the local economy has come a long way since the early chaos of the outbreak and Las Vegas is still a place where people spend big on hotels — not to mention gambling and booze.

“As much as parents like to spend money on their kids whether in Orlando and other locations I don’t think anybody’s ever spent $10000 on a bottle of apple juice” Pitoniak said this week.

The Review-Journal is owned by the family of Dr. Miriam Adelson the majority shareholder of Las Vegas Sands Corp. Las Vegas Sands operates The Venetian Palazzo and Sands Expo and Convention Center.

I think they're kind of prepared but I think Jason's been traveling a lot. So I think they want that to slow down a little bit [first].""

The reality TV veteran also added of becoming a grandmother: ""I think I'm prepared. I think I would look forward to that. I love having somebody to kiss and smoother with love. I think I'm prepared.

One source said: 'Adele has very recently been talking to musicians that she has worked with before to gauge their availability to see whether they could be in Vegas for the gigs.

'It is all very exciting. It would make her a lot of money but it would also mean she could have a routine. It would be hugely lucrative for her but also really fun.

'She loves performing live and there would be no shortage of people travelling to see her once the Covid restrictions are dropped.'

The singer hasn't been on the road since 2017 when her 120-date world tour grossed £127 million.

Celine Dion (pictured at the The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in 2003) has made an astonishing £450 million from 1100 residency shows in the city dating back to 2003

Performers who signed up for extended runs of concerts in Vegas stretch back to Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack in the 1960s.

More recently Celine Dion has made an astonishing £450 million from 1100 residency shows in the city dating back to 2003.

Ms Dion 53 has sold more than five million tickets to her concerts which have been held at the iconic Colosseum at Caesars Palace.

Sir Elton John Britney Spears Rod Stewart Shania Twain Cher and Bette Midler have also had residencies.

Adele revealed in 2019 that she was separating from her Eton-educated husband Simon Konecki and divorce papers were lodged in America three months later.

There are so many restaurants that were once popular and full of hungry bellies every day. Restaurants like Sambo's a pancake house Chi-Chi's a casual Mexican dining experience and even the original Mcdonald's aren't around anymore per Delish. Instead it was turned into an unofficial museum in 1971!

The historical value and memories places like these offer make people wonder whatever happened to them? Well one that stands out in particular is Lum's restaurant. This unique hot dog joint was known for steaming its dogs in beer – it was kid-friendly; don't worry!

In 1956 it was welcomed in Miami Beach per Florida Backroads Travel. Founded by the Perlman family Lum's became popular among college students says The South Florida Sun-Sentinel. It increasingly gained popularity over the years and by 1972 there were over 400 locations in the U.S. Puerto Rico and Europe. In fact as it became a household name Lum's even purchased Caesars Palace a popular and large hotel and casino in Las Vegas. How could a place that was doing so well come to an end?"

Accounts of the evening vary but according to Smithsonian Magazine Andy Warhol begged his friend Latow for an idea that could rival his friend's pop art pieces while being different enough to make him stand out. The shrewd Latow insisted that Warhol fork over $50 for her suggestion and when he did her response was as simple as tomato soup: paint something everyone recognizes. Pop art was just getting its legs and gaining ground in the early 1960s as the public seemed to want a change from the abstract and expressionist styles of the previous decade. Vanity Fair says Latow told Warhol he should stick with the basics and appeal to the materialistic culture of the day; then she gave Warhol two ideas for the price of $50 suggesting he paint money or Campbell's soup.

Warhol would later say that he grew up with Campbell's soup. ""I used to drink it"" he said according to History. ""I used to have the same lunch every day for 20 years."" It's unclear how much soup Warhol consumed in the year that he was surrounded by Campbell's cans in order to paint the 32 images he's known for today but if you thought he got sick of the stuff you are wrong. According to Vanity Fair when the editor of Esquire pitched a 1969 cover featuring Warhol drowning in a giant can of Campbell's tomato soup the artist was ""ecstatic."" He was even quoted as saying ""I should have just done the Campbell's soups and kept on doing them because everybody only does one painting anyway."" Warhol passed away in 1987 but the shelf life of his Campbell's soup paintings is still going strong.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzE5MDU3LWpvaG5zb24tam9obnNvbi12ZXQtdG8tbGVhZC1mb3JtZXItbmVzdGxlLXdhdGVycy1ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson & Johnson vet to lead former Nestle Waters North America,"STAMFORD CONN. — Jorge Mesquita has been named chief executive officer at BlueTriton Brands the former US and Canadian operations of Nestle Waters.

The longtime Sequim residents joined other family members and friends spread across the country in rooting for 19-year-old Tyler Christianson their grandson and son of Sequim High graduate Eric Christianson.

Tyler a dual citizen of Panama and the Untied States was one of 10 athletes competing for Panama at the 2020 Summer Olympic Games. He competed in the 200-meter breaststroke and 200 individual medley.

On July 27 Tyler raced to a heat victory in the 200 breaststroke with a 2:13.41 finish — more than two seconds better than his entry time — and led from the first turn on finishing with the 29th-best time (the top 16 qualified for the semifinals).

A day later he came back from a fifth-place spot after one turn to win his heat in the 200 IM finishing in 2:02.70 — about a half-second better than his entry time — and wound up 40th overall.

“It just hit me; he’s among the best swimmers in the world” Molly Christianson said last week in between her grandson’s heats.

Molly and Bernie moved to Sequim in 1978.

“We thought it was the most beautiful place on earth (then) and we still think that” Molly said.

Eric Christianson graduated from Sequim High in 1987 before attending West Point. He was an athlete but no swimmer Molly said.

“He was not very good in the water at all” Molly said of Eric but he competed in football and wrestling.

After graduating from West Point Eric Christianson worked for six years and six month in the service stationed in Panama. There he met Emyeny a native Panamanian.

Eric and the family moved across the United States as he held corporate jobs Molly said including those with Proctor & Gamble in Cincinnati Pacific Coast Feather Company in Seattle Campbell Soup Company in Camden N.J. Perdue Farms in Salisbury Md. and most recently with Nutrient in Reno Nev.

Tyler was born stateside but he retains dual citizenship with the U.S. and his mother’s home country.

In interviews leading up to the Olympic Games Tyler said he learned at age 8 to swim.

By the time high school ended he was a state champion in Maryland and began receiving offers for his athleticism Molly said fitting his exhausting sports schedule in with his involvement in school leadership (he was Student Government Association President at his high school in 2019-20).

Tyler chose Notre Dame and in his first year took home the Fighting Irish’s Rookie of the Year award and was named a USA Swimming Scholastic All-American. He qualified for the NCAA championships and then added Olympic Games qualifier to his resume. He holds two Republic of Panama national records.

“I just really can’t wait because its going to be a blast to swim with the best athletes in the world and to represent my country so that’s all I can really ask for” Tyler said in an interview with WSBT TV in South Bend Ind. last week.

“I never thought it would be possible you know. You write it down as a little kid — I want to be an astronaut NFL Football player I want to go to the Olympics — I wrote down ‘I want to go to the Olympics’ and to see that sheet that I had made like 12 years ago in first grade and look back and see I really did it it means a lot.”

Molly said the Panamanian athletes — there were 10 listed as competitors compared to 613 for the U.S. — are treated like celebrities in their home country.

“(He’s) like a national hero over there” Molly said. “(But) he is a true American in heart.”

Tyler swims for the Naval Academy Aquatic Club-Republic 1 club team and is up and working out early thanks to help (and car rides) from Emyeny.

“She certainly had a large part to do with him getting his swimming career (going)” Molly said. “Parents have a lot to do with these athletes.”

No wonder then that Molly and Bernie were up at 3:31 a.m. one morning cheering on Tyler from about 4700 miles away.

“(We had) all of his brothers and sister are rooting for him his friends rooting for him”Molly said. “It’s been so much fun.”

Per team policy terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Neto averaged a career-high 8.7 points to go along with a career-high 2.4 rebounds 2.3 assists and a career-high 1.1 steals per game while shooting .468 from the field in 64 games (22 starts) during the 2020-21 season. As a starter last season he averaged 11.4 points 3.0 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game while shooting .495 from the field and .403 from three-point range. He scored a season-high 25 points (7-of-11 from the field 5-of-7 from three-point range) in the Wizards’ 131-129 win over the Raptors in Tampa on May 6.

“We are very pleased to bring Raul back after the career year he had for us last season” said Wizards General Manager Tommy Sheppard. “He was one of our most consistent players with a toughness and tenacity on both ends of the floor that allowed him to lead our second unit and step in when called upon as a starter.”

Neto was originally signed as a free agent by the Wizards on November 21 2020. During the 2019-20 season he averaged 5.1 points and 1.9 assists per game in 54 games (three starts) with Philadelphia. Before signing with the 76ers Neto spent his first four seasons in the NBA with the Utah Jazz (2015-19). Neto averaged 4.8 points 1.3 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 14.2 minutes per game with Utah. As a rookie in 2015 he appeared in 81 games (53 starts) and averaged a career-high 5.9 points and 2.1 assists per game.

Neto was selected by the Atlanta Hawks in the second round (47th overall pick) of the 2013 NBA Draft and his rights were traded by the Hawks to the Jazz in a draft-night trade in exchange for a 2015 second round pick (from Brooklyn) on June 27 2013. Prior to coming to the NBA he played professionally in Brazil and Spain from 2008-15. During the 2014-15 season he appeared in 34 games (23 starts) for Universidad Catolica De Murcia (UCAM) of the Liga ACP in Spain averaging 8.9 points 3.9 assists 2.1 rebounds and 1.2 steals in 22.4 mpg.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL2h1ZHNvbnZhbGxleW9uZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8wNi9icmljay1jYXBpdGFsLW9mLXRoZS13b3JsZC1uZXcteW9yay1jaXR5LXdhcy10aGUtbWFpbi1tYXJrZXQtZm9yLXRoZS1iaWxsaW9uLWJyaWNrLWEteWVhci1sb2NhbC1pbmR1c3RyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brick Capital of the World,"A condensed chapter from the forthcoming The Story of Historic Kingston

The common brick has been one of the greatest materials for the construction industry being fireproof waterproof weatherproof and relatively inexpensive. By the turn of the 20th century the Hudson Valley was known as the “Brick Capital of the World” due to its tremendous clay deposits and proximity to New York City which would become the largest brick market in the world. The region produced up to one billion bricks a year and employed nearly 10000 people in more than 320 brickyards.

Back in 1771 Dutch settler Jacob Van Dyke found deposits of clay and began producing the first handmade bricks in Haverstraw for use in fireplaces and chimneys. Since then a wide variety of clay has been discovered along the banks of the Hudson River. While the red-orange color comes from iron oxide in the clay many factors influence the final quality and color of bricks: the quality of clay the type of open yards for drying construction of kilns and the time and temperature needed for firing. These differed significantly from one brickyard to another even those only a few miles apart.

Hutton Brickyard in Kingston operated continuously from 1865 until 1980. As with most brickyards along the Hudson workers were predominantly Italian and African-American mainly from the South. The two groups were closely knit at work and socially despite the racism that inflicted many other aspects of society. Many employees of Hutton Brickyard resided in nearby Ponckhockie while others lived in very basic housing provided by the company.

Workers made a decent living but the work was backbreaking and could be dangerous particularly in the days before automation. High clay walls could suddenly collapse or slump injuring workers below so clay banks were mined in terraces that averaged eight feet high. On the plus side the company allowed employees to borrow mules wagons equipment and manure to use in their own gardens if desired.

Two events caused an increase in demand for bricks. First residents of New York City were facing yet another water crisis. In 1832 more than 3500 people died from cholera as a result of contaminated drinking water prompting the search for a new clean source. This led to the construction of the Croton Aqueduct built from 1837–1842. The reservoir sat 41 miles north in Westchester and carried water underground by gravity via a brick-lined aqueduct.

The second event The Great Fire happened in 1835. It burned for three days destroyed much of lower Manhattan — a 17-block area — and engulfed more than 600 buildings mostly made of wood. A lack of readily available water added to the damage. Thousands of federal-style townhouses were built in Manhattan Brooklyn and elsewhere.

The kilns were roughly 40-feet wide by 50-feet high and could fire about a million bricks a week. In the early 20th century when New York City was at the peak of its tenement building boom manufacturers in the Mid-Hudson region made 1.3 billion bricks a year equal to a 40-feet-high 300-mile-long wall. More than 65 percent of the bricks that built the city came from the Hudson Valley.

The Hutton Brickyard closed in 1980 and sat abandoned for decades until being partially renovated in recent years for events and concerts. Last year Scenic Hudson built a 1.9-mile trail along several former brickyards and earlier this year the Hutton Brickyard luxury retreat and event center opened along the Rondout waterfront.

Trump’s campaign needed money when he went online and chipped in everything he could: $500.

It was a big sum for a 63-year-old battling cancer and living in Kansas City on less than $1000 per month. But that single contribution — federal records show it was his first ever — quickly multiplied. Another $500 was withdrawn the next day then $500 the next week and every week through mid-October without his knowledge — until Mr. Blatt’s bank account had been depleted and frozen. When his utility and rent payments bounced he called his brother Russell for help.

What the Blatts soon discovered was $3000 in withdrawals by the Trump campaign in less than 30 days. They called their bank and said they thought they were victims of fraud.

“It felt” Russell said “like it was a scam.”

But what the Blatts believed was duplicity was actually an intentional scheme to boost revenues by the Trump campaign and the for-profit company that processed its online donations WinRed. Facing a cash crunch and getting badly outspent by the Democrats the campaign had begun last September to set up recurring donations by default for online donors for every week until the election."

The ship the largest for Carnival Cruise Line to-date can hold a whopping 6500 passengers. The line is holding capacity at about 70 percent right now and there were approximately 4200 people onboard for this first sailing.

The ship set sail from Port Canaveral on July 31 marking the first revenue sailing from the port in 16 months.

Here's a look at what we loved and what we didn't – and what fell slightly in between.

Rudi's Seagrill on Carnival Mardi Gras (Photo/Chris Gray Faust)

Rudi's Seagrill. The longtime Master Chef for sister line Holland America Rudi Sodamin has been known for sophisticated seafood in his onboard venue Rudi's Sel de Mer. At his first venture outside HAL into Carnival we found the food at Rudi's Seagrill to be a little more down-to-earth than it is on Holland America -- but just as tasty. What ties them both together are the whimsical ""food faces"" plates and clever presentations that are Sodamin's calling card. Lobster mac and cheese is served in a cute lobster bowl for example. At $38 per person the Seafood Grill makes for a reasonably priced date night that's certainly comparable to a nice seafood restaurant on land. Make reservations early -- we tried to go back later in our cruise but it was completely booked.

Shaq's Big Chicken. If Rudi's is our favorite new upscale restaurant onboard then this complimentary chicken sandwich station at the back of the Lido deck has become our go-to casual option. Created by Carnival partner Shaquille O'Neal we love the variety of chicken sandwiches served and even gave the chicken breakfast biscuit a try. (Verdict: A little sweet but we'll take it). The fries are a technical delight – although they are shaped like steak fries they hold their crispiness. While the masses are still lining up for Guy Fieri's burgers which is now in an expanded location on deck 17 we predict that Shaq's Big Chicken will win more than its share of converts.

Fortune Teller Bar on Carnival Mardi Gras (Photo/Chris Gray Faust)

Onboard Neighborhoods. Carnival borrowed a page from Royal Caribbean here and organized the ship around six themed areas known as neighborhoods: Grand Central French Quarter La Piazza Summer Landing Lido and The Ultimate Playground. We predict most passengers will never remember the names. What they will notice though is that different restaurants bars and attractions are grouped together in areas that make sense and have a similar vibe. With its three-story banquette seating and unique side atrium Grand Central has that ""this is where everything happens"" busy vibe from early in the morning until late at night. La Piazza does seem to be a place where people linger for multiple reasons -- not only is it close to the outdoor smoking area it's also where the free pizza and paninis are (and the new Bar Della Rosa). And of course we're already mentioned our love for the French Quarter.

Red Frog Tiki Bar on Carnival Mardi Gras (Photo/Chris Gray Faust)

Supersized Venues. There are always cruisers who eschew the new for old favorites – and what's great about Mardi Gras is that these Carnival hallmarks are bigger than ever before. The RedFrog Rum Bar is now a two-deck Tiki bar taking up more real estate on the Lido with better seating options (and even yummier drinks). The popular Guy's Burger Joint now has plenty of seating and it's been moved to deck 17 right next to the teen club so they can chow down. The Pig & Anchor Smokehouse is the linchpin of the casual Patio at Summer Landing corner. The Alchemy Bar -- always a popular watering hole since being introduced as part of the line's FunShip 2.0 enhancements a few years back -- also has substantial seating so you have somewhere to go after getting that expertly mixed cocktail. Having more space at the places you know your cruisers enjoy makes a lot of sense.

BOLT on Carnival Mardi Gras (Photo: Chris Gray Faust)

Outdoor Thrills. Bolt the first roller coaster at sea is always one of the first things that comes up when you talk about Mardi Gras. The hype is justified; the ride packs a lot of thrills into a short timespan. While some people will always complain about the $15 price we think it's in line with similar cruise ship attractions such as the North Star on Royal Caribbean (currently $29 on Odyssey of the Seas and Anthem of the Seas for an extended ride on sea days) and the go-karts on Norwegian (ok you spend longer on the race track for about the same price -- but you're also not hurtling on a track high above the water either). There was a lot of confusion over how many Bolt laps you get for your money. On our sailing $15 covered one lap but Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy said it would change to two laps on subsequent cruises.

With all of the hype surrounding Bolt it's easy to sleep on the other main attraction in the Ultimate Playground the ropes course. If the height doesn't challenge you then maybe the zip line will. (We saw a few people balk when they got to that part).

Brass Magnolia on Carnival Mardi Gras (Photo/Chris Gray Faust)

Bars (yes most of them!) If your vision of a Carnival cocktail menu is the same old daiquiris and Pina coladas then the bars on Mardi Gras will blow your mind. The line has embraced craft cocktails and taken them far beyond the mixology of the already-great Alchemy Bar. Every bar onboard has something special it seems and that's on purpose according to Eddie Allen VP of Beverage Operations. The new French Quarter neighborhood has two fantastic bars the Brass Magnolia and the Fortune Teller both with a different vibe and completely different cocktail menus. But even the Watering Hole bar which is kind of tucked away outside at the Patio at Summer Landing has its own collection of new-to-the-line drinks centered around refreshment. What I like best of all is that unlike some other cruise line almost every specialty cocktail is included in the line's Cheers beverage package. For the 10-20 percent of passengers who buy a drink package they get the full range of flavors without having to pay extra.

Loft 19 on Carnival Mardi Gras (Photo: Chris Gray Faust)

Loft 19. The suite retreat sounds like a great idea and we've seen the concept executed very well on other cruise lines (Celebrity and MSC have particularly nice sundeck amenities for their suite guests). But using our complimentary pass to the area we didn't see anything that would make it particularly special. The Loft 19 cabanas cost extra whether you're in a suite or not – and they aren't cheap at $500 a day for five guests. Now while the special service that you receive there might be nice for a splurge – you get a free bottle of sparkling wine and bar service which would be fun if you brought four of your friends – there's no service at all if you're just a regular Loft 19 guest. The regular loungers for the non-cabana guests are in less desirable locations. You're far better off going down a deck to the free adults-only Serenity deck where you at least have bar access a wider variety of deck chairs a full pool (as opposed to a hot tub) and a salad bar.

Multiple Your Time Dining Venues. The ship's architects Glenn Aprile and Petu Kummala told journalists that they knew Mardi Gras would not work if all guests followed the same tradition of eating their meals in the main dining rooms and the Lido buffet. There simply aren't enough seats particularly in Flamingo the dining room set aside for Your Time Dining.

To alleviate the pressure the ship made several specialty restaurants -- new Mexican-Chinese restaurant Chibang Cucina del Capitano and Guy's Pig & Anchor Smokehouse & Brewhouse -- complimentary for what they are calling a ""limited time."" Guests were also advised that they could order items from the main dining room -- including lobster on Elegant Night -- in these specialty restaurants.

Passengers didn't get the memo. The lines for the Flamingo Dining Room were long on the first Elegant Night with angry gussied-up guests who waited hours to eat in a more formal setting. Then the next night the specialty restaurants were overloaded when large amounts of people decided to give them a try.

The ship is looking at finding solutions said Duffy who was onboard all week and witnessed the blockages. One option is to put overflow Your Time passengers on the second floor of the Palm dining room which is currently reserved for traditional set dining. Another option is to make it more obvious to passengers that they can get their Elegant Night lobster-- as much as they want-- in the other venues.

Still we ate in Chibang! the Mexican and Chinese-inspired venue during an Elegant Night. While the venue had much faster service than we heard was happening elsewhere among the ship no one told us that we could order the fancier menu items. And for those who love the pomp of a main dining room for dress-up dining the modern setting is not a substitute.

The line will also not say how long these alternative venues will remain complimentary. The term ""limited time"" was thrown around quite a bit with no actual deadline. If Carnival hopes to charge for these venues using them as overflow from Flamingo is also not a solution.

We'll be interested to see how the line sorts this out as the ship builds its way to full capacity.

View of balconies onboard Carnival Mardi Gras (Photo by Chris Gray Faust)

Tiered Balcony Cabins. When you look at Mardi Gras from the outside you'll immediately notice that some of the cabins are recessed inward in a tiered fashion. That allows the ship to not only maximize space it also appears interesting (at least that's what the architects said when they were asked about it).

This tiered design however does mean that your balcony cabin may not be as private as you think. We could see people sitting on a corner balcony from our bed – which made us wonder if they could see us. And when I looked down over my balcony I saw a woman hanging out in nothing but a towel which didn't quite cover everything. Be aware before you bare.

Chibang! Speaking of Chibang! we were underwhelmed by this replacement for Jiji Asian Kitchen. The concept is a bit odd -- you can order Mexican dishes or Chinese dishes or mix and match. We gave it a try mixing it up with a little of both during our meal. What we found was that neither option was all that great. Certainly the Mexican food wasn't nearly as tasty as what you'd find at the Lido in the stellar BlueIguana Cantina. And as for it comparing to Jiji…we'll just shed a tear and wait until we're on a different ship to order Chinese.

Granted this is something that is unique to my sailing as Carnival announced that beginning August 7 more precautions would be placed on ships to guard against the rise of the Delta variant of COVID-19. These include mask requirements in crowded public areas of the ship for all passengers including those who are vaccinated; elevator limits and social distancing signage.

Our sailing had none of that and after two months of sailing aboard other cruise lines with signs masking requirements and limitations in place it felt downright shocking. Elevators were packed with maskless passengers. The piano bars and comedy clubs had every seat filled. All tables and seats were open in restaurants and the theater.

As the week went on we saw more and more passengers put on masks in crowded areas even without the signs. We think the new rules will be wise although we're not sure how it will be enforced; Duffy said that the crew were not intended to be the ""mask police.""

All we know is that when we get home we are getting our own COVID-19 test after being onboard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gyNmhvdXN0b24uY29tL25ld3MvY2Fybml2YWwtdmlzdGEtY3J1aXNlLXJldHVybnMtYWZ0ZXItZmFjZS1tYXNrLXJ1bGVzLWltcGxlbWVudGVkLWNvbmZpcm1lZC1jYXNlcy1vZi1jb3ZpZC0xOS1vbmJvYXJk0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDI2aG91c3Rvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9jYXJuaXZhbC12aXN0YS1jcnVpc2UtcmV0dXJucy1hZnRlci1mYWNlLW1hc2stcnVsZXMtaW1wbGVtZW50ZWQtY29uZmlybWVkLWNhc2VzLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE5LW9uYm9hcmQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Vista cruise returns after face mask rules implemented confirmed cases of COVID-19 onboard,"article

During a cruise on the Carnival Vista travelers learned some of their fellow passengers onboard tested positive for the coronavirus and mask-wearing would be enforced as a result.

The ship departed from Galveston on Saturday July 31 but a viewer who was also a passenger alerted FOX 26 on Thursday an announcement was made mandating a new mask policy everywhere on the ship except for outside.

RELATED: 'Small number of positive cases' reported onboard Carnival Vista officials say

We reached out to officials and they confirmed in a statement that it was ‘a small number of positive cases.'

""We have implemented our new fleetwide mask policy early on Carnival Vista given that we are managing a small number of positive cases on board. Our pre-established protocols of vaccinated guests and crew testing enhanced medical capabilities and contact tracing anticipated the potential for positive cases and they are designed to adapt to various scenarios. We have identified and tested close contacts and anyone who tested positive is in isolation. The decision to implement the mask policy was made in an abundance of caution given our focus on the health and safety of our guests and crew. The voyage will continue as planned and we are dedicated to continuing to provide our guests with a fun and safe vacation. We appreciate the support of our Carnival Vista guests who have been extremely supportive as we implemented the policy Wednesday evening.""

The ship returned Saturday and while it did not disclose if passengers had any symptoms or serious illness. Additionally it's unclear if those who tested positive were breakthrough cases of previously vaccinated. However officials tell us Carnival has been requiring that 95% of its cruise passengers be fully vaccinated before coming aboard.

Effective August 14 through Oct. 31 Carnival will keep its new mask policy in place for all cruises and that all vaccinated guests have a negative COVID-19 test result three days before departing. The company released the following statement:

""Carnival Vista managed a small number of positive COVID cases on the cruise that just returned to Galveston on Saturday despite all our crew and almost all of our guests being vaccinated. All those who tested positive were placed in isolation. As per our protocols we tested all unvaccinated guests who debarked the ship this morning and none of our unvaccinated guests tested positive. In addition we have a process in place to randomly test a large percentage of our crew every day. Carnival is in daily contact with the CDC about the status of all our ships. Carnival Vista is cleared to sail and our onboard protocols meet the CDC guidelines. In addition starting today all Carnival ships will ask their guests to wear masks in certain indoor areas as we flex our protocols to adapt to the changing public health situation.""

Length: 16 nights

Homeport: Miami (United States) to Seattle (United States)

Ports: Santa Marta (Colombia) Cartagena (Colombia) Panama Canal transit Puntarenas (Costa Rica) and Cabo San Lucas (Mexico)

This 16-night Panama Canal cruise is one of Carnival’s longer itineraries for 2022. It connects Miami to Seattle visiting four ports in America’s East and West coasts.

Ahead of a summer season in Alaska the Carnival Freedom departs Florida in April heading south to Panama. Before using the Canal’s new locks the vessel visits two ports in Colombia including Santa Marta – an unusual cruise destination.

After visiting two additional ports in the Pacific the Freedom concludes this one-time cruise in Seattle on May 3.

Length: 12 nights

Homeport: Barcelona (Spain) to Dover (England)

Ports: Gibraltar (United Kingdom) Lisbon (Portugal) Porto (Portugal) Vigo (Spain) La Coruña (Spain) Bilbao (Spain) La Rochelle (France) Le Havre (France) and Zeebrugge (Belgium)

Despite being known for its close-to-home cruises in the U.S. market Carnival Cruise Line has also sailed full seasons in Europe in the past years.

In 2022 the Carnival Pride will offer a unique itinerary in the region connecting the Mediterranean and Northern Europe with this 12-night repositioning cruise.

Sailing from Barcelona the vessel will visit nine ports in five different countries before arriving in Dover. Among the highlights of the itinerary is a 14-hour visit to Le Havre – the getaway to the French capital Paris.

Ship: Carnival Miracle

Date: June 10 2022

Length: 10 nights

Homeport: San Francisco (United States)

Ports: Victoria (Canada) Sitka (United States) Juneau (United States) Tracy Arm Fjord (United States) and Ketchikan (United States)

The Carnival Miracle is returning to Alaska in 2022 with unique ten-night cruises from San Francisco California.

This longer itinerary allows the ship to visit four ports – three in the Last Frontier and one in Canada. An extended 12-hour stay in Juneau means more time for guests to enjoy the city and its surrounding areas.

Before returning to California the Carnival Miracle also cruises through the Tracy Arm Fjord offering the passengers unique scenic views of the region.

Ship: Carnival Sensation

Date: September 12 2022

Length: 10 nights

Homeport: Mobile (United States)

Ports: Key West (Florida) Grand Turk (Turks and Caicos) Amber Cove (Dominican Republic) George Town (Grand Cayman) and Cozumel (Mexico)

Carnival Cruise Line is the only company sailing from Mobile Alabama. With year-round departures from the port the Carnival Sensation offers several different short-cruise itineraries to the Western Caribbean and Mexico.

In September the vessel is also sailing a special one-time ten-night cruise to the Caribbean visiting five different ports.

The itinerary combines calls in both the Eastern and Western Caribbean with visits to ports in the regions including George Town (Grand Cayman) Grand Turk (Turks and Caicos) and Cozumel (Mexico).

Ship: Carnival Splendor

Date: December 27 2022

Length: 3 nights

Homeport: Sydney (Australia)

Ports: Ocean Getaway

With two vessels based in Australia year-round Carnival offers a variety of itineraries in the region from ports such as Sydney and Brisbane.

While longer cruises are more common for geographic reasons Carnival is also sailing shorter cruises with all sea days in the area.

In December 2022 for instance the Carnival Splendor will sail from Sydney on a three-night inter-holidays ocean getaway with no ports of call.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2xvc2FuZ2VsZXMuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdGhlLXNjZW5lLWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvaHlwbGFuZC14LWhlbGxvLWtpdHR5LWNhcm5pdmFsLXBvcC11cC1zYW50YS1tb25pY2EvMjY2NjY0NC_SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbG9zYW5nZWxlcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90aGUtc2NlbmUtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9oeXBsYW5kLXgtaGVsbG8ta2l0dHktY2Fybml2YWwtcG9wLXVwLXNhbnRhLW1vbmljYS8yNjY2NjQ0Lz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hypland x Hello Kitty Carnival Pops Up in Santa Monica,"A giant Ferris wheel cotton candy and carnival games.

The Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning and its carrier strike group carried out realistic training in an undisclosed sea area on July 1 2017. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Li Tang)

During the latest voyage by the aircraft carrier Liaoning fighter jet pilot instructors from the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Naval Aviation University reportedly received certification to operate on carriers at night marking the stage that the university can now coach pilot cadets nighttime carrier operations. This means China's aircraft carriers will get night combat-capable pilots faster than before analysts said on Sunday.In the recent certification exam several pilot instructors from the university steered J-15 fighter jets and landed on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier Liaoning which was sailing in the Bohai Sea on a windy night with fierce sea waves the PLA Daily reported on Friday.This marked that the university is now capable of coaching pilot cadets to operate carrier-based fighter jets at both daytime and nighttime the report said.The PLA's first batch of carrier-based fighter-jet pilots mastered night combat skills in 2018 . And now having instructors gaining related techniques will allow them to teach cadets properly without letting the latter explore by themselves. This will help generate China's aircraft carrier nighttime combat capability more efficiently than before a Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Sunday requesting anonymity.""The biggest challenge of landing on a carrier at night is the low visibility as there is no surrounding environment for reference. Relying on only light instructions on the carrier to accurately land on the small flight deck is a huge test to a pilot's skill and courage the PLA Daily quoted a landing signal officer on the Liaoning as saying.Daytime takeoff and landing are already difficult and dangerous as a carrier flight deck is much smaller than a land-based airfield analysts pointed out.In other navies that operate aircraft carriers like those of the US and France fewer than 60 percent of pilots are qualified for nighttime operation due to its high difficulty China Central Television quoted Chinese military expert Yin Zhuo as saying.But nighttime operation is crucial in combat because surprise attacks are easier at night and if a long-distance operation starts in the afternoon it would also require landing at night Yin said.The Liaoning's latest voyage bagged many other results including giving certification for daytime carrier operation to a new batch of pilot cadets the PLA Daily report revealed.Pilot instructors who operated at night and pilot cadets who operated during the day all succeeded in landing on their first tries the report said noting that the number of people who received a certificate in a single voyage by the Liaoning reached a record high.Also during the voyage an all-female crew independently completed a support mission of dispatching helicopters including Z-8 and Z-9 on the Liaoning for the first time js7tv.cn a news website affiliated with the PLA reported in late July.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL25ld3MvaG9uZy1rb25nL3RyYW5zcG9ydC9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDQyNjYvaG9uZy1rb25ncy1ncmVhdGVyLWJheS1haXJsaW5lLWNob29zZXMtY2hpbmFzLW5hdGlvbmFsLWRhedIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL25ld3MvaG9uZy1rb25nL3RyYW5zcG9ydC9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDQyNjYvaG9uZy1rb25ncy1ncmVhdGVyLWJheS1haXJsaW5lLWNob29zZXMtY2hpbmFzLW5hdGlvbmFsLWRheQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hong Kong’s Greater Bay Airlines chooses National Day for maiden flight,"While a timeline has now been set GBA is still awaiting its operating licence and air operating certificate. It expects to get the latter which covers the commercial and safety requirements necessary to take-off on September 17 Stanley Hui Hon-chung revealed in an interview.

The National Day flight which will take place amid an ongoing surge in coronavirus outbreaks around the globe will be a charter to Beijing according to the company’s director.

Greater Bay Airlines (GBA) bidding to be Hong Kong’s newest carrier will make its inaugural flight on October 1 the 72nd anniversary of the People’s Republic of China the Post has learned.

“In a nutshell the airline is taking shape” the director said while tempering expectations given the collapse in travel demand amid the pandemic.

GBA’s flight to Beijing was a deliberate decision “symbolic” of the airline’s development plan to operate regular flights to the capital and nationwide Hui told the Post.

But the seasoned airline executive expressed unhappiness with unnamed competitors accusing them of slowing down the company’s bid to take flight despite no rival having objected to its operating licence bid.

“We have been reminded time and again to ensure that we comply with the ATLA [Air Transport Licensing Authority] regulations in the areas of Incorporated and Principal Place of Business [IPPB] and financial strength” an exasperated Hui said of the application process that began in December.

In 2015 Jetstar Hong Kong was refused a licence after ATLA ruled the airline’s IPPB was not in Hong Kong but rather Australia where investor Qantas was based.

It is not surprising that incumbent airlines do deploy various means to prevent or delay the entry into the market of new airlines Greater Bay Airlines director Stanley Hui

As part of the licence compliance process principal shareholder Bill Wong Cho-bau – who owns Shenzhen-based Donghai Airlines – pumped in an additional HK$250 million (US$32.1 million) according to a Companies Registry filing on June 30.

Wong previously said he was investing HK$2 billion into GBA’s launch with a predicted 300 employees to start.

“We believe we meet all the requirements. It is not surprising that incumbent airlines do deploy various means to prevent or delay the entry into the market of new airlines” Hui added.

Without an ATLA licence GBA cannot apply to operate scheduled flights and would be reliant on non-scheduled services such as charters.

In a response a Cathay Pacific spokeswoman said while the carrier had not objected to GBA’s licence application it had urged ATLA to take into account Covid-19’s impact on the aviation industry.

She added: “We share in their excitement about the opportunity in Hong Kong and across the Greater Bay Area – there is a wealth of potential for both business and leisure travel as the region continues to develop.”

GBA headed by former top Cathay Pacific executive Algernon Yau Ying-wah had previously said it intended to launch in October but had not indicated a specific date.

The carrier’s debut flight and beyond however remain clouded with uncertainty with Asia facing some of the strictest travel restrictions including in Hong Kong where arriving passengers need to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine.

Mainland China has also seen a recent resurgence in Covid-19 with outbreaks affecting at least half of the nation’s provinces including in the capital.

“We are mindful that as a new airline it takes time to build up a solid foundation. We are not rushing in to expand rapidly until we are ready” Hui said.

“We will adjust our pace of development taking into account market conditions and to what extent travel restrictions will be eased going forward.”

GBA which will initially fly three Boeing 737 aircraft will undergo a series of test flights from the middle of the month overseen by the city’s aviation regulator a key stage in securing permits to start flying.

A final “proving flight” that would culminate with the awarding of the air operating certificate if successful was planned for early September Hui said. But the airline is still running without an official website.

“Under normal circumstances there is sufficient room for GBA in the mainland market and Asia but it would be very very difficult for GBA to reach meaningful operations in a short period of time” said Law Cheung-kwok a senior adviser at Chinese University’s aviation policy and research centre.

Law said he believed the extended travel downturn was within the airline’s expectation.

He added: “I think the first step – getting the first flight in the air to establish itself – is the most important for the commencement of the airline.”

In January GBA formally bid for a licence allowing it to fly to more than 100 destinations across Asia. Almost half of the routes in the bid are to destinations on the mainland.

The rights to the routes were put up for grabs after being relinquished by now-defunct regional carrier Cathay Dragon which was shut down last October as part of a wider restructuring of its parent company resulting in the loss of 5900 jobs.

It’s been a landmark 12 months for Xiaomi already as the veteran manufacturer overtook HUAWEI in 2020 to become the number three smartphone brand in terms of global shipments. The upward trajectory didn’t end there either.

Xiaomi managed to build on this success by reportedly passing Apple for second place according to Canalys’ Q2 2021 global market share report. The firm delivered 17% market share compared to Apple’s 14% making for a rather massive achievement.

The momentum didn’t stop though as Counterpoint Research now reports that Xiaomi has passed Samsung for the top spot in June 2021. The tracker reported that Xiaomi accounted for a 17.1% share of sales versus Samsung’s 15.7%.

This therefore begs a major question. Is Xiaomi able to maintain this momentum and stay ahead of Samsung for more than a month?

How did Xiaomi get to number one?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Perhaps the biggest reason for Xiaomi’s newfound status is the US trade ban against HUAWEI. The sanctions against HUAWEI eventually saw the firm slide down the global rankings in a massive way.

These sanctions opened the door for Xiaomi to step in with the firm passing HUAWEI in Q3 2020. Meanwhile HUAWEI dropped out of the top five globally and in China by July 2021. Xiaomi used this opportunity to expand to (or grow in) over 100 overseas markets often targeting HUAWEI’s strongholds in Europe South East Asia and other markets. In fact Canalys noted that Xiaomi grew by 50% in Western Europe on its way to taking the global runner-up spot. It also saw impressive yearly growth in Africa (150%) and Latin America (300%) in recent months. More reading: Xiaomi buyer’s guide — Everything you need to know

Huawei’s departure opened the door for Xiaomi when it came to carrier partnerships especially in the 5G era. It actually made progress in this area before the HUAWEI ban thanks to tie-ups with European carriers for its Mi Mix 3 5G in early 2019. Things have only improved since then.

The manufacturer told Android Authority that it actually set up an Operator Business Development team in late 2019 to support its global carrier partnerships. This team and its other efforts mean Xiaomi now has direct relationships with 150 carriers around the world it explained. That’s a pretty notable jump from September 2020 when it said it had partnerships with “50 telecoms carriers covering over 100 sub–networks.”

This isn’t the only OEM to benefit from HUAWEI’s US-induced slide as the likes of OPPO realme and vivo have also looked to new markets in a bid to fill the massive void. But market share reports show that Xiaomi is leading the way in this regard. In fact it’s not uncommon to see several Redmi devices listed in the top ten most popular smartphones globally.

Could it keep the top spot?

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

It seems like a tough task for any brand to knock Samsung off its perch for any meaningful period of time as the Korean company has been at the top for almost a decade now. HUAWEI may have seized the crown for a quarter but the combination of pandemic-related timing and trade sanctions meant this was a case of convenient timing rather than a meaningful change.

This latest June 2021 report clearly shows that Xiaomi can beat Samsung though even if it’s only a month. Furthermore the Q2 2021 market share report from Canalys reveals that the two brands were separated by just 1% market share. The company managed to record year-on-year growth of 83% versus Samsung’s 8% growth.

In other words it seems like Xiaomi can keep the number one crown for more than a month if it’s able to keep up its explosive growth. There is a mitigating factor for Samsung though and that’s COVID-19 in Vietnam. Canalys noted that a new wave of COVID-19 affected its smartphone production in Vietnam resulting in shortages of Samsung phones across online and offline outlets. Xiaomi was therefore able to take advantage of this gap particularly when it came to the shortfall of A-series phones.

Samsung is likely to recover in Q3 2021 as its supply chain issues ease Canalys senior research analyst Maurice Klaehne told Android Authority. The analyst adds that Samsung will be able to take advantage of its substantial market share to get priority for components.

The Korean manufacturer is also expected to launch new foldable phones later this year with Klaehne saying they expect a 3x increase in growth over 2020. What does this mean for its overall market share though?

“While this suggests strong growth from an overall volume perspective it will remain quite small in 2021 as we estimate total market shipments at around 9m with Samsung having over 88% market share” the analyst told us.

Xiaomi could lay the foundation for long-term supremacy by taking on Samsung and regional players in other parts of the world.

Samsung isn’t the only company Xiaomi needs to worry about either as it’ll also need to ensure it puts some distance between Apple and itself. After all the iPhone maker was purportedly the number one brand in Q4 2020 after almost four years due to new iPhone sales and a major drop in Samsung shipments. And we know that the quarter after Apple launches an iPhone is usually a strong one for the Cupertino company.

Once Xiaomi has managed to shore up its defenses against Apple it can continue to focus on Samsung. But beating Samsung in the long-term will also require Xiaomi to beat regional top dogs.

It has risen to a distant third place in Latin America for example. Motorola is a massive player in this region occupying second place with 21% market share and Xiaomi could build a foundation for enduring success here by grabbing this share. Its recent ascendancy here particularly in Mexico and Colombia according to Counterpoint Research suggests that it’s on the right path. This would be a dramatic change after its disastrous foray into Brazil back in 2015.

Latin America isn’t the only region with players other than Samsung to beat as Africa also fits the bill. Xiaomi has shown in-roads here too as the aforementioned growth rate suggests. But much like Latin America has Motorola as a huge player Africa has Transsion’s brands (Infinix Itel Tecno).

In fact Counterpoint Research reported that Tecno was actually the top brand in Africa for 2020 with an 18% market share. Xiaomi on the other hand doubled its share from 2% to 4%. Again it’s evident that there’s plenty to gain here. And with the company opening its first African office recently it seems like Xiaomi recognizes the opportunity for a long-term play too.

Does Xiaomi need the US to keep number one?

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

Then there’s North America which has been a Samsung stronghold for years now. HUAWEI attained its huge numbers without the help of the US but success in the region would definitely make Xiaomi’s quest for a long-term top spot much easier.

Chinese players haven’t had the best time in the US as HUAWEI’s attempted entry into the market with AT&T was blocked due to US government pressure. Xiaomi also stated its intentions to enter the US back in 2018 targeting a late 2018 or early 2019 entry. It also noted last year that it was in the “preparation stage” of entering the market. So it clearly has an eye on the country still. Unfortunately the firm told Android Authority that it doesn’t have “any specific timelines to share yet” regarding smartphones coming to the US. Related: US agrees to remove Xiaomi from controversial deny list

Could Xiaomi steer clear of the same sanction-related trouble that befell HUAWEI? That’s a key question but it has already won a major battle against the government after it was accused of having Chinese military ties. The designation would’ve meant that US entities couldn’t invest in the manufacturer. Fortunately the US government was ordered to drop the designation after Xiaomi obtained an injunction and filed a lawsuit marking a major legal and PR victory for the brand.

Another encouraging sign for Xiaomi is OnePlus’s growth in the US. The firm has been in the market since 2018 thanks to a partnership with T-Mobile while subsequent tie-ups with Sprint and Verizon have also been welcome news for Chinese brands. OnePlus might be starting from virtually nothing and only introduced a budget portfolio last year potentially skewing the growth figures. But it was nevertheless the only brand to grow in the US in 2020 and was reportedly the fastest-growing brand in the first half of 2021.

Premium Xiaomi phones have arrived

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

When we pondered whether Xiaomi was the next HUAWEI last year we noted that the brand was bolstering its premium segment in a big way. Fast-forward to the second half of 2021 and the firm has well and truly breached the ultra-high-end barrier with the Mi 11 Ultra.

Xiaomi’s first water-resistant flagship is packed full of features and takes the fight to Samsung and Apple’s Ultra/Pro phones. There’s a 120Hz QHD+ screen an impressive rear camera system a secondary display on the back and fast wired/wireless charging for the 5000mAh battery. It isn’t cheap either coming in at €1200 but it certainly fits the ultra-premium bill in terms of features.

Xiaomi has its roots in affordable devices but premium phones have upsides too.

In any event premium phones could be a key strategy for Xiaomi’s growth prospects. Sure these aren’t volume-driven devices but they do allow the manufacturer to potentially subsidize the volume-driven mid-range and budget phones that are its bread and butter. And the increased profit margin will also open the door for more cash to spend on R&D and promotional activities (e.g. value-added extras and bigger incentives for sales agents).

The increased profits could also help the company bolster its advertising spend which has traditionally been a weak spot for Xiaomi. Samsung is a juggernaut in this regard as its marketing budget often dwarfed former rivals like LG and HTC. And this was arguably one of several factors contributing to Samsung reaching number one status — even when Samsung phones weren’t necessarily better.

What does the premium approach mean for Xiaomi’s previously stated commitment to a 5% profit margin though? “We will always hold to an overall 5% profit margin across all of our hardware business” the company told us in response to an emailed query.

In other words the statement means Xiaomi could make more than a 5% profit margin on some hardware products (e.g. flagships) and way less than 5% on other products to get to the overall 5% profit margin cap.

What to expect in 2022?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

The house of Mi phones and Redmi devices is in excellent shape in 2021 and there’s little reason to doubt that it will be able to carry this momentum into 2022. Between its growing market share in Europe Latin America South East Asia and Africa it certainly seems like Xiaomi is in a good position to keep challenging Samsung over the long term.

Apart from a resurgent Samsung there are a number of real and potential hurdles to overcome nonetheless. For one there’s still the very real threat of Apple passing Xiaomi for the number two spot again as it was able to take the number one position from Samsung in Q4 2020. It doesn’t help that rumors point to Apple offering one or two cheaper iPhones next year.

Another possible hurdle might be HUAWEI in the event that the US trade ban is eased in 2022. A revived HUAWEI might not be able to instantly get back into the top three or four but it could claw back market share that was otherwise up for grabs. This scenario is looking increasingly unlikely as the Biden administration has arguably expanded sanctions against the company.

Finally Xiaomi’s home market is another hurdle to overcome in 2022. The company is currently occupying third place in China behind vivo and OPPO. It still recorded the most impressive growth out of the top five players in the region but it hasn’t challenged for the top spot in years. So it has plenty of work to do if it wants to pass the BBK brands in 2022.

Boeing ‘Hard Sells’ Its F/A-18 Super Hornets To Indian Navy; Global Customers Give It A ‘Royal Snub’,"Is the future of the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet — one of the world’s most lethal combat-proven multi-role frontline fighter jets — hanging in balance? While the US Navy plans to take the jet off-grid lawmakers are persistent for it to stay.

Member of the US House Armed Services Committee which is currently debating the military budget for FY2022 Rep. Vicky Hartzler wrote in an op-ed for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch

“These Super Hornets are a proven platform that will make up the vast majority of the strike fighter force for at least the next decade. Modernizing in this regard is a positive step. However doing so without plans to replace the lost capability is why we need the Super Hornet”.

Though more than 700 F/A-18 Hornets and Super Hornets are in operation today only two foreign militaries have purchased the fighters — Australia and Kuwait.

However despite uncertainty Boeing remains hopeful to bag a deal with the Indian Navy for its acquisition of 57 multirole carrier-based fighters.

US Congress Vs Navy

An intense discussion has erupted in the military circles on the future of the Super Hornets since the US Navy’s announcement last year that it would stop buying F/A-18E/F Super Hornets starting in FY22.

This came after the 2019 budget release in which the US Navy rolled out an ambitious plan to buy 110 Block III Super Hornets over the next five years.

Among the supporters of the fighter jet are US lawmakers who want the Navy to purchase more fourth-generation fighters.

The EurAsian Times earlier reported that the US lawmakers had expressed concern over shifting resources from in-production fighters to the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program.

Panel Chairman Rep. Donald Norcross of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces (D-N.J.) said he found it “unacceptable” that the Navy and Air Force were divesting current aircraft like the A-10 and F/A-18E/F that are still valuable for service to invest in next-generation aircraft when F-35 costs weren’t under control.

On the other hand the US Navy officials argue that the fourth-generation fighter might not remain viable against any threat in the 30-year timeframe taking the fighter’s life to the 2050s.

“If Congress mandates the Navy keep buying the current F/A-18E/F Super Hornets the airframes will be in the fleet into the 2050s. But by then the fourth-generation fighters likely couldn’t stand up to future threats” a Navy official told USNI News.

The Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday made similar comments while criticizing defense lobbyists for pushing Congress to purchase Navy platforms that the service does not want to buy.

“It’s not the 90s anymore. If you go to the tri-service strategy we really try to punctuate the sense of urgency that we feel every day against China to move to move the needle in a bureaucracy that’s really not designed to move very fast” Gilday said.

Rear Adm. Andrew Loiselle who leads the chief of naval operation’s air warfare Directorate (OPNAV N98) informed the committee members that instead of buying new airframes of Super Hornets the Navy’s choice is to pursue the service life modifications for the Super Hornets giving him the flexibility to update more of the fourth generation aircraft if the service needs them.

“Given a limited funding environment the choice was made to put that money against increases of lethality in the weapons and [research development test and evaluation] needed to ensure that the viability of the fourth/fifth generation mix and the weapons needed to be fully capable as a fifth-generation moving into sixth-generation capabilities” Loiselle said.

Global Customers

In 2010 Boeing announced a “Super Hornet International Road Map” highlighting a set of potential enhancements to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet to increase its export prospects.

The elements under the road map included a next-generation cockpit enclosed weapons pod and an enhanced performance engine (EPE) version of the GE F414 among other upgrades.

However despite a promising deal with the Australian Air Force of A$2.9 billion to acquire 24 F/A-18Fs the Super Hornet could not impress upon other foreign customers.

In 2018 Kuwait became the second country to award a $1.5 billion contract to Boeing to build 28 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets for the Kuwait Air Force. The delivery is expected by the end of 2021.

Lately Boeing has lost major export deals to its opponents like F-35s Rafales and Saab Gripens. In 2013 Super Hornet lost the deal to Saab JAS 39 Gripen when Brazil dropped the fighter from its final list. Similarly in 2016 the Danish government recommended procuring 27 F-35As over Super Hornets.

In 2019 Poland too chose F-35 over the Super Hornet for its Air Force similar to the UK Royal Navy when it opted for the carrier-based “C” variant of F-35 for its Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.

This year in June Switzerland confirmed the purchase of Lockheed Martin F-35s over the Super Hornets for its fighter fleet.

Among prospective deals Canada remains one of the countries with which Boeing is looking to seal the Super Hornet deal. To replace its fleet of CF-18 legacy Hornets the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) is eyeing land-based variants of the F/A-18E/F Block III Super Hornet along with the opponents Lockheed Martin F-35A and Saab Gripen E.

Earlier this year Admiral Timothy Keating a former commander of USNORTHCOM and NORAD commented on Canada’s future fighter capability at the Ottawa Conference on Security and Defence.

“The Super Hornet can carry more it can fly longer in terms of time and longer in terms of distance and those are factors that are of surpassing importance to the battle room commander” he said.

The other prospective customer for F-18s is India to which Boeing has offered the naval variant of Super Hornet fighters under the RFI (Request for Information) to acquire 57 multi-role carrier-borne fighters for India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC-1) named Vikrant set to be commissioned in 2022-23.

Indian Navy

Both Indian aircraft carriers are short take-off but arrested recovery (STOBAR) carriers which means they utilize the deck of the aircraft carrier for take-off and landing purposes.

To adapt to India’s needs Boeing demonstrated the jet’s capability to launch from a land-based ski jump in 2020.

According to Boeing India’s press release “The Super Hornet’s unique differentiators for the Indian Navy include its two-seater carrier-compatibility capability which provides operational flexibility and opportunities to integrate future technologies related to manned-unmanned interface from aircraft carriers”.

Recently Ankur Kanaglekar the Head India Fighters Sales Boeing Defense Space and Security showed confidence in winning the Indian Navy’s fighter jet contract outpacing the opponents such as French Dassault Rafales Sweden’s SAAB and Rosoboronexport of Russia.

“The USN will operate Block III Super Hornets for decades to come. With its rapid technology insertion plan Block III will outpace threats for decades to come. This next-generation aircraft is ready to protect Indian armed forces from current and future threats” he said.

Interestingly the Super Hornet is also offered to the Indian Air Force under the RFI acquisition of 114 medium fighters in a contract worth an estimated $20-30 billion. However experts suggest the likelihood of the F-15EX replacing the Super Hornet in Boeing’s offer to the Air Force is very high.

It appears that a contract with the Indian Navy could be a lifeline for the legendary Super Hornets."

You just need to know where to look for them.

Over the past several years my family has been amazed at all the activity going on inside the stems and flowers of our fennel plant in the garden. So much so that we have left it alone and let the caterpillars and bugs have it.

The kids have gotten to where they go out a few times a week and check the number and caterpillars it is supporting to help them begin their metamorphose into butterflies.

We observe the many types of bees collecting pollen and nectar. Assassin bugs or wasps also look for their next meal.

'It's Owl Good': These owls will be watching you at Airlie Gardens

It’s a whole world to itself and I’m sure if you look close enough around where you live you might just find something similar.

Here are a few of our tenants that call our fennel plant home for short periods of time.

1. Assassin bugs

Assassin bugs are great additions to your garden and will hunt down and eat many of the harmful bugs in the area. There are approximately 160 different species of assassin bugs in North America and more than 3000 worldwide.

2. Swallowtail caterpillars

A black swallowtail caterpillar may feed on your plants before making its one to two week transformation into a butterfly. In colder areas black swallowtail butterflies can overwinter in the chrysalis so if they form late it may not come out of the chrysalis until the following spring.

3. Squash bugs

The shield-shaped squash bug resembles a stinkbug but is a bit larger more elongated and black brown or gray in color with orange highlights. Squash bugs are notorious for eating young cucurbit plants but can be controlled organically with an organic insecticidal soap.

4. Bumblebees

You may see bumblebees gathering nectar and pollen from your plants. Bumblebees are social insects that live in colonies and are a key pollinator in nature. While bumblebees keep our ecosystems healthy they are also commercially valuable as pollinators and have become big business over the past few decades. Bumblebees do not make honey but they do gather and store nectar for food.

5. Wasps

Wasps are predators that hunt small insects and use the nectar for quick energy while they hunt among the flowers. I’m absolutely no insect expert and there are over 50 types of wasps in North Carolina. So if you have an idea of what specific type of wasp this is please send me a note to let me know.

I saw my first monarch butterfly of the season July 11 when one landed on the milkweed in my Somerville garden.

Their bright orange coloration warns predators that they are poisonous. Monarch caterpillars eat milkweed which contain cardiac glycosides that are extremely poisonous to most vertebrates. The adult butterflies do not eat; they drink nectar through their proboscis. But the poisons they ate as caterpillars are still stored in their bodies and the compounds are quite distasteful. If a bird tries to eat a monarch it often will take one bite of a wing before tasting the poison and spitting it out. It learns its lesson and avoids preying on monarchs in the future. Monarchs can still fly and travel with imperfect wings so this behavior does not necessarily doom them.

Monarch migration

During the summer adult monarch butterflies live two to five weeks during which they mate and lay eggs that become the next generation. Each generation travels a little farther north as the south becomes too hot for the offspring to survive. The last generation of the season in mid-August or later (the fourth or fifth generation) does not become sexually mature.

As the days become shorter and cooler instead of traveling north the butterflies migrate south up to 3000 miles where they overwinter two miles above sea level in the steep mountain fir forests of central Mexico. Beginning in November the butterflies roost together on branches and tree trunks in foggy cloudy areas that are slightly above freezing. The trees protect them from rain and snow and the humidity keeps them from drying out. Although they do not reproduce here the butterflies still need water and perhaps a little nectar as they conserve their fat reserves throughout a five-month winter. Some of these migrating butterflies live as long as eight or nine months (from August until April).

In February or March as the days become longer and warmer in Mexico the overwintering monarchs become sexually mature and they begin their journey north to find milkweed on which to lay their eggs in northern Mexico and the southern United States. The succeeding generations spread north and east across North America throughout the spring and summer to repeat the pattern.

Life cycle

An adult monarch lays a single egg on the underside of a milkweed leaf which is the only plant monarch caterpillars can eat. Each egg is about the size of a pin head. On average a monarch female lays about 700 eggs in a lifetime. In four to six days an egg hatches into a caterpillar. The caterpillars grow quickly and shed their skin five times before they reach their final size slightly less than 2.5 inches. In just 10 to 14 days they have become almost 2000 times their original mass.

The caterpillar crawls away from the milkweed to find a safe place to pupate. It uses a hook at the base of its tail to attach itself upside down to a plant near the milkweed. It sheds its skin one last time to expose a jade-colored chrysalis. Inside the chrysalis the caterpillar’s mouth parts are reconstructed to form a proboscis it uses to sip nectar. Its eyesight improves greatly and reproductive organs form. All of this occurs in only eight to 15 days after which an adult monarch emerges from the chrysalis. A fascinating time lapse of this transformation can be found here.

The new butterfly pumps hemolymph the bloodlike substance of insects throughout its body. It spends about an hour drying off before it flies away to find nectar. In five to seven days it is sexually mature mates and the female begins laying eggs. An adult monarch mates and lays eggs several times during its weekslong lifespan.

Some monarch facts:

Using cardiac glycoside “fingerprinting” scientists have determined that 85 percent to 92 percent of monarchs overwintering in Mexico feed on common milkweed as caterpillars. Therefore protecting and growing common milkweed is important to sustaining the eastern monarch migration.

The eastern North American monarch population is vulnerable to extinction and is classified as “critically imperiled” because of recent rapid decline and widespread threats..

Common milkweed produces nectar night and day and pollinators visit around the clock.

Monarchs can travel 100 or more miles per day although 25 to 30 miles is more typical.

Yet of all of the sights sounds and smells that characterize the latter part of summer few elicits as unappealing a response as the appearance of the communal shelters used by the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea).

Typically during the first weeks of August the silken tents of the fall webworms become conspicuous enough for people driving along a highway walking through an open hardwood forest or biking on a backcountry road to notice. These unsightly masses of thin white fibers are woven by over a hundred tiger moth larvae that live inside them and are always placed on the very end of a twig of a preferred tree like a cherry or willow.

Eventually these translucent shelters may engulf all of the foliage that occurs over the last few feet of one or several adjacent twigs. The visible presence of various pieces of debris within this enclosure along with the ragged shape of this structure creates a less than attractive mass of material enveloping the twig. Some people liken it to the tattered remains of a plastic grocery bag that has become entangled over the end of a twig and has destroyed all of the foliage around which it has wrapped.

A close view of this seasonal shelter reveals numerous fuzzy black-headed caterpillars that are less than an inch in length. These are the maturing larvae that have been at that site for the past several weeks feeding on the leaves in that immediate location.

Additionally there are clusters of rounded pin-head size masses that are the waste products of the occupants of this structure. The dried pieces of leaves that were never eaten flakes of bark that have fallen from the twig and other scattered clusters of debris also litter the inside of this translucent home.

During the very early summer the adult moth lays her egg mass which contains several hundred eggs in a spot where the future colony is most likely to flourish. Places that are exposed to direct sunlight are typically selected as the foliage of trees on these sites tends to produce a higher concentration of nutrients compared to those that are in the shade for much of the day.

After the eggs hatch the tiny caterpillars begin to create a silken shelter around a section of leaves on which they will feed for then next four to six weeks. Initially the tent produced by the fall webworm is rather inconspicuous because of this insect’s small size. As the larvae grow and consume the few leaves within their enclosure an expansion program begins and more foliage further along the twig is included in the tent. Eventually sticks that may overlap that spot or those that come within a few inches of it may also be incorporated into the developing complex that is wrapped by the webworm’s thin sheet of fabric.

Later during August the larvae reach a stage in their development at which they abandon this shelter and look for a place on the ground in a deep tree cavity or under a section of loose bark in which to spend the winter. After settling into some protective nook the larvae experiences a transition into its pupa stage. It is in this dormant form that the webworm passes the next eight months before emerging as an adult late next spring.

It is important to note that the fall webworm is not the same as the tent caterpillar. The tent caterpillar is well over an inch in length active in the late spring and early summer and makes its tent-like home in a crotch or fork among the interior branches within a tree. The fall webworm is substantially smaller active later in the season and constructs its home on the outermost limbs and twigs of trees and shrubs.

Infestations of fall webworms in any particular place come and go as with population swings for any species of insect. However during those years when fall webworms are few in numbers in a general location their absence often goes unnoticed as it is an occurrence that people do not like. It is not viewed the same way as a chorus of crickets or the bright amber flowers of goldenrod coloring an open area. But fall webworms still are a similar sign that autumn is just around the corner.

When I crossed our driveway last week while serenaded by a vast chorus of cicadas I discovered a substantial coating of a gritty gravel-like substance grating beneath my feet just outside of our garage. I knew instantly what this meant: they were back. I looked up into the leaves above my head and sure enough there they were: catalpa hornworms. The blanket of grit beneath my feet was produced by their unbridled defecations sometimes falling from the branches above me like a gentle rain shower.

Their return signaled the rekindling of an annual life and death drama produced and directed by Mother Nature that movie buffs might describe as a combination of the circle of life (Lion King) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The three principal players in this production are the catalpa hornworm the parasitic braconid wasp and the catalpa tree.

The dramatic interaction between these three adversaries plays out every summer right here in my own Northbrook backyard where a mature catalpa tree throws considerable shade on our driveway and garage. The catalpa tree (also called catawba tree)is distinguished by its large elephant ear-like leaves and long seed pods that resemble green cigars. If you were to Google “cigar tree” the catalpa/catawba will appear at the top of the list.

But these trees have another unique characteristic — their leaves represent the sole source of food for the catalpa caterpillar also referred to as the catalpa worm. It’s a relationship suggestive of the narrow diet of the koala bear that eats only the leaves of specific kinds of eucalyptus trees in Australia.

In any case these caterpillars are the larval stage of Ceratomia catalpae aka the catalpa sphinx moth. In late spring and throughout much of the summer the female sphinx moth lays clusters of eggs on the undersides of catalpa leaves. After they hatch the black and yellow caterpillars boast a horny structure at the end of their abdomens that’s apparently intended to discourage predators. These kinds of caterpillars are often classified as “hornworms” most of which like tomato hornworms are considered serious garden pests.

These hornworms are ravenous eating machines mowing through my catalpa tree’s leaves like little buzz saws and quickly growing to three inches or more in size. In past years significant hornworm infestations have served to completely defoliate my catalpa tree. A sure sign that my tree has been infested (other than the leaves being stripped away) is the layer of grit that appears on my driveway courtesy of the caterpillars’ copious fecal droppings.

But even gnawed down to bare branches the resilient catalpa tree always bounces back immediately sprouting a fresh batch of leaves. Unlike gypsy moth caterpillars which can defoliate and eventually kill oak trees the connection between catalpa worms and catalpa trees is far less lethal as the tree appears to suffer little harm. While defoliation of the tree might be unwelcome and unsightly there is a major upside here particularly if like me you happen to be a fishermen. For the upside just Google “fish bait tree” and see what happens.

You’ll find that the “cigar tree” doubles as the “fish bait tree” because as it so happens catalpa worms make for excellent fish bait especially for catfish sunfish and crappie. In fact some folks plant catalpa trees specifically to attract these caterpillars for use as bait. They then “harvest” their worm crop and either hook them up fresh off the tree or freeze them for later use. You can even go online and purchase preserved catalpa worms that may sell for as much as $7.00 a dozen or more. I can testify first hand that the bluegills in our pond can’t resist them.

So now let’s cue the parasitic braconid waspCotesia congregata the actor that might be regarded either as the hero of our story or the villain depending upon your point of view. If you’re a catalpa tree seeking relief from catalpa worms or a gardener plagued by other hornworm pests the wasp represents the protagonist. If you’re a fisherman collecting fresh catalpa worms for bait the wasp is definitely antagonistic to your quest. Here’s why.

While these tiny half-inch long wasps don’t sting and pose any threat to humans they prove deadly to the catalpa caterpillar in the most sinister of ways. Braconid wasps are parasitoids meaning they eventually kill their hosts in a most unpleasant manner. The female braconid wasp actually pierces the hornworm’s skin and deposits her eggs inside its body where they hatch and become larvae feeding on the caterpillar’s flesh from the inside out. When the time comes to pupate the larvae chew their way out (reminiscent of the movie Alien) and then create tiny silk cocoons on the surface of the caterpillar’s skin. These pupae may number well into the hundreds attached to a single caterpillar. Soon after tiny adult wasps emerge from these cocoons.

The hornworm host although doomed might survive through the stage where the wasp larvae are feeding and developing inside its body but in the end it’s a walking dead zombie worm that will die long before it can spin its own cocoon and emerge as a sphinx moth. Since these wasps short circuit the hornworm’s life cycle and prevent it from reproducing they are considered beneficial parasites (although some fishermen might disagree). Ultimately in this movie there are really no good guys or bad guys just compelling raw evidence that Mother Nature can indeed be a cruel mistress. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the unique mini-ecosystem encompassing the catalpa hornworm the braconid wasp and the catalpa tree.

Sources said the insurance giant is in advanced talks for 10 floors or 250000 square feet at Olayan America’s 37-story 750000-square-foot tower with the famous “Chippendale” top.



“They have a lease out and a deal could be struck within 90 days” one source said.



The long-vacant former AT&T and Sony Building designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee has been closely watched as a bellwether for high-end office leasing. The market’s priciest portion is in less dire shape than the overall market but still weighted down by high vacancy and low physical-occupancy.

Sources emphasized that the Chubb negotiations could still break down in this season of unprecedented uncertainty — including when and if employees will return to offices in large numbers.

4 Olayan paid $1.4 billion to buy 550 Madison Ave. in 2016.

But a completed lease would be a huge breakthrough for 550 Madison where no tenants have yet been signed. Perella Weinberg had talks with Olayan in 2019 but the firm decided to renew its lease at the GM Building at 767 Fifth Ave.



Chubb’s New York headquarters is currently at the Durst Organization’s 1133 Sixth Ave. The firm’s lease there is for 184000 square feet at a gross rent of $88.32 per square foot and expires in 2024 The Real Deal recently reported.



Asking rents at 550 Madison are expected to be above $100 per square foot.



Olayan paid $1.4 billion to buy the city-designated landmark from Chetrit Group in 2016. It’s spending $300 million more to modify the tower’s retail portion redesign its lower-floors façade and create a large public garden behind the lobby — all under the watchful eye of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. RXR Realty is helping to manage the construction project.



Separate CBRE teams are representing Olayan and Chubb. All the brokers either declined to comment or couldn’t be reached. A rep for Durst Chubb’s current landlord declined to comment.

Some “experts” gave the Soho retail scene up for dead following last year’s lockdown and looting. The pandemic had chased residents and killed tourism. Many shops were boarded up in the wake of riots and the entire historic neighborhood seemed to be on its last legs.

But the forecasts proved premature in the extreme.



In the latest case of a glam Madison Avenue brand expanding there high-fashion and fragrance house Givenchy just signed a five-year lease for the retail condo at beautiful cast-iron 94 Greene St. sources said. Givenchy’s other Manhattan location is far uptown at 747 Madison Ave.



The Greene Street Givenchy boutique will have 1667 square feet at sidewalk level and 1600 more square feet below. Devialet previously occupied the space.



Cushman & Wakefield’s Eric Le Goff and Jim Downey repped landlord Continental Ventures. The pair recently placed La Perla at 120 Prince St. around the corner.



Greene Street especially between Prince and Spring has become a prized destination for European luxury brands — among them Christian Dior Louis Vuitton Versace Chloe and Stella McCartney.



Robin Zendell & Associates represented Givenchy. The asking rent was $650000 a year sources said. None of the brokers could immediately be reached.

Congrats to the winners of the Real Estate Board of New York’s Retail Deals of the Year Awards. They orchestrated leases that lifted spirits in the pandemic’s darkest days of 2020.

Newmark’s Matthew T. Leon scored for “most impactful” deal — CultureSpaces’ 30000-square-foot lease at 49 Chambers St. It’s the first US venue for the French digital art museum which launched an immersive exhibition space called Hall des Lumieres on the landmark building’s ground floor.



The “most ingenious” honor went to CBRE’s Eric Gelber Jordan Kaplan Gary Trock and Zach Parisi for bringing Greek seafood restaurant Avra to Rockefeller Group’s 1271 Sixth Ave. — a huge vote of confidence in the prime Midtown office corridor.

Sharonview Federal Credit Union is among the leaders in showing a competitive streak.

The institution opened in south Charlotte in 1955 to serve the members of the Celanese chemical company a major employer in North Carolina for decades. But much of that company’s operations were sold or closed as the textile industry declined forcing the credit union to change strategies

It has worked with Sharonview recently passing 100000 members a 60% growth over the last five years. It took the organization 49 years to reach 50000 members and 17 to reach 100000. It now has the ability to accept anyone living in the Carolinas or contiguous states as members reflecting liberalized regulations of credit union affiliations.

Lots of growth is ahead suggests Rickey Otey who joined the bank in 2014 after working for 17 years at First Union/Wachovia six at Capital One Financial and one at First Niagara in Buffalo N.Y. As chief operating officer he reports to CEO Bill Partin who arrived six months earlier after working at California credit unions for many years.

[media-credit name=”Ricky Otey” align=”right” width=”195″] [/media-credit]

Since the duo joined Sharonview’s staff has grown from 175 to 315 and a new headquarters was set up in Indian Land S.C. a Charlotte suburb. Assets now total more than $1.7 billion. Eleven of its 19 branches are in North Carolina.

Sharonview last week started offering business checking and savings accounts in a pilot program covering several South Carolina offices and Shelby in North Carolina. Once the program is established system wide Sharonview plans to offer commercial lending a new service for the credit union.

Then there’s “indirect lending” which is banking jargon for making used-car loans. Sharonview started offering the loans last year and has signed agreements with various dealers including Hendrick Automotive Group.

Credit unions are on the offensive these days because they can operate at a lower cost and charge lower fees than many commercial banks says Otey. “Credit unions are one of the best kept secrets in financial services.”

Commercial banks say that credit unions have an unfair advantage because they don’t pay corporate income taxes because they are chartered as not-for-profit member-owned institutions that don’t issue stock. That means credit unions also don’t have to satisfy shareholders with higher stock prices and quarterly dividends.

While credit unions can’t use stock to make acquisitions some sellers don’t mind taking cash. That’s how Sharonview entered the Hilton Head Island S.C. market last year buying two offices with $107 million in deposits from Bank OZK a Little Rock Ark.-based commercial bank. They were the only South Carolina branches owned by Bank OZK. It was Sharonview’s first purchase of a bank branch.

The credit union is increasingly opening new branches adjacent to giant rivals. “We want to compete. There’s a stereotype of credit unions not having the technology or services of big banks but nothing could be farther from the truth.” Otey says.

“We just need to continue to tell the story that we represent the values of Main Street not Wall Street” Otey says.",,,,,,,,,,,,

And it’s not the first time the labels have sued Charter for its subscribers’ alleged behavior.

In a complaint filed in US District Court in Colorado July 26th Universal Music EMI Sony Music and Warner Music along with several subsidiaries claim that Charter which provides internet services as Spectrum “has insisted on doing nothing despite receiving thousands of notices that detailed the illegal activity of its subscribers despite its clear legal obligation to address the widespread illegal downloading of copyrighted works on its Internet services and despite being sued previously by Plaintiffs for similar conduct.”

The same group of companies sued Charter in 2019 claiming Charter had received notices that its subscribers were using BitTorrent and other services for pirating music. Between March 24 2013 and May 17th 2016 Charter had “reaped substantial profits from massive copyright infringement committed by thousands of its subscribers” the 2019 complaint states.

“flagrant and serial infringers”

The new complaint covers infringement that allegedly occurred between July 26th 2018 to the present which the labels claim they detected as they monitored Charter’s network.

The labels claim in the complaint that they notified Charter sending 150000 notices of infringement including the unique IP addresses of “flagrant and serial infringers” numbering in the “tens of thousands” on Charter’s network but that the company turned a “blind eye” to the alleged activity.

Charter declined to comment on Saturday.

The new suit is the latest attempt by record labels to hold ISPs responsible for instances of copyright infringement by their subscribers. In 2019 a group of labels won a $1 billion verdict against Cox Communications after a court found it was liable for infringement of more than 10000 musical works by its subscribers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The world’s biggest energy company reported a net profit of 95.5 billion riyals ($25.5 billion) in the second quarter the highest level since the end of 2018. Free cash flow rose to $22.6 billion above the state-controlled firm’s quarterly dividend of $18.75 billion for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

The reopening of major economies has triggered a surge in commodity prices with crude up around 40% this year. In the past two weeks oil companies such as BP Plc Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc have said they will increase share buybacks and payouts confident the worst of the pandemic is over.

Aramco’s annual dividend of $75 billion the world’s largest is a crucial source of funding for Saudi Arabia. The government which owns 98% of the company’s stock is trying to narrow a budget deficit that ballooned last year as energy prices tanked with the spread of the virus.

The results “reflect a strong rebound in worldwide energy demand and we are heading into the second half of 2021 more resilient and more flexible as the global recovery gains momentum"" Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said. “I remain extremely positive about the second half of 2021 and beyond.""

Gearing a measure of net debt to equity fell to 19.4% from 23% at the end of 2020 though it remains above management’s preferred cap of 15%. It declined thanks to higher cash flow and the Dhahran-based firm using some proceeds from the sale of a stake linked to oil pipelines to pay down debt. In June Aramco finalized the $12.4 billion deal with a consortium led by U.S. group EIG Global Energy Partners LLC.

Capital expenditure was $15.7 billion in the first half of the year and Aramco still expects it to be around $35 billion for all of 2021.

The company will release more detailed financial statements on Monday when Nasser will also hold an investor call.

Saudi Aramco profits rose from a year earlier to SR95.47 billion ($25.46 billion) in the second quarter as a recovering global economy pushed up oil prices and allowed the Kingdom to pump more crude.

It represents a 288 percent increase and was affiliated with higher oil prices and a recovery in global demand supported by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions vaccination campaigns stimulus measures and accelerating activity in key markets the oil giant said in a Tadawul filing.

This was slightly above the median of economists' estimate of $24.7 billion — Bank of America predicted $24 billion; JPMorgan estimated $23.7 billion while Al-Rajhi Capital had the highest forecast of $25.3 billion.

“The oil giant has achieved results beyond Al-Rajhi Capital’s expectations” said Mazen Al-Sudairi head of research.

“Our second quarter results reflect a strong rebound in worldwide energy demand and we are heading into the second half of 2021 more resilient and more flexible as the global recovery gains momentum” Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said.

“While there is still some uncertainty around the challenges posed by COVID-19 variants we have shown that we can adapt swiftly and effectively to changing market conditions” he added.

Oil demand is improving with the reopening of major economies and more vaccines roll out with crude up around 40 percent this year. In the past two weeks oil companies such as BP PLC Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have said they will increase share buybacks and payouts confident the worst of the pandemic is over. Still the pandemic is “clearly far from over” Nasser said later on a call with reporters.

Oil prices witnessed its worst week since October last year as the spread of the delta variant especially in China added downside risk to short-term demand outlook. Brent crude fell 7 percent to $70.70 a barrel. Global oil demand remains below pre-COVID levels but should reach near-record levels of 100 million barrels a day next year Nasser told reporters.

Despite the sound profitability and cash position the company trails other Big Oil as it declared a dividend of SR70.33 billion. Aramco’s indicated dividend yield is roughly 4 percent while BP Chevron and Exxon Mobil Corp. all pay above 5 percent.

The price of a barrel of Brent crude the international benchmark has risen about 40 percent this year and closed at $70.70 on Friday after its biggest weekly decline in four months.

The oil giant also benefited from its strategy to optimize its portfolio announcing billion dollar deals in recent months.

“Our historic $12.4 billion pipeline deal was an endorsement of our long-term business strategy by international investors representing significant progress in our portfolio optimization program. Our landmark $6 billion sukuk reinforced our robust balance sheet further diversifying our funding sources and expanding our investor base. And once again we delivered a dividend of $18.8 billion for our shareholders” Nasser said.

He said the company will move forward on a number of strategic programs particularly focusing on sustainability and low-carbon fuels.

Commenting on the company’s new strategy to sell assets and re-leasing them Nasser told Asharq Business TV that this type of investment enhances the role that Saudi Aramco plays in attracting large foreign investments in the Kingdom.

Nasser was referring to the sale of 49 percent of Aramco’s oil pipeline business in June to a consortium that includes Washington DC-based EIG Global Energy Partners for $12.4 billion.

Located at 2232 Lincoln Highway East the cafeteria-style chain restaurant features a menu of burritos tacos burrito bowls and salads. The roughly 2300-square-foot Chipotle takes a spot in East Lancaster Plaza a newly-built shopping center where Jersey Mike’s Subs recently opened.

The new Chipotle features a “Chipotlane” a drive-thru lane used exclusively for orders placed through the restaurant’s digital app.

Based in Denver Colorado Chipotle operates more than 2750 U.S. restaurants all of which are company-owned.

East Lancaster Plaza was built on the site of the former Star Buffet where in March 2017 two children were sickened after drinking tainted apple juice.

Klay Thompson is one of the best shooters to play in the NBA. Per Forbes the three-time NBA champion and five-time All-Star who wears a Golden State Warriors jersey re-upped his contract in 2019 signing a five year deal worth $190 million. Needless to say Thompson has the skills to pay the bills. The baller even nabbed a part in the movie Space Jam: The New Legacy. He's kind of a thing.

But for all of his success — which is quite impressive — Thompson is pretty down to earth and humble. In 2020 an NBC reporter confirmed via Twitter that this world-class player only uses a flip phone.

So if you run into this NBA star at Chipotle ordering up his favorite meal what would you do? If you said break out your phone fire up TikTok and ask Thompson what he is ordering at the fast-food chain then your name might be Kai. Recently this young man — Kai — encountered Thompson during the basketball player's stop at the Mexican grill and did just that. Thompson graciously shared that he was about to get a fire burrito bowl and then urged his fans to follow ""his boy"" Kai on TikTok.

Worship attendance small group attendance and baptisms were up last year in the SBC’s annual statistical report released Tuesday while membership fell below 13 million.

2023 marks 17 straight years of decline for the country’s biggest Protestant denomination. It’s down 3.3 million from its peak with the steepest drops coming during the pandemic. The SBC lost 1.3 million members between 2020 and 2022 alone.

Beyond COVID-19 disruptions Southern Baptists have recently confronted some contentious issues within their convention responding to sexual abuse and clamping down on female preachers which have led some congregations to leave the SBC (including prominent megachurch Saddleback Church).

But statistics indicate that church departures aren’t a significant driver of membership decline; the SBC was down 292 churches last year just 0.63 percent of its total.

In 2023 membership fell by 241000 its smallest decrease since 2018. Yet attendance at SBC churches increased 6.5 percent reaching above 4 million a week for the first time since the pandemic.

Attendance at small groups and Bible studies ticked up 4 percent to 2.4 million.

With fewer Americans than ever attending church and religious disaffiliation on the rise leaders see even small increases in engagement and discipleship as worth celebrating.

It’s the first time in over a decade that SBC worship attendance has grown two years in a row though it still lags behind pre-pandemic numbers. Back in 2019 SBC churches saw over 5 million show up each Sunday.

“Outreach and discipleship are difficult today. They require time and commitment when our culture offers numerous distractions and alternatives. The pandemic was discouraging as fewer people engaged in these activities” said Scott McConnell executive director of Lifeway Research which releases the annual report.

“But as people have re-engaged and new people are participating there is much to celebrate in Southern Baptist churches today while we invite more to join.”

Baptisms the key metric for Southern Baptists also grew for the second year in a row.

“God has been stirring the waters and an upswing in baptisms has solidly begun” wrote SBC president Bart Barber a pastor in Texas.

“Not only have we experienced a second year of increased baptisms but we have also witnessed a year-over-year gain—25.94 percent more baptisms than in 2022—that leaves no room for doubt about what God is doing among our churches.”

Kevin Ezell president of the North American Mission Board said the baptism trend is widespread across regions. Out of 41 state conventions 35 reported more baptisms in 2023 than 2022.

“Pastors are the difference makers here” he said in a statement. “Despite all the distractions and challenges out there they are keeping the focus on evangelism and encouraging new believers to follow up with baptism.”

The report’s release falls about a month before the SBC’s annual meeting which gathers over 10000 messengers in Indianapolis in June. They are slated to address new mechanisms for overseeing abuse reform and reporting as well as clarifications to cooperation agreements and guidance around women in ministry.

The SBC’s current membership of 12982090 is the lowest since 1976. The membership size peaked at 16.3 million in 2006.

One bright spot leaders say is the generosity of members and churches who spent nearly $800 million on missions last year up 9 percent.

“We are sharing the gospel with more people gathering for worship and Bible study in increasing numbers giving billions to support churches serving communities across our country and sending millions to support mission enterprises around the world” said Jeff Iorg the SBC Executive Committee president-elect.

“Southern Baptists are not a perfect people” he added. “But we are a movement making a positive difference in our world and our most recent statistical report underscores this reality and motivates us to press forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vcmVsaWdpb24vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9sZHMtd29tZW4tY2h1cmNoLWxlYWRlcnMtd2hlbi1kaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LDS women push back — again — against an address delivered by a Relief Society leader,"(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints explained that even though she worked outside the home her priority has always been motherhood.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

A Grade II* listed church is to be redesignated as a Minster in recognition of its work in the community.

St Mary le Tower in Ipswich will be given the status next year to coincide with the 825th anniversary of the town being granted a Royal Charter by King John.

The charter was signed by the King in the churchyard in 1200 - although the building was largely rebuilt in the mid 19th Century.

The Church of England in Suffolk made the official announcement on Thursday.

What is a minster?

The status of Minster is bestowed on major churches of regional significance within the Church of England.

The term dates back to the 7th Century and the status helps reflect the church's importance and contribution to the local communities it serves.

In the past 30 years just 15 churches have been granted the status nationally and in total there are only 31 Minsters in England.

Some of these include Hull Minster Lincoln Cathedral and York Minster.

The name of St Mary le Tower will remain in this case the church said.

Why is St Mary le Tower being granted Minster status?

St Mary le Tower earns the status as a vital contributor to local community life.

As well as church services and choral performances that encourage participation from young people it offers a ""top up shop"" for local residents facing financial hardship.

The church has a regular weekly food delivery from FairShare and also now collects additional food from a local supermarket.

A small number of essential toiletries are also generously provided from FIND and church members.

'Community work'

The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich the Rt Revd Martin Seeley made the announcement following months of wide-ranging consultation to assess whether St Mary le Tower should receive this designation.

According to the church the decision ""sets in motion a development plan to strengthen St Mary le Tower's response to the needs of people living in and visiting central Ipswich"".

There will be no change to the way the church is governed or financed and there is no change to its legal status or name.

The honour acknowledges the church's work in the local community and does not alter its relationship with neighbouring churches.

What does Minster status mean for Ipswich?

The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich the Rt Revd Martin Seeley said the church would continue to serve the local community [Church of England Suffolk]

The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich the Rt Revd Martin Seeley said this recognition was ""a sign of the continued commitment to strengthen the ties between the Church and our civic and community partners as together we seek to service the people of Ipswich.

""I look forward to the new ways in which all churches including the newly created Ipswich Minster will be a part of the transformation and flourishing of the town’s future"" he added.

""Now we will focus on the minster-making process and share those important details in due course.""

The Reverend Tom Mumford vicar of St Mary le Tower said their mission was ""to be a welcoming inclusive and open church offering peace and sanctuary to the people of Ipswich"".

""We want to be a place that the people of Ipswich know as their home a place of care and support"" he explained.

""We also want to be a place that people come to Ipswich to visit to enjoy the beautiful and historic building as well as the remarkable town in which it is set.""

'A new chapter'

The Mayor of Ipswich Lynne Mortimer said the move was a ""testament both to the rich heritage and spiritual significance of St Mary le Tower to the town"".

She added it marked a ""new chapter"" in the life of the church.

Terry Baxter BID chair of Ipswich Central similarly welcomed the news.

""The church is currently recognised as the civic focal point for many in the town centre and plays such an important role in engaging with the people of Ipswich"" he said.

John Dugmore chief executive of the Suffolk Chamber of Commerce said Minster status gave the church ""an even more important role .. in bringing together the county town’s incredibly diverse communities"".

Here's what that means for the organization's future,"Bishop Karen Oliveto is retiring in a few months as a United Methodist bishop.

Oliveto was emotional saying those words aloud. As the church's first openly gay bishop her path was not always certain.

""Every day of my ministry I've had to wonder is this the day my ordination will be taken from me?"" Oliveto said.

That is until this year's United Methodist General Conference the church's global legislative body voted to overturn every ban on LGBTQ people. The historic changes include a new definition of marriage as a lifelong covenant between ""two people of faith"" rather than solely between a man and a woman and a repeal of its ban on LGBTQ clergy.

The General Conference also struck down a 52-year-old stance on homosexuality being ""incompatible with Christian teaching.""

""To hear someone say 'we need to repent of the harm we've done.' I didn't realize my body was waiting for that"" said Oliveto.

The changes which are effective immediately open new doors for LGBTQ members. One 24-year-old who wished to go by J.M. is working toward becoming ordained as a deacon in the United Methodist Church.

""We have been here and we have been fighting and our fight has been worth it"" they said. ""It shows that progress can happen and has happened.""

J.M. said they felt they needed to navigate around their identity as part of the LGBTQ community and not address it directly until the General Conference.

""Queer kids … the church once told them 'you're loved' but then made that love conditional when they started to question their sexual orientation or gender identity"" said Oliveto. ""They're going to hear 'We love you. We want you to be who God made you to be.' That is huge. Lives will be saved.""

The General Conference overwhelmingly supported the end of anti-LGBTQ church laws after more than 7600 mostly conservative congregations chose to disaffiliate from the United Methodist Church by the end of last year. That equates to about a quarter of U.S. Methodist churches.

Those U.S. congregations were able to leave because of a 2019 special General Conference that passed a plan for congregations that wished to depart for ""reasons of conscience"" regarding human sexuality.

There was widespread joy and celebration at the General Conference that concluded on Friday but there are still global members including those from central conferences in Africa Europe and the Philippines who do not stand by the new changes.

Some African delegates protested after the vote on changing the church's stance on marriage according to the United Methodist News Service.

Reverend Jerry Kulah a delegate from Liberia said at the rally ""We do not believe we know better than the Bible.""

The General Conference also passed a constitutional amendment known as worldwide regionalization which means many congregations that disagree with the church's new inclusive stance on LGBTQ people will likely be able to make adjustments that fit their beliefs.

Regional conferences could customize parts of the Book of Discipline which outlines church laws instead of needing to conform to judgments dominated by the U.S. That includes the ordination and marriage of LGBTQ members.

The regionalization amendment must receive support from at least two-thirds of annual conference voters who are part of local governing bodies. The votes will likely not be finalized until late next year.

Even with regionalization at play some congregations may choose to depart the United Methodist Church.

Many congregations that left by the end of 2023 joined the Global Methodist Church which launched in May of 2022 and has rules against LGBTQ ordination and marriage.

Keith Boyette a former United Methodist Church member who is overseeing the Global Methodist Church during its transitional period said the Global Methodist Church now has more than 4500 churches about 90% of which are in the U.S. It will hold its General Conference in San Jose Costa Rica in September.

Boyette does not think regionalization will be helpful for the United Methodist Church.

""I believe in the long run there will be a decline in the membership of the United Methodist Church because of the decisions it has made"" he said.

But Bishop Karen Malone the president of the Council of Bishops of the United Methodist Church is confident regionalization has the ability to strengthen the church.

""It allows for a more contextualized ministry in order to address the specific social and cultural contexts"" she said.

Malone recognizes that some congregations still may decide to leave following the decisions made at the General Conference. But she also believes that ""others will come home"" she said. ""That some were waiting and have left for a season.""

As the church moves forward Malone said there is a renewed spirit of hope with the stance that all people are fully welcomed into the total life of the church.

As Oliveto reflects on the changes and prepares for life beyond the ministry she said ""I feel like I'm leaving the church better than I found it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvb2R0di5jb20vbmV3cy9rYWxhbWF6b28tY291bnR5L2NvbW11bml0eS1jbGVhbnMtdXAtY2h1cmNoLXRvcm5hZG8tYWZ0ZXJtYXRoL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvb2R0di5jb20vbmV3cy9rYWxhbWF6b28tY291bnR5L2NvbW11bml0eS1jbGVhbnMtdXAtY2h1cmNoLXRvcm5hZG8tYWZ0ZXJtYXRoL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Community cleans up church tornado aftermath,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.woodtv.com/news/kalamazoo-county/community-cleans-up-church-tornado-aftermath/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvb2R0di5jb20vbmV3cy9rYWxhbWF6b28tY291bnR5L2NvbW11bml0eS1jbGVhbnMtdXAtY2h1cmNoLXRvcm5hZG8tYWZ0ZXJtYXRoL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvb2R0di5jb20vbmV3cy9rYWxhbWF6b28tY291bnR5L2NvbW11bml0eS1jbGVhbnMtdXAtY2h1cmNoLXRvcm5hZG8tYWZ0ZXJtYXRoL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) memilih untuk menekuni kembali hobi melukis.

Di tengah Pemberlakuan Pembatasan Kegiatan Masyarakat (PPKM) presiden keenam RI tersebut menghabiskan waktunya menggoreskan kuas di atas kanvas. Sudah sekitar 2 bulan ini ia melukis di sudut studio mini di rumah Cikeas.

Kepala Badan Komunikasi Strategis Partai Demokrat Herzaky Mahendra Putra mengunggah kesibukan bekas Ketua Umum Partai Demokrat tersebut di akun media sosialnya.

Ia mengizinkan Kompas.com untuk mengutip unggahannya.

Muncul karena PPKM

Dalam unggahannya ia memperlihatkan foto SBY yang mengenakan topi khas pelukis di antara sejumlah karya lukisannya. Salah satu lukisan yang dipamerkan adalah lukisan ombak di tepi pantai yang diberi judul ""Debur Ombak di Pantai Pacitan"".

SBY kata Herzaky sebetulnya sudah hobi melukis sejak duduk di bangku SMP.

""Inspirasi beliau sumbernya bisa bermacam-macam. Imajinasi foto karya Ibu Ani maupun fotografer lainnya"" kata Herzaky saat dihubungi Kompas.com Sabtu (7/8/2021).

Hobi melukis SBY ini juga lantaran penerapan PPKM di Indonesia. Melukis menjadi salah satu medium SBY sebagai medium perjalanan batinnya selama ini.

""Mengelola dan meresapkan pengalaman dan perjalanan batin beliau dalam memimpin bangsa ini selama sepuluh tahun dan dalam mencermati situasi terkini bangsa ini"" tulis Herzaky.

Herzaky menuturkan melukis juga memberi kesempatan bagi SBY untuk menjalani kehidupan setelah berpulangnya isti SBY Ani Yudhoyono pada 2019 lalu.

""Karena bagaimanapun kehilangan cinta sejati dan pendamping hidup seperti Ibu Ani tentu juga sangat membekas bagi beliau"" tulis Herzaky.

Ekspresi cinta kepada sang istri

Melukis sekaligus menjadi medium bagi SBY untuk mengekspresikan rasa cintanya kepada Ani Yudhoyono.

Ini terbukti ketika SBY rela menghabiskan waktu sehari penuh menyelesaikan lukisan pada 6 Juli 2021 lalu. Lukisan itu ditujukan sebagai hadiah ulang tahun bagi mendiang istrinya.

Dalam sebuah pos yang diunggah akun Instagram Agus Yudhoyono SBY berdiri di sebelah sebuah lukisan senja dengan dua lembar cetak foto tersemat di meja jangka terbuat dari kayu.

SBY mengatakan dalam video tersebut biasanya ia dan sekeluarga merayakan hari ukang tahun Ani dengan berziarah ke makannya di TMP Kalibata. Namun demi menghormati aturan PPKM yang diterapkan pemerintah tahun ini ia tak melakukannya.

""Sebagai gantinya siang dan sore hari ini saya melukis. Dan lukisan ini meskipun dunia (kami) berbeda dengan izin Allah saya persembahkan untuk istri tercinta"" kata SBY.

SBY mengakui bahwa sejatinya lukisan tersebut merupakan foto pemandangan hasil jepretan Ani Yudhoyono pada 2015.

""Oleh karena itu tepat di hari kelahirannya ini siang dan sore hingga sekarang ini saya melukis sebuah pemandangan yang indah yang manis dan mengirimkan surat Al Fatihah semoga istri tercinta hidup tenang di sisi Allah SWT"" ujar SBY.

Melalui akun Instagram dengan handle @cakecaine Nadin Amizah hadir sebagai bintang tamu dengan topik besar Musik Indonesia di Mata Gen Z. Kepada Dave dan juga penonton Instagram Live akun Harper's Bazaar Indonesia (@bazaarindonesia) Nadin membagikan cerita mengenai antusiasnya bermain dengan kata-kata indah sejak awal kariernya. Namanya memang dikenal dengan puisi luar biasa cantik yang selalu ia bacakan pada saat dirinya sedang menyanyi ataupun pada bagian takarir di Instagram dirinya. Berbincang mengenai hal tersebut Nadin membuka proses yang ia lewati sampai dapat merangkai kata-kata yang begitu indah di umurnya yang sekarang telah menginjak 21 tahun. Simak perbicangannya di bawah ini:

""Yang saya mau tahu dari Anda adalah kok bisa anak seumur kamu jatuh cinta pada kata-kata dan mampu merangkai kata demikian indahnya? Kecintaan Anda pada kata-kata itu mulainya dan ceritanya bagaimana?"" tanya Dave.

""Sebelumnya terima kasih banyak. Kata-kata yang saya rangkai dibilang indah that is such a blessing. Sepertinya apa yang membuat saya jatuh cinta sama kata-kata itu adalah bagaimana cara Bunda berbicara kepada saya. Dari dulu sejak kecil kalau beliau menasihati saya beliau menasihati dengan banyak susunan kata-kata. Ia tidak memberi tahu bahwa 'tidak boleh ini itu' tapi ia akan berpetuah begitu. Ia akan menceritakan 'dulu Bunda sih seperti ini' dan menurut saya ada sesuatu yang cantik sekali dari bagaimana kata itu dapat menerjemahkan apa yang kita rasakan. Dan saya pikir tidak semua orang punya gambaran bagaimana cara menggunakan kata-kata secara efektif. Saya merasa bahkan saya pun menulis masih selalu mencari tahu bagaimana caranya bisa menulis lebih indah supaya apa yang saya rasakan itu bisa terasa ke apa yang saya rasakan di tangan. Kadang bisa 'saya mau tulis apa tapi yang keluarnya jadi apa' itu menjadi tantangan juga. Tetapi semakin saya banyak belajar saya jadi ingin bisa mengeluarkan persis yang saya rasakan begitu. Dan sebenernya orang-orang banyak yang bertanya 'Anda baca ya? Siapa penulis favoritnya?' Nyatanya adalah saya tidak memiliki fokus untuk membaca terlalu banyak.

Entah dalam kehidupan sehari-hari atau menjadi tema yang selalu aktual dalam buku lagu puisi atau film. Tema cinta nggak ada matinya. Apalagi kalau sudah bicara soal cinta segitiga. Seru. Karena pasti ada airmata di dalamnya.

Salah satu kisah cinta segitiga yang cukup fenomenal yang saya tahu adalah kisah cinta antara Rahul Anjeli dan Tina. Kenal mereka nggak?

Penggemar film bolywood pasti kenal donk. Benar mereka adalah tiga tokoh utama dalam film ""Kuch-Kuch Hotahai"". Rahul diperankan oleh Shahrukh Khan Anjeli oleh Kajol dan Tina oleh Rani Mukherjee.

Ceritanya Rahul dan Anjeli adalah sahabat karib. Mereka suka main basket berdua. Rahul tak pernah memandang Anjeli sebagai seorang wanita. Dianggapnya sama kayak sahabat cowok saja karena Anjeli memang tomboy.

Suatu ketika datanglah Tina mahasiswi baru di kampus mereka. Tina sangat bertolak belakang dengan Anjeli. Ia berambut panjang cantik lemah-lembut dandan modis girly. Rahul langsung terpesona dan melakukan pedekate ekstrem.

Awalnya Anjeli juga senang ada Tina. Mereka bertiga sering hang-out bersama - hingga pada satu titik Anjeli merasa tersisih.

Ia menyadari dirinya mencintai Rahul lebih dari sahabat dan di saat yang sama ia menyadari bahwa Rahul dan Tina mulai saling cinta. Anjeli mundur memilih pulang kampung dan menghilang selamanya. Rahul menikah dengan Tina.

Tentu saja penulis cerita tak rela kisah berakhir begitu saja apalagi durasi film India kan tiga jam he. Tina meninggal saat melahirkan anak Rahul (Meninggal saat melahirkan apa meninggal waktu anaknya masih kecil ya? Lupa saya soalnya sudah lama nontonnya). Rahul membesarkan putrinya yang diberi nama Anjeli - dibantu oleh ibunya.

Saat si Anjeli kecil ini umur 8 tahun ia membuka surat dari almarhum Tina. Pura-puranya waktu Tina mau meninggal kan dia terasa gitu lalu nulislah semacam surat wasiat buat anaknya.

Pada surat inilah si Anjeli kecil baru tahu sejarah persahabatan tiga serangkai ayahnya ibunya dan Tante Anjeli.

Special to the San Angelo Standard-Times

Seventh-year Winters head football coach Matt McCarty said initial preseason practices were moving a little slow because the Blizzards are switching to the spread offense and tweaking their defense.

But if Class 2A Division I Winters starts slowly this season don’t write off the Blizzards. Winters started 1-6 last year but won three consecutive games – including a COVID forfeit from Coleman – to make the playoffs.

And in 2017 McCarty’s third season at Winters the Blizzards overcame a 1-5 start to finish second in their district.

“Last year we had some kids playing out of position” McCarty said of his team’s 1-6 start that included District 4-2A Division I losses to Cisco and San Saba by a combined 77-14. “We moved our quarterback (Alex Salas) to running back where he could be more of a game changer. And we started our backup quarterback Jon Kullen Busher. Both of them did a great job in their new positions and we won our next two district games (plus the Coleman forfeit).

“I go back and forth about whether to play a tough nondistrict schedule. It doesn’t help your win-loss record but it helps get you situated for the end of the season. Last year we played Cisco closer than anybody in the district (28-14) and we were tied with them at the half.”

Cisco went on to play in the state quarterfinals.

Winters finished 4-7 last year after a 45-7 bidistrict loss to Anson. The Blizzards return 13 starters for this season.

Salas was a senior last year but Busher is back at quarterback. McCarty said the move from the flexbone to the spread offense was to accommodate the skills of Busher and a tall fast group of receivers.

Busher entered the lineup and quarterbacked Winters to district wins over Goldthwaite (28-13) and De Leon (41-14) as the Blizzards made their fourth consecutive playoff appearance.

“He’s a senior and a leader on the team” McCarty said of the 5-foot-11 180-pound Busher. “He can run and throw and he’s tough as nails. He’s a quintessential West Texas quarterback.”

The pass catchers include senior Trent Hamilton a 6-3 225-pound converted lineman; Chaney Bahlman a 6-4 senior; along with speed receivers Dayvin Oats (5-10 160) and Houston Esquivel (5-9 165).

“Hamilton is very athletic. He could play inside receiver tight end or even fullback” McCarty said. “Oats is athletic and Esquivel is our best downfield receiving threat.”

Aidan Leamon a 6-2 180-pound junior has moved from receiver to running back.

“Leamon is special” McCarty said. “He runs hard and he finished third at regional last year in the 300-meter hurdles so he has some speed.

“The skill positions on offense are our strength. We have a lot of speed and decent size to go with it. We have a lot of length in our skill players that we haven’t had before” McCarty said.

“Our offensive line is just the opposite. We’re really young. We only have two guys we know for sure are starting.”

Those two starters are third-year tackle Rider Duggan (6-2 210) and returning starter Zander Hadlock (5-10 220) a junior. Senior Connor Garcia is the top prospect at center. Otherwise offensive line positions were up for grabs as preseason practices played out.

The most points Winters scored last year against a team with a winning record was 22 against Anson.

Defensively the Blizzards allowed 34 points per game during their 1-6 start so improvement within that unit is a priority. Busher will be a third-year starter at inside linebacker Hamilton returns at nose guard and Leamon will lead the secondary at free safety.

“The strength of our defense is down the middle with our nose guard inside linebackers and free safety” McCarty said. “We have more experience coming back on defense and they’re playing in the same positions they played last year.”

Other returning starters up front on defense include Bahlman at outside linebacker and Duggan at end. Oats and Esquivel give the Blizzards a pair of returning starters at cornerback. Senior Cannon Collins (5-9 175) will step in at inside linebacker and sophomore Aidan Bryant is projected to start at outside linebacker.

Chris Martinez another sophomore is expected to make an immediate impact at safety. The 5-4 140-pound Martinez was the district champion in the 100 meters last spring as a sophomore.

“Our expectations remain the same” said McCarty 26-39 at Winters. “We expect to be at or near the top of the district. We’ve got a good senior class and a big sophomore class. I think our district is tougher than last year.”

In District 4-2A DI No. 5-ranked Cisco is the overwhelming favorite to repeat as champion. San Saba ranked No. 17 and the winner of 35 games over the last three years is picked second in most preseason polls. Coleman and Winters are projected to take the final two playoff spots with Goldthwaite and De Leon predicted to miss out.

It happens due to wrong public DNS settings or when the public DNS stops responding correctly.

The VPN connection failed due to unsuccessful domain name resolution

VPN software helps you connect and explore the internet anonymously. On the other hand public DNS services such as Google Public DNS Comodo Secure DNS OpenDNS etc. can help you go through some limitations while browsing the internet. The above-mentioned problem occurs when the VPN app doesn’t comply with the additional public DNS that you set up earlier. Therefore you have to switch to the original DNS to get rid of this error message and continue using the VPN service.

What is VPN connection failed due to unsuccessful domain?

When the installed VPN app cannot connect to the server due to some incorrect settings users get this error on their Windows 11/10 computer. This error message is a representation of a problem occurring due to the wrong public DNS or settings.

How do I fix VPN unsuccessful domain name resolution?

You can fix the VPN unsuccessful domain name resolution issue by switch back to the original DNS given by your ISP. In case your ISP has not provided a separate DNS setting you can choose the Obtain DNS server address automatically option.

The VPN connection failed due to unsuccessful domain name resolution

To fix this error – The VPN connection failed due to unsuccessful domain name resolution follow these steps:

Press Win+R to open the Run dialog. Type ncpa.cpl and press the Enter button. Right-click on the network adapter and select the Properties option. Double-click on the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4). Choose the Obtain DNS server address automatically option. Click the OK button.

Let’s check out these steps in detail.

At first you have to open the Network Connections panel. For that press Win+R to open the Run prompt type ncpa.cpl and press the Enter button.

Here you can find all the networks that you were connected to. You have to right-click on the network adapter or connection which is creating the issue and select the Properties option.

Now it opens up a popup window. Find out the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and double-click on it. Alternatively you can select it and click on the Properties button.

Next select the Obtain DNS server address automatically option and click on the OK button.

After that close all the windows and try to connect to the VPN server. Hopefully you won’t get any issues now.

Why does my VPN say unsuccessful?

This error message can appear due to two reasons – 1] the VPN app is not complying with the public DNS you are using on your computer. 2] the public DNS is down due to some problems. If the second reason is not valid for you you can revert the custom DNS settings from Network Connections panel. Whether you are using a Wi-Fi Ethernet or mobile hotspot you can change the settings using the guide mentioned above.

PHILADELPHIA – Not long after Zack Wheeler spent Sunday afternoon dominating the New York Mets across the street at Citizens Bank Park leading the first-place Phillies to a 3-0 win the Eagles took the field for an evening practice at Lincoln Financial Field.

There was another Zach different spelling who drew some of the biggest cheers when he was introduced to a crowd that mostly filled the lower bowl at the Linc. That was Zach Ertz who took the field and turned a couple of circles saluting the crowd of 25896 and thumping his No. 86 with one hand.

Then when practice heated up under the lights with the barrage of nonstop music and the occasional E-A-G-L-E-S chants Ertz gave the fans something more to cheer about. He was involved in several team drills making a few catches and showing that while he is still here he will be used by new coach Nick Sirianni.

Quarterback Jalen Hurts also got a nice ovation but perhaps the loudest applause was showered upon defensive end and Super Bowl LII hero Brandon Graham.

Hurts though made the play of the night when he rolled left during 11-on-11 and threw a strike to Quez Watkins who went above Anthony Harris just over the goal line securing the ball then somersaulting into the end zone. The play covered about 50 yards.

The QB wasn’t done. Later in the practice Hurts threw a perfect touch throw to Travis Fulgham down the right sideline for a 35-yard gain.

As for Sirianni this was a new experience for him too.

The coach held the final practice of OTAs on June 4 inside the Linc. There weren’t any fans then.

Still he was nonplussed by an experience that was MIA last summer due to the global pandemic. This was the first time the Eagles practiced in front of their fans since the summer of 2019.

“Just being part of the best fan base on the NFL” said Sirianni when asked how much he was looking forward to the atmosphere. “I’m just looking forward to going out there and being around the fans but whether it’s practice in front of nobody or practice in front of 40000 or a game in front of 70000 people the way you approach your business has to be the same.

“That’s been my messaging. Hey there’s going to be people in the crowd tonight. Last year that wasn’t a thing so it’s going to be different. But that’s how each game presents itself. Again practice is great preparation for what you’re about to do in a game. … So nothing changes. I didn’t even address it to be 100 percent honest because it’s just business as usual.”

The players however were a different story.

LB Alex Singleton on zoom prior to Sunday's practice at the Linc.

“It’s been kind of cool (Sunday)” said the linebacker Alex Singleton. “All the rookies and second-year players because the rookies don’t know. They just know what their college experience was but the second-year guys I think they’re more excited about it than the rookies because they’ve been there they’ve played in games.

Most of last year’s games were played in either empty stadiums or at 20 percent capacity.

“The only game that really had a lot of fans last year was when we went to Dallas so they kind of got to experience that” said Singleton prior to the practice and in a virtual interview. “Everybody knows how people talk about the Linc and Philadelphia fans they’re just all super super excited to be around them for the first time in their careers.

“I know how excited I am just to be back in front of them because we had a whole year without them. How I played last year to just be able to show them in person the player I can be. It’s exciting. I know everybody in the building is excited to get over there. I know we’re excited for Thursday (in the preseason opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers). Having two home preseason games is exciting. Overall the building is charged up. We’re ready to go we’re ready to get over there.”

The practice was the longest of training camp under Sirianni running one hour and 50 minutes. When it was over Graham went to a nearby microphone and led what remained of the crowd in an E-A-G-L-E-S chant.

Realmuto (10) and starting pitcher Zack Wheeler (45) celebrate after Wheeler pitched a shutout during the Philadelphia Phillies game against the New York Mets at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia Pa. on Sunday August 8 2021. The Phillies won 3-0. Read more

It dawned on Zack Wheeler in the eighth inning Sunday that he hadn’t put a runner on base for a while. How long? He wasn’t sure nor was he aware that the last Phillies pitcher to retire as many consecutive batters in a game was the Hall of Famer whose uniform number was retired a few hours earlier.

“To do that on his day” Wheeler said “what can you say?”

Advertisement

Seriously though what can you say about this day -- or this past week? They almost defy words.

Before the game the Phillies took the late Roy Halladay’s No. 34 out of circulation forever in a poignant ceremony. Then Wheeler making his 34th start for the Phillies twirled a gem that would have made Halladay blush. He threw a two-hit shutout in a 3-0 victory over the free-falling New York Mets -- his former team no less -- and gave the Phillies their eighth victory in a row. At one point he retired 22 straight batters the most by a Phillies pitcher since -- you guessed it -- Halladay’s perfect game on May 29 2010.

How’s that for baseball poetry?

“It was like Roy had his hand on him” manager Joe Girardi said fighting back tears.

That’s eight consecutive wins now for the Phillies their longest streak since a nine-game roll from July 29-Aug. 6 2011 -- the last year they made the playoffs.

OK so it’s too soon to mention the postseason. But this is what kind of week it was for the Phillies: They began last Sunday in third place 4 1/2 games behind Mets; they will wake up Monday 2 1/2 games in front of New York two ahead of the second-place Atlanta Braves. It’s the first time in 105 years -- since September 1916 -- that they moved into first place within a seven-day span of being at least four games out in August or later according to the Elias Sports Bureau.

So when Wheeler trotted back to the mound for the ninth inning the announced crowd of 39186 -- largest at Citizens Bank Park since Sept. 14 2019 -- erupted in applause. A fan base that’s thirsting for winning baseball that hasn’t seen the postseason since Halladay’s epic duel with St. Louis’ Chris Carpenter on that fateful night in 2011 finally seems ready to fall for a team again.

“We know what time of year it is. We know who we’re playing and what’s at stake” Wheeler said. “To come out here and really bear down today and get this win and get the sweep and put ourself that much more in front ...”

Wheeler shifted gears. He didn’t want to get ahead of himself.

“We’ve still got a lot of baseball left. We’ve got to concentrate and just know the task at hand basically and just come ready to play every day.”

Girardi thought it was Wheeler’s best start of the season which is saying something considering the All-Star right-hander has emerged as a favorite to win the National League Cy Young Award.

But with a chance to sweep the Mets two days after passing them to reach the apex of the division Wheeler dialed up his blazing fastball and didn’t relent. He threw 18 pitches that registered 99 mph or faster through four innings according to Statcast his most ever in a start. He gave up a leadoff double to Brandon Nimmo and then nothing else until Michael Conforto’s one-out walk in the eighth.

And with his 108th and final pitch he whiffed Pete Alonso with a sinker that registered 98 mph.

“I didn’t want to come out of the game. I wanted to finish that game” Wheeler said. “With the fans as crazy as they were and as loud as they were it gave me that extra little bit that I needed to get through that.”

Wheeler said he wanted to lean on his fastball regardless of the opponent. But the Mets by their admission have had trouble handling fastballs all season. Wheeler recognized the weakness and exploited it.

“I’m not shocked” Bryce Harper said. “That’s him. Just vintage Wheeler out there doing his thing.”

Just like Halladay used to do.

“It just happened to be on Roy’s day. That gave me a little push” Wheeler said. “I saw his number on the back of the mound every time so it pushed me a little bit more.”

Segura sets tone

Jean Segura who had X-rays Saturday night after a pitch hit his lip after ricocheting off his finger returned to the lineup and drove Mets starter Taijuan Walker’s 12th pitch of the game out of the park to left field.

J.T. Realmuto went deep two batters later and although it was only 2-0 it felt like the Mets -- losers of nine of their last 11 games -- had no chance.

“Jean giving us the lead right away with the way that Zack looked today I thought it was really important” Girardi said. “Then you get another one from J.T. and it’s 2-0 and when Zack is on the mound sometimes that’s a lot of runs because he’s that good.”

20-homer club

With a solo shot in the sixth inning Bryce Harper reached the 20-homer mark for the eighth time in 10 years. He’s also the fifth active player with at least eight 20-homer seasons by age 28 joining Giancarlo Stanton Mike Trout Miguel Cabrera and Albert Pujols.

Harper has also reached base in 17 consecutive games posting a .551 on-base percentage in that span."

Equality of opportunity cannot be taken for granted. Over 40 years ago The Clorox Company established a foundation to help provide just that. Over the years the foundation has evolved to engage in and help address the changing needs of society and our communities. In that time it’s made a strong impact in our hometown city of Oakland California and in places around the globe awarding cash grants totaling nearly $130 million plus millions of dollars more in product donations in times of natural disaster and humanitarian crisis.

This year with Clorox crystallizing its long-held purpose and province as a health & wellness company the foundation adapted its mission and focus to align with that purpose.

The new mission of the Foundation is: to foster healthy and inclusive communities so people can be well and thrive.

This mission is rooted in determining the sweet spot between our company purpose employee interests and societal needs. And the issues we have faced over the turbulent last year with a global pandemic and a racial justice awakening have reshaped how we believe the foundation can help make a difference in people’s lives.

Signature theme — Health security

Born out of this is a signature theme for the foundation a way for it to stand for something — a singular platform upon which to organize its giving to be the most meaningful and impactful. Our signature theme is Health Security which is based on the belief that health and wellness is a basic human right. The Clorox Company Foundation is focused on helping to ensure the equality of opportunity of under-resourced people and our communities providing support to improve their overall physical and mental health to help them flourish.

Based on the promise of Health Security the foundation will now focus on programs that support three areas:

1) Community wellness

Racial Justice: It was critical for us to make racial equality and equity core to our giving to address social determinants of health.

Youth Development/Education: This is longstanding area we have funded that focuses on literacy mentoring and STEM contributing to enduring change by giving young people and young minds the opportunity to thrive.

Sustainability: Central to the company’s focus on ESG and at a time we the health of the planet is in jeopardy these grants will focus on environmental issues that disproportionately impact urban areas and communities of color.

2) Disease prevention

Given the continuing COVID crisis and what lies beyond COVID this is a new important area where The Clorox Company Foundation is uniquely positioned to help.

3) Disaster relief & preparedness

This continues our public health legacy based on our longstanding partnership with American Red Cross and other relief organizations.

Employee giving and volunteering

A significant part of the foundation is the company’s employee giving campaign (GIFT) and volunteering program. Clorox matches employee’s donations dollar-for-dollar up to $2500 per year and rewards U.S. and Canada employees’ volunteer hours. While the causes employees choose to support may be broader than the Health Security focus of the foundation’s grants employee giving and volunteering are an integral part of the foundation’s footprint. Through volunteer rewards we support our employees with $10 per volunteer hour outside of work up to $300/year to donate to the nonprofit of their choice.

We have to give Ecogreen 10 acres to set up the plant. We have already issued the tender and received estimates from three agencies. The technical evaluation of these agencies will be done first after which one agency will be given the contract of bio-remediation and clearing waste. The estimate of the project is around Rs 16 crore” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.On April 13 2018 Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had laid the foundation stone of the plant.Ecogreen got environmental clearance for the project from the Union ministry of environment forests and climate change in 2019.In November 2020 the MCG House passed a resolution to cancel Ecogreen’s contract citing inefficiency in managing the city’s waste and failure to set up the waste-to-energy plant. The resolution however was rejected by the Haryana government in December 2020.“MCG will hand over land to us after the civic body clears the waste. It is likely to be done in a month’s time after which we will proceed with work on the plant” said Sanjay Sharma deputy CEO of Ecogreen.According to the tender document the height of the Bandhwari landfill is 40 metres and the total area is nearly 31 acres.The ownership of the landfill site is with MCF and the site has been used for open dumping of solid waste since 2010. Around 27.5 lakh tonnes of waste have already been deposited at the landfill and an additional 1800 tonnes are dumped every day.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company is rolling out a new version of the beverage across the United States designed to taste more like regular Coke.

Maybe you like the new flavour. Maybe you prefer the old one but you don't really care. Or maybe you hate it so much that you vow never to buy another Coke Zero again.

The last option should make Coke shudder and remind the company of an infamous period in its history: The 1985 New Coke debacle.

The change to the Coke Zero recipe is a risk by the company and might divide consumers. (iStock)

Companies like Coca-Cola have to walk a fine line when it comes to their signature products. They have to keep up with consumer trends and stay ahead of the competition. But when they make changes they run the risk of upsetting loyal customers and chasing them away from the brand. And it can be difficult to predict what people actually want.

Rival PepsiCo learned that in 2015 when it removed aspartame from its Diet Pepsi formula in response to consumer complaints about the ingredient. Enough shoppers balked at the new recipe that Pepsi brought the aspartame version back the following year.

But when it comes to product missteps nothing comes close to New Coke. The brand has to be careful not to stumble again today.

The story of New Coke

In April 1985 Coca-Cola held a buzzy New York City press conference to unveil the new recipe for the drink confirming rumours that the company was changing its signature product for the first time in nearly 100 years.

""At the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center some two hundred reporters photographers and cameramen eagerly awaited confirmation of the sensational news while hundreds more participated via satellite"" wrote Thomas Oliver in his 1986 book on the topic The Real Coke The Real Story.

New Coke was supposed to solve a big problem for the company: In the years leading up to the announcement the iconic drink was losing share to Pepsi. The rival cola had been bragging that consumers preferred its product for years through its ""Pepsi Challenge"" ad campaign which pitted Coke against Pepsi in blind taste tests. New Coke was born of a taste test of Coke's own. Nearly 200000 consumers who tried the new formula liked it better than the old Coke said. It's been described as a smoother sweeter version of the original.

Still the new product was met with immediate outrage. The New York Times reported in a 1985 story that one man wrote a song called simply ""You Changed the Taste."" The song's message was clear: ""Our feelings are very strong after 99 years of being right you did your country wrong"" the lyrics read. ""So now hear our plea and know that this is no joke just give us back the taste of Coke."" Others formed protest groups the Times noted. Another reportedly compared the change to the death of a friend.

By May 1985 fears were spreading among executives that the outrage could lead to a boycott of other Coke products according to Oliver.

In a blog post detailing the history of New Coke the company outlined the backlash it received: ""By June 1985 The Coca-Cola Company was getting 1500 calls a day on its consumer hotline compared with 400 a day before the taste change"" according to the post. ""People seemed to hold any Coca-Cola employee — from security officers at our headquarters building to their neighbours who worked for Coke — personally responsible for the change.""

According to a New York Times story from July 1985 executives began to seriously consider bringing the old version back in June just a few months after unveiling the new product. The company tracked consumer reaction to the new product in the weeks after launching it. They found that at first most people actually preferred the new product. But eventually more people said that they liked the old version more. That trend continued into the summer.

Coca-Cola listened to its bereft fans. It brought the old formula back and eventually scrapped New Coke altogether.

The backlash to the new recipe and rallying around the old ended up ""reaffirming to people that this classic traditional brand has meaning to them beyond a search for a particular kind of taste"" said Amanda Ciafone author of ""Counter-Cola: A Multinational History of the Global Corporation"" which looks at social movements and culture surrounding the company. Coca-Cola points to the incident as an example of how much Coke matters to people.

Now some people have a nostalgic attachment to New Coke. In 2019 the company brought back a limited number of New Coke cans in a cross-promotional campaign with Netflix for the third season of Stranger Things which featured the item. Bringing New Coke back was a way for Coca-Cola to ""not take ourselves too seriously"" Stuart Kronauge then president of Coke's sparkling business unit and senior vice president of marketing for Coca-Cola North America told CNN Business at the time. To recreate the product Coca-Cola had to reach into its archives to get the design and dig through its vault to recover the recipe.

Duane Stanford editor and publisher of Beverage Digest has another take.

""The lesson that they learned from New Coke was that ... consumers really pay attention to this kind of stuff"" he said. ""And it's a great way to continue to get people to think about your brand.""

But he warned the company has to make sure not to take things too far. ""The last thing you want to do is turn off your core consumers.""

The right kind of buzz

Coca-Cola has been rolling out its new version of Coke Zero Sugar which is designed to taste more like regular Coke internationally for months. This summer the new version hit the United States.

Across the world frustrated customers have expressed dismay over the new formulation. On Twitter users described the taste as ""bleh"" and ""not good."" One said that it ""sucks.""

Around the time that Coca-Cola announced the rollout in the United States Rafael Prandini category lead of Coca-Cola Trademark in North America told CNN Business that the company was confident in how the beverage would be received. ""We pre-tested both the new recipe and the new look with current Coca-Cola Zero Sugar consumers and non-consumers"" he said at the time. ""And they really love it."" The results the company has seen from these launches are ""very encouraging"" he said.

The company added Thursday that since the recipe change Coca-Cola Zero Sugar ""continues its strong performance across Europe and Latin America.""

9Honey didn't received an immediate response from Coca-Cola Australia about if or when we'll get the new Coke Zero recipe.

Some people have been responding to the new flavour positively and have said so online. ""It's good!"" one person concluded. Another said the product ""hits that Coca-Cola craving"" just as Coca-Cola had hoped.

The last time the company changed the formula and packaging for the drink in 2017 some consumers were also disappointed. Still Coke Zero has been increasing its share in the US low-calorie soda market since then according to data from the market research firm Euromonitor International.

Creating ""a little controversy online with social media users"" can be a good thing for the brand as long as dedicated customers don't turn on Coke Zero said Stanford. It can also keep the focus on Coke rather than its competitor.

Coca-Cola Zero Sugar is still far ahead of Pepsi's version of the product. According to Euromonitor International Coke Zero sugar held 21% of the US low calorie soda market in 2020. Pepsi Zero Sugar didn't crack the top five brands on the list which include leader Diet Coke Diet Pepsi Cherry Coke Zero and upstart Zevia. While both Coke Zero and Diet Coke are zero-calorie drinks Diet Coke has its own flavour and following while Coke Zero is designed to mimic the taste of regular Coke.

During a July call with analysts discussing second quarter earnings PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said that Pepsi Zero Sugar and other zero sugar options are ""getting a lot of consumer favour"" adding that the company will continue to invest in zero sugar options.

""PepsiCo is really leaning into their Pepsi Zero Sugar offering"" said Stanford. ""They are coming after that [zero sugar] market share. So Coke's really got to stay on its game in order to continue the growth of Coke Zero Sugar.""

The company has set “A World Without Waste” as its goal. Kalia Patsia Corporate Affairs & Sustainability Manager for Coca–Cola HBC Cyprus spoke to the Cyprus Mail about the company’s notable achievements as well as the aim of the new campaign called “Every Bottle Matters.”

Tell us a little about your new campaign and your goals

Last month we launched the “Every Bottle Matters” campaign aimed at raising awareness about the importance of recycling and the need for society to shift toward a cyclical economy. Our company’s position is that each business is a part of the community in which it operates and should provide solutions to the major issues facing that community. That is why we are undertaking specific initiatives.

Our goal for 2030 is to recycle a bottle or can for every one sold so that each packaging lasts more than one lifetime. Coca-Cola HBC is taking concrete steps to support the national effort to increase recycling of single-use plastic bottles and we want our country to attain its targets – 77% by 2025 and 90% by 2029 – as defined by the European Union.

It should be noted that we are founding members of Green Dot Cyprus and through specific actions we have long played a part in collecting and recycling but also in raising awareness among the public. What’s more we welcome the recent announcement by Agriculture Minister Costas Kadis regarding the rollout of a successful and functional deposit return system concerning the packaging of our products.

What kind of actions does your company take to reduce its environmental footprint?

We aim to take more and more actions geared at reducing our environmental footprint. To maximise our effort we are working on implementing a consistent focused approach in strategic areas for our company for stakeholders and for the community. Our actions serve to boost the various green drives. Our main pillars are: water recycling and energy.

Water

Water is the source of all life. Safe and clean drinking water is essential to human health and to ecosystems. Being the key ingredient in our products water is an integral part of the production process since it is used during the production process as well as for cleaning and disinfecting machinery. It is also necessary to grow the raw materials that we use.

We handle this staple commodity water with the respect it deserves. Across our production process we implement standards and policies geared at the responsible management of water and its recycling. We carry out daily inspections and online measurements and analyses to track and deal with any water leakage. Our factories recycle the water and re-use it wherever possible. At the same time we are designing and implementing a plan to ensure healthy and sustainable management of the water resources that we use – for instance waste processing which protects marine life. In 2020 our productive units re-used and recycled 989000 litres of water while our water usage fell by 25.6% compared to 2019 – corresponding to 25168608 litres.

In fact and because of our strategy the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) has granted us certification for responsible water management for all our production units.

Beyond that and regarding social programmes over the last seven years we’ve been working alongside the Global Water Partnership Mediterranean (GWP-Med) organisation in implementing the ‘Mission Water’ programme from which Cyprus stands to benefit for years to come saving 5840000 litres of water a year. The programme promotes better water management by adopting alternative forms like rainwater or grey water to cover usages such as irrigating green spaces. It’s worth noting that as part of the programme 19 projects of national importance were carried out 16 grey water collection systems were installed and restored at schools and athletics grounds 30 technicians received training 280 teachers received re-training while 83621 residents of Cyprus benefited in one way or another.

Recycling

In 2018 at Davos James Quincey Chairman & CEO of The Coca‑Cola Company announced the company’s global vision for ‘A World Without Waste’ – an industry-first goal to collect and recycle the equivalent of every bottle or can it sells globally by 2030. Since then our goal globally has been to design and realise initiatives and actions in line with this vision.

Our strategy for sustainable growth focuses on the following pillars:

Designing packaging consisting of at least 50% recycled plastic by 2030; Collecting and recycling one plastic bottle or aluminum can for each one we place on the market by 2030; Working with valuable partners like the AKTI Project and Research Centre in implementing the Zero Waste Beach programme.

Having already achieved our target – 100% of our packaging is recyclable – we are currently aiming at collecting and recycling on a one-to-one basis of each packaging we have on the market by 2030. In addition by 2030 our PET packaging will contain at least 50% recycled plastic while we also focus on innovation and on developing packaging with a lighter environmental footprint. We’ve also replaced plastic straws with paper straws for the Lanitis 250ml and the Lanitis Kiddo juices.

Within the year we shall be carrying out an important investment worth €4 million involving the scrapping of plastic foil wraps on aluminum multi-packs. This initiative is a first for the industry of non-alcoholic beverages but also for our country as a whole.

To us initiatives that are collaborative in nature and are driven by sustainable growth constitute the optimal means for giving back to the community. For the third straight year we are renewing our partnership with the AKTI Project and Research Centre in implementing the unique Zero Waste Beach project. It aims to mobilise all stakeholders as well as the public in the fight against marine plastic pollution through Intervention and Education helping people change their attitudes toward the issue of waste. It’s a programme that will bequeath a legacy to future generations.

Energy

We recognise the critical consequences of climate change both for the planet itself and for humans. Correct energy usage is key to our company’s sustainable growth also impacting cost.

Being committed to playing a part in limiting climate change our priority lies in minimising our environmental footprint across the value chain including for consumption relating to our supply chain as well as in the end-use of our products.

In this context the actions we take to cut back on energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions go hand in hand with our contribution to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in particular those pertaining to responsible production and consumption clean energy and countering climate change.

At our factories we see to it that we track energy usage on an ongoing basis with continuous measurements we control for gaseous pollutants and immediately repair energy losses where these are detected. Thanks to this commitment and vigilance in 2020 we managed to reduce energy consumption at our factories by 5423727 MJ – or by 14% compared to 2019. We’ve also made a pledge that by 2025 50% of power at our factories will derive from renewable and green energy sources and that 100% of the electrical energy supplied to our factories will come from renewables.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8va3VuLnV6L2VuL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wOC8wNy9zdGF0ZS1zaGFyZS1pbi1jb2NhLWNvbGEtdXpiZWtpc3Rhbi10by1iZS1wcml2YXRpemVkLWZvci0yNTIyLW1pbGxpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State share in Coca-Cola Uzbekistan to be privatized for $252.2 million,"State share in Coca-Cola Uzbekistan to be privatized for $252.2 million

Before Cristiano Ronaldo pushed his body to physical perfection with a combination of exercise and diet - he was confronted by a fuming team-mate for drinking Coca-Cola at breakfast.

During his time with Manchester United the future Portugal icon is said to have enjoyed the fizzy drink and was spotted taking a sip while at their Carrington training base.

One unnamed Red Devils colleague is said to have left baffled by his consumption of the sugary beverage and turned matters physical in order to question the youngster.

That confrontation appears to have done the trick with Ronaldo winning five Ballon d'Or awards and scoring 674 club goals and a further 109 for his country since.

The Athletic mentioned the incident in a piece about the journey of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at United saying that Ronaldo was ""pinned up against a wall"" after sipping the drink.

Earlier this summer Ronaldo urged football fans to drink water rather than the Coca-Cola that had been placed on the tables throughout Euro 2020 in the summer.

That snub is said to have wiped billions off of their share price with a fall from $242billion to $238billion coming after he moved the glass bottles away from camera shot.

A Euros spokesman said: ""Players are offered water alongside Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar on arrival at our press conferences.""

Back in 2017 Ronaldo said that he planned to play at the highest level until he his 41 having continued to impress since turning 36 earlier this year.

He said at the time: ""When I renewed my contract I said I'd still be playing when I'm 41 - it was meant half jokingly and half seriously.

""If I feel good without any injuries and I am still motivated I'll play until I'm 35 41 or 45. I don't know.

""I can't see myself going into coaching. That looks unlikely. But I don't know what will happen in the future. ""At the moment I'm only focusing on my playing career.""

Having said of his dietary routine: ""I eat a high protein diet with lots of wholegrain carbs fruit and vegetables and avoid sugary foods.""

Adding: ""If you train regularly it’s important to keep energy levels high to fuel your body for better performance.

The medalists were all traditional baseball-loving nations. The Dominican Republic took bronze while Japan won a pitcher's duel with the United States for gold.

But all six teams were competitive including a team from Israel composed of U.S. collegians independent leaguers and a handful of players who are or have been in the U.S. professional system.

To underscore the point several games went down to the last at-bat on the turf field baseball shared with softball.

The sport also made a bit of history with former short-track speedskater Eddy Alvarez becoming the third American and sixth person overall to win a medal in both the Winter and Summer Olympics.

USA: Prospects and journeymen

Under the guidance of veteran major league manager Mike Scioscia the U.S. team featured a handful of former major leaguers such as Edwin Jackson and Brandon Dickson who won the World Series with St. Louis in 2011.

A couple of players based in Japan made good cases for U.S. teams to give them another look. Tyler Austin the leading hitter in Japan's Central League as of early July hit .417 in the tournament with seven RBI. Nick Martinez who had 4.77 ERA in four major league seasons from 2014 to 2017 and currently has a 2.03 ERA in Japan was the hard-luck loser with no run support in the final and struck out 16 in 11 innings of work.

One prospect who should make Red Sox fans happy is Triston Casas the club's top pick in the 2018 draft. His batting average of .217 was offset by the power he showed with three home runs and eight RBI.

Pro Bowl cornerback Xavien Howard and the Miami Dolphins have agreed to a restructured contract.

""I'm happy"" Howard told reporters Sunday. ""I'll always be happy to be with the team that drafted me and stuck through the ups and downs.""

As part of Howard's new contract the sixth-year player had $1 million in Pro Bowl incentives and $2.5 million in additional incentives added to his 2021 year the NFL Network reported.

Howard who led the NFL with 10 interceptions last season will also reportedly get $500000 in per-game roster bonuses and $100000 in workout bonuses moved to his base salary and guaranteed money in 2022.

""I was just happy about the whole situation"" Howard said. ""I'm just happy to be here and compete with the team.""

Doug Murray/AP Miami Dolphins cornerback Xavien Howard points and runs with the ball after intercepting a pass from Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert during a game Sunday Nov. 15 2020 in Miami Gardens Fla. Howard led the NFL with 10 interceptions.

Howard blasted the team last month on social media expressing his frustration about his contract and saying he didn't ""feel valued or respected by the Dolphins."" The post has since been removed.

""I'm not going to give you guys the details but we're excited to have gotten this done and we are just looking forward to continually improving with X"" head coach Brian Flores said.

Howard had requested a trade but he seems content to be returning to the Dolphins in 2021.

""At the end of the day we got it done so all of the other stuff I'm not even worried about it"" he said. ""I'm just happy to be here.""

According to the NFL Network the deal has been restructured in such a way that Howard can become the NFL's highest-paid cornerback this season.

Flores said the team had been progressing in contract talks with Howard's agent despite what it may have seemed.

""I think compromise is important which we talked about the other day and at the end of the day we want all sides to be happy"" Flores said. ""We feel like that's the case right now and that's how we'll move forward.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwdHYuY29tL25ld3MvdXNhcy1oaWxkZWJyYW5kdC1yZWJvdW5kcy13cmVzdGxpbmctYnJvbnpl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USA's Hildebrandt rebounds for wrestling bronze,"BRACKET (women's 50kg)

After a heartbreaking defeat in the 50kg semifinals on Friday Sarah Hildebrandt left no doubt in Saturday's bronze medal bout defeating Ukraine's Oksana Livach by superiority stopping the bout early by taking a 12-1 lead.

The first period saw both wrestlers warned for passivity with Hildebrandt the one who gave up a point after being put on the ""shot clock."" After giving up a last-second score in losing her semifinal she beat the buzzer herself just before the first-period ended managing to get Livach's leg and taking her back for a 2-1 lead.

Hildebrandt used the ""best defense is a strong offense"" strategy in the second period keeping Livach on her back foot. Needing to change things up Livach shot rashly for Hildebrandt's legs and wound up underneath the American who took a 4-1 lead.

The ending was emphatic. Hildebrandt got Livach down took a second to arrange the Ukrainian's legs then started rolling. Two points for the takedown making it 6-1. One roll for two more points. Then another. Then another. Hildebrandt looked like she wanted to keep going until being reminded that she had clinched the match and the bronze medal.

Hildebrandt had her semifinal bout all but won before China's Sun Yanan chipped away at her lead and scored a last-second four-point throw.

On Friday Hildebrandt looked stunned and distraught on the mat. On Saturday her face was full of tears of joy and she was still crying and smiling when she found the camera to say hello to her family.

The gold medal match was brief. Susaki Yui continued Japan's outstanding performance on the mat taking Sun down right away. As in the Hildebrandt bout Sun found herself being rolled around for multiple scores. Unlike the Hildebrandt bout the one ended with Susaki quickly picking up enough rolls for 10 points and the stoppage by superiority."

Of all the five senses vision is perhaps the most important with 80% of the information we obtain regarding the world around us coming entirely through eyesight. Our eyes collect information about the size shape color and texture of objects. They permit us to have depth perception judge distances to objects as well as inform us whether an object is stationary or moving. If the object is moving our eyes let us know its direction and its relative speed of motion. Our eyes also allow us to perceive the beauty of a sunset and pick up on non-verbal communication signals such as facial expressions or hand gestures. Our eyes function in daylight as well as in darkness and on clear dark nights we can stand rapt in awe as we gaze upon thousands of stars spread across the dome of the sky.

While our eyes function as light sensors it is our brains that make sense of the information being fed to it. As the light impinges upon the sheet of photosensitive tissue known as the retina and located at the very back of our eyeballs the light gets transformed into electrical signals which are then sent along our optic nerve to the brain for processing. In a very real sense our eyes are the brain’s windows not only upon our immediate surroundings but to the Universe at large. Your eyes are the most basic set of astronomy gear that you possess and for this month’s blog I want to do something a little different by paying tribute to the eye.

WHERE’D YOU GET THOSE PEEPERS?

Most animals have functioning eyes (although there are some species that have secondarily lost or reduced their eyes over the course of evolution) and we know from the fossil record that eyes go as far back as 540 million years when for reasons we still do not quite understand complex multicellular organisms suddenly appear in a wide diversity of body plans and lifestyles. Among this dazzling array of ocean dwelling critters were trilobites. Resembling the modern-day terrestrial arthropods many of us know as roly-polys pill bugs or wood lice trilobites possessed remarkably complex compound eyes. Each individual component of their eyes had its own lens made of calcite that gathered information and passed it on to the brain which then formed a mosaic-like image of the trilobite’s immediate environment.

But eyes must surely have a longer history than this. Unfortunately the fossil record doesn’t reveal much information in this regard. To fill in the gaps of the story we must look to modern day organisms to provide us clues. The simplest light detectors are to be found in single-celled organisms such as Euglena. There are many kinds of Euglena but the one many of us are familiar with are the ones often found in ponds. They have a whiplike structure called the flagellum used to propel this unicellular critter through the water and they possess both animal and plant characteristics. For example when behaving like an animal Euglena will engulf food particles in a process known as phagocytosis and when they behave like plants they can manufacture their own food via photosynthesis. At the base of the flagellum is a light sensitive patches known as a “stigma” or“eyespot” which is incapable of forming any kind of image but is very useful in steering Euglena either away from or towards light. Eyespots of one sort or another can also be found in more complex multicellular creatures such as jellyfish and flatworms.

Over time a depression around the eyespots evolved making the organism’s vision a little better by improving the ability to not only detect the direction of a light source but movement as well an important advantage in the deadly game of predator versus prey. Eventually there arose an organism that had the depression around their eyespots closed to a point effectively becoming a pinhole camera of sorts. Eyes became increasingly more sophisticated until finally there appeared the complex eyes of trilobites and many other arthropods (animals with chitinous exoskeletons segmented bodies and jointed appendages such as crabs spiders and insects). But according to the fossil record the evolutionary leap from these simple kinds of eyes to more complex ones like ours (i.e. with a sclera pupil lens and retina) took only about 30 million years which I hate to even say it was a blink of the eye in terms of the long history of life on Earth. For a long time biologists thought that with so many kinds of eyes and ways of seeing that vision must have arisen independently within several different lineages of organisms. But recent studies in genetics and biochemistry have revealed that all these different ways of seeing share a group of light sensitive proteins known as “opsins “ which strongly suggests that eyes have a common ancestry.

I don’t want to give the wrong impression that evolution proceeds towards specific goals or endpoints it has no direction whatsoever no matter how it may appear in hindsight as we look through the fossil record. Evolution is the change brought about by the inherited traits of a population of organisms over time and as such the process is blind with no ultimate or proximate goals in mind. So don’t get the idea that the human eye is the pinnacle of evolutionary perfection because there are many examples throughout the animal kingdom of eyes that far outmatch our own. Eagles for example can see quite clearly for about eight times as far as your eye can allowing them to spot a rabbit camouflaged in its surroundings two miles away. Dragonflies have as many as 30000 facets in each eye and they can see polarized and ultraviolet light forms of light invisible to our eyes. Mantis shrimp possess some of the most remarkable eyes in the animal kingdom. Their eyes are composed of tens of thousands of individual elements allowing them to perceive the world through 12 channels of color along with UV and polarized light. The human eye can process only three channels of color: red green and blue. The largest eyes in the animal world are said to belong to the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). These squid have eyes that are the size of soccer balls making them efficient light collectors allowing the squids to detect the movement of prey as well as predators such a sperm whales in total darkness as they eke out their living at great depths in the Southern Ocean.

THE HUMAN EYE AND STARGAZING

As your eyes take in the world around you the information that they are gathering comes in the way of photons those discrete quanta of light that behave as both particles and waves. Objects may be emitting photons like a light bulb for example or reflecting them like the photons being emitted by the light bulb are bouncing off various objects in a room. Physicists recognize four fundamental forces in nature: the gravitational force the weak nuclear force the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force. Each of these forces has a carrier force particle associated with it which act as the method by which a given force transmits itself to other particles they are affecting. We won’t go into too much depth here but just know that photons are the carrier force particle for all forms of light otherwise known as electromagnetic radiation. The forms of light in the electromagnetic spectrum range from short wavelength high energy gamma rays and x-rays to longer wavelength low energy radio waves and microwaves. The human eye has evolved to only perceive a very narrow sliver of wavelengths (and their associated photons) within the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum namely wavelengths in the range of 380 to 720 nanometers (one nanometer is equal to one billionth of a meter). We are blind to all the other varieties of light outside of these ranges and the ridiculously narrow section of electromagnetic waves that we can detect is otherwise known to us as “visible light”. It is a testament to science and human ingenuity that we have invented detectors to act as supplements to our eyes to learn about a universe that broadcasts itself across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

When we think about our vision or visible light we often associate them with color perception. When our brains tell us whether we are seeing blue or red all depends on the wavelength or energy level of the photons that are hitting the back of our eye. Lining the insides of the back of our eye is a thin layer of tissue known as the retina. The retina has two types of special photoreceptor cells: concentrated in the center of the retina are cone cells and around the periphery of the retina are the rod cells. Cones allow us to perceive color and fine details while the rods allow us to see grayscales in low-light conditions. Retinal cells also contain a variety of those opsins that I mentioned earlier and each is sensitive to the array of photons with different energy levels and wavelengths. As the photons bang into the retina they generate an electrical impulse that then makes its way along the optic nerve to our brains where the signal is decoded to register color and image detail. Since color perception is highly subjective it is difficult to put a firm and fast number on how many shades of color we can discern but it surely must be tens of thousands with many researchers citing a million.

When it comes to stargazing it’s the rods that are running the show. Cones work mostly during the day but if you are looking at a celestial object with a high enough illumination level they can still contribute (i.e. Mars registers as an orange-red while in a telescope you can see the earth-toned belts of Jupiter and bright stars such as Sirius and Betelgeuse show colors as well). The key thing to know here is that as long as the object is capable of zapping your retina with a photon you can theoretically see it. Stop and consider the implications of this: it doesn’t matter how small or how far away something is from you if it can transfer a photon to your eye you can detect it.

Step outside on a good dark night and look at all of those stars overhead. By just glancing at them you can’t really tell how far away they are but they are placed at such tremendous distances from the Earth that astronomers must use a distance unit less cumbersome than miles or kilometers: the light year. One light year is the distance that a photon would travel in one year’s time through the vacuum of space. That comes out to about 6 trillion miles. The closest star system to Earth that you can see with the unaided eye is that of Alpha Centauri relatively close at a mere 4.4 light years (using the fastest propulsion system we now have it would be a journey of many thousands of years before you could get there). Compare that with Deneb currently visible in our night sky within the constellation of Cygnus and which lies at around 1550 light years away. The most distant naked eye star puts even Deneb to shame. It’s known as Rho Cassiopeiae and can be found in the familiar W-pattern of stars that make up the constellation of Cassiopeia. Rho is estimated to be a whopping 8200 light years away and even though it looks tiny and insignificant to your eye you should know that its girth is 40% larger than the entire orbit of Mars around the Sun. And this is an important consideration: most of the stars you can see with your unaided eye are larger than our own Sun some of them with diameters measured in millions of miles (the Sun is just a bit shy of having a diameter of one million miles). Even though they are many trillions of miles distant they are still bright enough given their huge sizes to emit enough photons for the rods in our eyes to detect them.

All these stars that you see are to be found within our Milky Way Galaxy. The Sun and all its family of planets asteroids and comets comprise the solar system and virtually all the stars in our night sky are their own stellar system of planets and minor bodies. Estimates of the number of stars in the Milky Way range from 100 to 400 billion and together we all exist within a single galaxy. But there are many billions more galaxies in the whole shebang that we call the Universe. They all lie at such tremendous distances from us that we cannot see them with the naked eye. All but one that is. Right now if you go outside during these late summer and fall evenings look off to the NE at around 10pm. If your skies are dark enough and you know precisely where to look you can just barely see a dim fuzzy cloud of light. This faint and fuzzy patch of light is the Andromeda Galaxy and it is the most distant object that you can see with your unaided eye at some 2.5 MILLION light years away. At that distance your eye cannot resolve the individual stars that comprise the galaxy and all that we can perceive is their total combined glow. Think about that the galaxy is quintillions of miles away and yet there are enough photons getting into your eye having traveled for some 2.5 million years before they smashed into your retina got converted into an electrical signal which your brain could then decipher as a faint cloud of light upon the sky. And now because you have read this (assuming you didn’t already know about it) your brain can allow you to put the sight into its proper context. You’re welcome.

The rod cells in your retina use a photopigment known as “rhodopsin” and it is key to your ability to see in the dark and to perceive all of the awe and wonder of the night sky. When you step outside at night from a brightly lit room and into the darkness your eye begins to undergo a two-step process known as “dark adaptation” allowing you to see in the low light conditions. The first step is purely physical and it involves muscles that control the diameter of your pupils. During the day or in any kind of bright light conditions our pupils close to a diameter of around 2mm. This controls the amount of light entering the eye too much light will damage the retina hindering our ability to see or in worse case scenarios even blinding us. But under low light conditions the pupils will suddenly expand to gather as much light as possible. In younger people the pupils will expand to as much as 7mm while in older folks like me they will only increase in size to about 5mm. This expansion of the pupils increases the amount of light entering the eye by a factor of some 10 times.

The dilation of your pupils is a response that occurs in seconds while the next step takes up to 20 minutes to complete. This second step involves the retina and its rod cells. After being in the dark for a long enough time the rods begin to produce rhodopsin the light sensitive pigment that makes your night vision work. You may have noticed that upon entering a dark room after being in a well lit one that you cannot see much of anything at first but after awhile you slowly begin to make out the things in the room you might bump into and bruise your shin or stub your toe on. The same thing will happen as you sit outside at night long enough. After leaving the comfort of your brightly lit living room the darkness outside can be intimidating because of the difficulty in seeing things. But after a while objects around you come into view. If you are looking up when you first step outside you probably won’t see anything but the brightest stars but within about 15 or 20 minutes you notice that the sky is filled with many fainter stars. At this point your dark adaptation is complete and you are ready to take in the starry night in all its glory. But whatever you do do not let any bright light hit your eye. Looking into car headlights a flashlight bright house or streetlights or even the bright light from your cell phone will destroy your dark adaptation in a second. Why? Because rhodopsin is a light sensitive pigment and it has a threshold beyond which it will suddenly break down when exposed to enough light. Astronomers are very sensitive about the use of bright lights at an observing site and you can expect to get yelled at if you ever find yourself at such a location and you turn on your cell phone flashlight in order to see around. The best way to preserve your night vision (and that of the cranky astronomers) and still see in the dark is to use a red LED flashlight or a regular old flashlight with red plastic film taped over the lens. Why red light? Red light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than does bluer light and the longer wavelength doesn’t really do any harm to the rhodopsin that your rods slaved over for 20 minutes to make. Each time you let your eye get hit by bright light the longer it takes to get dark adapted all over again. And by the way vitamin A is a precursor to rhodopsin. Your body can convert vitamin A from beta carotene. A great source for beta carotene is carrots. Our mommas might not have always been right when giving out life advice but if yours ever told you to eat all your carrots so that you could see better she was spot on.

Isn’t it amazing how those delicate globes of tissue stuck into the front of your skull in combination with the firm 3lb mass of gray matter inside your cranium conspire together to allow us to appreciate the aesthetic beauty of the night sky ponder over what it all means and to ultimately understand our place in a vast ever-expanding universe?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lYWdsZXRpbWVzLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy93ZWVrZW5kX21hZ2F6aW5lL2dhcmRlbmluZy1ndXktZ3Jvd2luZy12ZWdnaWVzLWluLXNlbGYtd2F0ZXJpbmctY29udGFpbmVycy9hcnRpY2xlX2FmZWM3M2VmLTgwNDAtNWQzMS1hNTk3LWFhOTFmNWVmMGNmOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gardening Guy: Growing veggies in self-watering containers,Henry Homeyer's website is www.Gardening-Guy.com.

I've had the itch to cut the cord for years but I finally made the decision to move on from cable recently and began my testing by looking at YouTube TV.

Hulu with Live TV Cheat sheet Price: $64.99

Channels: More than 74

DVR: 50 hours (or 200 hours for an extra $9.99 per month)

Simultaneous streams: 2

Broadcast networks: ABC CBS FOX NBC The CW

And while it impressed me it still had some quirks about DVR recording management and its mobile picture-in-picture failings. That said it proved good enough for me to not delete my account.

But I moved on to Hulu with Live TV a service that is notable because it includes Hulu's shows and movies at the same $64.99 per month price as YouTube TV. That said I had some difficulties actually watching shows enough that I'm not exactly impressed.

To recap how I got here I want to cut the cord because of the cable box's archaic nature but my roommates don't want to give up their specific channels. So I'm planning on getting rid of my cable box and telling them that their $127 per month cable bill is their problem. I'll even offer to let them share my account with me.

My goal is that somewhere in this experiment I convince them it's time for all of us to wave goodbye to cable. Maybe I can find the set of channels they want in a service we like. But that's not as likely as they're big Yankees fans and the YES Network is stuck on DirecTV Stream fka AT&T TV which I'm not optimistic about.

Where Hulu with Live TV beats (or matches) cable

(Image credit: Henry T. Casey)

Hulu with Live TV defaults to a recent channel view which is a great way to jump back to what I was just watching.

So let's start with the positive things and I hope this section isn't too short. Video (mostly) looks great on Hulu with Live TV and the app often feels like a cable TV box that is adapting to me. The Live TV grid defaults to a recent channel view which is a great way to jump back to what I was just watching.

YouTube TV and cable do not take this personal approach. When you're trying to find a channel — and you can't just dial in a number as I'll get to below — menus can be tiring so Hulu with Live TV's Recents sorting is welcome.

Hulu understands how the grid view of channel surfing is still a priority for those who think like they still have cable. While both Hulu and YouTube have said grid on your TV Hulu also offers it on mobile whereas YouTube TV just gives you a single column stack of what's on live on what channels.

Also Hulu offers picture-in-picture support on iOS something Spectrum does (and YouTube TV doesn't).

Where cable still beats Hulu with Live TV

(Image credit: Henry T. Casey)

The biggest problem for me with Hulu with Live TV was stream stability. While the shows looked great about once every two hours or so it would freeze. I'd have to hit pause and play or move to a different show and back to un-stick it.

This is likely the thing that's stopping me from keeping Hulu around instead putting it near the bottom of my playlist. And before anyone asks I've got pretty damn good internet with 232.49 MBps down and 9.68 MBps up according to Ookla's speedtest.

I've noticed something particularly aggravating and inconsistent about Hulu with Live TV and it made me instantly not want to keep it around. And it's all about rewinding and fast-forwarding live TV. Unlike cable or YouTube TV there are limitations that might have you pulling your hair out.

(Image credit: Henry T. Casey)

I often struggled to rewind and fast-forward live TV programming including a moment where I hit an un-skippable ad break while skimming through the ABC game show The Hustler.

Also Hulu because it doesn't have an unlimited DVR cap like YouTube gives you two options for managing shows you want to see/follow: add to My Stuff or Record. If you make the mistake of just adding a show to My Stuff you'll not be recording it and have an ad-filled queue of episodes to watch.

I also just find the Hulu apps on all platforms to not be big enough for both Live TV and the regular Hulu content. You’ve got a Live section and a TV section and that feels redundant. It’s even more awkward on mobile where the TV section is up top and the Live section is on the bottom.

Does Hulu with Live TV hit the sweet spot for channels and price?

(Image credit: Henry T. Casey)

Just like YouTube TV Hulu doesn't leave me hurting for channels. It's actually even better for me. It's got CNN and MSNBC for when I feel basic enough to want to see how most people process the news ESPN for when I want to see Stephen A. Smith blow up about sports trades and I can follow my favorite sport (pro wrestling — yes I'm trash) on USA TNT FOX and VICE.

Hulu with Live TV struggles on the My Roommates Test lacking PBS and YES the two channels that this household believes are must-have. It's also missing BBC World News another channel the roomies want.

Answering your cord-cutting emails

Reader David Cross (not that David Cross) wrote in to mention that he switched to Sling TV from YouTube TV for the selection. He noted though that he got in early back when YouTube TV was only $35 per month but that didn't last as he said ""I thought since I was an early adopter they would show more love!""

This brings up an interesting situation as service prices do get raised over time. Sling bumped prices up by $5 over the last year and finally moved that new price to users in August. As these still relatively new services grow it's good to keep an eye on them and to think of them still as businesses like cable. It's up to these companies to prove that we shouldn't un-cut the cord.

David's favorite part about YouTube TV is how the Turner Classic Movies channel would put movies in his library for later. I'm curious about what on demand content that I didn't watch will show up in my library.

Reader Alan points out something I didn't think of that we lose when we cut the cord. On cord-cutter services channel numbers are gone. Now you have to navigate menus to find the channel you want and not just tap in a number.

Hulu with Live TV does not rank highly

Two of the best cable TV alternatives in and I've got a wide disparity in my #1 and #2 slots. Because even though I like Hulu's guide-centric organizations I had too many issues with buffering/stuttering as in I had any. YouTube TV offered a much more stable stream so I'm keeping it around for the time being.

Cord-cutting power rankings so far 1. YouTube TV

2. Hulu with Live TV

Next up I'm going to take a look at the affordable Sling and Philo (starting at $35 and $25 per month respectively). After that? Fubo TV and the newly re-christened DirecTV Stream (the service fka AT&T TV) are on deck. By the end of this I'll have made up my mind. But for now I'd need some big shocking reveal and upgrade to Hulu's offering for it to climb out of its hole.

Concertgoers arrived at CMAC with tents the beanbag toss game known as Cornhole beer pong food and cowboy boots along with cowboy hats. In between songs Combs addressed the crowd with a toast with most of the crowd raising their drinks in suit.

""Cheers everybody"" Combs said. ""Thank you so much for being patient and showing up 16 months later!""

One accessory that wasn't as prominent were face masks with only a handful of older venue employees volunteers and concertgoers wearing them.

That didn't mean COVID-19 was far from everyone's mind. For two local health care workers the Combs concert was the first one they had been to since before the COVID-19 pandemic — and while they were both vaccinated they still had concerns.

""We're both vaccinated but we have masks. We might wear them when we get in"" said Emily a health care worker from Rochester.

""We both have young kids that are unvaccinated we're worried about"" she added ""but also heck yeah we're out.""

""It's on my brain but this is absolutely perfect"" said Elizabeth who lives in Farmington. ""People are being really respectful.""

""This is more low-key than any concert I've been to"" at CMAC Emily added.

Eric Redmond and Katelyn West of Erie County both were very comfortable attending the concert with Redmond describing it as a welcoming environment.

""I think it's a good scene. It's nice here"" he said with his fiancee adding how ""being outside helps for sure.""

According to Matthew Geffers assistant coordinator for the venue interest in shows for this year's season has been ""huge.""

""It's pretty well fricking sold out today and tomorrow"" Geffers said in reference to the two Combs shows which were both sold out with 15000 in planned attendance for each night. Drew Parker and Hailey Whitters also were on the bill.

According to the official COVID-19 guidelines on CMAC's website the venue is open to all patrons this summer and does not require any proof of vaccination or a negative test result for admission. The guidelines last updated on June 21 also do not require social distance per New York state guidelines and will operate at full capacity for all events. Any children in attendance must wear a mask however according to the guidelines given how they are not eligible to receive a vaccine. The same applies for people who are unvaccinated although there will be no checking of the vaccination status.

The current guidelines remain in place despite recent spikes in positive COVID-19 cases among children teenagers and a select group of adults who have no record of receiving the vaccine according to Ontario County Public Health. Mary Beer director of the public health agency suspects the variant strain of COVID is responsible for many of the new cases.

Coming up at CMAC are Harry Connick Jr. on Aug. 12; Lynyrd Skynyrd with Kansas Aug. 19; and Little Big Town with Hailey Whitters Aug. 20.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Back in early July we posted a story about a Honda Civic Type R with seemingly no damage apart from missing seats and wheels up for auction on Copart. Now one of our readers has gotten in touch to say that she bought the car and is putting it back on the road.

Tara Bros an electrical engineer living in Minnesota said she bought the car with the help of a friend who works at a dealership and reports that as the photos suggested it was in remarkably good condition.

“It does actually run well” she told us. It “has some scrapes and scratches on the flares but otherwise seems to be in pretty good condition.”

Although she got no information about exactly what happened to the Civic she said she’s convinced it was an insurance job.

“I’ve seen it before and it looks exactly like it right down to the parts stolen were the easiest high dollar things that add up to just about the right amount to ensure the insurance would total it” she proposed. “I mean call me crazy but I don’t see anybody who’s an actual car thief going through the trouble of stealing a Type R and not taking the engine especially since it runs like a top.”

Since getting it off Copart’s lot the car has gotten new wheels and the seats from a Civic Type R that went on to become a racecar. It has also required very little work though the brakes did require some fixing as a result of the car sitting on the discs.

Now the only question is what to do with her current car a 1999 Acura Integra that she bought from her mom. Bros credits her mother (who now owns a Toyota GT86) with getting her into cars. The kind of person who liked to work on her own cars Bros’ mother had her in the garage helping out as soon as she could hold tools.

Although she wants to keep the Integra on the road running both it and the Civic Type R will likely end up being more than she can afford even though she’s getting a good deal on the new car.

When all’s said and done she figures that she’ll be considerably ahead of where she would have been otherwise. Having paid just $19200 for the car she expects to have it on the road with the taxes paid for around $26000. A quick look at similar vintage Civic Type Rs in Minneapolis finds that prices range from $35000 to $40000 though of course they don’t have a salvage title like this one.

For now though the main focus is getting a VIN inspection and a title in Minnesota so that she can fly out to California and drive her new Civic Type R home later this month for what will undoubtedly be an enviable road trip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2hlcmVzLWhvdy1tdWNoLWEtMjAxNS1qZWVwLXdyYW5nbGVyLWlzLXdvcnRoLXRvZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Much a 2015 Jeep Wrangler Is Worth Today,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2hlcmVzLWhvdy1tdWNoLWEtMjAxNS1qZWVwLXdyYW5nbGVyLWlzLXdvcnRoLXRvZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC9icmFuZC1uZXctdG95b3RhLWxhbmQtY3J1aXNlci1jcmFzaGVkLW9ubHktYS13ZWVrLWFmdGVyLWRlbGl2ZXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brand New 2022 Toyota Land Cruiser 300 Crashed Only A Week After Delivery,"The first examples of the Toyota Land Cruiser 300 Series have just been delivered to their owners and one of them has already been involved in an accident that allegedly happened in Russia. While this is not the first wrecked new-generation Land Cruiser we have come across – this title goes to the several models destroyed a few weeks ago while still in transport – it is probably the first one in public roads.

The pictures provided to us by Instagram user @lc300.qa show that the white Land Cruiser collided with a gray Toyota Camry. The SUV has serious damage on the front bumper and the front-left wing while the sedan was hit on the right side towards the front. Airbags were deployed in both cars and thankfully both drivers were unharmed.

The second angle leads us to believe that the accident was probably a head-to-side collision between the cars. The sheer mass of the Land Cruiser and the angle of the crash caused the Camry to rotate by 180 degrees and destroyed the front right suspension. We don’t have more information on the circumstances so it is no clear who was at fault but the road seems pretty wide.

Judging from the front bumper the Land Cruiser is in base spec – the LX and the GR Sport models have a different design. Besides the replacement of body parts the Land Cruiser will probably need extra work in the engine and on the front axle before getting back on the road. Considering that the bumpers were deployed the repair is definitely going to be costly so we hope the insurance is covering it.

It is unfortunate that the driver didn’t have much time to enjoy it before the crash occurred but it is more important that there were no injuries. According to the post the car was delivered only a week ago and the owner is Russian.

You get the 48 MP camera mode Macro mode Vlog feature Night Slow AI watermark Time-lapse Portrait Movie frame Pro and more.

Verdict

The Redmi Note 10T 5G packs all the perks in its segment from its mind-boggling performance to its battery life plus its lightweight design 5G support and a 90 Hz display adds to its overall features. It would have been great if Xiaomi had added an AMOLED display otherwise it’s a great buy especially for performance users the Redmi Note 10T ticks all the boxes in this price range.",,,,,,,,,

Costco doesn't advertise itself as a road trip stop but it's a key part of my ideal road trip.

The big-box store has discounted gas and food plus clean bathrooms.

I stopped at several Costcos while driving 2000 miles around the country and I'd do it again.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

There are plenty of reasons to be a Costco member but here's another in time for any final summer vacation: Costco is the perfect place to stop on a long road trip.

My fiance and I took a nearly 2000-mile road trip at the beginning of summer and we stopped at Costcos all around the Midwest on our trip. Here are three reasons I tell everyone taking a road trip that they should stop there too.

1. Gas prices

Gas is one of the biggest expenses on a long road trip so it's key to get it cheap when you can. Costco is known for having some of the lowest gas prices in the US. In 2019 Insider found that Costco was the cheapest chain for gas in 21 of 50 states.

In the Rochester metro area where I live GasBuddy says the average price of gas is $3.17 per gallon while it is only $2.89 at my local Costco right now. Like its famous rotisserie chicken deal low gas prices are another deal that gets customers on Costco property where they might buy higher-margin items.

As an added bonus in my experience Costco stations are well-lit and have an attendant which makes me feel very safe. On our road trip the attendant would even give us a treat for our dog.

2. Budget-friendly snacks

Maybe you planned ahead and stocked up on snacks before you hit the road. Either way the Costco food court is a great place to stop when you're craving something a little more substantial. For just $1.50 you can get a hot dog and a soda at the same price Costco has sold it for since 1985. They're popular for a reason – in the 2019 fiscal year Costco sold 151 million hot-dog combos for a total of about $226.5 million.

The menu was limited for much of 2020 but now other items are back too including ice cream smoothies and churros.

3. Clean bathrooms

Finally if you're already there for gas and lunch you might as well stop to use the bathrooms too. Costco bathrooms tend to be clean and spacious and you're much less likely to run into a line than at the highway rest stop.

Just make sure to check the store's hours because they sometimes close as early as 6 pm on weekends.

However many Costco shoppers have been noticing that the Costco churro is just not what it used to be. If you've made a similar observation then you might have something to add to the widespread discussion that's taking place online as customers work to pinpoint the exact characteristics of the Costco churro that have changed.

The Costco community on Reddit has been active since u/buycurious posted Friday: ""The churros are very doughy 🙁 I should have listened to everyone but I also wanted to form my own opinion. Please bring back the original."" A chorus of disgruntled fellow churro connoisseurs chimed in to respond with 30 comments at present (and counting). Read on for the litany of churro chides to see whether you had the same experience when you recently bit in. (Editor's note: Images used are meant to represent Costco churros.)

Costco churros may not be as crispy as before.

U/buycurious wasn't the only one who feels Costco churros now lack a certain crunch. U/Bkmademoiselle said ""Ok I'm so glad to see this post because I have purchased churros from multiple [Costco] locations for comparison and they're awful! Way too thick and remind me of play-doh. [sic]""

Other commenters described a similar churro texture like u/thatfamousgrouse who said ""I find the churros to be entirely too bready."" (This was not unlike u/masterbuilder14's adjective of choice: ""mushy."")

They're not as flavorful as they once were.

U/buycurious added a concern beyond the doughy texture saying the new Costco churro ""seems less cinnamon-y"" to me. U/QuickBrownFox86 concurred: ""We need that classic thin churro covered in cinnamon sugar.""

Costco Just Brought Back One of Its Worst Bakery Items

For some the new Costco churros seem too thick.

U/QuickBrownFox86 raised another observation by commenting on the churro's larger circumference of late. Others reflected similarly with u/Bkmademoiselle saying ""I hope they bring back the original smaller/skinnier ones!"" (Costco is known for bringing items back on popular demand—check out This Beloved Costco Snack Just Returned to Warehouses.)

The new Costco churros seem too dry to make some mouths water.

u/jbergy999 said ""I found the current churro to be deeply disappointing . . . so dry.""

Costco Just Issued a Quality Alert for This Type of Milk

Costco ""brought in these twist abominations.""

Shoppers at some Costco locations have noticed one whopping change to the churros: The straightforward stick has been replaced with a spiral shape. ""I've had many versions of the twist churro"" said u/silentspy who added: ""I hate them!""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Costco churros just keep changing.

A few longtime members of Costco have noticed that only one rule about the churro stays the same—and that's that it keeps changing. As u/masterbuilder 14 said ""It upsets me dearly that costco yet again changed the churro recipe i remember when it was just a regular churro . . . now this is like the 3rd time they changed it since like 1999 [sic].""

Variations from an original can be frustrating while sometimes brands actually stick the landing. Read This National Pizza Chain Just Launched a Game-Changing New Cheesy Bread.

Possible explanations for the Costco food court's churro changes:

We've reached out to Costco for comment on what was behind the change in churros. In the meantime one possible reason could be the supply issues and shortages that are facing many food retailers across the country. (Read 6 Shortages Costco Is Facing Right Now.)

Also the newer churro might be a little healthier than the old ones—according to u/QuickBrownFox86 the new churros are ""baked not fried [sic]."" As the user also observes this could be why some customers notice the cinnamon sugar has a harder time sticking to the grease than in times past.

""Oh my goodness how good is that?!"" – @SBurkowskiGC@ArizonaWGolf's Vivian Hou is currently 1 up thru 13 holes in the #USWomensAm. pic.twitter.com/O6ABy76B4W — USGA (@USGA) August 7 2021

Cinderella is still dancing at Westchester Country Club.University of Kentucky junior Jensen Castle  the No. 63 seed who survived a 12-for-2 playoff on Tuesday to advance to match play eliminated world No. 2 and reigning NCAA champion Rachel Heck in a 19-hole semifinal thriller on Saturday afternoon to earn a spot in Sunday’s 36-hole championship match of the 121st U.S. Women’s Amateur Championship.Castle 20 of West Columbia S.C. will face another Wildcat University of Arizona All-American Yu-Chiang (Vivian) Hou  20 of Chinese Taipei for the right to add her name to the list of legends on the Robert Cox Trophy.Hou the 2020 Women’s Golf Coaches Association Freshman of the Year outlasted Michigan State sophomore Valentina Rossi  of Argentina 2 up in the other semifinal.Should Castle prevail she would be the third No. 63 seed to claim a USGA title following Clay Ogden (2005 U.S. Amateur Public Links) and Steven Fox (2012 U.S. Amateur). She is the first University of Kentucky golfer to reach the final.“I keep forgetting I'm the 63rd seed” said Castle who has battled a rib injury most of the summer. “I feel like seeds are irrelevant once you get into match play. It's everyone's game. I’m just glad that the doctor said I could play.”Her championship-match opponent Hou is also recovering from an injury. A partially torn labrum in her left hip kept Hou from playing any competitive golf since the NCAAs concluded in Scottsdale Ariz. in late May. But she is clearly rediscovering her rhythm and is now the first Arizona golfer to reach the championship match since her head coach Laura (Myerscough) Ianello in 2000 at Waverly Country Club in Portland Ore. where she lost to Marcy Newton 8 and 7.Heck 19 of Memphis Tenn. who was bidding to join Vicki Goetze (1992) as the only players to win the NCAA and U.S. Women’s Amateur titles in the same year seemed poised to join her Pacific-12 Conference rival in the championship match. She held a 2-up lead through 15 holes after holing a 35-foot chip shot for birdie.But after finding a greenside bunker on the par-3 16th that led to a bogey (Castle two-putted for a winning par) Heck suddenly found herself with a precarious 1-up lead with two to play. The two tied No. 17 and Heck reached the par-5 closing hole in regulation. With Castle in for par Heck who missed her birdie attempt had a 4-footer for par to close out the match. Heck a rising sophomore at Stanford University pulled the putt badly for just her second bogey of the match.“I thought for sure she won” said Castle of Heck’s par putt on 18. “I couldn't believe she missed it. When I knew she gave me that opportunity I was like ‘All right I birdied [No. 10] earlier I'm going to I birdie this again’ and I went after it.”With newfound life – and confidence – Castle with the honor and added adrenaline blistered a drive just short of the green and right of a greenside bunker on the 274-yard 19th hole. Heck slightly pulled her drive left of the green in the rough.Playing first Heck’s shot stopped 12 feet short of the flagstick. Castle whose ball was in the intermediate cut came up 15 feet short. It looked as if Heck had the upper hand. Laser-focused Castle perfectly executed the birdie putt but showed no emotion. Heck still had a chance to continue the match but the ball hit the right-back portion of the hole and lipped out.“It's tough but I mean I played a good playoff hole” said Heck who is next headed to Wales to represent the USA on the Curtis Cup Team Aug. 26-28. “She made the putt and I don't know how I missed. It was a good roll.”Hou who briefly held the top spot in the Women’s World Amateur Golf Ranking®/WAGR® before falling to her current position of 21 had not played the 17th and 18th holes since Tuesday’s final round of stroke play. That wouldn’t be the case against the left-handed Rossi as it was a tight match throughout.Hou took a 2-up lead with a 12-foot birdie on No. 10 but mistakes on Nos. 13 and 15 – she badly pulled her drive on the latter into the fescue leading to a double-bogey 6 – allowed Rossi to tie the match.On No. 17 Rossi’s approach from the fairway sailed over the green into deep rough. Two shots later she eventually conceded Hou’s par to go 1 down. On 18 Hou split the fairway but Rossi pushed her drive left. After punching out Rossi hit her third shot just over the green. Seeing that her opponent faced a difficult fourth shot Hou could have taken the conservative route by playing to the middle of the green. Instead she took dead aim with a pitching wedge from 96 yards out stopping the ball 5 feet from the flagstick.When Rossi skulled her fourth and failed to hole her fifth the Spartan conceded the hole and match.“I'm not nervous but I knew I couldn't do anything if it's because of my bad shot” said Hou of her emotions coming down the stretch. “So I just try to focus more on my shot by shot and try to hit greens and then just get back to my normal routine.”Sunday’s 36-hole championship match will begin at 8 a.m. EDT and resume after a midday break at approximately 1:30 p.m. Golf Channel has live coverage beginning at 2 p.m. ET.Both finalists are exempt into the 2022 U.S. Women’s Open at Pine Needles Lodge & Golf Resort in Southern Pines N.C. June 2-5. The champion also receives exemptions into the next 10 U.S. Women’s Amateurs while the runner-up earns a three-year exemption.Three tees were significantly moved up for the semifinals. The par-4 seventh with one of the most challenging green complexes on the West Course measured 285 yards 24 yards shorter than the posted yardage. The par-4 10th hole played just 274 yards up 28 yards from the regular yardage and the par-3 16th played 23 yards shorter (168 yards).Yu-Chiang (Vivian) Hou became the fourth University of Arizona golfer to advance to the championship match but is hoping to be the first to hoist the Robert Cox Trophy. Besides Laura (Myerscough) Ianello’s loss in 2000 Marisa Baena (1996) and Annika Sorenstam (1992) also lost in the 36-hole final.Hou can be the third golfer from the University of Arizona to win a USGA title in 2021 joining Jim Furyk (U.S. Senior Open) and Sorenstam (U.S. Senior Women’s Open).Ianello is planning to fly in from Arizona to watch the final. It was a promise she made to Hou after she made the quarterfinals.A victory by Jensen Castle would guarantee her a spot on the 2021 USA Curtis Cup Team that will look to retain the cup in Wales Aug. 26-28. World No. 1 Rose Zhang Rachel Heck and Allisen Corpuz were previously named as the top three Americans in WAGR. The rest of the eight-woman team is expected to be name in the coming days.",,,,,,,,,,,,

While the left-handed players are more attractive to look at the right-handed batsmen have ruled the roost since the inception of the sport.

England-born Australian batsman Charles Bannerman who scored the first century in Test cricket was also right-handed. Sir Donald Bradman and Sachin Tendulkar were also right-handed batsmen.

Even right-handed bowlers like Michael Holding Imran Khan Glen McGrath and many more ruled the sport during their eras. Keeping the dominance of right-handers in Test cricket in mind here is the current World Test XI comprised of the best right-handed players:

1. Rohit Sharma

Rohit Sharma raises his bat after scoring a century against England.

Rohit is a white-ball genius but slowly and surely has grasped the longest format ever since he was asked to open the innings. So far Rohit has played 39 Tests for Team India scoring 2649 runs at an average of 46.47.

The 34-year-old has also slammed 7 centuries and 1 double ton in the longest format of the game. He is currently ranked sixth in the ICC test rankings for batsmen and he has scored the most runs by an opener in the World Test Championship.

2. Kane Williamson (C)

New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson celebrates his 4th Test double ton

Currently the no. 2 Test batsman in the world Kiwi skipper Kane Williamson is an absolute genius when it comes to Test cricket. Ever since he made his Test debut in 2010 against India Williamson has been ruling the batting charts.

In 83 Tests Williamson averages over 53 and has scored 7143 runs with the help of 24 centuries and 4 double tons. The 30-year-old can also bat anywhere in the middle-order but we’ve decided to put him at the top for this hypothetical playing XI.

3. Joe Root

England skipper Joe Root in action during the 2021 Edgbaston Test against New Zealand

England’s Test skipper Joe Root is the only batsman from the ‘fab four’ to play over 100 games in the purest format. He also has the most number of runs among his peers having notched up 8714 runs since making his debut in 2012.

The 30-year-old averages over 48 and has 20 centuries and 5 double tons to his name. He is currently fifth in the ICC Test batsman rankings.

4. Virat Kohli (vc)

Virat Kohli in action during the WTC Final between India and New Zealand

There cannot a World XI without Virat Kohli in it. Though often criticized for his captaincy Virat Kohli is arguably the best batsman in the world averaging over 50 across all three formats of the game.

So far the 32-year-old has featured in 92 Tests for Team India amassing 7534 runs with the help of 27 centuries and 7 double tons. Currently the no. 4 ranked batsman in Test cricket the Indian skipper is also the vice-captain of this presumed XI.

5. Steve Smith

Steve Smith celebrates his ton during Ashes 2019.

As many of us know Steve Smith played at the number five position for a long time before Michael Clarke and Shane Watson’s retirement. Currently a part of the modern-day ‘Fab-Four’ Smith has the best average in Tests among his contemporaries.

In 77 Tests Smith has amassed 7540 runs at an average of 61.8 in the ‘Baggy Green’. So far he has slammed 27 centuries and 3 double tons in the purest format of the game. Smith is also leading the ICC batsmen charts.

6. Tim Paine (wk)

Australia’s Test skipper Tim Paine reacts after the draw against India in Sydney.

From almost turning his back on professional cricket in 2017 to leading Australia following the aftermath of the ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town Tim Paine has had many ups and downs in his career.

In 35 Tests Paine has scored 1534 runs at a decent average of 32.63. Though he is yet to score a Test ton Paine has bailed out Australia on many occasions with his handy batting. Considering the experience he has Paine will keep the gloves for this hypothetical XI.

7. Jason Holder

West Indies skipper Jason Holder in action.

The lanky all-rounder is currently leading the West Indies team in the longest format. Though the Windies aren’t a force to reckon anymore Holder’s exploits with both bat and ball have pretty much kept them in the thick of things.

So far Holder has played 49 Tests for the Windies scalping 129 wickets with the help of 8 fifers and one 10-wicket haul. He has also amassed more than 2200 runs including 3 centuries and 1 double ton.

8. Ravichandran Ashwin

Ravichandran Ashwin in action during the Sydney Test in 2021.

Ravichandran Ashwin will be the only spinner in this supposed team. A proven wicket-taker Ashwin has the ability to trouble any batting line-up in the world. However his batting abilities shouldn’t be doubted as well.

Apart from his tally of 409 Test wickets which includes 30 fifers and 7 10-wicket hauls Ashwin has also amassed 2656 runs in 78 Tests at an average of 27.95. He also has 5 centuries and 11 fifties in the longest format of the game.

9. Pat Cummins

Australian vice-captain Pat Cummins jumps in air after dismissing Kane Williamson.

After making his debut as an 18-year-old Pat Cummins’ Test career was halted by repeated stress fractures. However he returned to action in 2017 and the rest is history. He is currently the no. 1 ranked bowler in the world.

In 34 Tests the 28-year-old has bagged 164 wickets at an economy rate of 2.74 including 5 fifers and a 10-wicket haul. In fact no one has taken more international wickets than Pat Cummins since 2017 (243). He can be a pretty handy batsman as well having scored two half-centuries so far.

10. Tim Southee

Tim Southee is New Zealand’s third-highest wicket-taker in Tests.

Tim Southee has been a match-winner for New Zealand in the longest format. He led g the pace-attack of the Kiwis in the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) Final against India.

So far in his Test career Southee has played 78 matches scalping 309 wickets at an economy rate of 2.97. He also has 12 fifers and one 10-wicket haul to his name. The 32-year-old can be pretty useful with the bat down the order as well.

11. Mohammed Shami

Shami is one of the best fast bowlers in the world who has got an impressive record in Whites.

Shami has been a regular member of Team India’s Test team since making his debut in 2013. A proven wicket-taker Shami has the tendency to provide important breakthroughs. He has been Virat Kohli’s go-to-bowler in Test cricket. In 50 Tests Shami has picked up 180 wickets with the help of five 5-wicket hauls."

Bruce Springsteen may have been born to run but his daughter Jessica Springsteen was born to jump.

The 29-year-old made her Olympic debut in Tokyo and on Saturday she and her teammates Laura Kraut and McLain Ward took home the silver medal in team equestrian jumping.

More from SPIN:

Jessica told CNN that she called her family after the “wild” experience. “I FaceTimed them really quick. They were all screaming I don’t think we understood anything” she said. “Just saw their team USA gear; there was just lots of shouting. I couldn’t make a lot out but I know that they’re so excited.”

Since this was her first time competing in the Olympic games Jessica Springsteen admitted to feeling some nerves. “You definitely start to get the jitters” she said. “But it was also super exciting. My horse [Don Juan van de Donkhoeve] jumped it beautifully. And we really gave it our all out there.”

As for her dad the Boss has been spending 2021 collaborating with other artists. In June he helped the Killers reimagine their 2008 track “A Dustland Fairytale” and earlier this week he joined forces with Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello and Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder to release a cover of AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell.”

The star and all four of her children attended West's second listening party for his 10th studio album Donda Thursday which took place once again at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Kardashian wore an all-black Balenciaga outfit which included a long-sleeved top tight pants over-the-knee boots and a full face mask. The star also wore black stilletos with her hair in a long braid.

Kardashian also shared a series of photos on Instagram which showed her wearing her full outfit inside the venue. One of the photos show West wearing a coordinating all black outfit with a similar face mask and an added bulletproof vest which read ""Donda"" on the back.

Kardashian and West's four children North 8 Saint 5 Chicago 3 and Psalm 2 coordinated with their parents in black outfits.

West presented a new rendition of his album at Thursday's listening event per People. Kardashian also posted an Instagram video of the event. She and her children had previously attended West's first Donda listening party last month where she wore a red Rick Owens jumpsuit and matching boots featuring bejeweled heels. West also coordinated with his estranged wife in an all-red outfit that night.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star filed for divorce from West in February after six years of marriage. The pair have reportedly established a ""healthy"" co-parenting relationship. A source close to Kardashian told E! News ""Kim wants the kids to stay connected to Kanye and will make that happen. It's very important to her that she has a healthy co-parenting relationship with Kanye and that the kids have strong relationships with both of their parents.""

""We have to go find it"" said Emanuele Azzaretto. ""So you always have a little knot until you find [it] and we know we can bring it back home.""

Azzaretto is both an experienced diver and as a native of Italy also an experienced wine drinker. ""I married all the things I like and tried to turn it into a job!"" he said.

Azzaretto then disappeared into the water and about 20 minutes later a massive metal cage broke the surface. Inside the cage: a bounty of nearly 1500 bottles of red wine.

This find was not dumb luck; Azzaretto knew what he was looking for because he sank it in the ocean a year ago. He is the co-founder of Ocean Fathoms a company experimenting with using the ocean floor as a wine cellar.

The bottles come out dripping with sea water and shellacked with sea shells. ""Each bottle I mean it's an art piece"" he said.

""It does look like something you'd find on a pirate ship"" said correspondent Ben Tracy.

After just one year in the murky depths the bottles have bonded with the ocean bottom attracting plenty of curious (and perhaps thirsty) sea creatures. But Ocean Fathoms is more interested in the ocean's influence on the inside of the bottle. It calls this section of the Santa Barbara Channel ""nature's perfect cellar"" because there is little oxygen and light; the temperature remains a constant 54 degrees; and ocean currents gently rock the bottles.

Tracy asked ""So the motion of the ocean really is just kind of cradling these things?""

""Absolutely"" Azzaretto said. ""And then we are in the Santa Barbara Channel there's all the whales here. So imagine what the bottles hear from here: the whales are singing to them!""

""So they get cradled by the ocean and lullabies from the whales? That's a good life as a bottle of wine' Tracy said.

""Yeah it is. For us too when we drink it!""

""Better than you're gonna get in somebody's closet.""

Azzaretto was inspired by stories he read a few years ago about a treasure trove of champagne from a shipwreck found on the bottom of the Baltic Sea. The 168 bottles including some very vintage Veuve Clicquot were still highly drinkable after 170 years underwater.

The famed champagne house has since created its own ""cellar in the sea"" program storing various bottles of bubbles 130 feet down in a Baltic Sea wine vault.

Rajat Parr was a sommelier for 18 years and now makes his own wine near California's Central Coast where the cool ocean breeze provides ideal conditions for making world class wine – the perfect temperature to grow grapes.

But when Ocean Fathoms approached Parr about dropping some of his best vintages into the Pacific he was ""intrigued and super-curious"" but not convinced.

Tracy asked ""At first you thought this might be kind of a gimmick?""

""Oh 100%"" Parr replied. ""In the beginning I was like could be interesting but I just don't know. I wasn't sure.""

He ultimately decided to sacrifice a few bottles to see what happens. The result? ""Mind was blown!"" he said. ""I realized it was definitely not a gimmick!""

Tracy asked ""What does the ocean do to the wine?""

""The wine evolves in texture"" Parr said. ""Wine tannin becomes softer tannins. Wines which are kind of rustic become more round but the nose is identical. It does not age in aromas. It only ages in texture.""

Tracy asked ""And how long would it typically take you to get that kind of texture in a cellar?""

""I don't know – five-plus years?""

The bottles sell for a premium starting around $350. But not everyone is a true believer. The California Coastal Commission is reviewing Ocean Fathoms' permit application and has expressed concerns about the wine cages' impact on marine life and fishing grounds.

Meanwhile Azzaretto popped open a bottle from his sea cellar from which Tracy got to sample: ""Nice! Yeah it's silky. Well you found your treasure.""

""I did finally"" Azzaretto said. ""And now we get to enjoy it!""

Basically Jessie said Ariana heard the song loved it and then somehow Nicki heard the song in the studio and also loved it so much that she said ""'I've got to jump on this."" Jessie said she didn't even have to ask Nicki to be on it.

Well Nicki denied that in a now-viral tweet saying ""I didn't hear the song and ask to get on it. How would I have heard the song? Chile what am I the damn song monitor? This was said by another artist recently as well. Y'all gotta stop.""

Babe @JessieJ I didn’t hear the song & ask 2get on it. The label asked me2get on it & paid me. How would I have heard the song? 😩 chiiille what am I the damn song monitor? Snoopin around for songs chile?😂This was said by another artist recently as well. Yallgotta stop🎈 LoveU😘 02:53 AM - 06 Aug 2021

THEN it was SENT to Nicki. According to this interview with Republic Records' president Wendy Goldstein Jessie did in fact mess up a few parts of the ""Bang Bang"" origin story. Turns out ""Bang Bang"" was written for Ariana who hated it. Then Jessie hopped on it. it wasto Nicki.

Well after being called out by Nicki Jessie J took to Instagram to address the situation. She posted a video of her trying to rap Nicki's verse but intentionally failing. ""I respect you publicly being yourself @nickiminaj so here I am being myself. This is a video of me back in 2015 onstage taking the piss out of myself which is basically an hour of my set.""

""[The video] was made into a meme about two weeks ago. Is that what this is really about? And where this weird energy between us began? Or maybe it was when you used me as a stair rail at the AMAs. That was also funny AF"" she continued.

We should of been known this beef was coming when nicki used Jessie j as a stair railing 03:27 AM - 06 Aug 2021

""If we can’t laugh in the lives we have been blessed with what’s the point?"" she said. ""It really isn’t that deep.""

""From the moment I met you to now I have shown you nothing but love and gratitude for how fucking blessed I was to have you and Ariana — who wrote 'Bang Bang' with the insanely talented Max Martin which I found out today. Jesus what a day. Sorry Ari. I never knew. Wild.""

""I’m sorry I got the story wrong all these years. I was told you heard the song and wanted to be on it by someone clearly gassing me up at the label"" she continued. ""Thank you for clarifying I was wrong on that and 'Do It Like a Dude.' Told me huh.""

Kevin Winter / Getty Images for MTV

""What a way for us to celebrate the seven-year anniversary of the song. Should we all go for dinner? No pobably not right. Too soon? 'Bang Bang' part two? No OK got it. 'Do It Like a Dude' remix? OK. I’ll stop.""

Michael Tran / FilmMagic

""Look the song did its damn thing"" she added. ""I will never say you asked to be on the song ever again. Although all this drama means memes — and man have the memes of me kept me entertained all day — [it's] always love and light from me babes.""

High-end restaurant chains are recovering more quickly than casual chains.

Longhorn Steakhouse Texas Roadhouse and similar chains are well above 2019 foot traffic levels.

All kinds of experiences people missed during the past year are coming back.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Restaurant sales are recovering and higher-end chains are having some of the best recoveries of all.

Based on foot traffic analysis from Placer.ai pricier and less casual chains are recovering fastest. Darden Restaurant's chains are doing particularly well compared to the same period in 2019. Darden is the parent company of Olive Garden Longhorn Steakhouse and a few other chains.

Longhorn Steakhouse visits were above 2019 levels in April May and June growing each month to an 18.9% increase in June. Capital Grille which is also owned by Darden was up 19.8% over 2019 visits in June after being behind in April and modest gains in May. Eddie V's Prime Seafood saw the largest increase over 2019 levels at 28.5% in June.

The trend among the top-performing restaurants shows a huge jump in recovery this summer. Of the eight top restaurants monitored by Placer.ai seven saw increases over the previous month in May and June. The only exception was Texas Roadhouse which had nearly similar gains in each of the three months.

More casual chains especially diners are recovering much more slowly. Denny's IHOP and Applebee's were all still below 2019 levels into June.

Restaurant dining is officially back as vaccination rates increase and people begin feeling safe going out again and other industries are profiting too. Spending on restaurants bars clothing and transportation are all up as people return to plans that were on hold for over a year.

Intuitively the trend makes sense for dining. The pandemic was great for fast-food sales which customers turned to for comfort in a challenging time and these chains were already equipped with drive-thrus and takeout orders. Now people are flocking back to the experiences that they couldn't get during that period like full-service dining.

The trend toward experiences and food exists at the very top of the industry too. Two of the most expensive fine dining restaurants in the US both raised prices to nearly unheard of rates $800 for a tasting and about $2000 for dinner for two. Seats are booked up for over a month.

It's unclear if less casual chain restaurants will keep their lead over diners and other casual restaurants or if this is a temporary trend due to ""hot vax summer.""

DE,John Deere,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZS5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3doYXQtZG9lcy1kZWVyZS1zLTI1MC1taWxsaW9uLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLW9mLWJlYXItZmxhZy1yb2JvdGljcy1tZWFuLWZvci1hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What does Deere's $250 million acquisition of Bear Flag Robotics mean for agriculture?,"John Deere's recent acquisition of Bear Flag Robotics is the next step in the company's precision ag technology journey. The move John Marshall believes will not only enhance Deere's position in the autonomous space but continue to set the company apart.

""It also will further Deere's presence in Silicon Valley showing that it is a major player in technology"" says Marshall IntelliFarm Director at Wade Incorporated.

For over 100 years Wade Incorporated has been servicing the equipment needs of farmers in the Mississippi Delta and beyond. Through its IntelliFarm team the dealership ensures its customers operate confidently with the latest technology.

""Labor is in short supply and this news couldn't come at a better time"" Marshall says. ""I see the acquisition as a huge step forward.""

The lack of skilled labor in agriculture is real and impactful says Dan Liebfried. ""Deere understands the challenges its customers face when it comes to labor and the impact of not having labor available to execute jobs in the field when they need to be done in the narrow windows of opportunity agriculture presents to producers each and every day"" says the director of automation & autonomy Intelligent Solutions Group John Deere. ""This is not only a problem of today but it's going to be increasingly difficult to find labor going forward. Solutions like autonomous technology and our relationship with Bear Flag Robotics will help to solve those challenges for our customers.""

The challenge of automation in farming is massive because it's not just about going from point A to point B says Aubrey Donnellan co-founder and chief operating officer at Bear Flag Robotics. ""It's automating the job and understanding all the failures that can occur in these environments to ultimately give the grower more strategic ways to deploy his resources and run more hours in the day.""

Bear Flag Robotics which is based in the East Bay of San Francisco was started by Donnellan and Igino Cafiero four years ago. The company builds autonomous technology for farm tractors – the hardware sensors actuators and software that go on top of the machine to give it situational awareness. The technology not only gives the machine the ability to navigate through rugged changing environments but it allows the machine to perform a job effectively and really mimic and hopefully do better than a human can in the cab.

Today Bear Flag has a limited market reach with a handful of customers of varying sizes. It is focused on delivering autonomous tillage but it plans to branch out over time into other tasks.

Liebfried and Donnellan share how the two companies came together and their plan for autonomous technology going forward.

Q: What are some of the deciding factors Deere has when making an investment like this?

DL: Deere made a fundamental shift as an organization a little over a year ago and rolled out a smart industrial strategy focused on production systems the technology stack that adds value to those production systems and managing the life cycle of a customer's operation to improve the ownership cycle of his equipment.

Then we asked ""How do we look at the customer problems today and into the future and what are some of their biggest challenges?"" The availability of skilled labor has been a growing problem and it's not expected to get any better in the future.

We've talked openly about our strategy of automation and autonomy. We believe we have significant momentum and we continue to make significant investments in the automation space. As Aubrey noted it's not just about going from point A to point B. It's about ensuring the job itself is done to the highest level of quality. We believe we've got enough critical mass in that space and value to offer to take this big step into autonomy.

When we started to look at what things could accelerate our journey to deliver value to our customers the ability to retrofit was a big factor. The second was in-market learning and in-market experience in a commercial way. Last was making sure that whatever company we considered fit our culture and overall focus of adding value to growers. Ultimately that led us to Bear Flag Robotics. They have a retrofit solution; it's in-market and not only did their company culture match ours but their focus on safety principles was a critical factor in making this decision.

Q: Bear Flag Robotics was one of the first start-ups to participate in Deere's Startup Collaborator. Tell us about that experience in this invitation-only program.

AD: What better opportunity than to learn from the people at Deere? We learned so much throughout the whole process. The company opened its doors across its entire organization to help teach us. For example we met for hours with Deere's tillage team people who spend every day working on the betterment of tillage implements so we could improve our product and do tillage better autonomously.

That experience was really the impetus to a very good relationship we've maintained over the last few years.

Q: Is the Collaborator going to be the way Deere looks at acquiring other companies?

DL: I don't think you should read into it that this is the pattern and this is the only way. The collaborator is more about helping start-ups than it is about developing a pipeline of acquisitions over time. Our goal is to provide the start-up community with access to resources mentoring and customers via the channel to get their idea in front of real customers. Through that process it gives us insights into how they're thinking about problems that could teach us different ways as a company to think about problems.

Q: When are we mostly likely to see the first product from the acquisition?

DL: It's already in market with a limited set of customers. We're going to work together over the next few months to lay out our roadmap. During that time frame it's critical we continue to support current Bear Flag customers with the same excellent experience Bear Flag has been providing over the last few years.

Q: Who are some of the customers Bear Flag Robotics has worked with to date?

AD: We are working with a variety of growers – both in size and structure – in our near geography in California. We have operated in tree nut orchards leafy greens and specialty crops. In the early days of the company we were doing orchard floor management mowing and spraying autonomously. Ultimately we found a niche in tillage and that's what we have been focusing on for the last few years. We've upgraded our machine to do this at a larger scale. Today we provide autonomous tillage like disking harrowing and plowing. Tillage is just the start. We plan to move across all production steps and machine types/forms as well.

Q: What's been the reaction of those customers once they've seen this technology at work?

AD: People can't believe they're seeing a fully autonomous machine in the field. One of the first things people ask is when can they get one. Growers are ready for this technology. As a cofounder it's hard not to be able to deliver our product as fast as people want it but it has to be done right.

We are in an exciting time where we are talking conversationally as a society about robotics and automation. It's impacting us in so many ways. Even AI we hear that term all over the place. It not only affects agriculture but also the automotive and financial service spaces. We are getting accustomed to these advanced technologies that are impacting our lives and making them better.

Q: How soon do we expect this technology to expand across the channel?

DL: As a company we often talk about our competitive differentiators and we firmly believe our dealer network is one of them. We've been making investments with them over the last 20 years in the precision ag space to increase their capabilities and their overall understanding of this space to not only sell the solution but to support it to the highest level. We'll be exploring how the channel will interact with this solution over the next six to 12 months. We expect that it's going to be one of the linchpins to helping us scale this out. There is still a lot to learn yet but the Deere channel will be an integral part of making this solution scale out to a broader market.

Q: What is Deere doing to prepare the dealer network for selling and servicing autonomous equipment? Will special training be needed to make sure the service staff can work on this technology?

DL: At every juncture across our precision ag journey Deere has recognized that it's not good enough to just have a great product. You also must have the great last-mile support of a channel partner to both sell and support the solution. We put training and development programs in place along the way to do that.

In 2005 one of my roles was to focus on channel development as technology like AutoTrac was starting to increase in overall market penetration. We did the same thing in upskilling and building channel capabilities in 2011 as we started connecting machines to the cloud. More recently we began the AI journey with See and Spray building channel capability. As we move into the autonomy space in the next few years I expect us to take a similar approach.

Q: This is a retrofit product. Are there plans to integrate that technology into the tractor or other equipment potentially in the future?

DL: The future is still yet to be determined. I believe having a retrofit product allows us to tap into a large install base and it's one of the big value drivers here – meeting customers where they are to give them the opportunity to experience autonomy in a meaningful way.

Q: Over time do you believe this technology will change the form of the traditional tractor?

DL: I believe we're going to see the machine form change over time as the technology gets adopted utilized fit into the operation and we get comfortable with it. However jumping from here to there is quite a leap. Again I don't know the timing of when that will happen but I definitely see machine form changes over the next five 10 or 15 years.

AD: When you look at the long-term effects technology like this enables you can start to think about alternative machine forms as well as alternative fuel for machines. How do we pull in sustainability into maybe lots of smaller machines? When you're not so constrained by labor and people driving these machines and making decisions about those machines you really can be free to incorporate other value drivers like sustainability. I think we're going to see very different machine forms in the future.

Q: How does the Bear Flag acquisition compliment or compare to the acquisition of Blue River?

DL: It's a recognition that the space is rapidly evolving. While John Deere has a ton of capability in the precision technology space the reality is we need a lot more to accelerate this area.

With the acquisition of Blue River we recognized what artificial intelligence could do to manage at the plant level. The acquisition of Bear Flag is a recognition that autonomy is another step in that journey of customer value.

For me it's an exciting time to be a part of Deere. We're not just building technology internally. We're partnering with other companies through our collaborator as well as acquiring companies to accelerate our journey.

Q: How will announcements like this attract the next generation to agriculture?

DL: People want to do something more impactful with their careers. We see an influx of that in recruits with very brilliant minds who want to come work on these problems. Of course we always need more people to solve the problems facing agriculture.

Autonomy is going to come much faster to agriculture than it is to on-road. That's going to help us collectively attract talent to this space because they are not only hungry to work on interesting problems but they also want to make sure those problems are solved and deployed to real-life customers in a timely way. We're excited about that value proposition for future employees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNocm0ub3JnL3RvcGljcy10b29scy9uZXdzL2FsbC10aGluZ3Mtd29yay9hZ2lsZS1qb3VybmV50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Agile Journey,"​If any organizations had doubts about the virtues of agility the COVID-19 pandemic has dispelled them. Companies that emerged stronger—or were harmed the least—appear to be those that were most organizationally agile.

Organizational agility is the ability of organizations to make timely effective and sustained changes when and where they result in a performance advantage says Pepperdine University research professor of management Christopher Worley.

John Deere's information technology organization adopted the Agile operating model one of the most widely used methodologies for achieving organizational agility over the past two years. It has enabled the Moline Ill.-based equipment manufacturer's information technology and business partners to pivot much more successfully in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic than would otherwise have been possible says Ganesh Jayaram vice president of information technology at John Deere.

Jayaram notes that the use of Agile allowed the rapid development and deployment of digital services that were important to supporting customers during the pandemic. The efforts have paid off: Deere & Co. (the organization's formal name) has reported dramatic growth in net sales and revenue since the public health crisis began. ""We could not have deployed those solutions at scale during COVID-19 conditions without our Agile operating model"" Jayaram says.



Making the Transformation

Studies have linked organizational success and agility. A McKinsey & Co. report released in May 2021 and based on a survey of more than 2100 organizations found that a highly successful agile transformation tripled the likelihood that an organization would be a top-quartile performer when compared to organizations with no agile transformation.

The report The Impact of Agility: How to Shape Your Organization to Compete also found that 65 percent of organizations that were highly successful in agile transformations reported a significant impact on their financial performance after the transformation. But only 15 percent of companies that underwent less-successful transformations reported strong financial results.

Agile transformations occur when companies start from traditional operating models and transform largely or in totality to work under the Agile operating model in which networks of teams are organized around a business-focused mission and connections among teams and digital technology facilitate more iterative collaborative entrepreneurial and rapid work notes Christopher Handscomb a London-based McKinsey & Co. partner.

The report found such transformations are becoming more widespread. Of the organizations surveyed 44 percent saw agile transformation at their companies though only 14 percent reported that such transformations were happening enterprisewide.

It also found that different economic sectors are becoming more agile at different rates with telecom and financial services leading the way and public- and social-sector organizations and professional services coming in last. Industries that are leaders in agile practices tend to have been exposed to disruptive events such as regulatory changes to a higher degree. They also are increasingly focused on producing digital products Handscomb says.

""Amazon Google and Netflix are invading more and more spaces"" says Peter Hildebrandt a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) managing director and partner based in Los Angeles. ""Their agility as demonstrated by their ability to bring new products quickly to market gives them a huge advantage over more traditional organizations in any space they enter. We are seeing less-agile incumbents attempt to catch up and struggle.""











Defining Agility



Definitions of agility and its components vary. McKinsey describes organizational agility as the ability to quickly reconfigure strategy structure processes people and technology toward value-creating and value-protecting opportunities.

Others note that the organizational trait of agility tends to encompass a variety of necessary attributes including:

Use of digital technology to expedite the collection and dissemination of knowledge throughout the organization enhance analytics and automate routine functions.

Dedication of people and processes to innovation.

Regular realignment of objectives throughout the organization.

Capacity to recover from adverse conditions while capitalizing on opportunities.

More flexible iterative and purposeful work processes by employees.

Worley notes that a common misunderstanding of agility is that it simply represents the ability to make decisions more quickly. Rather he says agile organizations often can make the right key decisions more quickly because they are better prepared.

To determine the best way forward they have tested potential solutions to various challenges long before the optimal time to deploy them. When the trajectory of growth becomes clearer these previously developed tools and approaches are taken off the shelf adjusted slightly for new circumstances and pressed into service.

This requires an organization to have more comfort with experimentation and failure than many organizations have Worley says. Essentially businesses must have a dual nature: one component that carries on day-to-day business and another that is enabled to pursue what is essentially research and development.









Implementing Agility



The agile transformation of health care company Cambia Health Solutions is a case in point.

For Cambia with operations in Idaho Oregon Utah and Washington state legal and regulatory mandates fueled the initiative to imbue the company with greater agility. With 4700 employees Cambia adopted major organizational changes as Congress was considering and passing what would become the Affordable Care Act which resulted in major changes to the design and delivery of health insurance in the U.S.

The business potential that emerged from the law drove home the need for change and greater agility says Mark Stimpson the company's senior vice president and chief human resources officer. ""We had to figure out how we would thrive in this new environment"" Stimpson says. ""We needed a model where whatever emerged we'd be independent and we could thrive.""

Cambia created a parent holding company to house Regence its traditional breadwinning insurance business and a new subdivision Direct Health Solutions (DHS). DHS was a newly created incubator business unit charged with developing or investing in innovative products and services such as other lines of insurance alternative forms of health care access and free-standing health and wellness solutions notes Worley who as a consultant assisted the organization with its transformation. (DHS has since spun off as its own company Echo Health Solutions.)

Two and a half years into its journey a survey of the organization's leadership found significant improvements in all dimensions of design and agility including leaders' ratings of the extent to which the culture was more change-friendly.

""You learn that being agile is a process"" Stimpson says. ""It is never over.

""The biggest thing I have learned"" he adds ""is that you can have all the processes and systems—and those are important—but if you don't have the right people your change effort will not be effective.""





There are several approaches to achieving agility. The Agile operational methodology is one of the most common. In existence since 2001 when a group of software developers announced the creation of the Agile Manifesto it features small teams working discrete components of larger projects on tight deadlines and frequent check-ins with management and/or clients. Agile is a way of working that emphasizes collaboration and responsiveness. Cross-functional teams break down walls within organizations while iterative cycles mean feedback and improvements are incorporated quickly. Among key Agile terms is ""scrum"" which is a process that uses an agile mindset for developing delivering and sustaining complex products. Another term is ""sprints"" which are short-term project development events. They usually last one month or less and are aimed at achieving a project goal. Agile also features frequent check-ins with product or service consumers and/or company management about interim project deliverables and goals which drive further changes to project design and team focus. Agile is not the only agility and efficiency methodology in town. It shares much with a variety of project management practices generally categorized as lean methodologies such Toyota Production System Six Sigma Lean and total quality management. These generally aim to increase efficiencies by cutting down on wasteful actions reducing the amount of inventory in the pipeline and making continuous production process improvements. SAFe is the most widely used framework for scaling agility in large organizations notes Deema Dajani a product manager at Boulder Colo.-based Scaled Agile Inc. and co-founder of Women in Agile a nonprofit organization focused on promoting inclusivity in the agile community. For Proximus Group which has been adopting Agile techniques over the past several years the path toward agility has been deliberate. ""We are still in our agile transformation journey"" says Thomas De Rycke agile transformation leader at the 11400-employee telecommunications and technology company. ""Our journey so far has been a journey of gradually scaling agile in the organization building upon learnings and adapting"" he says. ""As with most organizations Agile started in IT where we changed traditional managed teams to cross-functional empowered teams which would work following an agile methodology. Quite rapidly we started to experiment in other business units where customer centricity adaptability and speed are considered important."" A slow and steady approach has helped the company adapt. De Rycke says the organization has taken the transformation one step at a time and has incorporated learning which comes mostly through failures from previous steps while also taking other steps forward. That ""really helped us to continuously improve while limiting the operational impact that such a big change would otherwise have"" he says. Still there are some who say there are costs associated with Agile that must be carefully weighed against the benefits. Agile skeptics such as Kurt Cagle a software developer and an editor at the Data Science Central website says that for many organizational functions building an Agile approach can add administrative steps with little benefit—forcing a focus in incremental steps to satisfy Agile metrics while doing little to advance the product as a whole. —D.T.



To succeed in its initiative to become more agile Cambia's had to undergo staffing changes. ""We told people that we had to bring new and major changes to the organization and a large number self-selected [and said] that was not what they wanted to do"" Stimpson says. ""At one point 60 percent of directors and above were new to the organization over the prior five years. And as key leadership positions came open we replaced them with the needed different types of people. More than 80 percent of our leadership hires don't come from health care."" Stimpson says Cambria looks for ""people who are comfortable in ambiguity who are action-oriented and who have the courage to drive change.""

Worley says agility is best approached incrementally. ""People see this as all or nothing that if parts of an organization are not agile this is a problem"" he says. ""The truth is that some parts of the organization need to be stable reliable and predictable. You don't want front-line people at your restaurant telling customers they can have anything they want.""









Leading the Way



The path toward agility is not easy. ""Moving past the tipping point requires a true leadership commitment to scale rather than standing up one more team here or there"" Hildebrandt says. ""Organizations have to decide to adopt organizational agility from the top down including mindsets structures principles and processes.""

Many organizations never take that step. ""The agile concept has been around a long time and almost every organization has started on the journey but only a few have gotten to the point where they're getting the full results from it"" Hildebrandt continues. ""They may think they're agile but often they're really just going through the motions.""

McKinsey's Handscomb says that while organizations' HR IT and financial divisions should be heavily involved in an agile transformation business leaders should be the champions in leading its implementation.

Worley notes there is little hope that rank-and-file employees will make the disruptive changes needed to improve agility—adopting Agile project management technology discretely experimenting and failing fast and other hallmarks of agility—unless senior management embraces them and clearly communicates the need to do the same throughout the organization.











Denver-based Agile management consultant Eric Willeke also stresses the importance of leadership buy-in. ""Executives need to lean in because they will be having people report to them at every level of the organization who are collaborating in ways that they never have before"" he says. ""And the executives showing those teaming behaviors with their peers and disparate groups is the single most powerful behavior to give people permission to do so.""

HR professionals are key in efforts to attain agility given their workforce management administrative and training expertise as well as their role as custodians of organizational values.

""If Agile does not cause you to change the shape of how people organize in your company in order to deliver value you have not yet done Agile; you have not yet made the journey"" Willeke says. ""Agile is change. It forces people to work together across boundaries in ways they never have before. And that's the messy point where people start to show resistance where bringing it back to HR communications and employee support becomes crucial.""

If you’ve ever driven on the 800 block of Legion Street in Maywood it’s very likely you’ve seen the lush garden growing up on the northwest corner.

On Aug. 7 the man behind the garden — longtime Maywood resident Vic Jackson 79 — was out on his John Deere tractor working the land.

He pointed out the land’s bounty — everything from okra squash and cabbage to sweet corn and tomatillos. All of it growing in roughly an acre of soil.

Jackson a native of Arkansas said he’s been working the land since he was a child. He’s been cultivating the garden on Legion Street for about 20 years he said.

“When I was a youngster I used to do this walking behind an eight horsepower rototiller” he said.

“When I came up here from the South I swore I wasn’t going to garden anymore” Jackson said. “I moved to Maywood and my wife had a birthday so we had a little party and one of my elder brothers who was living on the South Side spent the night with me. He said ‘Hey man come and take a ride with me.’”

By the time they stopped Jackson said they were in Breedsville Michigan where Jackson discovered that two of his brothers cultivated a garden.

“He asked me if I had any interest because he needed some youth” Jackson said laughing (he wasn’t that young at the time). “So him and me started gardening up there in Michigan.

“We grew so much vegetables” he said. “We’d be driving down I-94 coming back to Chicago and people would see the vegetables on the back of his pickup and they’d follow us over to his house. He lived over on 101st and Halsted. They thought he was selling produce!”

Jackson then started cultivating roughly 15 acres of land in Hopkins Park with another brother of his.

Jackson said a native of Arkansas reflected on his life gardening on Saturday afternoon in Maywood. | Michael Romain

“By that point we stopped using rototillers and at this point I’ve brought about four or five tractors” he said.

By the late 1980s Jackson said his brother had died and he found himself in a financial crunch after losing his job.

“When I lost my job I couldn’t garden and feed my family so one of them had to go — farming had to go” he said.

Since he was lured back into gardening roughly two decades ago Jackson has found something of an extended family.

There’s Maywood Fire Captain Denard Wade who has recruited young people to help Jackson grow food. There’s the family that lives in the house next to the garden as well.

“They are the nicest people you’d ever meet” Jackson said of the family who lives next to the garden.

Jackson said the super tall stalks of corn growing on the far west side of the garden are “just conversation pieces.” | Michael Romain

“If I’m out here they’re going to send a kid or somebody out here with some water. I mean that’s every time I’m out here” he said. “I tell them ‘Take what you want out the garden.’”

The result? Some of the best food he’s ever tasted. The relationships the connections the community — it all makes gardening worth it to the man who at one point in his life didn’t think he’d ever garden again.

“My oldest son was going over to Proviso East and he had some class I guess it was in wrestling and he came home with a bad grade and I had to ask him about it” Jackson recalled. “He says ‘Well dad I just don’t like it.’

“I told him ‘Well that’s what you’ve got to take.’ He says ‘Wasn’t it something when you were little that you didn’t like?’ I told him ‘Yes Mr. Jackson it sure was.’ He asked me ‘Well what was it?’ I said ‘Gardening.’”

Reveling in the irony Jackson let out an infectious laugh. He was still on his tractor which he’d paused to talk for a moment. Before long though the machine roared back to life and the man responsible for a garden oasis in Maywood was back tending to his crop.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhcm1vbmxpbmUuY29tLmF1L3N0b3J5LzczNzQzMDUvam9obi1kZWVyZS1mZWVscy1pdC1oYXMtdGhlLXBpY2stb2YtdGhlLXBpY2tlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Deere feels it has the pick of the pickers,"""The size of the new round module builders on the picker and stripper make it possible to harvest more hectares per hour as the module size has grown by more than five centimetres in diameter to equate to a two per cent productivity gain per bale."""

The students say they were hungry and Delta did not load any Kosher meal for them.

Jewish Girls Thrown Off Delta Flight In Eating Dispute

The incident occurred Friday according to The Times of Israel. The girls had traveled from Kiev to Amsterdam on KLM and were due to continue to New York on Delta onboard DL47. After boarding the girls began to eat their food drawing rebukes from flight attendants. The girls will told to stop eating but refused. Flight attendants then alerted ground staff which called the police. The girls were then escorted off.

The group tried to rebook on a KLM flight leaving an hour later KL641 that still would have arrived before Sabbath began on Friday but was denied.

A local Chabad student organization arranged meals for them and the students were eventually transferred to Antwerp Belgium where they will spend the sabbath. On Sunday they will attempt to fly back to New York again.

Federal mask rules provide very clear exceptions for eating and drinking. While the guidelines require replacing the mask between bites and sips they do not specify that meals can only be consumed at so-called meal times.

Even if flight attendants told the girls not to eat or drink during boarding to prevent additional exposure to other passengers such good intentions do not seem to comport with federal rules or Delta’s own internal mask policy.

Indeed this is the first I’ve heard that meals can only be consumed during meal time. If anything I would think staggering meals would be “safer” because less people would have their mask off at the same time.

A Delta spokesperson said:

“A group of passengers declined to follow the instructions of our staff and were escorted out of the airplane.”

What a silly statement. If a flight attendant tells me to drink a beer or clean the toilet I’m not going to obey. Instructions must be lawful and reasonable.

Later on Delta issued an extended statement:

The safety and well-being of our customers and our crew is always our top priority. Delta flight DL47 today from Amsterdam to New York-JFK was delayed after a group of passengers on board refused to follow the crew’s instructions. After the group refused to leave the plane all passengers were asked to get off the plane according to Delta’s protocol. At 12:40 PM local time the re-boarding process was completed without the group. We apologize to our customers for the delay and thank our customers for their patience and understanding.

Maybe the girls were rude (they claim the flight attendants were rude). Maybe the flight attendants were power tripping. Perhaps the girls were “eating” as an excuse not to wear masks. All we have is the claim for the girls and a very vague response from Delta.

KLM has also issued a statement stating the girls did not obey crewmember instructions concerning masks on the flight from New York to Amsterdam and again from Kiev to Amsterdam. It also appears that the girls who were denied boarding were chosen alphabetically not necessarily based upon their specific conduct.

Thus mark this story as developing but for purposes of our discussion I am most concerned about whether Delta allows passengers to consume meals brought onboard outside of meal times. Both statements fail to address this.

CONCLUSION

I try to give people the benefit of the doubt but it’s one or the other in this case. I can see a situation in which hungry girls were eating after no kosher food from Kiev to Amsterdam and the prospect of no kosher food again from Amsterdam to New York. Perhaps they did not replace their masks between bites. That becomes a gray area perhaps depending upon how rapidly they were eating. But if they were simply kicked off for eating outside of “meal times” then Delta owes the students a huge apology.

Delta Air Lines inaugurated its new four weekly service between New York JFK Airport and Dubrovnik last month marking its entry onto the Croatian market. The carrier is maintaining its operations to the coastal city with the 226-seat Boeing 767-300ER aircraft featuring full-flat Delta One beds Delta Comfort+ and Main Cabin service. The airline spoke with EX-YU Aviation News regarding the performance of its Dubrovnik service and future plans for the route. Delta Air Lines inaugurated its new four weekly service between New York JFK Airport and Dubrovnik last month marking its entry onto the Croatian market. The carrier is maintaining its operations to the coastal city with the 226-seat Boeing 767-300ER aircraft featuring full-flat Delta One beds Delta Comfort+ and Main Cabin service. The airline spoke with EX-YU Aviation News regarding the performance of its Dubrovnik service and future plans for the route.





How satisfied is Delta with its new Dubrovnik flights?





We’ve seen strong demand for international markets that are open to US leisure travellers this summer. Our Dubrovnik flights are more than 90% full as people are learning how to manage and live with the coronavirus pandemic. They are also yearning for a holiday and Croatia provides them with a good opportunity to safely enjoy their well-earned breaks. It is also important to note that the vast majority of our passengers are vaccinated and fully masked ensuring a safe environment at their destination as well. We are encouraged by the strong loads in our premium cabins on the Dubrovnik service and are proud to be supporting Croatia’s tourism recovery. T he service also provides cargo opportunities for freight forwarders to conveniently transport goods between the two nations.





Are passengers mostly point-to-point or is the airline seeing a lot of connecting traffic from the US? If so is there any particular region of the US from which the route is registering notable feed?





We are getting passengers connect onto our Dubrovnik flights from various points in the US although the majority still originate from New York itself. There is no particular point of origin that stands out on these flights but at the moment we are seeing travellers connect from some thirty different US cities through our JFK hub to Dubrovnik. This is made possible as US connections are all timed within four hours of the Dubrovnik flight enabling them to reach their final destination the same day.





Is there a possibility the flights could be extended past the end of the summer season?





We don’t plan on extending these flights past October 3 into the winter season. This is a leisure route targeted at US holidaymakers who usually travel between July and October so they can enjoy the sun sea and sights. Customers are at the centre of everything we do including where and when we fly which is why we included this new summer outdoor-friendly destination to our network in line with seasonal demand.





Has a decision been made on whether the route will be restored next summer season?





We still have not decided on the future of these flights. At the moment we are satisfied with the route’s performance and depending on the Covid-19 situation next year as well as travel restrictions and requirements we will make a final assessment in due course. We are constantly engaging with the airport and monitoring market demand based on which we will make a final decision. At this point it is too early to say.







Has Delta considered any other destination in Croatia namely the capital Zagreb?





We are satisfied with our presence in the region and have codeshare partnerships in place to enable wide-ranging connectivity. In Zagreb’s case we codeshare with our partners Air France and KLM from Paris and Amsterdam respectively from which we offer seamless connectivity to a number of cities in the United States. Codeshares are an important part of Delta’s network strategy as they allow us to reach parts of the globe that we do not operate to ourselves. We have many partnerships of this nature around the world. Although we continually evaluate our markets and make adjustments to our network when required we are happy with our current network footprint in Eastern Europe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZGVsdGEtb3J0aG9kb3gtamV3aXNoLWdpcmxzLWtpY2tlZC1vZmYtYW5vdGhlci1mbGlnaHQtbmV3LXlvcmstMjAyMS040gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1vcnRob2RveC1qZXdpc2gtZ2lybHMta2lja2VkLW9mZi1hbm90aGVyLWZsaWdodC1uZXcteW9yay0yMDIxLTg_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta: Orthodox Jewish girls kicked off another flight to New York,"The girls were removed from a Delta flight on Friday morning.

Insider previously reported that the Orthodox Jewish girls were barred from boarding a flight on Thursday.

The next day the girls were ordered off a second Delta flight for trying to switch seats.

Their rabbi told Insider that he suspects antisemitism is at play.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

A group of Orthodox Jewish girls who were barred from boarding a flight from Amsterdam to New York on Thursday evening was kicked off another flight the next day according to their rabbi.

The 18 teenagers part of a group who had been visiting religious sites in Ukraine were initially disallowed from traveling on a flight home due to a dispute over COVID-19 protocols on the KLM-operated leg of their journey from Kyiv to Amsterdam Insider previously reported.

A day later Delta Air Lines allegedly kicked off the same girls for swapping seats on a Friday morning flight Rabbi Yisroel Kahan claimed in an interview with Insider.

Kahan said that he suspects antisemitism is at play with regard to Delta's decisions. ""With antisemitism if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck"" he said.

After the girls were banned from boarding the flight on Thursday evening Kahan said the group slept on benches at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport while he and a chaperone tried to arrange their journeys home.

Kahan said that he and another rabbi started calling New York lawmakers including Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand to reach out to Delta to remedy the situation.

Schumer reportedly stepped in the rabbi said and Delta executives personally called the parents of the stranded girls and arranged a Delta flight from Amsterdam to New York for Friday morning.

Schumer did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

On Friday morning the girls boarded the Delta flight to New York from Amsterdam but shortly after Kahan said the girls were asked to leave. ""Ten minutes later the phone rings"" he said. ""They're being taken off the plane.""

The rabbi claims that one of the girls was asked to swap seats by a mother who wanted to be seated next to her son. ""The minute they made the swap a stewardess made a beeline to the girl and said 'You're misbehaving you're kind of on thin ice to begin with get off the plane'"" he said.

A video seen by Insider appears to show a woman confirming that she asked to switch seats and that this led to the girls being asked to leave the flight.







Although the girl returned to her assigned seat Kahan said the entire group of teenagers was told to leave the flight. He said that the woman was allowed to remain on the plane because it was her ""first transgression"" he said.

The rabbi said that although he hates to ""throw that card out there"" he thinks the incidents reeks of antisemitism.

""Either you're telling me that you know that each and everyone one of them was violating rules on both flights"" Kahan added. ""Or you're telling me that you banned the entire group a group of one ethnicity for this misbehavior.""

The girls were removed and booked onto a Delta flight for later that day but declined to travel on it because it would have involved returning to their homes after the start of Shabbat – the Jewish day of rest when observant Jews are not allowed to travel by car or plane.

Instead they spent the night in Antwerp Belgium and traveled home to New York with United Airlines on Sunday morning.

In an email to Insider a Delta spokesperson said: ""We apologize to our customers on Delta Flight 47 Amsterdam to New York-JFK who were delayed and inconvenienced to remove a group of passengers who refused to comply with crew instructions. The flight departed approximately two hours after its originally scheduled time.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8wNy9jb3ZpZC1mbGlnaHRzLXNhZmV0eS1wcm90b2NvbHMtdHJhdmVsLWFpcmxpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which COVID-related health and safety practices will airlines keep post-pandemic?,"Before COVID-19 airplanes seemed like grimy containers for passengers to kick off their shoes cough freely and seemingly disregard others on board. Now it’s nearly impossible for that behavior to play out. Airlines have gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure the health and safety of crew members and passengers. As travel picks up speed and many restrictions loosen what’s the future of cleanliness aboard: immaculate or the Wild Wild West as it once was?

Health organizations discourage gatherings in confined closed spaces for more than 15 minutes. So naturally traveling on an airplane goes against those recommendations. However over the past year airlines have integrated complex multilayered protections to reduce transmission risks in such an environment. In fact the International Air Transport Association (IATA) showed that only 44 out of 1.2 billion passengers contracted COVID-19—thought to be traced back to a flight—from March to October 2020. These statistics among much research have concluded it is safer to fly on a plane than conduct activities in other indoor places such as a grocery store or restaurant.

The most significant contributions to this are masks and robust air filtration. Proper airflow reduces transmission risk substantially. On flights—despite being near others for long periods—constant fresh and filtered airflow is shown to be an important safety factor. The New York Times recently designed an in-depth simulation that thoroughly exhibits how air particles distribute on planes and how filtration systems keep aerosol distribution low.

Delta overhauled its cleanliness and safety efforts through partnerships with Mayo Clinic Emory University and Reckitt the makers of Lysol. Its new “Delta CareStandard” program launched in June 2020 and since the onset of COVID the company has implemented 100 new protocols including installing industrial-grade HEPA filters. On Delta flights the air is refreshed 10 to 30 times per hour (every two to six minutes). This is more frequent than most public indoor spaces.

Filters such as this which are now seen on major airlines—including Southwest Qatar Airways American Airlines and more—are also used in hospital operating rooms and extract more than 99.9% of particles including viruses. Moreover Delta’s filtering systems on the ground pump outside air into our jet bridges and parked aircraft resulting in a 40% reduction in air particles.

In addition enhanced cleaning of aircrafts between flights and at the end of each day is now standard practice throughout the industry. Intrinsically some changes made by airlines will stay. Others will depend on the state of COVID and its variants.

In the U.S. the TSA planned on relinquishing masks on public transportation on May 11 2021. However because of the rise in Delta variant cases the rule will remain through Sept. 13. When the United Kingdom lifted mask mandates on July 19 British Airways Ryanair and EasyJet kept mask requirements. While federal mandates helped protect companies from unruly customers who refuse to follow the rules the airlines saw the impact of masks and stuck to mandates regardless. Qatar Airways believes masks are likely to remain a requirement for its passengers for the foreseeable future.

According to IATA which represents 290 airlines globally travelers are frustrated with convoluted COVID-19 protocols including confusing travel rules testing requirements and high test costs. In May 2021 IATA surveyed 4700 travelers in 11 markets and concluded that most air travelers are confident about air travel safety and 83% support mask-wearing in the near term. Ultimately the majority believes the mask requirement should be ended as soon as possible despite studies like Harvard Aviation Public Health Initiative’s (APHI) two-parter showing that the risk of infection onboard a full aircraft with everyone wearing a mask is less than 1%.

Ultimately the flight crew can’t babysit every passenger to ensure they follow basic hygiene and safety practices. But some like Qatar Airways which was recently awarded the top spot on AirlineRatings.com’s “Airline Excellence Awards” have made things easier. During the pandemic they provided passengers with complimentary disposable face shields and a protective kit with a single-use surgical face mask large disposable powder-free glove and alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Other airlines are committed to new standards on and off the plane as well. Among Delta’s 100 items it installed hand sanitizer stations and antimicrobial lavatory lighting contactless payment technology onboard wipes to clean customer-facing areas at airports and on aircraft and so much more.

“Cleanliness is an important part of our culture and we are stepping up to the challenge of surpassing our own high standards” said Jonathan Litzenberger the managing director of Delta’s Global Cleanliness strategy. “We’re expanding our reputation for cleanliness that we cemented last year to maintain and improve the level of care we are known for. Delta’s commitment is to continue to lead the industry when it comes to clean giving customers the confidence to fly safely with Delta.”

Everyone is living in the pandemic in different ways. And that continues to evolve and remain unpredictable as does the virus. How airlines will choose to maintain their standards will vary but it is crucial that passengers patiently adhere to cleanliness too not just for themselves but for fellow travelers and crew who continue to make travel possible."

A commitment to ride a bicycle across Canada in support of universal access to diabetes devices for all Canadians living with the disease.

Sébastien was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2002. He vowed that T1D would never keep him from living life to the fullest and today his story is a testament to how challenges can be turned into opportunities. These opportunities have included running across Canada climbing Mt Everest and participating in a number of the world’s hardest endurance races.

This journey was for a cause extremely close to Sebastien’s heart.

“I’ve been using an insulin pump and CGM system for years and it’s had a tremendous impact on my life and diabetes management – these devices are life changing nothing short of that. They enable me to do what I do” says Sébastien.

The provincial governments of Quebec Saskatchewan and British Columbia recently announced they will join Yukon in offering public coverage of CGM systems under provincial or territorial health plans. In addition Prince Edward Island and Manitoba have also recently announced plans for funding based on their 2021 budget platforms.

“These are significant announcements impacting the more than 300000 children and adults living with type 1 diabetes in Canada but the coverage for both insulin pumps and for advanced glucose monitoring systems varies greatly depending on where you live in Canada and even by age” said Dave Prowten President and CEO of JDRF Canada.

“We applaud Sébastien’s desire to bring attention for the need for equitable access to life-changing technology for all Canadians living with type 1 diabetes and we encourage people to support Access For All by sending a letter to their provincial or territorial representative at jdrf.ca/accessforall.

Sébastien also wanted to highlight how hard diabetes management is even with these devices. That it makes life easier but not easy. Even with advanced technology there is still a lot of work involved with day-to-day management. He worries that people may see the athletic endurance feats he accomplishes without realizing how much effort is involved in managing his T1D.

I truly am not a natural athlete – my journey is not about winning medals. I’ve never won anything or even been on the podium. My message is really about ‘hey this is not easy there are great tools available and they should be available to all’ – and then figuring out what works for you to make tomorrow a little bit better than today. My diabetes management is not perfect – I have highs and lows like everyone. I manage as well as I can with the exercise – I am proud that I can say I can keep it under control with years of experience and experimentation. But it’s not any easier for me. It’s not easy for anyone and that’s why it’s so important that everyone has access to the best tools for their own management.”

“This one was so much harder. I’ve never suffered this much. Including Everest. This was by far the toughest thing I’ve ever done because of the intention of going fast. The real story was can this be done in under two weeks. What happens when you ride 400 km a day with no days off and almost no recovery time. From a diabetes management perspective everything was new. It was trial and error as the training doesn’t always translate to real life. The high temps (45 degrees Celsius) the difficult conditions; these were things I did not expect.”

Sébastien finished his journey in just over two weeks and was followed by a documentary crew who will be putting together a video to be released later in the summer.

“I feel I learned through the challenges and it’s made me even more resolute to continue to use my platform to help others living with diabetes” he says.

As for raising awareness for Access For All Sebastien says “I think I helped but credit to the employees and advocates – just everyone at JDRF who has been advocating for years. These campaigns are successful over years by making sustained noise over time to get into the ears of the right people. I know we made a lot of noise on social media. I hope I helped this cause.”



Sebastien without a doubt contributed and we could not be more grateful. JDRF thanks Sebastien his team and his sponsors Dexcom Canada and Tandem Diabetes Care for his incredible efforts and achievement and commitment to ensuring access to diabetes devices to any Canadian who could benefit from it.

Switch Exploring Potential REIT Conversion

Switch and Elliott Investment Management the data center provider’s largest Class A shareholder are taking a close look at the company’s financial structure exploring a REIT conversion as one of the potential outcomes of the review.

Elliott a well-known activist investor holds 11 percent of Switch Class A shares. As part of the process being kicked off Switch plans to add Elliott portfolio manager Jason Genrich to its board of directors. He will be one of four Switch directors on the REIT committee evaluating the conversion.

Some of the largest US-based data center providers operate as REITs including Equinix Digital Realty CoreSite QTS CyrusOne and Iron Mountain.

REITs don’t pay corporate taxes in exchange for an obligation to pay out dividends to their shareholders who then pay taxes on those dividends.

Switch stock rose sharply on the announcement of the review Friday jumping from roughly $20 to $25 per share.

The company went public in 2017 with the opening IPO price of $17 per share and a $4.2 billion valuation.

Switch reported second-quarter earnings Thursday (see results below).

QTS Iron Mountain Switch Report Solid Q2 Earnings

The US-based publicly traded data center operators’ 2021 second-quarter earnings season is now complete. QTS Iron Mountain and Switch reported their results this week following last week’s reports by Equinix Digital Realty CyrusOne and CoreSite.

All three operators that reported this week had a solid quarter with healthy revenue growth. (Numbers in the chart below)

This is probably the last earnings report we’ll see from QTS which is in the process of being acquired and taken private by Blackstone. Shareholder approval of the acquisition is still pending with a vote scheduled for August 26. If the approval is secured the deal is expected to close before the end of the third quarter.

“We believe the announced acquisition of QTS by Blackstone represents a strong return for shareholders while positioning QTS to achieve our strategic objectives in our next phase of growth” QTS CEO Chad Williams said in a statement.

Iron Mountain’s numbers in the chart below reflect the entirety of its business which in addition to a growing data center operation also includes the document storage and management services the now seven-decades-old company is best known for. (Iron Mountain is celebrating its 70th anniversary this month.)

Iron Mountain doesn’t break out revenue from its data enter business. The company however said its data center revenue grew 15.3% year over year in the second quarter.

Iron Mountain said it signed 12.6MW in leases during the quarter and now expects to have leased more than 30MW in the full year. Its previous data center leasing guidance for 2021 was 25MW to 30MW.

A couple notes on the Switch numbers in the chart:

Switch isn’t a REIT yet so FFO per share isn’t reported.

The revenue number doesn’t include Data Foundry’s revenue for the quarter which was $3.3 million. Switch closed its Data Foundry acquisition in early June.

Dropbox Says Energy Powering Its Storage Servers Is 100% Renewable

Dropbox announced that the energy used by storage servers in its data centers is now “covered by 100% renewable electricity.”

It’s unclear whether that 100% is achieved through offsets renewable energy credits purchases of energy that powers facilities directly on the local grids or a combination of all three. (A combination is the most likely scenario.)

Dropbox said it’s making “significant investments to procure renewable energy” this year.

Last year it committed to sourcing 100 percent renewable energy for all its operations and achieving carbon neutrality for scope 1 2 and 3 business travel emissions by 2030.

Complicating matters on the data center side of things is Dropbox’s reliance on a mix of on-prem data centers and cloud services. It has to negotiate with its data center providers and cloud operators region by region to get renewable energy to each site.

Even in places where it’s possible to secure enough generation capacity to match a data center’s power consumption there’s currently no scalable solution to intermittency of wind and solar.

Solving the technology market-structure and regulatory obstacles to powering data centers with carbon-free energy around the clock is a goal some of the world’s largest data center operators most notably Google and Microsoft have set out to hit by 2030.

Hyperscaler Landlord Vantage Makes Zero-Carbon Pledge

Vantage Data Centers has set a goal to fully eliminate carbon emissions that result from its operations by 2030. It plans to get there by working with utilities investing in technology and collaborating with its data center tenants.

The company acknowledged that it may not be possible to go fully carbon-free within the timeframe it’s committed to and that it will likely have to use carbon offsets to fill the gap.

As outlined in the story about Dropbox above powering data centers with carbon-free energy around the clock is a gargantuan challenge.

But Vantage’s business revolves around building and leasing data center space wholesale to the world’s largest tech companies including the likes of Google and Microsoft both of whom have committed to get to zero carbon by 2030 as well.

Because hyperscaler platforms lease a lot of their capacity from the likes of Vantage their solution to reaching their carbon goals will include energy that powers their data center landlords’ facilities.

I Squared Capital Agrees to Buy Mexican Operator Kio

I Squared Capital has agreed to acquire Kio Networks which it described as the largest data center provider in Mexico.

The sale price was not disclosed but Bloomberg reported last year that Kio backed by Tresalia Capital was exploring a potential sale that could fetch as much as $1 billion.

Kio is a major data center provider to the Mexican government. Its reliance on that relationship as a business was cited as a factor working against Tresalia’s efforts to sell. Moody’s last year explained its B2 rating of Kio’s stock (a rating reserved for risky junk stocks) by the provider’s “weak liquidity and revenue concentration in Mexico with a particularly large exposure to the government of Mexico and to some large contracts.”

I Squared Capital also known as ISQ is an infrastructure investment manager. It has invested in utilities energy transport and social infrastructure and says it has made six investments in digital infrastructure that total $3 billion.

Kio operates 11 core data center campuses and 11 edge facilities in Mexico Central America and the Caribbean totaling 20MW of installed capacity and “significant expansion potential” according to the announcement.

ISQ owns the Hong Kong network and data center operator HGC which it acquired in 2017.

In July ISQ announced acquisition of the Houston-area fiber network operator ICTX WaveMedia through a newly formed Ezee Fiber platform for investment in fiber networks in growing and underserved US markets.

In 2020 ISQ reached an agreement to acquire the global network operator GTT for $2.15 billion but the deal appears to have stalled.

Mantra Data Centers Says It Has $1 Billion to Build Data Centers in India

Another new player is promising to enter the global data center market. A company called Mantra Data Centers announced plans to invest $1 billion in data center construction in India one of the hottest emerging cloud and data center markets.

MDC which describes itself as an “independent platform and wholesale colocation provider” said it will start by building 20MW data centers in Mumbai Delhi Chennai Bangalore Hyderabad and Kolkata. The company said it has signed MOUs for data center development in three of those markets with the respective state governments.

American and Chinese cloud providers are investing in infrastructure to serve India’s massive population. International and Indian data center providers – both established and newly formed – are racing to take advantage of the opportunity to lease data center facilities to those cloud platforms and support enterprise requirements.

In its announcement MDC said that besides India’s growing digitization data center demand in the market could be further spurred by enactment of the Personal Data Protection Bill that’s been under consideration since 2019. If enacted the bill would require all “sensitive personal data” of Indian citizens to be stored in India.

While they both undoubtedly present a danger to society they also have significant differences which start to manifest at birth.

“The psychopath is born with a psychopathic brain which … doesn’t function properly to allow for normal social experiences” explains Scott Johnson a psychologist and independent consultant who provides forensic mental health training to law enforcement and prosecutors. “The sociopath on the other hand we believe is born with normal brain but something goes wrong during their nurturing.”

Childhood neglect and abuse is a major predictor for serious antisocial behaviors such as sociopathy in later life. That isn’t to say that everyone – or even most people – who were abused as a child go on to become a sociopath but studies have consistently shown that sociopaths are more likely to have been a victim of child abuse than the general population. Psychological trauma as a child is thought to interfere with proper brain development which may explain why this a link says Johnson.

Brain Basis

Though the cause may differ psychopaths and sociopaths both have brain differences particularly when it comes to their morality centers. This often shows up on CT and PET scans. They also tend to lack empathy and sympathy almost entirely particularly psychopaths. “They often just seem like don’t care for other people at all” says Johnson. They might enjoy the feeling of inflicting pain or exercising control over others unincumbered by feelings of guilt anxiety or remorse.

There are some significant differences between the two phenomena however. Psychopaths are better at delaying gratification. Subsequently they can meticulously plan their wrongdoings – not all of which are inevitably violent. Psychopaths also commonly commit financial fraud. “A psychopath doesn’t necessarily need to hurt someone physically their motivation can be narcissism and a thrill of what they perceive as ‘the game’ and that can be achieved in different ways” explains Johnson. “Approximately 70 percent of psychopaths cross the line into sexual or physical violence.”

Sociopaths however are even more likely to be violent but less likely to be calculating. They struggle to delay their gratification and frequently lash out. “Almost all sociopaths cross over the line into violence. They’re not cunning enough to prepare an attack they act on impulse.” Because of this sociopaths are more likely to be caught than psychopaths.

Psychopaths are probably more dangerous the long run says Johnson precisely because they can hide it for longer ­– possibly why they get more mention in popular culture than sociopaths.

Hollywood Influence

It seems however that Hollywood does a bad job in trying to portray these various traits. Karen Davis an assistant professor of psychology at State University of New York College at Cortland and colleagues recently examined whether 24 movie characters that have been described as psychopathic really deserve the label. In a 2020 study she assessed the characters using a professional test commonly used by mental health professions in legal proceedings to come to a diagnosis. Just 21 percent of the sample passed the test to be legitimately called a psychopath.

Interestingly if not surprisingly she also found that mental health slurs were frequently used in the films’ dialogue. “The most common terms used in the movies to describe characters were derogatory” she concluded in the study. “A large percentage of characters were referred to as “crazy”.”

While the silver screen may have a long way to go before it sets the right tone for its portrayals of psychopaths and mental illness more generally law enforcement officials rely on a proficient assessment of whether a suspect is a psychopath or a sociopath. Knowing the answer can help inform interview techniques and even where to look for evidence says Johnson. For example a psychopath is more challenging to question; they’ll keep their cool and make sure to mimic what they think would be the normal and innocent response to an interrogation. “A sociopath meanwhile blows up under interview and that’s their downfall because that’s when they end up revealing something” says Johnson.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9nZW9sb2dpc3RzLWRpc2NvdmVyLXRoYXQtbmFzYS1yb3Zlci1oYXMtYmVlbi1leHBsb3Jpbmctc3VyZmFjZS1zZWRpbWVudHMtbm90LWFuY2llbnQtbGFrZS1kZXBvc2l0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Geologists Discover That NASA Rover Has Been Exploring Surface Sediments Not Ancient Lake Deposits,"In 2012 NASA landed the rover Curiosity in the Gale crater on Mars because the crater was thought by many scientists to be the site of an ancient lake on Mars more than 3 billion years ago. Since that time the rover has been driving along carrying out geological analyses with its suite of instruments for over 3190 sols (martian days equivalent to 3278 Earth days). After analyzing the data researchers from Department of Earth Sciences the Faculty of Science at The University of Hong Kong (HKU) have proposed that the sediments measured by the rover during most of the mission did not actually form in a lake.

The research team suggested that the large mound of sedimentary rocks explored and analyzed for the last eight years actually represent sand and silt deposited as air-fall from the atmosphere and reworked by the wind. The alteration of minerals formed by the interaction between water and the sand did not occur in a lake setting. The “wet” environment they propose actually represents weathering similar to soil formation under rainfall in an ancient atmosphere that was very different from the present one.

The discovery was published recently in Science Advances in a paper led by research postgraduate student Jiacheng Liu his advisor Associate Professor Dr. Joe Michalski and co-author Professor Mei Fu Zhou all of whom are affiliated with the Department of Earth Sciences. The researchers used chemistry measurements and x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements in addition to images of rock textures to reveal how compositional trends in the rocks relate to geological processes.

“Jiacheng has demonstrated some very important chemical patterns in the rocks which cannot be explained in the context of a lake environment” said Dr. Michalski. “The key point is that some elements are mobile or easy to dissolve in water and some elements are immobile or in other words they stay in the rocks. Whether an element is mobile or immobile depends not only on the type of element but also on the properties of the fluid. Was the fluid acidic saline oxidizing etc. Jiacheng’s results show that immobile elements are correlated with each other and strongly enriched at higher elevations in the rock profile. This points toward top-down weathering as you see in soils. Further he shows that iron is depleted as weathering increases which means that the atmosphere at the time was reducing on ancient Mars not oxidizing like it is in the modern day rusted planet.”

Understanding how the Martian atmosphere and the surface environment as a whole evolved is important for the exploration for possible life on Mars as well as our understanding of how Earth may have changed during its early history. “Obviously studying Mars is extremely difficult and the integration of creative and technologically advanced methodologies is necessary. Liu and co-authors have made intriguing observations via the utilization of remote sensing techniques to understand the chemical composition of ancient sediments that inform on their early development. Their data present challenges to existing hypotheses for both the depositional environment of these unique rock formations and the atmospheric conditions that they formed under – specifically the authors show evidence for weathering processes under a reducing atmosphere in a subareal environment similar to a desert rather than formation in an aqueous lake environment. Indeed this work will inspire new and exciting directions for future research.” Assistant Professor from Department of Earth Science Dr. Ryan McKenzie added.

China successfully landed its first lander Zhurong on Mars in May this year. Zhurong is currently roving the plains of Utopia Planitia exploring mineralogical and chemical clues to recent climate change. China is also planning a sample return mission likely to occur at the end of this decade.

News: China bans off-campus tutoring in education overhaul

China’s government is cracking down on the mainland’s booming off-campus tutoring industry in one of the biggest overhauls of the education sector.

Local authorities will ban the provision of holiday and weekend tutoring and will no longer approve the establishment of new tuition centres according to sources briefed on a policy document that was formally released by the State Council on July 24.

For preschoolers the new rule also bans any form of tutoring such as English teaching under the name of “mind training”. The rules will also be applied to off-campus education for high school students.

Chinese President Xi Jinping had criticised the after-school tutoring sector in 2018 saying it had “increased the burden of students and families’ financial burden” and “violated the laws of education” as well as “disrupted the normal order of education”.

“The motivation behind the government’s move to ease the burden for students is that many people are not willing to have children due to the huge cost of raising kids. There are fewer and fewer newborns in recent years. And that’s the problem the government needs to solve as the top priority” said Li Qingshan research director at EqualOcean an information service provider and investment research firm.

Chinese authorities have also emphasised that for students who do not have the opportunity to attend a university vocational education is another way for them to better themselves.

However middle-class parents are generally not fans of vocational schools and the new crackdown is causing a great deal of concern.

“I’m terrified every day. I don’t know if the classes I signed my daughter up for can be completed” said Ms Zhang a Beijing-based mother who asked not to use her full name.

“I can’t accept having to stop sending my daughter to after-school tutoring classes because the school-selection mechanism has not changed and every parent wants their children to go to a better school to receive a better education.”

Question prompts

How are after-school tuition classes in the mainland similar or different to those in Hong Kong?

How would you feel if holiday and weekend tutoring was banned in Hong Kong and why?

From News and Context identify ONE other concern parents may have about the mainland government’s crackdown on off-campus tutoring.

Context

China’s State Council the top administrative body announced a new set of guidelines last month to “ease the burden of young students” for kids going through mandatory education which covers all children younger than senior secondary school age.

The new guidelines ordered local governments to stop approving new tutoring companies force existing companies to become non-profit organisations eliminate classes on weekends and holidays and ban tutoring companies from receiving foreign investment.

The latest rules are additions to the edict by Chinese President Xi Jinping during a May 21 meeting. In this meeting he promulgated a set of rules to ease the burden of homework and after-school training for primary and secondary school students. He also instructed the government to rein back on runaway investments in the education industry.

As much as US$10 billion (HK$77.7 billion) of venture capital poured into mainland China’s edtech sector last year alone. This spawned hundreds of start-ups apps and edtech platforms that provided instruction in everything from K-12 tutoring to elementary mathematics language skills and music.

The total number of nationwide student enrolments in K-12 after-school tutoring has increased from 202.6 million in 2015 to 325.3 million in 2019. By 2024 this number is expected to further increase to 659.5 million according to New Oriental Education one of mainland China’s largest tutoring services providers.

Language training is one of the fastest-growing segments in tutoring increasing by 13 per cent to 619.1 billion yuan (HK$744.57 billion) in 2019 from 377.5 million yuan in 2015.

China’s ban on private tutoring is not new. It mirrors a similar move by South Korea in 1980 when the new government led by Chun Doo-hwan banned almost all forms of private tutoring in an effort to ease pressure on students in the country’s highly competitive education system.

However the efforts proved futile as underground private tutoring continued to flourish with Seoul gradually ending the ban.

Question prompts

Describe two general trends that are shown in the chart.

The chart is a projection of mainland China’s online education market done in 2017. Based on News and Context explain how the estimated value and growth rate of the industry might change with the new regulations on private tutoring.

How far will governments go to regulate tech giants?

Issue 1: China’s new private tutoring regulatory watchdog to oversee teachers and curricula for private education companies

In June China’s Ministry of Education created a new department to oversee the mainland’s off-campus tutoring market and bring regulatory oversight to private teachers and curricula.

The Off-Campus Education and Training Department will supervise institutions that provide training and tutoring to mainland Chinese students from kindergarten through high school according to the ministry.

It will also work with other regulatory bodies to help private educational institutions set up Communist Party cells and establish rules for incorporation fees as well as the content scheduling and qualifications of training.

Xiong Bingqi director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute a research firm focused on Chinese education said after-school tutoring was difficult to regulate without a specific body dedicated to it.

“The new department has two key missions” Xiong said. “First to determine requirements for the industry; second to set up a system to ensure that all off-campus tutoring institutions are qualified.”

He also said that a significant hurdle for reform in the Chinese education system would be curbing “group education anxiety” and that if the government wanted reforms to stick society needed to focus more on competence instead of education.

“There is a phenomenon of placing immense importance on a ‘high education’ background in our society” Xiong said.

“Some employers including government agencies and institutions unilaterally emphasise high education when recruiting and employing people which intensifies the ‘famous school complex’ in society.”

Separately Sun Jin an assistant professor at the Department of Early Childhood Education at The Education University of Hong Kong said the new reforms were a gesture of goodwill to ease the pressure on students and that schools would need to become central to their education. If parents were to worry about their children falling behind it would not ease the pressures that created the private tutoring boom she added.

“It is important to ensure schools are able to fulfil the responsibility assigned and to provide necessary and quality support for all students” she said.

Sun added that the crackdown might incentivise rich families in China to pay for one-on-one tutoring but most families could not afford these services and might become even more anxious.

Based on this Issue and your own knowledge explain TWO challenges the Off-Campus Education and Training Department might face in its attempts to regulate after-school education services.

“If the society moves away from paper qualifications parents will be a lot less anxious and there will be no need to send their children for extra classes.” To what extent does the information in Issue 1 agree with this statement and why?

Covid-19 Delta variant causes concern worldwide

Issue 2: Ban on private tutoring may create a black market as demand for education services remains high

China’s ban on private tutoring for children may create a black market with significantly higher prices according to industry insiders and parents.

Signs of a black market for tutoring are already visible in local media reports. This comes as a number of cities in the central Chinese province of Hubei including Xiangyang and Huanggang have tasked enforcement authorities responsible for cracking down on pornography and illegal publications to also police off-campus training. The move treats private tutoring as a form of petty crime.

Despite this the demand from middle-class families for off-campus classes is likely to remain as students are pressured to perform on state exams including the mainland’s notoriously difficult National Higher Education Entrance Examination or gaokao.

Mary Pan the mother of a 10-year-old in the western city of Chengdu enrolled her son in the last available maths tutoring class.

“Everybody else is still taking courses. In the future if the [state] rules are implemented but other families secretly hire private tutors we will probably do the same” she said.

Even though one-on-one tutoring at home could cost 10 times more than institutional services she said if other parents hired private tutors then she had no other choice.

A Beijing-based tutor working for New Oriental a provider of private educational services in mainland China who declined to be named said they would keep teaching until the policy was fully implemented. Even then the crackdown would not kill their career.

They added: “As long as the college entrance exam exists [tutors] can always make money.”

Meanwhile an investor in private tutoring in Beijing who also declined to be named said tutors who were not officially employed by any public school could still find customers eager to pay for a boost to their child’s performance. They said the price in Beijing for one-on-one tutoring had surged to 3000 yuan (HK$3608) per hour about half the mainland’s average monthly salary.

Quotes

“The conscientious [education] industry cannot turn into a profit-seeking industry. The off-campus training institutions must be regulated by the law so that they can return to the normal track of educating people.”

– excerpt from Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech published in Xi Jinping: The Governance of China Volume Three

“Without the existence of these extracurricular companies the role of pushing [my daughter] to study hard will lie on us parents which will be exhausting. [Many parents are suddenly worried about where they will send their kids to study after school] … They do not want to see their kids’ after-school classes get cancelled.”

– Tina Xie a Shanghai parent whose daughter is a primary school student

“Education has been crucial to [the] CCP’s legitimacy as a people’s party. The recent crackdown on ed tech and private tutoring can be seen as an attempt to respond to the concerns of the poor.”

– Liu Ye a sociologist at King’s College London who studies education inequality in China

Glossary

black market: exchange of goods or services prohibited by governments

Chinese education system: in the mainland each child must have nine years of compulsory education – six years of primary school and three years of junior secondary education.

To continue their education they need to take a locally administered entrance exam after which they would have the option of either continuing in a senior secondary school or entering a vocational school.

gaokao: also the National Higher Education Entrance Examination. It is a standardised college entrance exam held annually in mainland China. The gaokao is required for entrance into almost all higher education institutions at the undergraduate level.

Before sitting the exam students must fill in a form listing the universities they wish to get into. Each university has a minimum intake score that a student must achieve to secure a place.

If a student does not meet the requirements for their chosen universities they will have to retake the gaokao the next academic year.

middle-class family: a social group that falls between the upper and working class. According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics about 400 million people – or less than a third of the mainland’s total population – is considered middle class. This is based on the definition of a family of three earning between 100000 yuan (HK$120000) to 500000 yuan (HK$600000) every year.

off-campus tutoring: also known as private tuition. This is usually a form of teaching which is not provided by the state. Off-campus tutoring can take place at the student’s home the tutor’s home a private tuition centre or on school premises. Lessons can also be conducted either face-to-face or online.

K-12: education for children from kindergarten through 12th grade usually between the ages of five to 18

vocational education: education that prepares individuals to work as technicians or to take up employment in a skilled craft or trade.

Without an official list of banned books librarians fearful of crossing red lines said they had adopted a more cautious approach to screening their collections.

Some report they are even questioning whether to take works such as George Orwell’s Animal Farm off the shelves for their portrayal of totalitarian regimes.

First person convicted under the NSL sentenced to nine years in prison

Books written by prominent opposition political figures arrested under the national security legislation and publications marked “controversial” by pro-Beijing media could be at risk the librarians said.

At least one school has already removed the biography of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen while another took down a historical account of defeated Kuomintang soldiers seeking refuge in Hong Kong.

“As teacher-librarians we would rather be more cautious” said Susanna Lau Po-shan who has held the role in several subsidised schools over the past two decades. “We would not want to give up our own safety amid controversy.”

At least one school has already removed the biography of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen from its shelves as the island and its politics are a sensitive topic for China.

Within days of the national security law taking effect in June last year education officials were telling schools to get rid of reading material that could “possibly violate” the legislation although no clear guidelines were provided.

Lau convenor of a concern group representing teacher-librarians from about 150 schools said that without clear guidelines schools could only decide whether to remove titles by applying their own standards.

In regards to her school she planned to remove books written by politicians who were arrested on suspicion of breaching the security law.

Many libraries have already removed books from pro-democracy advocates

Lau also said one of the books removed from her school library’s shelves covered the history of a Hong Kong town which was once a refuge for Kuomintang soldiers fleeing mainland China after losing the civil war in the late 1940s to the Communists.

“I was a bit worried as the book discussed [Kuomintang soldiers] fleeing to Hong Kong and seeking refuge in Tiu Keng Leng … Part of the book also mentioned them being ‘persecuted by those in power’. It seemed safest that I remove this title” she said adding it was a “difficult call”.

Another teacher-librarian from a primary school said his library pulled down a Chinese-language book on human rights and legal protections co-published by former Department of Justice prosecutor Eric Yung Tat-yeung. Pro-Beijing newspapers had accused the book of teaching youngsters “to avoid legal pitfalls”.

A biography about Tsai written by a veteran Taiwanese financial journalist covering her election was also being removed from shelves he said citing fears of breaching the law “as it discussed Taiwan electing their own president”. Beijing sees the self-ruled island as a breakaway province.

Lui Chi-kong president of the Quality Library Network who served as a teacher-librarian at several schools for more than 40 years said books on the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown as well as George Orwell’s Animal Farm and 1984 were among those being considered for removal.

Political activities banned from HK school campuses

Over the past year public libraries have pulled at least 89 titles pending review of whether they run afoul of the security law including several books written by localist Horace Chin Wan-kan youth activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung and former opposition lawmaker Tanya Chan.

In a reply to the SCMP the Education Bureau suggested schools follow the decisions taken by public libraries to remove titles from their campus collections.

Some librarians are wondering whether they can keep the George Orwell classic

But neither the bureau nor the Leisure and Cultural Services Department have provided a banned books list.

Wong Wai-shing deputy principal of Pui Kiu College called on authorities to provide a list of books that should be banned from school libraries so educators would “not fall into traps easily”.

A secondary school principal who asked to remain anonymous said he believed there was “no need to overreact” adding that his school had so far not removed any titles following a review of their library’s inventory which numbered in the thousands.

15000 students left the local school system last year

“As long as authorities do not list out books which schools must remove we will treat that with a business-as-usual mentality” the principal said.

He added: “We don’t plan to remove books just because the author has been arrested under the security law. Even if they have been arrested many of them have not yet been convicted. If their conviction is not directly related to their books I don’t see why we have to do so.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3lwL2Rpc2NvdmVyL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDM5NzEvbmdvLWhlbHBpbmctZW1wb3dlci1ob25nLWtvbmdzLXJlZnVnZWUtcG9wdWxhdGlvbtIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL3lwL2Rpc2NvdmVyL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDM5NzEvbmdvLWhlbHBpbmctZW1wb3dlci1ob25nLWtvbmdzLXJlZnVnZWUtcG9wdWxhdGlvbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The NGO helping to empower Hong Kong’s refugee population,"Filipino refugee Shirley Ballesberos has been trying her hardest to help refugees and homeless locals in Hong Kong – even though she and her 8-year-old daughter need the help as well.

Ballesberos 50 volunteers at Grassroots Future a non-profit organisation that focuses on helping the city’s asylum seekers through providing financial assistance and activities that give them new skills.

While refugees in Hong Kong are given a subsidy of HK$3000 (US$386) a month from the government many of them have said that the amount is not enough given Hong Kong’s sky-high rents and other costs of living.

What life is like for refugees in Hong Kong

Children of asylum seekers can go to school for free the way other local children do but many refugees struggle to pay for the school uniforms textbooks and digital devices required for their education.

Grassroots Future has been providing financial aid to these children including Ballesberos’ daughter.

But its resources are running dry because it has been unable to launch enough fundraising events due to Covid-19 social distancing rules.

It now needs to raise HK$250000 (US$32153) to fund school fees for about 20 children and to organise more empowerment programmes for refugees.

‘God’s way of blessing us’

The help from the NGO had been so essential for Ballesberos she said that it sometimes makes her cry.

“I feel like it’s God’s way of blessing us – he helps us” she said.

Ballesberos came to Hong Kong in 1995 and worked as a domestic helper sending money home to support her two young sons. She was terminated from her job in 2007 and her employer refused to pay her benefits which are required by law at the end of a contract.

Famous people you may not have known were refugees

She tried to bring that employer to court but when her visa expired she did not have the money to apply for a new one.

Eventually she decided to remain in the city without a visa to keep working to support her family as wages in Hong Kong were better than in the Philippines.

In 2012 Ballesberos was sent to the Lo Wu Correctional Institution for overstaying her visa. At the time she was seven months pregnant. She applied for refugee status and was released from the facility to give birth to her daughter in a hospital.

Her daughter is now eight years old and happy with her life in Hong Kong – the only home she has ever known. Ballesberos’ two sons in the Philippines are grown with jobs and lives of their own.

“My daughter wants to stay in Hong Kong” said Ballesberos. “Life in the Philippines is very tough and it’s only gotten worse during Covid.”

Many of her friends and relatives in the Philippines have lost their jobs during the pandemic.

“Kids have to enjoy life and I don’t want my daughter experiencing what I experienced” she said expressing her worries about crime and drugs in the Southeast Asian country.

Asylum seekers share their stories and recipes

Giving and receiving

After hearing from a friend that the Refugee Union a refugee-run society could help with her family expenses she started volunteering there six years ago. She collects donated items such as food and clothes and distributes them to members of the union.

She also recently started volunteering at Grassroots Future which works in collaboration with Refugee Union. She organises attendees for their workshops and collects food to distribute not only to other refugees but to homeless locals too.

“I can make people happy and reduce their burden. I want to help other people who are not allowed to work and don’t have money” she said.

In addition to providing financial assistance Grassroots Future offers weekly classes for adults and kids such as art classes to help people express their feelings and crochet classes to teach them to make bags and wallets. About 30 to 40 people regularly attend these sessions.

“There’s also a self-defence class which is good for the body and a great bonding experience for parents and children” said Ballesberos who attends the class with her daughter.

The charity also organises maths classes which are useful for the children who struggle to learn maths when their teachers speak in Chinese.

Covid-19 has made life even more difficult

Tegan Smyth who founded Grassroots Future five years ago explained that the 13000 refugees in Hong Kong face many challenges.

They often wait 10 years or more to be resettled outside the city. During this time they are not legally allowed to work and must live on a monthly government subsidy of HK$3000 of which HK$1500 is allocated for rent.

The Covid-19 pandemic has only made life more complicated for the city’s already-struggling asylum seekers.

Hong Kong must do more to protect its domestic helpers

“Refugees weren’t eligible to get the Covid-19 vaccine until recently” Smyth said. “There’s also a lot of misinformation spreading around as well as a lack of access to medical resources.”

Getting daily necessities has become more difficult as prices in shops have risen while the government subsidy has stayed the same. There have also been shortages of much-needed goods.

Hong Kong failed the ethnic minority community during the pandemic

Smyth’s interest in refugee issues stems from her time training as a lawyer when she worked at a legal centre in Australia that provided law advice to refugees and new migrants.

In the past Grassroots Future would raise money through regularly holding events and workshops – the most notable being Table of Two Cities in which an asylum seeker cooks food from their home country and shares their story with dinner guests allowing them to learn more about each other through food.

However because of social distancing regulations and concerns over the virus Grassroots Future was only able to hold three events last year.

Growing for the future

The many difficulties posed by the pandemic have not stopped the organisation from continuing to create new programmes. Currently it is looking to launch a new sustainable fashion education initiative.

“We’re always looking for ways to get the community involved in sustainability as well as learn skills that are transferable” said Smyth. “The initiative we’re launching is a 10-week programme that’s all about product development.”

What has China achieved in its fight against extreme poverty?

“We’ll be working with a small group of people and training them to make garments and accessories from scratch using eco-friendly plant-derived yarns letting them get some hands-on experience building a portfolio of work and a personal brand” she said.

Programme participants will also develop their leadership skills as they will be encouraged to teach others in their community.

“It’s focused on giving people the ability to make their own garments and develop a life skill” she said.

The programme aligns with the NGO’s main goal: to empower people in the refugee community to fulfil their potential and become self-reliant sustainability-minded global citizens. The programmes can also give them a sense of comfort amid their unstable situations.

“Families feel so happy and blessed because Grassroots Future is such a big help for us” said Ballesberos. “The activities help our mental and physical well-being and give us confidence. They’re the only ones that help us.”

(KOLN) - A Family Dollar store in Lincoln is back open Monday after having a sign on its door the previous day indicating everyone had quit.

The store located near 48th Street and Leighton Avenue was closed on Sunday with this message posted on the entrance: “We all Quit. Sorry for the inconvenience.”

Family Dollar employees quit (KOLN)

This is now the second business to have a situation such as this one. A Burger King in Lincoln back in July saw all nine employees quit.

The last two Family Dollar employees decided to quit on Sunday and they were the ones to put up the orange sign. Former employees said the store manager quit 4 or 5 days ago.

Former employee Breanna Faeller said the pay is low and they are working extra-long shifts. The store used to be open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and now the hours are 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. due to a staffing shortage.

Faeller said as soon as new employees would come in they would leave almost immediately.

“We got employees hired they went through the onboarding process they’d work for us for two days and they’d quit. They’d be done so it was just a never-ending cycle of training people and them quitting and we wouldn’t have anybody anymore” Faeller said.

She also says if the store decides not to raise wages they should at least treat the employees better. Faeller said if they don’t this will continue to happen.

By Sunday evening the store had a new sign on its door indicating the business would be back open Monday. 10/11 NOW reached out to Family Dollar for a comment and received the following response.

The Suicide Squad really tried to come at me with a mediocre version of Harley Quinn and I’m not here for it. And the advertising for The Suicide Squad knew what it was doing when putting together it’s social media packages. They featured Margot Robbie‘s Harley as much as they could to make it seem like she was prominent in the movie. And I fell for it! Plenty of us did. Unfortunately she wasn’t key to the movie as the trailers tried to make us believe. She got lost in the sauce of the mess of a bunch of men who legitimately were two seconds away from whipping it out and measuring their own packages.

This leads to concern number one when it comes to The Suicide Squad. What was her story arc about? What did she learn? How did she grow? Because from where I’m standing The Suicide Squad used Harley for one epic fight sequence and then spent the rest of the time having her laugh in the way only Harley does have crazy sex with a dictator and look beautiful while looking like she’s lost her train of thought because of rainbows flowers and unicorns that only she can see. That doesn’t make for a productive or interesting character especially with someone as loved as Harley Quinn.

This leads to concern number two when it comes to The Suicide Squad. When does this take place in Harley Quinn’s story? Because the Harley that we saw in Birds of Prey aka the superior DC movie moved past a lot of the pain of her past life with the Joker. She closed that door lit the house on fire and found a family worth fighting for. It’s like James Gunn watched Birds of Prey ignored it because it didn’t fit the story he was building and ended up giving us a dollar story version of Harley while trying to convince me “Oh don’t worry. It’s all the same. She’s all the same. Trust me.” No I don’t trust you.

‘The Suicide Squad’ Really Tried to Sell Me a Dollar Store Version of Harley Quinn

This leads to concern number three when it comes to The Suicide Squad. It was missed opportunity after missed opportunity with this movie while giving us flashbacks and scenes that added absolutely nothing to the overall story in this movie. Ratcatcher? Don’t care. Polka Dot man? Ehhhh I don’t care to see your mom as everyone and whoever thought that was funny was wrong. Even the scene with King Shark and the cute jellies how did that add to the overall story? That includes the montage where Harley was in a romantic movie with dictator dude. What was the point? Because I still don’t understand it or care to do so.

This leads to concern number four when it comes to The Suicide Squad. It wasn’t funny. From beginning to end I was waiting for the laughs. But the only laughs that I got in this movie were the ones that came from Harley. That’s it. No one was funny the situations they were in missed the mark time after time and they were trying to be so serious and brooding that I wondered for a second whether I was watching The Suicide Squad or fanfiction written by Ben Affleck’s Batman where everyone is brooding bland and basic AF. Because there were plenty of hits and beats that reminded me of how bad Batman vs. Superman truly was.

And finally the last concern I have when it comes to The Suicide Squad is the direction this movie took when it came to it’s women. Harley was there to laugh maniacally screw dictators and have moments with herself that we never got to see even though the movie wasted plenty of time on Bloodsport and Peacemaker trying to one up each other King Shark doing nothing and Polka Dot man just growing these weird polka dots of death on his skin. Where was the same time and dedication when it came to Harley? And why did the movie think we were going to connect with Ratcatcher? Because that fell flat as a pancake.

‘The Suicide Squad’ Really Tried to Sell Me a Dollar Store Version of Harley Quinn

Also why was the only Latina Alice Braga‘s character Sol Soria a guerilla style warrior? Because from where I’m standing it’s unoriginal idea after unoriginal idea with a side of “Look at me I did a movie laugh for me and ignore how I treated the women in this movie.” How about no? How about I don’t ignore the dollar store version of Harley Quinn that I was fed while living with scraps when it comes the Latinx character IN A FICTIONAL LATINX COUNTRY IN SOUTH AMERICA!?” *deep breath*

Point being I started this piece talking about Harley and everything this movie missed when it came to her. But the problems with The Suicide Squad run deeper than I first thought or expected. So yeah I’m going to delete this movie from my memory watch the superior movie of Birds of Prey and hope that the next version of Harley that we get (or just any woman in the DC universe) gets the respect that she deserves. She’s badass she’s fire and she’s the reason why people tuned into this movie. Unfortunately this movie failed to deliver on Harley and then some.

I said what I said.

The Dominion Post is helping the community reduce reuse and recycle.

There are a number of ways to recycle around Morgantown. The Monongalia County Commission provides drop-off recycling at the Westover City Building. Every year MUB holds an annual Household Hazardous Waste Collection Day; the city’s Recycle Right Morgantown campaign; and The Monongalia Solid Waste Authority provides information and resources related to recycling and solid waste.

However The Dominion Post is a great resource for recycling newspapers and other corrugated products such as those Amazon boxes.

“Our ‘Project Green’ recycling initiative has been in place for over a decade” said Chris Halterman production director at The Dominion Post. “We offer all types of newspaper recycling and for corrugated products.”

All newsprint from The Dominion Post is made of 100% recycled paper. “We want to make sure that we are continuing to offer an avenue for our customers to re-recycle the products that we sell” said Halterman.

“Recycling is important because we are all stewards of the environment” said Andrew Stacy communications director of the City of Morgantown. “It’s up to everyone to preserve and protect our resources so that we can enjoy them now and our children can enjoy them in the future.”

Recycling can help save energy and conserve natural resources. It can also help create and maintain jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industries.

Anyone can drop off any newsprint and corrugated products at The Dominion Post’s warehouse which is adjacent to the building at 1251 Earl L. Core Road in Sabraton. Drop-off hours are from 7:30 a.m.-3 p.m. Monday through Friday.

For any questions about The Dominion Post’s recycling services contact Halterman at 304-291-9479.

Speaking exclusively with Inside The Ropes’Kenny McIntosh about his new book The Complete List of Jericho former AEW World Champion Chris Jericho opened up about the match.

“Well I’m not being egotistical when I say ‘Of course it was my idea and of course I was fine with it’ because I thought of it. I booked the whole match as well. You never thought you’d see Chris Jericho in that type of match maybe not on TNT but why wouldn’t you see Chris Jericho in that type of match? Because I’ve done every other match! You know go back to the book. I had the first ever barbed wire match in Canadian history in 1993 against Beef Wellington and did the the thumbtack bump with with with Moxley in the Ambrose Asylum Match and all that type of stuff.”

Jericho said he’ll do anything if the story fits – but that he may not want to repeat that match in particular.

“If the story fits I’ll do it – because it is all about storytelling. Obviously it’s not something I would want to do every night or probably will ever do again but when you’re talking about the story that we’re telling it was perfect for it. And I think that match was a classic in its genre. I think it might even be the most-watched death match of all time in the fact that we had 1.2 million people watching it. Show me another death match that had that type of viewership. So it really did do what we wanted it to do which was was kind of extend this storyline and create a stir and create a buzz. So like I said was it was something that I would ever volunteer to do again? Probably not. But was it something that completely was 1000 percent approved and basically thought of by me? Well guilty as charged.”

The incident of course which took precedent in the fallout was the use of a pizza cutter with a Domino’s ad airing shortly after. When asked about putting a pizza cutter on the map Jericho added.

“I also put I also put a clipboard on the map a few years prior. So that’s kind of what I do.”

It’s almost impossible to resist their “gimme-snacks” gaze and you usually scrap some crust anyway so would it be so bad if you shared? Moreover can dogs even eat pizza crust in the first place?

In short yes. But as canine nutrition coach Cam Wimble explains dogs are fraught with gluten sensitivity. Compared to us they’re “less evolved to eat wheat proteins” meaning even small amounts of wheat can lead to things like leaky gut syndrome which happens when undigested food leaks through the intestinal walls resulting in itchy skin and digestive problems.

For the same reason starchy carbs like pizza crust can prompt inflammatory responses in pups which is something to watch out for if your dog deals with allergies or other recurring health problems. “If your dog’s got arthritis recurring ear infections or any issue ending in ‘itis’ you should avoid starchy carbs altogether” Wimble warns.

Another thing to consider when your pooch is salivating over your leftover crust is their weight. Because dogs haven’t evolved a need for carbs Wimble says carb-heavy foods like pizza crust tend to “rapidly incite weight gain.” So if your dog is already carrying a few extra pounds keep that crust on the table. “Obesity is a killer and we forget that” Wimble says. “The chubbier the dog the more likely it is to suffer from nearly every type of disease.”

Beyond the crust it’s super important to keep your dog away from pizza if it’s topped with onions. “Overconsumption of onions can incite anemia as they contain a sulfur-based compound that attacks the red blood cells” Wimble continues. Garlic can cause problems for the same reason though your pooch would have to eat quite a lot to get sick.

All of that said if your good boi or girl is generally healthy and onions/garlic are nowhere to be found Wimble has no problem with the occasional slice of pizza. “Just remember that occasional for them is probably less occasional for you” he says. (You can make a whole dog-friendly pie by using coconut flour for the crust going light on the cheese and topping it with meats and/or veggies — spinach carrots and broccoli are all good bets.)

Well well well. Looks like it’s your lucky day Tuck.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8va3NsbmV3c3JhZGlvLmNvbS8xOTUzNTM0L3JpY2UtcGl6emEtbm9vZGxlLWljZXMtZm9vZC1zaG93cy1qYXBhbnMtcHVuay1yb2NrLXNvdWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rice pizza noodle ices: Food shows Japan's punk rock soul,"YOKOHAMA Japan (AP) — Countries’ foods are also windows on their souls.

Take hamburgers. Hand-held quick to assemble and wolf down they embody a quintessentially American idea that founding father Benjamin Franklin put to paper in 1748 and which still powers the ambitious on Wall Street and beyond. “Remember” Franklin wrote “that time is money.”

In China food is so omnipresent in the national psyche that people greet each other with the phrase “chi fan le ma?” — have you eaten? And French food snobbery prompted the famously omnivorous President Jacques Chirac to once quip unkindly of the British that: “One cannot trust people whose cuisine is so bad.”

Which leads us to the Cup Noodles Museum in Yokohama Japan.

Yes there is such a place. And yes instant noodles have plenty to say about Japanese traits of inventiveness risk-taking and an openness to adapting and upgrading foreign influences that helped Japan recover after World War II to become an economic cultural — and gastronomic — titan.

Some of those same traits have these past two weeks also helped Japan pull off the improbable feat — or folly the jury is out — of hosting the Olympic Games in the midst of the pandemic. Allowing 11000 athletes to come from around the world some bringing the coronavirus with them testified to Japanese resilience hospitality and flexibility.

Now back to ramen with — excuse the pun — a potted history.

The Japanese cribbed noodles from neighbor China where they are called “lamian.” Over the years Japanese chefs elevated ramen into an art a tastebud-blowing spectrum of flavors textures and choices.

In short Japan absorbed a foreign influence and improved on it. The same would later be true with automobiles gadgetry and — for fans of “Demon Slayer” “One Piece” and other mangas — cartoons to name just those few.

Back to noodles though. Horrified by food shortages that ravaged post-war Japan impoverished former credit union worker Momofuku Ando hit upon the idea of turning surplus American wheat into ramen that hungry people could prepare with just hot water and a few minutes.

Ando’s eureka moment came while watching his wife deep-fry tempura. That gave birth to the idea of flash-frying noodles to dehydrate them. Ando’s first instant noodles were launched in 1958.

Cup Noodles followed in 1971. The brainchild for that idea came on a fact-finding trip that Ando made to the United States in 1966 when he saw consumers of his instant noodles rehydrate and eat them from paper cups. This according to Nissin Foods the company Ando founded. Worldwide cumulative sales of Cup Noodles surpassed the 40-billion mark in 2016.

Ando died in 2007 at age 96. But his inventive spirit lives in what must rank as one of the world’s most unique flavor experiences: the Cup Noodle ice cream.

Served only at the Cup Noodles Museum in its fourth floor cafeteria it’s made with the same powdered soup and freeze-dried toppings — onion shrimp chunks of egg and meat — used in actual Cup Noodles.

Museum visitor Noriyuki Sato who tried it described it as “salty-sweet” neither here nor there. “I’m not sure if that word makes sense to foreigners” he said. “It’s not sweet and it’s not salty either.”

But it is a monument to thinking out of the box and to a Japanese knack for fusing together seemingly incompatible things to make wholly new ones. It’s hard to imagine an Italian gelato maker veering so audaciously off the beaten track.

Nissin Foods spokesperson Kahara Suzuki says the ice cream — having tasted it one hesitates to call it a dessert — embodies “what I would call a punk rock spirit that many Japanese people have.”

“Who would ever come up with an idea like this? I mean it’s very unique” Suzuki said. “You can see that punk rock spirit in every aspect of Japanese life.”

Certainly on Japanese plates. A few other examples include fruit sandwiches sold in corner stores and popular rice burgers. Since May they and their likes have been been joined by rice pizzas — developed by Sachie Oyama an innovation chef and manager of the Menu Innovation Department at Domino’s Pizza Japan Inc.

The Domino’s Deluxe version is in effect a pizza built on a base layer of compressed pre-cooked Japanese-cultivated white rice instead of a usual base of pizza dough. The rice base is then smothered with rich tomato sauce and topped with traditional pizza ingredients: mozzarella cheese onions peppers pepperoni and Italian sausage. Domino’s sells the product line only in Japan. Oyama calls it “a pizza you can eat by yourself” rather than sharing slices.

“Japanese people are good at rearranging things” she said. “A combination with pizza and rice is not a weird thing at all.”

Perhaps not. But foods like that do help explain why Japan seems to never stand still. After all there are always new tastes to invent.

An informed source at the ministry told Iranian media that “action” would be taken against the Tehran-based brand responsible for the advert Domino Dairy.

“This teaser was posted online without a permit” they said. “But an hour after it was published after it was discovered by our colleagues in the advertising field the clip – which was produced and published in violation of the regulations – was removed from the page of the company in question and they were served with the required warnings and admonitions.”

The Domino advert showed an attractive happy-looking woman in a loose-fitting headscarf driving through mountain scenery before parking her car and taking a sensuous bite from a chocolate ice cream.

The product appeared to be a local copycat version of Magnum a global brand owned by British conglomerate Unilever. But it was the provocative image of a woman enjoying a frozen treat in public not the rip-off that whipped Iranian state media into a frenzy.

Regime-aligned outlets wasted no time in condemning the clip - officially at least. On Friday Fars News Agency which is affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps called the commercial “disgusting”.

“Recently a famous ice cream maker brand published a video clip that drew reactions from social media users” Fars breathlessly reported. “In this clip a woman improperly dressed and with totally erotic and sexual mannerisms and gestures which are precisely at the heart of the commercial promotes the ice cream by eating it.”

Other media outlets howled that the commercial “misused women”. For the past 40 years the charged term “misuse of women” has been used in legal arguments to censor and shut down publishers that do not toe the official ideological line.

Under Chapter 8 of the Islamic Republic’s Advertisement Laws and Regulations the wide-ranging “misuse” of women men and children is prohibited in commercial ads.

Chapter 9 of the same law also states that commercials and ads must not give “preferential treatment” to males or females. Elsewhere it stipulates “The use of sexual attraction in advertisements is banned”.

Roy Lassiter passed away at home surrounded by family on Sunday August 8th 2021 from colon cancer at the age of 71.

Roy was born in Corpus Christi Texas on January 2nd 1950 to parents Roy Lee Lassiter Sr. and Ellen Mae Collins Lassiter. He graduated from Tascosa High School in Amarillo TX and attended the University of Houston before entering the Navy where he was based in San Diego CA on the DESRON 17 Staff at the 32nd Street Naval Station. After his service Roy joined naval architecture firms M. Rosenblatt & Son and later Designers & Planners Inc. both in San Diego. Over the years Roy's true calling was his interest in new home construction and sales which culminated in securing his California Real Estate Salesperson License in the early 90s. Over the span of his real estate career Roy worked at national builders in California Washington Arizona and both Southern and Northern Nevada for Beazer Homes Richmond American Pulte and D.R. Horton. He also worked for local Northern Nevada developers Braddock & Logan Ryder Homes Altmann Ott Construction and most recently Bates Homes. It was a career that brought Roy the joy of countless buyers and coworkers who became much valued friends.

Roy met his wife-to-be Jean through his sister Diane who were college roommates. Their relationship which began with exchanging letters eventually took them to San Diego where they were later married in 1973. Their children Michael and Paige were both born there in 1979 and 1989 respectively. Roy was a devoted and beloved father who passed along to his children a love of travel and an abiding appreciation of the beauty of nature. Roy's love of the outdoors was his true religion which was enjoyed at his most favorite places in this world via his long brisk walks and even longer swims along the shores of both Maui and Lake Tahoe. He then would often be found dining at one of his favorite local restaurants with a glass of Rombauer Chardonnay in hand. Roy was known for his quick wit terrific sense of humor kindness generosity and deep caring for his family and friends.

Michael Brown

The Highlands is Caldwell Home’s newest master-planned community coming soon to Montgomery County will feature 4000 homes from award-winning builders and with amenities for a highly active lifestyle. Inspired by the thick forestation of the 2300-acre site The Highlands presents itself like a national park featuring large recreational lakes a 300-acre nature preserve and a sandy beach along the San Jacinto River just west of FM 1314 along the Grand Parkway.

“The topography of this site is what really sets it apart” said Peter Barnhart vice president of land development for Caldwell in a release. “We wanted to be good stewards of the natural resources and the densely-treed setting has greatly inspired the development direction of the community. Even the streets are named after national parks.”

Groundbreaking on The Highlands has begun with a grand opening planned for mid-2022. The Highlands will offer the best in master-planned community amenities including a semi-private 18-hole golf course and clubhouse miles of scenic hiking and biking trails waterpark and lazy river onsite fitness tennis and pickle ball courts an event lawn and pavilion for live music and more. These amenities along with a full-time event director will provide an unparalleled living experience for residents while also promoting an outdoor lifestyle in which families and friends can connect and socialize in harmony with their surroundings.

“If you’re in the market for a home The Highlands is definitely worth the wait” said Jennifer Symons vice president of marketing. “From the forty miles of rated trails along an elevated ridge of the property to the unique nature-inspired waterpark residents at The Highlands will experience a wealth of amenities unlike any other we’ve designed.”

Known for building extraordinary places that enrich lives Caldwell has won local regional and national recognition for its communities and has been named Developer of the Year by the GHBA. Caldwell has built many award-winning communities throughout Houston including Towne Lake which was recently named the “Best Community in Houston” by the Houston Chronicle and a Landmark award recipient of the HBJ.

Resident HOA dues will include a social membership to the semi-private 18-hole golf course Highland Pines built by Augusta Pines developer Tour18. Highland Pines will be the first all-zoysia grass course and provide a robust juniors program for kids looking to enhance their golf skills.

The Highlands will also be home to a new onsite elementary school slated for Fall 2024. Zoned to New Caney ISD one of the fastest growing school districts in Texas The Highlands students currently attend Crippen Elementary New Caney Middle School and New Caney High School.

“We’ve gone to great lengths to make sure that there’s something for everyone at The Highlands” says Barnhart. “Homes will be priced from the $290’s and up and offer a wide variety of home types for residents in every stage of life.”

Built by Houston’s most notable builders buyers will be able to browse floor plans in the community’s Model Home Park later this fall. The Highlands builder lineup includes Beazer Homes Caldwell Homes Coventry Homes David Weekley Homes Drees Homes Empire Communities Highland Homes Lennar Homes Newmark Homes Partners In Building Perry Homes and Ravenna Homes.

The Highlands will also include active-adult homes nestled within the community specifically designed for those 55 and better. Patio homes for active-adults will include lawn maintenance in the HOA dues for the ultimate lock-and-leave lifestyle.

Located in North Houston The Highlands provides a lush forested setting just minutes away from top destinations such as The Woodlands Old Town Spring and George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH). Residents will have an easy commuter access to all major freeways including I-45 and Hwy 69 with close proximity to major area employers such as Anadarko Chevron and Exxon Mobil.

“It feels like an escape from Houston yet still close to it all so homeowners get the best of both worlds.” said Symons.

Development is currently underway and the community is slated for a soft opening late fall with a Grand Opening mid-2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvcmVhbF9lc3RhdGUvbW91bnQtcGxlYXNhbnQtZGluaW5nLXNwYWNlLXNvbGQtdG8tYS1tYXNzYWdlLXRoZXJhcHktdmVyc2lvbi1vZi1vcGVudGFibGUvYXJ0aWNsZV8zMmIzYjIzNi1lOTliLTExZWItYTExYy1hNzY1YzZmZjUzNjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mount Pleasant dining space sold to a massage-therapy version of OpenTable,"A former Mount Pleasant restaurant will be converted to a mixed-use office development after the building changed hands recently for $3.2 million.

Mark Volkmann CEO of MassageBook a massage-industry version of the online restaurant-booking site OpenTable bought the former 10051-square-foot home of Liberty Tap Room & Grill at 1028 Johnnie Dodds Blvd. through an affiliate.

Volkmann whose online business helps independent therapists compete against larger chains now rents a small space across town in an upstairs office above the Kickin' Chicken restaurant on Coleman Boulevard. He doesn't expect to move into the newly acquired location until June after it's upfitted.

""I wasn't actively looking and I saw the space"" Volkmann said.

He said MassageBook founded in 2013 is not widely known but he's aiming to raise its profile.

""The goal is to create a little bit more awareness in the new space"" said Volkmann who started in the industry as a therapist and later founded and sold an online product distributor called MassageWarehouse.

He plans to convert a portion of the former main dining space and bar near a pond to office space. He'll leave the kitchen and another restaurant space open for a possible culinary tenant.

Volkmann now employs a staff of about 18 but expects to beef up the payroll after the move.

""We are aggressively growing"" Volkmann said. ""The goal is to have 25 folks in that building.""

He called the newly acquired building ""a great fit for the company"" with plans to preserve the bar area and use a long table for employee gatherings.

""The beauty of that space is the wood in there and the beautiful columns and open ceiling with exposed wood and the view over the water"" Volkmann said.

""I buy the team lunch every Wednesday and we shoot the breeze"" he said."

A songwriter first and foremost — penning hits for George Strait Kenny Chesney Luke Bryan and others before he started recording himself — the Kentucky native eschews videocentric flamboyance and charismatic chit-chat letting the music do the talking instead. On Friday night Aug. 6 in the first of two All American Road Show Tour shows at the DTE Energy Music Theatre that said everything about why Stapleton is such a commanding presence in his genre.

And that was just fine with a nearly sold-out crowd that was as familiar with Stapleton’s material as it was with any of the chart-toppers he’s written for other artists.

Following opening sets by Kendall Marvel and Nikki Lane (replacing a pregnant Elle King sidelined by the flu) Stapleton started quiet with a solo rendition of his 2015 single “Whiskey and You” before bringing his five-piece band on for meaty takes on “Nobody to Blame” and “Parachute.” There was an abundance of star power there — award-winning producer Dave Cobb on guitar and pedal steel legend Paul Franklin a Detroit native — but there was no question who was the star of the show as Stapleton delivered snarling vocals and equally ferocious guitar solos even stepping forward from his center stage position during the stinging outro of “Second One to Know.”

Stapleton’s vocals were aimed mostly at his wife and backup singer Morgane Stapelton but he still had the DTE crowd fully engaged as he rolled through songs from his four studio albums to date — all of them country chart-toppers. Though the heavily backlist staging offered a more it was a bit glitzier than his last tour in 2019 Stapleton and company still achieved a roadhouse kind of intimacy whether they were playing loud or quiet stone country or hard rock or soulful honky tonk. He was clearly making up for lost time alluding to the pandemic pause that pushed these shows back a year by telling the crowd early on that “It’s good to see all your faces again. It’s good to be out here I know that.”

The five-time Grammy Award winner offered quiet moments including a solo acoustic performance of “Maggie’s Song” (about his late dog) and a rendition of “Fire Away” extended to let the audience sing a final chorus. But most of the highlights came when the group throttled down and tore it up with the likes of “Parachute” “Devil Always Made Me Think Twice” “Arkansas” and the Steeldrivers’ “Midnight Train to Memphis.” Stapleton stripped it down to a guitar-bass-drums trio for a combination of “I Was Wrong” and the bluesy “Sometimes I Cry” while David Allan Coe’s “Tennessee Whiskey” ended the main set with “Traveller” and “Outlaw State of Mind” kicking it up during the encores.

There will be other country stars that come back to DTE this year with more personality and visual pizazz. But they’ll be hard-pressed to present anything as potent as Stapleton’s musical celebration.

Some limited tickets remain for Stapleton’s second show 7 p.m. Saturday Aug. 6 at DTE. 33 Bob Seger Drive Independence Township. Tickets start at $30.50.

North Carolina Health News

On a recent morning when a voluminous energy bill hit the N.C. House floor for a vote Democrats remained confident that it would be defeated.

And then from their view at least everything unraveled.

By the evening of July 14 the House had voted 57-50 to approve the 49-page bill. State law requires two votes and after Democrats objected to holding those votes on one day House members hung around until the clock struck midnight then gave the bill its final approval by a vote of 59-47.

“Apparently the speaker (Kings Mountain Republican Rep. Tim Moore) applied his magic and twisted a lot of arms and flipped all the undecideds and got some of the no votes to walk and even got some no votes to flip” said Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Greensboro). “So Wednesday morning the votes weren’t there to pass the bill. They were there by the evening.”

The vote flipping was just one of the many curious Republican maneuvers for a bill that has the power to change the way Duke Energy delivers and charges for electricity in this state for decades to come — whether that be good or bad for the environment and for Duke’s customers.

Rep. John Szoka (R-Fayetteville) is a primary sponsor of House Bill 951. Szoka acknowledges that the bill is not perfect and is likely to face many challenges and changes as it moves into the Senate.

But Szoka who has become so versed with the bill that he can recite its complexities without notes is proud of what he helped create.

Among the biggest rewards from the proposed legislation Szoka said are that it would retire some of Duke Energy’s coal-burning power plants early and provide an abundance of solar power in the future amounting to a 64% reduction in North Carolina’s carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030.

Democrats and environmental activists counter that the coal plants would have had to be retired early regardless of the bill. They object among many other things to some of those coal plants being converted to natural gas. Either way they say the plants are on tap to continue burning carbon-emitting fossil fuels when solar wind and other less-polluting alternatives are possible.

Researchers have amassed a large body of research showing the human health effects of air pollution from burning carbon ranging from diminished lung function and asthma rates to potentially contributing to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Older data has linked air pollution to cardiovascular disease lung disease even low birth weight.

Opponents of the bill also say it could lead to higher energy rates and take power away from the state’s rate regulators. They question the secrecy that some say has shrouded the bill-making process as well as the urgency to get the legislation approved.

The reported secrecy issue

Peter Ledford general counsel for the N.C. Sustainable Energy Association said months of negotiations while drafting the bill happened behind closed doors with direct input from Duke Energy officials during the process.

Ledford said that although he was able to attend those meetings environmental groups ratepayer activists and residential interests such as AARP were excluded. He said he was prohibited from sharing any information from the meetings with anyone else.

“So yes it was definitely done in secret” he said.

Szoka disagrees. He said the secrecy issue was hyped by media outlets and is simply untrue. In reality he said everyone was given ample time — about three weeks — to review the bill before it came up for the House votes.

“So the secrecy thing I’m not buying that” he said.

Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative amendment

So why did so many Republican lawmakers flip their votes the day the bill made it to the House floor?

Ledford believes it had to do with a last-minute amendment that would bar the government’s executive branch from participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative which places an increasingly lower cap on the amount of carbon dioxide coming from the energy sector.

North Carolina is considering joining the initiative — known as RGGI and pronounced Reggie — a cooperative effort among 11 states from Maine to Virginia that will use it to cap and reduce carbon dioxide pollution from the power sector. A study by the Maine-based Arcadia Center found that RGGI reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 47% over 10 years. Other studies have found that it has helped save lives by reducing air pollution.

The day before the House voted on the energy bill the state’s Environmental Management Commission voted 9-3 to start the rulemaking process to join RGGI. An amendment to prohibit the governor from joining RGGI appeared the next day.

Ledford said Moore the House speaker acknowledged in an interview that day with WRAL-TV that the RGGI amendment “was key to getting the caucus aligned around the legislation.”

The Environmental Management Commission approved the rulemaking process for RGGI after the Southern Environmental Law Center filed a petition on behalf of the environmental groups CleanAIRE NC (formerly Clean Air Carolina) and the North Carolina Coastal Federation.

Under Gov. Roy Cooper’s administration the state has set a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector by 70% by 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. Duke Energy the state’s leading energy company by far has its own goal to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by at least 50% by 2030 and to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration carbon dioxide trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere absorbs and radiates heat. Over time carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have “tipped the Earth’s energy budget out of balance” raising the Earth’s average temperature and contributing to an increase in sea levels and more intense storms and flooding. Last year North Carolina broke almost every heat record.

What the legislation promises

Szoka provided NC Health News with a list of talking points that he says the bill would achieve. Among them:

Retire two Marshall coal-fired plants at Lake Norman eight years early — from 2034 to 2026 — and replace them with natural gas plants which emit much less carbon dioxide.

Retire the Allen coal-fired plant in Belmont in 2023. The plant is on schedule to be replaced with a 20-megawatt battery system and 70 megawatts of solar.

Subsequent retirements from 2027 to 2029 are prescribed in the bill but the N.C Public Utilities Commission would hold hearings to determine the most cost-effective and reliable replacement generation at that time.

The four-unit Roxboro coal-fired plant is planned for retirement but if no replacement generation is available by 2027 the plant would continue to operate as is.

Opponents of the bill say they like that it would provide a large amount of new solar power in a state that already ranks third nationally in generating electricity from the sun. But they object strenuously to stipulating that natural gas power plants would replace the coal-fired facilities and to other provisions contained in the bill.

“The solar piece is good but I think there isn’t another piece of that bill that’s good” Harrison said adding that the coal-burning plants would have to be retired early anyway if Duke is to fulfill its pledge of becoming carbon-free by 2050.

Mary Maclean Asbill a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center said the Utilities Commission should make the decisions on what source of power would replace the coal-burning plants.

“It shouldn’t be set in statute” she said.

Ratepayer protection

Other provisions in the bill would allow Duke to use multi-year rate plans revenue decoupling and performance-based ratemaking which would create incentives by linking the energy company’s revenues with its performance.

The legislation would allow the utility to submit rate plans every three years instead of annually a provision Szoka says will cut red tape and result in lower rates for customers.

Ledford and other opponents of the bill say it could have the opposite effect.

“The issue just boils down to ratepayer protection” Ledford said. “Because you’re setting rates several years in advance Duke has the opportunity to over-earn which is pretty problematic when the commission doesn’t have the necessary oversight to really reel them in and make sure that they’re earning an appropriate amount.

“So it’s really just kind of a consumer-protection issue there. What is this going to do to utility rates what’s it going to do to low- and moderate-income folks what’s that going to do to businesses that pay very large power bills.”

A day after the House approved the energy bill the AARP released an article saying the organization is concerned that the bill could be a “bad deal” for the state’s Duke Energy customers.

“If passed Duke Energy will seek rate increases in three-year blocks rather than year by year. The bill takes authority away from state regulators to determine whether (the) company’s spending and earning plans are in the best interest of all customers” Michael Olender AARP’s North Carolina director said in the article.

Two years ago lawmakers dismissed a similar multi-year rate plan proposal from Duke.

Differences in rate projections

Szoka said the bill would add about a dollar a month to customers’ energy bills. That $1 figure is based he said on computations by the Utilities Commission’s Public Staff.

But that figure is also in dispute.

Ledford said the Public Staff’s analysis excluded the impact of multi-year rate plans and did not consider energy transmission and distribution costs — the wires investment.

“Yes they calculated it would only be $1 extra a month roughly but that’s a generation plan that is currently being litigated before the North Carolina Utilities Commission” Ledford said. “So it would only cost $1 more than Duke’s current plan which several parties including NCSEA contend is too expensive to begin with. There are cheaper ways of doing it.”

Another analysis performed for the Carolina Utility Customers Association a trade group for industrial and manufacturing ratepayers found that the proposed legislation would result in a 50% increase in electric bills over 10 years The Associated Press reported.

Szoka called that analysis “100% inaccurate” and reiterated that “we rely on the Public Staff to do the math.”

Hedge fund wants Duke split up

Harrison thinks the urgency to approve the bill stems from an external force in the name of Elliott Management Corp. one of the oldest and wealthiest hedge funds in the country.

Elliott Management which has acquired a large share of Duke Energy stock sent the company’s board of directors a letter in May suggesting that an independent group evaluate whether Duke should be broken up into three regionally traded public holding companies — for the Carolinas Florida and the Midwest.

Four days after the House voted in favor of the energy bill Elliott Management sent another letter to Duke’s board saying it had received an outpouring of feedback from fellow investors top industry advisors current and former industry executives and others.

“Elliott observed that Duke’s poor track record has engendered deep skepticism regarding management’s ability to create value for shareholders and deliver improved service for customers.” the letter said. “Elliott also noted that Duke lacks effective independent oversight at the Board level and that the Company’s “bigger is better” strategy is not aligned with the best interests of its shareholders or its customers.”

Duke shot back with a statement of its own the same day.

“The new Elliott Management letter to the Board of Directors is the latest attempt to push its short-term agenda at the expense of long-term shareholder value as well as the interests of Duke Energy’s employees and the communities it serves” the statement said in part.

Duke was set to hold a call conference with shareholders Friday. That Harrison believes could be the reason for the urgency to get the bill approved.

“Apparently that’s what’s driving the timeline because otherwise none of us could figure out why this big rush” Harrison said acknowledging that Szoka did reach out to lawmakers to explain the bill and thanking him for doing so.

Ledford and Maclean Asbill the SELC attorney said they have also heard rumors about the urgency to approve the bill before Duke’s earnings session with shareholders.

“I have heard that. I can’t verify anything but the timing seems to line up” Ledford said. “Duke certainly isn’t saying whether it’s true or not.”

Szoka said it would be news to him.

“Nobody has even mentioned a word of that to me” he said.

If the bill clears the Senate with few substantive changes Cooper is expected to veto it. His spokesman Ford Porter issued a statement before the House vote.

“The House Republican energy legislation as currently written weakens the Utilities Commission’s ability to prevent unfair higher electricity rates on consumers in the short run. And in the long run this bill falls short on clean energy which will create jobs and contain costs. The Governor encourages legislators to oppose this bill unless important changes are made to fix these significant problems.”

On Sunday Pure Romance held its annual national training weekend in person after more than one year bringing around 2500 to the Duke Energy Convention Center.

As the events -- and the revenue for local convention centers hotels and restaurants -- return to Cincinnati they still don't all look exactly as they did in 2019 as concerns over increased COVID-19 cases caused by the delta variant mount.

""We were told to wear our masks when we were in crowded situations when we're going out and about going to restaurants things like that"" said Ashley Farmer who attended the Pure Romance convention ""They did split us up and had several different rooms we were able to go to so it didn't feel like we were sitting on top of each other. Extra chairs were everywhere. They really did make sure they took care of us and protected us.""

Some at the event could be seen wearing masks; others chose not to don one. Farmer said despite the delta variant she felt comfortable throughout the weekend.

Chris Cicchinelli CEO and president of Pure Romance said getting back to an in-person event was important and precautions were key to pulling it off while helping everyone feel comfortable.

""You can do a lot of Zooms you can do a lot of Teams but you can't deny the factor of being together and having that one-on-one connection and that energy that you feel"" he said. ""I know we've all missed it and I know a lot of people are wanting to get it back in their lives especially with their businesses so this was a really big thing for us to do. But we did it with a lot of steps a lot of precautions a lot of making sure that everybody was taking steps to be safe while they're here.""

The delta variant's effect and rise in COVID-19 cases have occurred since the International Moose Convention in June. Since then the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued new recommendations and masking guidances that many businesses and events have chosen to adopt.

""You know with the delta variant we've been very cautious about making sure that again everybody is wearing their mask there's sanitation stations everywhere you know just really making sure people are using common sense to work together"" said Cicchinelli.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHN1Z2FyLmNvLnVrL2ZpdG5lc3MvdXMtd29tZW4tdm9sbGV5YmFsbC10ZWFtLXdpbnMtdGhlaXItZmlyc3Qtb2x5bXBpYy1nb2xkLTQ4NDUyMzI20gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9wc3VnYXIuY28udWsvZml0bmVzcy91cy13b21lbi12b2xsZXliYWxsLXRlYW0td2lucy10aGVpci1maXJzdC1vbHltcGljLWdvbGQtNDg0NTIzMjYvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bottle the Happy Tearful Energy of the US Women's Volleyball Team Winning Olympic Gold,"It was a moment 57 years in the making. On the final day of competition at the Tokyo Olympics the US women's volleyball team — the most decorated volleyball squad never to win Olympic gold — finally made the top of the podium after defeating Brazil in three straight sets.

The final point came courtesy of three-time Olympian and team captain Jordan Larson who spiked the ball just behind Brazil's front row to close out the third set 25-14.

Special to Fort Myers News-Press

Collins DuPont Design Group was recently recognized with one grand and three silver Aurora Awards from the Florida Home Builders Association for its renovation of a Bonita Bay private residence.

Established in 1979 Aurora Awards are presented annually during the Southeast Building Conference to outstanding builders planners architects developers designers interior merchandisers and other housing-related professionals. This year’s competition drew nearly 300 entries in 61 categories from projects located in Alabama Arkansas Florida Georgia Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina South Carolina Tennessee Texas Virginia and the Eastern Caribbean.

The Bonita Bay project received the Grand and Silver Aurora Awards for Best Renovated or Restored Single Home (Private Residence) as well as Silver Aurora Awards for Best Custom Home 8000 to 10000 sq. ft. (Private Residence) and Best Bath Design for a Custom/Spec/One-of-a kind Home (Private Residence).

Overlooking the Imperial River in the heart of Bonita Springs this Old World-Mediterranean style home underwent a stunning transformation at the request of its owner an avid outdoorsman. A new wing was planned which included an additional 1742 square feet for the master suite den with bath and state of the art “man cave” and tackle room.

The designer began by eliminating aged murals groin vaulted ceilings and arches that were typical “Tuscan” era design. Traditional elements were removed so the large windows tall ceilings and abundant natural light could be utilized. Simplified ceilings with floating wood beams complement the custom lighting throughout. The dropped backlit wood ceiling in the stairway showcases the LED star lights that form an artful depiction of the family’s astrological signs for an interesting focal point.

Intricate details like the glass wine room juxtaposed with the transparent stair railing enhance the open feel of the home. The spacious kitchen with double islands is ideal for entertaining while the seemingly endless wall of floor to ceiling windows frame a breathtaking view of the Zen-style fountain and lush landscaping beyond.

Natural organic elements like wood flooring stone surfaces and warm colors were used to give a masculine earthy approachable feel to this home where regularly entertaining family and business peers is the norm. The blue mosaic and palm frond tiled walls cypress clad ceiling and light wood cabinetry of the outdoor kitchen carry the natural appeal of the interior spaces through the expansive pocket doors to this popular gathering area that boasts multiple televisions for enjoying favorite sporting events.

Presented with a plan for the master bathroom that depicted an expansive uninteresting rectangular space Collins DuPont Design Group’s Lana Knapp and Colleen Wilson’s goals were to maximize the potential of the room and create a luxurious spa-like retreat.

A 60” circle of rain glass for the shower provides a view to the Italian Mother of Pearl tile panels with blue raindrop detail that clad the shower walls and the impressive 24” x 24” rain head imported from Italy with RGB LED capabilities. Incorporating a dropped ceiling detail to create dimension and soften the space the sloped beams were conceived to repeat the circular feature in the shower and bring the 12’ ceiling down to a nine-foot drop to facilitate the plumbing that flows from the center filling the tub from above. Layering the room with white marble and glass tiles provides the ideal backdrop for the homeowner to select any color from the RGB custom lighting controlled by a wall unit for both the bath and the shower to promote a chromo-therapeutic atmosphere of calm and serenity. Adorned with the same mosaic tiles as the shower head the dual bench features a heating element that enhances the room’s spa-like aura.

Aurora Award entries were reviewed and judged by a panel of six building industry leaders. Judges are selected from among the most creative and successful individuals within the homebuilding industry and represent the many disciplines contributing to building and design as well as geographic diversity.

Collins DuPont Design Group’s Aurora Awards will be featured in the upcoming Pro Builder Magazine online.

Bill Dundee was the boss in the territory in the time. The number-one rule he had for his daughter was that she was never ever to go out with a wrestler. Heck she wasn’t even allowed to talk to them. Well one day I called up about getting a booking changed and Bill was in the shower. So against orders rather than let it ring Donna picked up her dad’s phone. She and I got to talking a bit and she said she be at the matches and she’d wave to me. Well she never showed up that night and I wound up calling her two weeks later to ask her out for beer and pizza. So without her dad knowing we went out. We kept going out and she kept it a secret from her dad for nine months. When she finally told him she was dating a wrestler it was at dinner. He dropped his fork started cursing and yelled “Who is he??!! I’ll make sure he never works again!!!!” She told him it was me and he didn’t say a word he just started eating again. Donna was like “So?” and her dad said that out of all the boys she had picked the best. So maybe nice guys don’t finish last after all. -Bobby Eaton May 1999

There is no shortage of praise one can heap on the memory of Bobby Eaton generally considered one “the good ones” in an industry where few leave unscathed by their peers.

Bobby Eaton was a professional wrestling fan that never stopped being one even while making hundreds of thousands of dollars while performing state-of-the-art matches that mortgaged his body in the long run.

He was born in Huntsville Alabama on August 14th 1958 and sought out professional wrestling at a young age.

By the time he was 12 he was assisting the ring crew for Nick Gulas’ promotion and finding any “in” available at a time when doors were shut to outsiders.

Alongside high school friend Arvil Hutto he attended the matches and made himself familiar with the Mid-America crew.

So often luck and timing usurp all factors and for Eaton that combination occurred when he was sixteen years old and Bearcat Wright needed an opponent with a no-show on the card.

Without any formal training Eaton was thrown head-first into the industry. It was not lost on people that one of the most gifted talents of any generation was one whose own training came through what he saw and taking the elements his heroes implemented.

Suddenly Eaton and childhood friend Hutto were working under masks as The Brown Bombers in the wrestling interpretation of “Almost Famous” as they traveled Northern Alabama and into Tennessee.

Area stalwart Tojo Yamamoto took a liking to the teenager and provided mentorship for Eaton who would unmask just after his nineteenth birthday and introducing the fanbase to Bobby Eaton.

As a tag specialist Eaton would find success being paired with various partners during this stretch of his career including Lanny Poffo. It was a sign of early confidence in the performer when promoter Nick Gulas paired his son George with Eaton as they formed “The Jet Set” in the spring of 1978.

George was not well-regarded as a worker but with the undeniable skillset displayed by Eaton out of the gate he was considered the right man to bring the best out of George. Together they won the Mid-America tag titles three times and forming trios with Jerry Barber The Mexican Angel (Francisco Flores) and Arvil Hutto to win the six-man championship in the promotion.

When Eaton was 20 years old he was stunning the wrestling world along with Randy Poffo a.k.a. Randy Savage with the two tearing down the house wherever they worked and becoming must-see matches. The respect Savage held for Eaton was evident years later in 1997 when Savage was a main event star in WCW and worked a Worldwide taping against Eaton and gave his contemporary everything before going over.

It was against Savage that Eaton won the Mid-America heavyweight title for the first time at a house show in February 1979. Eaton held the title eleven times often feuding with Dutch Mantel for the belt. In June 1980 he defeated Robert Gibson for the title as a prelude where the two would be on opposite sides of the preeminent tag team feud of the decade.

After a brief move to Georgia Championship Wrestling Eaton was back in Memphis and a member of Jimmy Hart’s First Family allowing Eaton’s in-ring skills to be punctuated by one of the best managers in the business a trend that would continue on a national level for Eaton.

While it was brief his team with Koko Ware was a tandem people raved about for the chemistry the two instantly displayed as a unit. Later they broke up and feuded with Ware a.k.a. Sweet Brown Sugar losing a Loser Leaves Town Match.

In 1981 Eaton traveled to the Knoxville territory that Ric Flair and Blackjack Mulligan had invested in but the stay was brief and returned to Memphis.

The turning point of his career was the famous talent swap of November 1983 that saw Bill Watts select Eaton and Dennis Condrey to come to Mid-South while being paired with Jim Cornette to form The Midnight Express.

It wasn’t the first version to use the name as the movie title also served as the tandem name for Condrey Norvell Austin and Randy Rose in Alabama and Tennessee. Years later Jim Crockett Promotions would lean on this idea for a battle of the Midnights in 1988.

The swap between Memphis and Mid-South included The Rock ‘N Roll Express the team forever linked with The Midnight Express.

Eaton & Condrey debuted as The Midnight Express on November 23 1983 defeating Rick Rood (Rick Rude) & Mike Jackson. Their first main event was in January 1984 against Mr. Wrestling II and Magnum T.A. and would wrestle Ricky Morton & Robert Gibson for the first time on February 29 1984 in Shreveport Louisiana.

For the history books The Midnight Express erased any doubts regarding their ability as a top act when they were the central heels positioned against area legend and promoter Bill Watts coming out of retirement for a series of matches promoted as “The Last Stampede”.

It was kicked off by a legendary angle where Watts replayed footage of Cornette getting his face put into a cake and they had an all-time classic confrontation. The big announcement was that Watts needed a partner and while Junkyard Dog had lost a Loser Leaves Town match his replacement would be the masked “Stagger Lee” a.k.a. JYD.

The major event was at the Louisiana Superdome on April 7 1984 drawing 25000 people and a gate of $176000. Cornette outlined the business figures in The Midnight Express & Jim Cornette’s 25th Anniversary Scrapbook noting that the match went around the circuit drawing $807000 over five weeks on fifteen shows.

The Midnights would be featured on three more Superdomes in 1984. On July 16 they lost to the Rock ‘N’ Roll Express in a No Disqualification Match in front of 20800 with JYD vs. Butch Reed in the main event. On August 24th the Midnights beat Dusty Rhodes & Sonny King in front of 18000 with Ric Flair vs. Kerry Von Erich in the main event. Their Mid-South reign wound down with a Scaffold Match losing to the Rock ‘N’ Roll Express at the Superdome on November 22nd in front of 14000 underneath Magnum T.A. vs. Ernie Ladd.

While the group was eyeing a move to Jim Crockett Promotions with an open door provided by booker Dusty Rhodes they were moved to World Class Championship Wrestling and agreed to the placement and debuted in time for their Christmas night event at Reunion Arena.

World Class had been hot for the previous two years after the Christmas angle of 1982 when The Freebirds turned on Kerry Von Erich and cost him the match with NWA champion Ric Flair sparking the territories’ hottest feud.

In late 1984 the company was still reeling from the death of David Von Erich in February who was considered a lock to become NWA champion. After his death brother Kerry won the title in May at Texas Stadium but only held the title for several weeks. In late 1984 the Freebirds and Von Erichs had run their course and Freebirds were moving on so there was an opening for Condrey & Eaton.

The Midnight Express arrived and beat The Fantastics (Tommy Rogers & Bobby Fulton) on Christmas night. They spent six months in the territory and worked the David Von Erich Memorial show on May 5 1985 losing to The Fantastics. Their run wrapped up at the end of June and made the biggest move of their careers moving to Jim Crockett Promotions.

The three appeared on TBS on June 29 1985 but were designated to Georgia which had been bought by Crockett. The team was strategically kept away from the Carolinas with Cornette stating in the 25th Anniversary Scrapbook that Rhodes wanted to keep them apart from The Rock ‘N’ Roll Express who were also in JCP. By August the Midnights began working the Carolinas.

This was the golden age of The Midnight Express as they were having outstanding matches and their exposure was massive on TBS with a red-hot territory.

Their first Starrcade was in November 1985 losing to Jimmy Valiant & Miss Atlanta Lively (which was Ronnie Garvin dressed as a woman).

Cornette has cited 1986 as the group’s hottest year with their biggest rivals being Morton & Gibson throughout the year.

The Midnights won the NWA tag titles from The Rock ‘N’ Roll Express on February 2 1986 in Atlanta and held them until August losing them back to Morton & Gibson in Philadelphia.

It was also in 1986 that the group secretly met with Vince McMahon during one of their rare days off at a hotel in Stamford Connecticut so they would not be spotted at WWF headquarters. The meeting was taken despite The Midnights and Cornette being in a great position at JCP and didn’t come away impressed with McMahon’s presentation. Cornette has said that a lot of focus was placed on the “potential” money they could make and noting the merchandising arm of the company. It was decided that it was not a risk worth taking after assessing who they would work with and how they would be booked in WWF rather than the sure thing as a hot act in JCP.

One of the most famous matches of that era was the Scaffold Match at Starrcade on November 27th that year against The Road Warriors. The event was promoted as “Night of the Skywalkers” with the event split between the traditional home of the Greensboro Coliseum and another portion of matches from The Omni in Atlanta including the Scaffold Match.

The events drew huge gates with 16000 and $307000 in Greensboro along with a closed-circuit set-up while The Omni had 15000 paid and a gate of $300000.

The Scaffold Match had its roots in Tennessee wrestling with the idea that the wrestlers would be perched on top of boards hanging over the ring where the match would end when one person took the plunge.

The famous spot of the match culminated with Cornette hanging from the scaffold with Big Bubba Rogers strategically placed underneath to catch the falling manager. However with the great distance between Cornette and the ring he picked up so much momentum that Rogers didn’t provide any assistance and Cornette crashed and thus destroyed his knee. The match was a hit and they sold a lot of VHS tapes through the promotion of the spectacle.

In March 1987 the team was fractured when Condrey took off and went home without providing a reason. In a pivot they were able to recruit Stan Lane as the new partner for Eaton and didn’t miss a beat. The debate has always been which version of the Midnights was superior. Cornette is often asked and says they had different functions with the Condrey & Eaton iteration designed to get true heel heat and draw from those tactics. Eaton & Lane were put in the position to go out and have the best match possible and did so at a consistent level. In fairness both versions would be in the conversation among the greatest teams of all time.

Eaton & Lane won their first of three U.S. tag titles in May 1987 and added the NWA tag titles in September after beating Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard who moved to WWF after dropping the titles. The reign was short with The Road Warriors taking the titles the next month in New Orleans.

The Midnights continued to defend the U.S. tag titles and had sensational matches with The Fantastics reviving their program from WCCW. While most remember the first Clash of the Champions for the 45-minute draw between Ric Flair and Sting it’s the tag match that will blow you away on the re-watch.

In November 1988 Condrey returned with another Midnight Express alumni in Randy Rose under the managerial talents of Paul Heyman for a Midnights vs. Midnights program. It kicked off with an explosive angle where the outsiders jumped Eaton Lane & Cornette in the television studio and Cornette bled to really drive home the threat of the “other” Midnight Express and establish them instantly.

This coincided with the sale of JCP to Turner and the exit of Dusty Rhodes as the booker at the end of the year.

In their WON Hall of Fame bio it is outlined that the three were on $225000 per year deals and once Jim Herd arrived he wanted to cut their pay down to $75000 each for Eaton and Lane and Cornette to $100000. They negotiated to figures of $125000 for the wrestlers and $150000 for Cornette. It was safe to say the bloom was off the rose and The Midnights not being treated as the top act they had become.

Cornette would have a role on the booking committee but the structure of the company was taking its toll. After extending their deals an additional year Cornette and Lane would exit WCW in October 1990 while Eaton stayed.

It was a tough spot for Eaton who did receive a singles push initially and won the WCW Television Championship from Arn Anderson at the first SuperBrawl in May 1991. However two weeks later he dropped the title to rising prospect Steve Austin at a Worldwide taping which aired at the end of June. To this day Austin always goes out of his way to compliment Eaton and was always transparent of his immense respect for Eaton’s work.

In June Eaton challenged champion Ric Flair in a 2-of-3 Falls Match at the Clash of the Champions in Knoxville Tennessee. The match saw Eaton score a fall on Flair before losing the remaining two by count-out and pinfall.

Eaton’s next chapter was as a member of The Dangerous Alliance with Rick Rude Steve Austin Larry Zbyszko Arn Anderson Madusa and mouthpiece Paul E. Dangerously. It was an all-star group and became a highlight of 1992 programming for the company.

While everyone will instantly think of Eaton’s partnerships with Condrey & Lane during this era he teamed with Anderson pitting two of the best workers in the company together. The duo won the WCW tag titles from Ricky Steamboat & Dustin Rhodes in January 1992 and held them until losing to The Steiner Brothers in May.

Eaton had a brief exit from WCW working for Smoky Mountain Wrestling at the beginning of 1993 and made several tours of New Japan Pro Wrestling during this time. Eaton teamed with Tony Halme who would become Ludvig Borga in the WWF later that year. They challenged Road Warrior Hawk & Power Warrior (Kensuke Sasaki) for the IWGP tag titles on June 14 1993 in Osaka.

In WCW he was teaming regularly with a young Chris Benoit and then formed Bad Attitude with Steve Keirn who was coming off a forgettable run as Skinner in WWF.

In 1995 they formed The Blue Bloods and took the Alabama native and transformed him into Earl Robert Eaton for the easy comedy of the Southerner outside his element. He teamed with Lord Steven Regal with Squire Dave Taylor added to the mix.

The group challenged for the WCW tag titles on back-to-back pay-per-views at the Great American Bash against The Nasty Boys and the next month at Bash at the Beach in a three-way match with Harlem Heat and The Nasty Boys.

In the summer of 1996 they tried a unique concept for a house show loop in the Carolinas where Eaton & Taylor teamed against Eddy Guerrero & former rival Robert Gibson. It was designed for the local market with shows in Rock Hill Columbia and Greenville in South Carolina.

The Earl Robert character was dropped in 1996 and he was back to “Beautiful” Bobby and was essentially in an enhancement role for the remainder of his WCW tenure that lasted until 2000.

He was rarely showcased on the major television programs but frequently occupied Saturday Night and Worldwide against a wide array of young talent.

In July 1999 on an episode of Thunder from his hometown he was used to put over David Flair who was being presented as the “undeserving” United States Champion and beat Eaton.

His last match listed in WCW was against Chuck Palumbo in March 2000 one year before the company shut its doors.

In 2001 Cornette and Danny Davis brought him to OVW where he spent some time as a coach and wrestled a series of tag matches teaming with Randy Orton and Ron “H20” Waterman. One of those matches was Eaton & Orton against John Cena & Rico Constantino.

He appeared once for NWA TNA in August 2002 where he lost to Kid Kash on a Wednesday night pay-per-view.

In 2005 there were a series of reunion matches involving The Midnight Express on the WrestleReunion cards reuniting Eaton with both Condrey and Eaton.

His last match was listed as a 15-man battle royal in March 2016 for the RWA group in Fayetteville North Carolina.

Eaton struggled with many health issues over the years and required a pacemaker to be installed and dealt with heart problems.

In June he lost his wife Donna and is survived by his children Taryn Dustin and Dylan.

Eaton will be remembered as one of the best to ever perform with no ego and a penchant for the industry he fell in love with at a young age and never looked back on. He had a dream to make a living in this bizarre industry and was able to take his talents across the world.

While he was not the most famous wrestler his reputation among those he shared rings and locker rooms with for all those decades is untouchable.

Bobby Eaton was 62 years old.

A Go Fund Me campaign has been launched to help assist the Eaton family with Bobby’s funeral expenses.

On August 8 the wrestling world learned of the passing of wrestling legend “Beautiful” Bobby Eaton. AEW paid their respect to Eaton on Twitter writing:

“AEW joins the wrestling world in mourning the passing of a true legend and one of the greatest tag team wrestlers off all-time “Beautiful” Bobby Eaton. Our thoughts are with his family his friends and his fans.”

Eaton is remembered fondly for his contributions to tag-team wrestling notably competing as one half of the Midnight Express. Jim Cornette who managed the team has thanked AEW for the tribute.

Speaking on his Jim Cornette Experience podcast Cornette said:

“I want to say this also a lot of people tweeted including the folks at AEW tweeted a nice graphic and a respectful message about Bobby. I know that some of the AEW personnel at various positions listen to the show. That’s not a snide comment either. “If anybody with access to Tony Khan can get to him tell him that I heard everything that he said about Bobby and how respectful it was and how nice it was and I thank you Tony. Tony Khan is not a horrible human being. We may see way far apart on wrestling in a variety of issues but that was a cool thing to do Tony. I hope somebody will deliver that message to him.”

A GoFundMe campaign was set up by Eaton’s family to help with funeral expenses. AEW’s Cody Rhodes and Chris Jericho both have donated as well as WWE Hall of Famer Ricky Steamboat.

We here at WrestleTalk extend our condolences to the family friends and fans of Bobby Eaton.

The actress who famously starred as a 2000-year-old genie in the hit ‘60s sitcom ""I Dream of Jeannie"" has recently co-written a children’s book titled ""Barbara and the Djinn."" It chronicles the adventures of a young girl who meets a charming genie and later learns the value of kindness and understanding.

This isn’t Eden's first book. In 2012 the 89-year-old wrote a memoir titled ""Jeannie Out of the Bottle"" which details her rise to fame in Hollywood. And despite her latest release Eden is refusing to sit back and relax. In fact she’ll be kicking off a show in February 2022 with the celebrated impersonators The Edward Twins. For Eden it’s ""business as usual.""

EARTHA KITT’S DAUGHTER SAYS ‘BATMAN’ STAR WAS A DOTING MOTHER DESPITE HOLLYWOOD FAME: 'WE ADORED EACH OTHER'

Eden spoke to Fox News about the connection she developed with late co-star Larry Hagman what it was really like working with both Paul Newman and Elvis Presley as well as what kept her going over the years.

Fox News: When people see ""I Dream of Jeannie"" today there’s no denying the chemistry between you and Larry Hagman. How would you describe your connection to Larry on set?

Barbara Eden: You can’t describe it. It’s either there or it isn’t. And of course with us it was there. We had the same rhythm. We laughed at the same things. It was just there. We didn’t have to work at it.

Fox News: What’s your favorite memory from your time on set?

Eden: Oh my goodness I have so many. I have told this story many times but it always makes me laugh. We had a lion as a guest one time. I had done a film at Fox Studios and I had worked with a lion a young male lion. I learned from the trainer on set that you’re supposed to go over and make friends with the lion. Let them know you’re not a threat. They’re not at all an animal to be played with.

FRANK SINATRA AND AVA GARDNER HAD 'A VERY INTENSE RELATIONSHIP' THAT 'WAS BOUND TO BURN OUT' PAL SAYS

So when I knew we had a lion coming up I was prepared. I knew they always used a male lion mainly because they’re lazy. They’re not aggressive like the females. They’re very happy as long as they’re fed and everything is nice calm and sweet around them. And as long as you don’t run – you never run around a lion because it’s like a kitty cat. He wants to play with the ball in the yard but a lion is 800 pounds or more and can really break your leg.

So I knew I had to go over there and let the lion know who I am. I went to Larry and said ""Larry we have to go over and make friends with the lion."" And he said ""I’m not making friends with any blankety-blank lion!"" *laugh* I said ""Well you better."" He didn’t do it. I rehearsed with the lion. They put some meat nearby and the lion ate it. He looked around and was very very happy. We did that several times.

Then they brought in Larry. At first the lion did a double-take and then he roared just roared at him. It was the loudest roar I’ve ever heard. Larry ran like mad but so did every single man on that set *laughs*. They broke the camera. They knocked over the set just running. Meanwhile I was sitting on the sofa. I couldn’t move. The lion then came over put his head on my lap and began to purr like this little machine. *laughs*.

'THE BIRDS' STAR VERONICA CARTWRIGHT RECALLS GIVING BEAVER CLEAVER HIS FIRST KISS MEETING ALFRED HITCHCOCK

Fox News: Your costume caused a stir at the time but it’s very tame compared to what we see on television today.

Eden: Oh it really was. When we did the pilot and the first 13 episodes they didn’t say anything about it. But when we came back they suddenly decided they had to put a lining in the pantaloons. Someone was always on set constantly making sure we followed the best practices. The bottle couldn’t be in Larry’s bedroom. The smoke couldn’t be there. It was a little ridiculous but it’s funny *laughs*. But anyway it worked!

Fox News: It’s been reported that Darren McGavin was being considered as a possible replacement for Larry. However it was you that put a stop to that.

Eden: Sidney Sheldon who of course was our creator producer and everything came to me and said that Larry was troubled. We all knew that he was personally troubled but never on the set. When we worked it was work and it was good. On film he’s wonderful.

I simply said ""He can’t get along with people. That’s all. You can get around that. I think it would be foolish to switch him in the middle of the show."" I love Darren but I didn't know it was Darren McGavin. You've told me something I didn't know. But all I knew was they wanted to get rid of Larry and I didn't think it was the wise thing to do.

ELIZABETH TAYLOR WAS ‘BROKEN’ AFTER LOSING ‘SOULMATE’ MONTGOMERY CLIFT AUTHOR CLAIMS: ‘THEY SAVED EACH OTHER’

Fox News: It sounded like Larry gained a friend in you.

Eden: We just got along. I don’t think it was a surprise to him. Larry always had a friend. He knew that.

Fox News: You appeared on ""I Love Lucy."" What’s the biggest piece of advice that Lucille Ball gave you?

Eden: She didn’t really give me advice. What she really gave me was affirmation. She liked what I did. She treated me like a professional. [""I Love Lucy""] was my third job in Hollywood and I was just so in awe of her. I watched her constantly so I could learn. And she appreciated that.

She was a lovely lady. She was so good to me and even wanted me to sign a contract. But I had already tested at Fox Studios and they had an option on my services. And while I was in the show they called and said they picked up the options. So I had to tell her that I couldn’t work for her which I would love to have done. But she was a pro.

DONNY OSMOND LOOKS BACK AT HIS 'LONELY' TEEN IDOL YEARS: 'THIS BUSINESS CAN EAT YOU UP'

Fox News: You also appeared in 1960’s ""From The Terrace"" with Paul Newman. What was your initial impression of him?

Eden: Oh my goodness he was so handsome. But he was so wonderfully real. He didn’t have an ego. Some actors and actresses - they sometimes have an ego that stands out around them so then you have to be very careful. But he didn’t have any of that. He was real good and wonderful. I had one little scene with him but he put me completely at ease. The first thing he said to me was ""Oh look at this I can look down on you. Most actresses I cannot."" *laughs* Technically of course he was short and everyone knew that. I said ""I'm also short so that was OK."" But he was wonderful.

Fox News: You were also in ""Flaming Star"" that same year with Elvis Presley. What did you think of him?

Eden: Oh he was just a lovely man. Just a dear to work with. Again no huge ego sticking out. He was very sure of himself. He knew what he was and what he wanted to accomplish. He was grounded which I loved. And he was wonderful to work with. He cared about what he was doing. He knew the role was demanding and hard but he worked just as hard at it. And he was really good. I just loved him.

Fox News: You and Marilyn Monroe shared the same stand-in. Did you ever get a chance to meet her?

Eden: Once. I thought she was the most beautiful woman I’ve ever met. She just radiated warmth and kindness. But I was also just flabbergasted over how beautiful she was. Oh my goodness her skin just glowed. Everything about her was beautiful. But she was also genuine and kind.

AUDREY HEPBURN’S SONS RECALL THEIR UPBRINGING OUTSIDE OF HOLLYWOOD: 'THE MOST VALUABLE THING WAS FAMILY'

Fox News: What did you make of her passing in 1962 at age 36?

Eden: Of course I thought it was incredibly sad. I didn’t know her well. I only met her once. I only knew what any of my stuntmen would tell me. I knew she was troubled. But beyond that I can’t really say. I was just really sad that it happened so suddenly for her. She was just so beautiful and kind. That’s how I remember her.

Fox News: What inspired you to write a children’s book now?

Eden: Well this has been a long time in the making. I met [co-author] Dustin Warburton in Australia. I was doing a personal appearance and he was promoting a children’s book that he wrote with someone else.

We talked and I explained to him how important books have always been in my life. I was lucky to have a mother and an aunt who read to me before I could read. Once I got to the first grade I started reading right away on my own. They took me to the library and made sure I had my library card.

The rest is history. I can’t be without a book. I love reading. And I’ve always felt it’s so important for children to read and use their imaginations not just visually on television and games but through the printed word. Dustin and I talked about creating this book and finally we got it done.

Fox News: What’s the biggest lesson you hope to share with children today?

Eden: One of the things that we emphasize in the book is selflessness. Think about other people. Be kind and share that kindness with others. We all could use love kindness and understanding. That will always lead us to better days.

Fox News: In February 2022 you’ll be doing a show with The Edward Twins. What has kept you going?

Eden: You know I don’t know *laughs*. I guess I enjoy my work. I truly enjoy what I do and I love it. And they’re so talented how could I not be excited? And for me it’s business as usual to do what I love."

(EBAY) reports Q2 2021 earnings after Wednesday’s closing bell with analysts looking for a profit of $0.95 per-share on $3.0 billion in revenue. If met earnings-per-share (EPS) will mark a 12% decline compared to the same quarter last year. The stock sold off more than 10% in April despite meeting Q1 estimates with a 26.4% year-over-year revenue increase and rallied into July’s all-time high in the mid-70s.

Riding the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Wave

The e-commerce provider has outperformed larger rivals so far in 2021 posting a 30% return compared 2.7% for Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and less than 1% for Dow component Walmart Inc. (WMT). The explosive growth of non-fungible tokens (NFT) has underpinned revenue and investor sentiment since sales were introduced in May. It’s a perfect place for this initiative with digital trading cards music entertainment and art backed up by blockchain technology.

eBay discussed this emerging growth channel at the time of the release noting that “NFTs offer greater access to a broader audience of collectors and creators. In the same way digital publishing brought more exposure for writers digital collectibles bring greater opportunity for artists and creators. We plan to double down on this idea – combining eBay’s global reach with the principle that anyone can find almost anything on our platform”.

Wall Street and Technical Outlook

Wall Street consensus remains unenthusiastic with an ‘Overweight’ rating based upon 7 ‘Buy’ 2 ‘Overweight’ 10 ‘Hold’ and one ‘Underweight’ recommendation. No analysts are recommending that shareholders close positions. Price targets range from a low of $59.20 to a Street-high $81.00 while the stock closed Friday’s session on top of the median $66.00 target. This suggests the company will need to raise Q3 guidance to trade at higher prices.

eBay completed a round trip into the 2018 high at 46.99 in June 2020 and broke out entering an uptrend that stalled just above 60. The stock cleared that barrier in June 2021 lifted into July’s all-time high at 74.13 and turned south into August. It’s currently trading below the 50-day moving average for the first time since May and testing support in the mid-60s. So far at least this looks like garden variety profit-taking suggesting even higher prices in coming months.

But look deeper and you’ll see that it’s actually one of the rarest and most special televisions in existence.

The brand is Teledyne Packard Bell which as Twitter’s resident hardware necromancer Foone points out isn’t that special. What does they explain is the Cartrivision player it holds.

In an era before video stores and the inevitable Netflix if you wanted to watch a feature film at home that wasn’t broadcast on network television you typically had to roll out an old-fashioned movie projector. But if you lived in the early 1970s and happened to love bleeding-edge gadgets you could get a TV console with a Cartrivision player built in.

HOLY FUCKING SHIT THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME AUCTION

Do you see this TV? do you realize why it’s special? pic.twitter.com/gaMMsskzTl — foone (@Foone) August 5 2021

As Foone explains Cartrivision was a short-lived analogue format for which videos came on massive cartridges. It wasn’t the first proprietary home video technology — those date back to the 1960s — but it was the first to let people rent Hollywood feature films for home viewing. Since there were no video stores renting was done through a catalogue and the cartridges were sent via snail mail.

But there was a catch: Most Cartrivision videos could only be watched once. This meant viewers could not skip ahead nor rewind the video. The good news is that there were no rewind fees (they hadn’t been invented yet!) but the bad news is that poorly timed phone calls or bathroom breaks could impact the viewing experience.

Once the viewed cassettes were returned (again by mail) they were rewound with a special proprietary machine.

Sears sold the Cartrivision + TV units for around $US1600 ($2176) which as YouTuber Oddity Archive points out would be around $US9000 ($12241) in modern money. Although Cartrivision offered an array of major studio films and even released the first adult movie on home video (A History of the Blue Movie) sales were not great. By July 1973 the format went out of production with leftover stock rotting in warehouses.

While the planned standalone players were never released some Cartrivision players have survived after being extracted from their original TV consoles and there exists a small community of enthusiast collectors and refurbishers.

According to electronics site CED Magic “most of the surviving Cartrivision units today are homemade boxes with the electronics mounted inside. It’s more common to see Cartrivision as two loose pieces of exposed electronics one piece being the tape transport unit and the other being the fishtank signal processing unit.”

That’s why as Foone notes an entire TV console with the Cartrivision still in it is an incredibly rare beast today.

Which brings us to the one that’s currently up for auction on eBay. A typical example of the wood-enclosed entertainment systems of the era this original Teledyne Packard Bell Cartridge Television System is massive weighing approximately 136 kg. Foone suggests it may be the only surviving specimen in the world.

“This was left behind in a property I purchased” wrote eBay seller lveldre. “Selling for parts only. I do not know if it works. I removed the back panel to give a view of the internal electronics. It looks like it is all original and still intact.”

Even if it works don’t get your hopes up for the Cartrivision to actually play the old tapes. The format is highly sensitive to humidity and as Foone points out there was actually an Emmy-winning documentary about just how difficult it was to extract the video from a vintage Cartrivision tape.

If you want to learn more about this crazy-archaic dead video format here’s the trailer for Lost and Found the documentary about resurrecting a Cartrivision tape of the 1973 NBA Championship.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZG9yaXRvcy1vZmZlcnMtMjAtMDAwLWF1c3RyYWxpYW4tMDYzMzI0MDUwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doritos offers $20000 to Australian teen who found rare 'Puffy Chip' in nacho Pack,"Your big fortune may be in a bag of chips. At least it was for a 13-year-old from Australia. Dorito paid her $20000 for finding a puffy Dorito. Here’s what happened.

Aussie teen finds the perfect chip a puffy Dorito

Puffy Dorito

“I found a puff Dorito. Is this valuable or should I just eat it?” said Rylee Stuart on her viral TikTok video. The teen was munching on a packet of Doritos when she came across a chip that looked like a puffed-up triangular pillow. The teen was about to eat it but decided it might be worth something. She posted her unique chip on TikTok asking for feedback on what to do with it. The teen’s followers asked her to put it on eBay. Soon the chip went on eBay with a starting bid of a measly $0.99. The TikTok entry blew up with over 6 million views.

Imagine Stuart’s surprise when the eBay ad blew up!. Moreover it also caught the eye of Vandita Pandey the Chief Marketing Officer of Doritos. “It’s been a whirlwind couple of days for Rylee and her family and we’ve loved following her story. We’ve been so impressed with Rylee’s boldness and entrepreneurial spirit so we wanted to make sure the Stuart family were rewarded for their creativity and love for Doritos” said Pandey. The firm also offered her an award of $20000.

New meaning to ‘cashing in your chips’

Puffy Dorito

Since the funky chip has made the news Rylee’s father started teasing her that he will contest for the ownership of the ‘golden ticket.’ “Dad is saying that since he bought the packet it’s his chip. But I ate the packet and found it so I believe it is mine” said the gleeful teen.

After all possession is nine-tenths of the law so there will surely be no disputes. However the rare chip finds surely gives the phrase ‘cashing in your chips’ a brand literal meaning.

British hammer-throwing champion Taylor Campbell 25 posted the link on his Twitter feed on Friday offering a phone and earphones for sale.

Campbell from Slough is selling a limited edition Samsung Galaxy S21 with the Olympic rings etched onto it as well as wireless Samsung earbuds.

The listing is open to bids with the highest offer currently standing at £3230.

Taylor worked as a receptionist at a sports facility until February but his contract was not extended due to lockdown-enforced closures and he had to use his savings to get to the Tokyo Games.

He has now returned to the UK and while looking for jobs he thought he would sell the Samsung phone athletes were given by the Games sponsor.

""I get some funding from UK Sport but it's not enough to live off"" Campbell told Sky News.

""Unfortunately making it to the Olympics doesn't get you any more money you do it for the pride.

""I am an iPhone guy and the Samsung will have just sat in a box as memorabilia so I put it on eBay.

""It has blown up a bit and there has been an overwhelming amount of support.""

Campbell has also started a Go Fund Me page.

Campbell qualified for the Olympics after winning gold at the Muller British Athletics Championships in June with a stadium record throw of 75.10m.

But he failed to make it through to the final in Tokyo finishing 14th in his heat.

Despite not making it to the final Campbell described the Games as an ""amazing"" but ""strange"" experience.

""It was a unique one - this Olympics was more about the journey to get there"" he said.

""The experience was a strange one but I did enjoy it because I had a good roommate.

""We didn't get to see any of Tokyo and were in our room.

""The village was a bit more relaxed but some athletes did find it tough.""

Campbell hopes to keep progressing after his experience in Tokyo firstly with the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham then the European and World Championships and then Paris 2024.

His participation will however be dependent on funding.

Image: Campbell believes his experience in Tokyo will give him confidence going into the Commonwealth Games

Funding has been a key question during this year's Olympics with some medal winners having to crowdfund their journey to Tokyo.

BMX gold medallist Beth Shriever had to fund herself after British Cycling decided to stop funding female BMX riders in 2017 because no British women qualified for Rio 2016.

Shriever and her coach decided to create their own support package close to her Essex home with the help of crowdfunding.

She worked part-time at a nursery and raised £50000 to travel to qualifying races.

In 2018 UK Sport removed the stipulation banning British Cycling from investing in female BMX riders so it was then able to support Shriever in the run-up to Tokyo.

And after Team GB's men's rugby sevens team was beaten in the semi-final star Dan Bibby criticised funding cuts to the sports programme labelling the Rugby Football Union's (RFU) plans ""a joke"".

The team's central contracts ended last August as the RFU looked to cut costs during the pandemic.

""Unless the unions pull their fingers out it is not going to be exciting much longer"" he said.

""Off little funding we can do that. Imagine what we can do with proper funding.

""If you look at who has done well in this tournament New Zealand Argentina and Fiji have had full programmes the entire time.

""You cannot compete on this level unless it is properly funded."""

The Cost of Carbon

Climate change is in vogue in Washington DC again. But industry has been fighting the battle against rising global temperatures regardless of what party is on the Hill or in the White House. As part of the cleaning product industry’s commitment to reducing emissions in accordance with scientific consensus the American Cleaning Institute created a roadmap for action on climate change. The goal is for the industry is to achieve net zero industry carbon emissions.“ACI and the cleaning product industry has talked about sustainability for a long time and we have showcased industry achievements. But our 1.5° Challenge is representative of bolder collective action to combat climate challenge” explained ACI’s Brian Sansoni.Industry is making a big push to be carbon neutral by 2050. The ACI program was scheduled to launch last year but the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the agenda into 2021.“The pandemic impacted company playbooks in crisis management but sustainability was never off the table during the pandemic” said Sansoni. “Rest assured announcements like this and others show the cleaning product industry continues to be a leader when it comes to sustainability.”According to Emilio Tenuta Ecolab’s senior vice president and chief sustainability officer Ecolab is aligned with the ACI’s efforts to bring industry forward on climate actions.“The science is clear that we must take action and we are doing our part to limit global warming to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels” said Tenuta. “It is the right thing to do and is based on the best available technology and science.”He described groups such as ACI and the American Chemistry Council (ACC) as building blocks in the economy that provide an opportunity to engage with suppliers and network with other stakeholders to develop new ways to deliver real solutions to climate change. Both groups engage and support stakeholders and help set science-based targets.“The more ACI and ACC are involved the more opportunities for organizations to learn together” said Tenuta.He noted that the pandemic served as a wakeup call regarding the role that industry plays in a cleaner environment. When much of the economy shut down last year air became cleaner which in turn can have a positive impact on human health.“We must continue to take the steps to a decarbonized world which will help improve human health and the environment” explained Tenuta.Climate change is the biggest issue facing the world according to Eric Peeters global director of sustainability performance materials & coatings Dow . His company is committed to doing what needs to be done to decarbonize and help others reduce their footprint.“Addressing carbon is a team sport. It is a value chain play” he explained. “When you think about detergents you think about ingredients the formulation the wash water to name a few. Without collaboration no one gets very far.”Specifically ACI’s Roadmap for achieving its net zero ambition includes:• Reducing absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within operations and product manufacturing.• Working with supply chain partners to reduce upstream GHG emissions and transition to low-carbon transportation.• Enhancing climate resilience by restoring conserving or creating natural climate solutions that store carbon and aid in sequestration.• Through support of policy and collaborations with external stakeholders minimizing emissions from cleaning product use.“We are happy to be part of this commitment” said Marcelo Lu SVP-care chemicals North America BASF . “No company can do it alone. You need partners.”ACI member company commitments include: BASF wants to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. To accomplish that the company wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions worldwide by 25% by 2030. Colgate-Palmolive has committed to net zero carbon by 2040 and 100% renewable electricity in its global operations by 2030. Colgate’s climate goals on Scope 1 2 and 3 were approved in 2020 by the Science-Based Targets initiative and are aligned with the Business Ambition for 1.5°C. Croda has an ambition to not only reduce its GHG emissions but to become “Climate Positive.” Accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy Croda is committed to science-based targets (SBTs) to reduce GHG emissions (Scope 1 2 and 3) in line with 1.5°C by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Dow’s “protect the climate” targets reflect the company’s commitment to reduce its net annual carbon emissions by five million metric tons versus its 2020 baseline and ensure Dow’s ecosystem is carbon neutral by 2050. Ecolab has committed to halve its carbon emissions by 2030 and reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 using science-based targets. This includes significant carbon reduction in its supply chain. Firmenich has set SBTs aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Building on its commitment to reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 55% and Scope 3 emissions from raw materials by 20% by 2030 vs 2017 the Group now powers all its operations worldwide with 100% renewable electricity. Henkel has committed to being climate positive by 2040. Having already achieved the use of electricity from renewable sources at the US production sites and offices Henkel will extend this to all regions by 2030. In addition Henkel strives to help customers consumers and suppliers reduce CO2 emissions by 100 million tons by 2025. IFF has set an SBT to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 30% below 2015 levels by 2025 and aims to engage suppliers representing 70% of its supply chain emissions to set their own SBTs by 2025. In addition IFF has a goal to procure 75% of its electricity portfolio from renewable sources by 2025. MonoSol is determined to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. As part of the journey toward this goal it is now establishing updated science-based sustainability goals and timelines as part of a comprehensive mid-term plan addressing a wide range of global environmental and social priorities. Novozymes is committed to a 50% decrease in absolute CO2 emissions below a 2018 baseline 100% renewable electricity and a 15% reduction in Scope 3 CO2 emissions from purchased goods and services by 2030. Reckitt has the ambition of net zero carbon emissions by 2040. It has committed to reduce carbon emissions from sites by 65% and to power operations with 100% renewable electricity by 2030. Sasol is updating its 2030 and beyond targets as a strategic imperative for release this year. Seventh Generation is committed to an SBT for Scopes 1 2 and 3 to limit GHG emissions. In addition it is transitioning from 100% RSPO GreenPalm PKO to 100% RSPO mass balance PKO to stop deforestation driven by demand for palm oil. Shell’s target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Twin Rivers Technologies has set a goal of outperforming the Paris Climate Accord and SDG goals for emissions. This includes a target of zero growth in emissions and waste streams over the next 10 years (2017 baseline).Impressive targets but the chemical industry still has a lot of heavy lifting to do according to Chris Sayner VP-customer alliances corporate sustainability Croda “Ninety-percent of the chemical industry’s feedstock is based on oil and gas” said Sayner. “It requires a lot of heat and is energy intense.”Sayner said most of Croda’s peers are 10% bio-based compared to 60-70% for his company. Furthermore when it comes tocarbon emissions Croda has been on a mission for more than a decade. A wind turbine was installed at its HullUK facility in 2000. The Atlas Point manufacturing facility powers and heats plants with solar panels and landfill gas conversion.Peeters noted that for Dow to reach zero carbon emissions by 2050 will take new technology in hydrogen chemistry and renewable energy and investments. Dow operates wind turbines and solar panels at several manufacturing sites.According to Lu BASF is transitioning its portfolio from fossil-based to a biobased which allows for a sign shift in carbon footprints. By the end of 2021 BASF will have carbon footprint data on all of its products.“Long-term we are making investment to reduce emissions in production. In Ludwigshafen we have an agreement with an energy company to supply us with renewable energy” he explained. “We are looking for these opportunities in North America and Asia.”Altruistic? Not necessarily. Carbon comes at a cost. The Biden Administration earlier this year put the cost of carbon emission at $51 a ton. But Sayner warned that the cost of doing nothing will climb much higher. He pointed to Trucost 2018 study that put 30% of profit at risk by 2030 and 60% by 2050.“There aren’t many companies that can afford that kind of slide” he noted. “When carbon has a cost it has more value for companies.”ACI expects more companies will come on board with the 1.5°C Ambition. In fact Sansoni said it has been the most significant response it received from members. Still the Institute has always considered sustainability as a long-term journey.“This is an opportunity for the cleaning industry to shine a light on what we’ve accomplished and put a stake in the ground on the issue for the cleaning industry” concluded Sansoni. “We look at sustainability as an evolution not a revolution at ACI.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s scary to think that Peter Jackson’s first film in the motion picture trilogy The Fellowship of the Ring will be celebrating its 20th anniversary later this year. At the same time it’s hard not to get excited for what’s coming next: Amazon’s 2022 Lord of the Rings television series.

In the world of video games Tolkien’s universe has continued to expand even in the absence of blockbuster films. Shadow of Mordor and its sequel wowed us with their intriguing Nemesis system. There’s also a Gollum game out next year. It’s a steady trickle and one that has us looking back and remembering some of those earlier Lords of the Rings tie-ins and where they are now.

Fly you fools!

The sixth generation of home consoles coincided with the Lord of the Rings cinematic trilogy the PS2 Xbox and GameCube battling for a spot next to the family television. Games such as Grand Theft Auto III Sonic Adventure and Devil May Cry were signalling a change in the action/platforming genre making way for film IP to cash in on quickly developed movie tie-ins.

The Lord of The Rings movie licence was safely in the hands of Electronic Arts by the time The Fellowship of the Ring hit theatres. EA’s first movie tie-in for The Two Towers represented two-thirds of Peter Jackson’s trilogy with most action sequences linking to The Two Towers.

Receiving a multi-platform release in October 2002 The Two Towers featured hack and slash battles from those first films. A second instalment in the same vein The Return of the King covered the action-packed finale of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Collectively selling over six million copies worldwide EA had a firm grasp on the Tolkien film licence. Something that the company would have trouble repeating with their Star Wars related ventures.

After the movie tie-ins EA threw somewhat of a curveball with The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age. This turn-based RPG weaved in and out of the movies’ main events and showed EA’s commitment to providing genre-hopping experiences under one licence (to rule them all).

In a hole in the ground there lived a licencing deal

Once EA had obtained The Lord of the Rings book licence The Battle for Middle-Earth soon followed. Moving into the realms of real-time strategy this served as EA’s answer to popular RTS hits such as Age of Empires and Warcraft. It also stood on the toes of Sierra’s own game set in Tolkien’s fantasy world War of the Ring. While both had their high points Battle for Middle Earth was better received by critics followed up by a sequel and its superb expansion Rise of the Witch King.

The Lord of the Rings: Conquest was another attempt by EA to cross the border into new genres. Instead of Middle-Earth’s mightiest heroes this game had you reliving epic clashes through the eyes of men elves and orcs with iconic characters occasionally gracing the battlefield. Although there was a solo campaign Conquest was designed with multiplayer in mind. Many liken to the game to Star Wars: Battlefront and its easy to see why – both were developed by Pandemic Studios who created Destroy All Humans! Mercenaries and The Saboteur.

Eight Lord of the Rings games were released within seven years with a ninth game – The White Council – cancelled while still in early development. It was gearing up to be the grandest Lord of the Rings adventure yet set in an open world with its protagonist working alongside Saruman Gandalf Galadriel Elrond. The fact this project was cancelled in favour of Conquest presents one of gaming’s biggest “what if” scenarios.

EA’s Lord of the Rings games: where are they now?

EA’s licence expired in 2008 with no attempts at renewal reverting the rights to Warner Bros. which lead to darker more mature titles in the series such as War in the North and the Shadow Of Mordor series. We also saw Lego game adaptations of both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit the former being the first Lego title to use original voice lines from a movie.

But what of those older games and the legacy they built? Unless you’re playing on older consoles – or have somehow managed to wangle PC copies – these games are nowhere to be found. No remasters Steam downloads or backwards compatible versions on Xbox systems all thanks to licensing issues.

Various calls have been made online for relicensing/re-releases/remasters of The Two Towers and The Return of the King video games. One in particular had reached nearly 15K signatures and included a call to arms for EA’s Harry potter titles. Electronic Arts cannot re-publish any games from the franchises mentioned above due to not having the licences. However negotiations for new licencing agreements isn’t an impossibility.

Gondor calls for aid!

Right now EA is hard at work on Battlefield 2042 a Dead Space Remake and a Jedi: Fallen Order sequel among various annualised sporting sequels. However a potential relicensing of older Lord of the Rings games could give fans an incentive if brought to the publisher’s EA Play subscription service.

Then there’s Xbox Game Pass. Whilst already packing in EA Play for Ultimate members having legacy The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter titles available for all Xbox/PC users as exclusive content would be an easy win without the need for developing remasters. It’s been well documented how much team Xbox pay developers to have their titles on Game Pass either for a limited time or permanently. In some cases this upfront cash covers development costs. In this case it could cover legal/licence costs.

The likelihood this will ever happen? Very slim. Those Lord of the Rings games aren’t the only ones caught in a tangle. Even in 2021 we’re still seeing AAA games fall prey to licensing woes Forza 7 being yanked from sale as Microsoft allow their rights to lapse. This has long been a slap in the face of game preservation though as we’ve seen in the past fan projects can sometimes deliver when game publishers can’t…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84MTAyNS9lYXMtdWx0aW1hdGUtdGVhbS1lYXJuaW5ncy1ncmV3LTQwMC1pbi04LXllYXJzLXRvLW92ZXItMS02LWJpbGxpb24vaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EA's Ultimate Team earnings grew 400% in 8 years to over $1.6 billion,"Electronic Arts' Ultimate Team has grown over 400% over 8 years driven by strong engagement and billion-dollar monetization.

EA's Ultimate Team is one of the most powerful monetization forces in the games industry. The business model which is delivered as part of annualized heavy-hitters like FIFA and Madden currently represents a significant portion of the publisher's total yearly revenues.

Ultimate Team earnings have grown tremendously over the last decade. Over the last 8 years alone UT revenues have jumped by over 400% from $318 million in FY14 to a whopping $1.632 billion in FY21. To put this another way Ultimate Team made up 8.9% of EA's total net revenues in the FY2014 period and by FY2021 UT made up 29% of net revenues.

This growth represents a CAGR of 23%.

Ultimate Team has made over $7.9 billion from 2014-2021. For perspective's sake GTA V has earned $6.4 billion since launch in 2013 and Call of Duty made over $3 billion in earnings in 2020 alone.

EA doesn't rely on Ultimate Team alone for its in-game digital revenues. The company now has the might of free-to-play Apex Legends adding to its coffers. Apex is on track to earn $2 billion in lifetime revenues since launching in 2019 and is now seen as a blockbuster franchise at EA.

EA is also doubling-down on singleplayer games to help diversify its slate and complement live games. The company confirms Jedi Fallen Order 2 is in development and reports say other games like Dragon Age 4 are now singleplayer-only.

Ultimate Team earnings should grow even higher this year. The publisher expects to earn a record-breaking $6.8 billion in net revenues in FY22 and says demand for FIFA 22 is exceptionally high. EA also expects to launch Apex Legends mobile this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvZ2FtZXIubmV0L3VsdGltYS11bmRlcndvcmxkLTEtMi1zeW5kaWNhdGUtcGx1cy1hbmQtc3luZGljYXRlLXdhcnMtcmV0dXJuLXRvLWdvZy1hbmQtdGhleXJlLWZyZWUtdW50aWwtM3JkLXNlcHRlbWJlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ultima Underworld 1+2 Syndicate Plus and Syndicate Wars return to GOG - and they're free until 3rd September,"Ultima Underworld 1+2 Syndicate Plus and Syndicate Wars have all returned to GOG where they are free to download until 3rd September.

Each game normally costs £4.39.

GOG's announcement that it planned to delist the classic quartet from its digital store in late June at the ""publisher's request"" (Electronic Arts) convinced a number of customers to snap them up.

Now they're back on GOG alongside a message from EA:

""Syndicate and Ultima Underworld are back! It seems that 20 years on there's still plenty of love for these titles so we're pleased to confirm that effective immediately they'll be available again on GOG and we'll be keeping them in the store for the foreseeable future. To celebrate this we're offering these games as a free download for four weeks.""

According to PC Gamer GOG is offering owners of either game a refund.

It's unclear why these games were delisted from GOG in the first place. Blue Sky Productions' Ultima Underworld is one of the most influential RPGs of all time. The 1992 first-person adventure created by developer legends including Richard Garriott Warren Spector and Paul Neurath was set in a fully 3D simulated world that predated even Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls. Ultima Underworld 2: Labyrinth of Worlds developed by LookingGlass Technologies followed in 1993.

Syndicate Plus is the 1996 re-release of the original Syndicate and its expansion pack. Syndicate is of course the isometric real-time tactical strategy game from Peter Molyneux's Bullfrog that came out in 1993. Syndicate Wars is the 1996 follow-up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL2RlYWQtc3BhY2UtZnJhbmNoaXNlLWJlc3QtbW9tZW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dead Space: Best Moments From the Franchise,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL2RlYWQtc3BhY2UtZnJhbmNoaXNlLWJlc3QtbW9tZW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84MTAyOS9lYS1tYWRlLTI4LWJpbGxpb24tZnJvbS1kaWdpdGFsLWluLTEwLXllYXJzLWRlY2FkZS1ncm93dGgtdXAtNDI3L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EA made $28 billion from digital in 10 years decade growth up 427%,"EA has earned over $28 billion from digital revenues in the last 10 years as online earnings eclipse physical sales.

EA's digital empire has grown tremendously in the last 10 years with the expansion of live services and less reliance on physical game sales. Digital revenues which include live services subscriptions and game sales made from online distribution channels have grown 427% over the ten-year period: EA's FY11 digital revenues were $833 million and made up 22% of yearly net revenues and by FY21 digital sat at a whopping $4.394 billion and made up 78% of earnings.

This represents a digital net revenues CAGR of 16%. EA's Ultimate Team model is a significant driver of yearly digital revenues and has made the company over $7.9 billion in the last 8-year period from FY14 to FY21.

EA one of the top leaders in digital sales and monetization but it wasn't always like this. 10 years ago during the Xbox 360 and PS3 era the publisher relied heavily on packaged game sales. The company's live services ecosystem has dramatically evolved since then to become a billion-dollar force in the games industry rivaling heavy-hitters like Ubisoft and Take-Two and brushing up against Activision's whopping $7-8 billion revenues.

The publisher's game plan is now dominated by digital to the point where live services are more meaningful than actual game sales. Game purchases are now gateway points to the real earnings which are in-game purchases made across a years-long span. EA's annualized sports franchises in particular offer the best of both worlds serving as both vehicles for game sales and microtransactions.

The biggest contributors to digital earnings are titles like FIFA and Madden as well as Apex Legends which is on track to accrue $2 billion in revenues in two years on the market."

Definitely a garden. Maybe some chickens. More than anything the St. Louis Park apartment dweller wants to give her 14-year-old son the stability that comes with homeownership. But Stroder has realized that’s out of her reach with a median home price in the Twin Cities now topping $350000 and her income as an insurance underwriting assistant holding stagnant. Those “rose-colored glasses were lifted” she says. All of this was on the 42-year-old’s mind when she approached the microphone during a contentious public meeting in St. Louis Park early last year. The crowd had spent the first hour opposing a developer’s plan to build a 4-story 80-unit apartment building saying it would threaten their property values and bring crime into the Elmwood neighborhood. “There’s a monster being built in front of our cottages!” one woman exclaimed. “I will not risk my children for this kind of stuff” said another. Despite hecklers and a lot of “hatefulness” in the room Stroder said she felt compelled to speak up for people like herself who cannot afford the American dream of a single-family home. “I’m used to not being heard because of the fact that I’m a renter and I’m a Black woman and I do not make a lot of money not enough to afford a $400000 house in St. Louis Park” Stroder told the mostly white crowd. “Do I not deserve to be here because of that?” The opposition to multifamily housing — and to the people who need to live there — that Stroder ­witnessed that night stems in part from decades of local government land-use rules that prioritize single-family housing . Today however these rules are increasingly viewed as a major reason that Black and Latino families are essentially shut out of the vast majority of the Twin Cities. Multifamily housing Multiple housing units in the same building with shared walls and oftentimes shared common spaces. Typically this refers to buildings with four or more units. Single-family housing Single-family homes that don’t have a shared wall with the neighboring homes.

“Zoning is being used to regulate who can live in what communities” said Nelima Sitati Munene co-chair of the equity advisory committee of the Metropolitan Council a regional planning agency that promotes and helps finance higher density housing. “We could argue about what the intentions were until kingdom come but it doesn’t matter. What has this meant for the people who have been excluded all this time? And what has been the impact for the people who have benefited?” None of these zoning ordinances mention race but they perpetuate segregation that took root decades ago in an era of more racially explicit housing discrimination. Today they are seen as a major reason the Twin Cities has some of the nation’s worst disparities in income wealth and homeownership between white residents and people of color. Zoning Most cities townships and some counties have local ordinances that control how land can be used and zoning is usually part of a larger long-term plan for orderly growth and change. Typically in the United States zoning divides land into areas for residential commercial industrial or other uses and often has additional rules regarding lot and building size parking or secondary structures. In Minnesota and across the country a growing number of lawmakers city planners and advocates for racial equity and housing affordability are pushing cities to drop rules that restrict areas to only single-family housing. They say allowing a mix of housing types — such as duplexes triplexes or row houses — when properties are redeveloped would make those single-family neighborhoods accessible to a more diverse population and improve affordability for everyone. Middle housing This is a relatively new term that encompasses townhomes rowhomes duplexes triplexes or even some fourplexes. This is more dense than single-family housing but often less dense than multifamily housing. The Star Tribune’s zoning analysis includes mobile homes in this category as well. Minneapolis drew national attention in 2018 for being the first city in the nation to loosen single-family zoning rules it said were rooted in racist planning decisions of the past. The state of Oregon and cities such as Berkeley Sacramento and Charlotte have since adopted similar measures and officials in Connecticut California Atlanta and Seattle have also debated zoning reforms. President Biden is proposing a $5 billion competitive grant program to encourage cities to eliminate exclusionary zoning practices. At the Minnesota Capitol two lawmakers — a Republican and a Democrat — have introduced measures that would either encourage or require cities to allow higher density development. Even the most ardent advocates admit that zoning reform will not eliminate racial segregation or improve affordability on its own especially not soon enough to help the current generation. “I don’t think it’s a panacea” says Gary Cunningham a former Metropolitan Council member and longtime leading voice for racial equity in the Twin Cities. “It’s a step in the right direction but it’s not sufficient.” Minneapolis shows that change will be slow. Only 23 building permits have been issued for new duplexes or triplexes in places they would not have previously been allowed. Some of the fully developed first-ring suburbs are starting to follow Minneapolis’ lead but most suburban leaders believe that they can meet the needs of anyone who wants to live in their communities by zoning land for townhouses and apartment complexes especially along highways transit corridors and in commercial areas. On the fringe of the metro area where there is still land for development and single-family zoning typically makes up 90% or more of the residential land city leaders are reluctant to change the character of the cherished single-family neighborhoods. “People have come out here and expected a certain way of life regarding how much density we have and what it looks like” said Denny Walsh mayor of Orono. Unfounded fears abound that the kind of reform approved by Minneapolis would lead to bulldozing of single-family neighborhoods. Michael Lens an urban planning associate professor at University of California Los Angeles from St. Paul points out that upzoning does not require the addition of duplexes and triplexes but merely removes a long-standing prohibition and gives landowners more flexibility. “Ending single-family zoning doesn’t end single-family housing. And there’s no real reason why we prioritize single-family housing in such a way” Lens said. “You can’t have true integration of race and income without a variety of housing types.”

In 2007 Stroder and her then 1-year-old son moved from Cleveland to the Twin Cities after her best friend from college persuaded her to start a new chapter in her life. Her friend introduced her to pickled herring and took her out on a frozen lake for the first time. She fell in love with Minnesota. She has made a home for herself in a 1960s-era apartment complex in St. Louis Park where she has made friends with her neighbors and tends to the community garden as well as the flowers produce and herbs planted in containers on her patio. Her rent has gone up at least 40% in the past decade though making it even harder to save for a down payment on a home. Over the years Stroder would get excited when she saw a “For Sale” sign on a house in St. Louis Park thinking maybe that would be her dream home. Then she looked at the price. “People who live in rental housing here they love the city too” Stroder said in an interview earlier this year. “If they want that dream to own a home and plant more permanent roots here why isn’t it something you’re trying to make possible for them?” This is a question that St. Louis Park officials are wrestling with as well. They realized that the 19% of the city’s residents who are people of color are concentrated in the few areas that have apartments. “BIPOC (Black Indigenous and People of Color) folks have been segregated from more affluent neighborhoods because they haven’t been able to have more housing options in those neighborhoods” said Karen Barton St. Louis Park’s community development director. “That affects education health future incomes everything.” The Twin Cities metro has become more racially diverse during the past two decades but people of color especially Black and Latino disproportionately live in the relatively small areas zoned for multifamily housing according to a Star Tribune analysis. Nearly 25% of Black people live in these areas compared to 15% of Latino and 8% of white people. Homeownership data also show families of color are having a harder time getting into single-family neighborhoods. Just 25% of Black and 43% of Latino households own their home compared to about 74% of white households according to U.S. census data for the seven-county metro. Twin Cities has wide racial disparities in homeownership PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS IN EACH GROUP WHO OWN THEIR OWN HOME The gap between Black and white homeownership in Ramsey and Hennepin counties is the largest among metro areas in the nation and has widened in the past 20 years according to an Urban Institute report released in June. Single-family neighborhoods are viewed as “high opportunity” areas due to the relative lack of poverty which has been repeatedly shown in research studies to shape the trajectory of children in important ways. At the same time the homes generate wealth that can be passed to future generations feeding a cycle of prosperity that does not exist in neighborhoods with high concentrations of rental property said Cunningham who serves as CEO of Prosperity Now a nonprofit focused on closing the racial wealth divide. “Not everybody can live where they want to live” Cunningham said. “They are relegated to certain areas because that’s where the affordable housing is.” The United States is one of the only countries in the world that uses zoning to separate single-family homes from other housing types and race was on the minds of its designers said Jonathan Rothwell a senior research fellow at the Brookings Institution. In the early 1900s city planners — supported by federal housing authorities — wanted to protect all-white neighborhoods that had been created by racially explicit zoning after the Supreme Court ruled those laws unconstitutional. They realized that they could achieve the same goal by barring multifamily housing from those areas since most Black people at the time could not afford to buy a home. “The problem is that from the very beginning zoning has treated multifamily housing as akin to a pollutant” Rothwell said. “It was taken for granted that if you were a well-off or a white family your children were at risk if they were near a multifamily housing complex.”

Black and Latino residents more likely to live in areas zoned for multifamily Though there are exceptions in many Twin Cities suburbs the areas with concentrations of Black and Latino residents often overlap with areas near highways or where a developer doesn’t have to get special permission to build an apartment building.

The homes that Stroder has been pining for in St. Louis Park tell the story of how this kind of zoning shaped the Twin Cities’ suburbs. The small entry-level homes were built to solve a massive housing shortage and provide homes for returning World War II servicemen and their families. Financing was available through the GI Bill but Black veterans had difficulty getting approved. Thousands of these new homes built in the first-ring suburbs in the 1940s were also protected by racial covenants  snippets of text that developers included in property deeds prohibiting people of color from buying or occupying those properties. Racial covenants Restrictions that were inserted into property warranty deeds to prevent people of color from buying or occupying property. These were often just a few lines of text added to the deeds by real estate developers. Research by the Mapping Prejudice Project at the University of Minnesota found they were first used in Hennepin County in about 1910. The U.S. Supreme Court deemed the covenants unenforceable in 1948 however covenants remain connected to property deeds in the Twin Cities. The Just Deeds Project is working with homeowners and cities to remove the racial covenants. Use of racial covenants starting in 1910 had successfully divided Minneapolis and St. Paul into distinct Black and white neighborhoods that remain evident today according to data collected by the Mapping Prejudice Project at the University of Minnesota. As farmland turned to subdivisions covenants effectively created an invisible wall in the suburbs along Minneapolis’ borders. There were at least 2400 covenanted homes in St. Louis Park a city of just 22000 people by the time racial covenants were deemed unenforceable in 1948. These covenants worked hand-in-hand with real estate steering white intimidation and “redlining” — a government-backed effort that designated minority neighborhoods as being high-risk for mortgage lending — to maintain all-white neighborhoods and keep people of color out of homeownership. In 1952 a Black family that wanted “to live in the more open atmosphere of the country” was met with bribes and threats when they bought a home in what was then Minnetonka Township. Neighbors attempted to halt the purchase and gathered a protest meeting. A Minneapolis Star editorial about the neighbors’ concerns said “It wasn’t claimed for example that these people are irresponsible shiftless ill-behaved etc. Actually the man is a mail carrier a veteran of the last war and a good enough credit risk to satisfy a major city bank. But he’s a Negro.” In addition to racial covenants some of these subdivisions had other requirements that are common in modern zoning codes. For example Golden Valley’s West Tyrol Hills neighborhood when approved in 1938 mandated only single-family homes with a garage costing at least $7500 according to city planning commission meeting minutes. As the other more racially explicit forms of housing discrimination were outlawed single-family zoning came into widespread use by the 1950s. “Class prejudice and racial prejudice were so intertwined that when suburbs adopted such ordinances it was impossible to disentangle their motives and to prove that zoning rules violated constitutional prohibitions on race discrimination” Minneapolis-based public historian Denise Pike who researches racial housing discrimination said in a League of Minnesota Cities webinar last year on systemic racism in housing. “The basis of single-family zoning is so tied to racial exclusion and today still excludes people of color.” The suburbs along Minneapolis’ western border — Edina St. Louis Park Robbinsdale and Golden Valley — are artifacts of how single-family zoning perpetuated the segregation created by racial covenants. Those cities now average 18% people of color well below the 34% average for other first-ring cities according to a Star Tribune analysis of census data. All four have 80% or more of their residential land zoned for single-family well above the 60% average for other first-ring suburbs. “So much of why things happened the way it happened especially in the first-ring suburbs goes back to these racial implications with redlining and racial covenants. Single-family zoning replaced that as a tool to maintain the status quo” said Jason Zimmerman Golden Valley’s planning manager.

Even today proposals for denser development in or near single-family neighborhoods almost always face fierce opposition from nearby homeowners. The owner of an Apple Valley golf course pitched a plan in 2019 to convert the property to a mix of apartments townhouses and single-family homes. After several heated public meetings and opposition from planning commission members for that much density the city ultimately opted in December to rezone the land for what would be considered low to medium density with no more than 8 units per acre. The city is considering a new proposal for that land calling for about half that density with 49 townhouses and 27 villas which are small single-level homes. In Prior Lake last year neighbors objected to a proposal to build 67 townhouses and 27 single-family homes. The townhouses were expected to be priced around $360000 similar to an adjacent development. Nearby residents said it would bring too much traffic more car break-ins and unacceptable density. “If they do build townhomes what’s that going to do to our property value and our neighborhood? Because it is a beautiful family neighborhood” one resident of that adjacent development asked at a March 2020 planning commission meeting. “I was told I was in a single-family neighborhood.” The city’s planning commission rejected the plan because the proposed density of 4.2 units per acre exceeded the 4 units per acre allocated in the city’s land-use plan. The land owner scrapped the proposal. Prior Lake Mayor Kirt Briggs said his city wants the “diversity and vibrancy” that growth brings but the city needs to balance that with its ability to provide infrastructure like streets utilities and parks and that there’s only so much the city can do to provide housing that everyone can afford. “What we can’t legislate is what the sales price is going to be” Briggs said. Some leaders of suburbs that prioritize single-family homes say that character is the heart of their community and something that people strive for and want to protect. Lakeville Mayor Doug Anderson said older homes in the city provide affordable options for entry-level buyers and have helped diversify the city’s population which is about 17% people of color. “I think the dream of homeownership is alive and well” Anderson said. “Single-family homes clearly are the motivation for a lot of people.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNpdHkubnljLzIwMjEvMDgvMDgvZ293YW51cy1yZXpvbmluZy1jb3VsZC1tYWtlLW1vcmUtZGl2ZXJzZS1icm9va2x5bi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gowanus Could Become More Diverse After Rezoning Racial Impact Study Finds | THE CITY — NYC News,"Brooklyn’s Gowanus neighborhood would likely become more diverse and less segregated under a proposal to allow more development in the neighborhood according to a first-of-its-kind study on the contentious rezoning’s potential racial impact.

The analysis of the Gowanus Neighborhood Plan conducted by a Columbia University professor with City Council staff comes as the controversial proposal — previously delayed for months by a lawsuit — now makes its way through the city’s public review process.

The study also offers the first glimpse at the potential value of a Council bill passed just weeks ago requiring “racial equity reports on housing and opportunity” for rezonings in the future.

While that legislation will not take effect until mid-2022 and does not apply to the Gowanus plan those backing the rezoning thought it was best to study the issue anyway. Those supporters include area Councilmembers Brad Lander and Steven Levin as well as the local housing nonprofit Fifth Avenue Committee which helped fund the study.

“If our goal is a more inclusive neighborhood with meaningful opportunities for New Yorkers of color then we need to find the courage to move forward thoughtfully. And I really believe this provides clarity about that” Lander said of the new research.

The Gowanus plan aims to change development rules within an 82-block area along Fourth Avenue between Atlantic Avenue and 15th Street and stretching west to Bond and Smith streets.

The idea is to allow more residential construction in a neighborhood that has for decades been an industrial enclave centered on the toxic Gowanus Canal which was designated a federal Superfund site in 2010.

The “Racial Equity Report” produced by Columbia urban planning professor Lance Freeman concluded that the rezoning would likely cause Gowanus currently one of the whitest neighborhoods in the five boroughs to “much more closely match the diversity of New York City rather than the [current] population of the local area.”

That’s partly because under the zoning proposal the neighborhood could gain as many as 2950 housing units rented at below-market-rate prices through the city’s affordable housing lottery out of a total 8495 newly constructed apartments.

All but 380 of the lottery units will be set aside for households making no more than 80% of the area median income which comes to $85920 for a family of three.

The researchers analyzed the demographics of households eligible for those apartments as well as the racial makeup of previous affordable housing lotteries in majority white neighborhoods using data from an ongoing lawsuit over city policy to give “community preference” to lottery applicants already living in a neighborhood where new affordable housing is to be built.

Taking that all into account the report estimates that 20% to 25% of the new lottery apartments under the rezoning would be rented by Black households and 25% to 37% of them will be rented by Hispanic households

The neighborhood is currently one of only 10 districts in the city with more than 60% white residents.

Because of that the report’s authors recommended the city give preference for the lottery to “more diverse community districts” beyond just Gowanus” they said.

‘Low’ Displacement Risk Touted

Even with the new market-rate apartments the report found the neighborhood is set to become more diverse as measured by the “dissimilarity index” a measure of segregation that quantifies the distribution of people by race.

“For all nonwhite groups but especially Blacks and Latinos residential segregation from whites will decrease” the report said.

Gowanus is also a place where prices have risen so much already in the past 15 years or so there are few lower-income tenants to push out. Many low-income families who remain in the area live in “protected” housing such as rent-stabilized apartments and public housing.

“The risk of displacement by rising market-rate rents for Black and Latino families in the area is low” the report found.

“This is now a majority white upper-income community” said Michelle de la Uz executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee which is part of the development team for a 100% affordable housing complex Gowanus Green included in the rezoning plan. “It wasn’t a number of years ago when I moved into the area but it is now.”

Freeman of Columbia who led the research hopes the next administration sees the report “as a template” for New York’s big zoning projects in the future — especially because the city remains among the most segregated places in the country he said.

“It is important to consider racial equity when undertaking these types of large land use projects” he said. “Simply taking a race-neutral neutral approach is not always sufficient.”

Long-Due Analysis

Housing advocates have for years been pushing the type of analysis in the Gowanus report and the mindset behind it could lead to big change in the way New York expands.

“That we are now front and center talking about race as tied to rezonings and what their impacts are — and how we should be considering the racial impacts in a rezoning — is in and of itself a huge shift” said Barika Williams of the housing advocacy group Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development.

The change follows years of protests over rezonings that looked very different from the one in majority-white and wealthy Gowanus — an outlier in the recent history of neighborhood land use proposals.

Under the de Blasio administration all neighborhood-wide rezonings have taken place in “low-income communities of color” said Lander — East New York Far Rockaway East Harlem Inwood and the Jerome Avenue corridor in The Bronx.

Before that similar actions were taken during the Bloomberg years including along Fourth Avenue in Park Slope adjacent to the Gowanus rezoning area of today.

At the time Lander led the Fifth Avenue Committee a community development corporation founded in 1978. He said he remembers asking city officials “If we want to keep this a diverse neighborhood where are we doing that?”

“The answer was ‘nowhere.’ We didn’t do it anywhere. And there was no study and relatively little conversation” said Lander now the Democratic candidate for city comptroller.

More recently locals in Manhattan’s Inwood asked similar questions during that neighborhood’s controversial rezoning process held between 2015 and 2018.

Cheryl Pahaham an Inwood resident and member of local coalition Inwood Legal Action said people were losing leases being harassed by landlords or dealing with huge price increases. Black and Dominican families were hardest hit she said.

“The displacement was happening and we were afraid it would accelerate” she said.

Pahaham and others asked city officials to look at the rezoning’s potential impact on housing for locals of different races. But “the city just ignored it” she said. “They said they didn’t have to.”

Since then Inwood Legal Action has been part of a coalition — which included Public Advocate Jumaane Williams as a major backer — pushing to pass the recent City Council bill.

Pahaham does not consider the Gowanus report perfect. She is concerned with its conclusions about the rezoning’s potential impacts on local industrial jobs — displacing businesses that often employ Black and Latino people at higher rates than whites — and questions whether future affordable housing will realistically go to Black and Latino households given that higher-income tenants have better chances of winning the housing lottery.

Still she called it a report “done with integrity” and a good first step — that would have been very useful to her own community as they tried to negotiate with the city during their rezoning.

“It would have leveled the playing field. We would have had more honest conversations with our Councilman. And we could have together advocated for more deeply affordable housing” she said.

Next Steps

The Gowanus report has come late in the rezoning process which has been in the works for years and has already begun the formal Uniform Land Use Review Procedure or ULURP necessary to get a final green light.

Critics have questioned the environmental safety of the plan particularly the Gowanus Green project which will be built on a cleaned-up contaminated site once home to a gas plant.

They have also called for more units of affordable housing as well as apartments available to even lower-income families and pushed for the plan to address $274 million in needed repairs and maintenance at Gowanus’ two public housing complexes.

Some of those concerns appeared in a resolution from the Gowanus community board which approved the land use changes with conditions under ULURP in June.

Next mayoral hopeful Borough President Eric Adams must weigh in with an advisory opinion on the rezoning. Then it will go to the City Planning Commission City Council and mayor for final approval.

The Gowanus rezoning and a similar effort to rezone SoHo — also a majority white neighborhood — are major pieces of de Blasio’s final attempt to cement his legacy on land use rules and housing.

As the process moves forward in Brooklyn the report’s authors make a series of recommendations to “further advance racial equity” — a step beyond what would be required from racial equity reports under the City Council bill enacted recently.

The study calls for more efforts to preserve and maintain Gowanus’ public housing complexes lowering income levels on future affordable housing and investing more in workforce development services to make up for industrial and auto-related jobs the rezoning will likely displace.

De la Uz of the Fifth Avenue Committee believes there is still time to take those recommendations and “be more rigorous in what we request and demand of government” — especially on behalf of people who don’t yet live in Gowanus but could.

“Future people who are going to benefit from the affordable housing are often not a part of the conversation” she said. “I’m hoping the report literally brings those folks to mind.”",,,,,,,,,

Grace Elizabeth a Victoria’s Secret model who has sashayed the runways of Diane von Fürstenberg Michael Kors Ralph Lauren and Oscar de la Renta claims in court papers that cosmetic titan Revlon posted an image of her to the company’s Instagram and Facebook pages last year to promote its Skinlights Prismatic Bronzer according to her Manhattan Federal Court filing against the company.

In fact the 24-year-old Brooklynite was wearing make up from Marc Jacobs in the shot taken in January 2017 by Michael Schwartz for Vogue Mexico the model said in court papers.

“The shot was totally unrelated to advertising for Estee Lauder or Revlon. She is not wearing Revlon make-up” her attorney Edward Greenberg told The Post.

The model whose given name is Grace Elizabeth Harry Cabe had rejected an earlier offer to work for Revlon the lawyer said.

“No means no” Greenberg told The Post.

“Revlon used her image anyway” she charged in the litigation which says Revlon posted the Schwartz pic in April 2020 to “promote market and brand Revlon products.”

Elizabeth was not wearing Revlon makeup in the picture that the company used.

Cabe who boasts 1.3 million followers on Instagram has a bigger audience on the social media platform than Kate Moss former Revlon models Christy Turlington and Iman and 2018 Revlon catwalkers Imaan Hammam and Adwoa Aboah she said in the lawsuit.

Cabe has been featured on at least 38 magazine covers including Vogue in Brazil China Spain Germany Italy Japan Korea Mexico Paris Russia and Turkey according to the suit against Revlon which seeks unspecified damages.

A Revlon spokesperson downplayed the situation telling The Post: “Revlon mistakenly posted a single image of Ms. Elizabeth on social media. When we became aware of the mistake we quickly removed the image and we have sought to resolve this issue amicably and fairly with Ms. Elizabeth.”",,,,,,,,,

Abigail McMurray grew up in a home where it was OK to make a mess. Her mother a homemaker enjoyed woodworking and gardening and was always drawing or doodling. She encouraged her children to be inventive and try arts-and-crafts projects. Messy equaled creative.

INSIDE ARLINGTON:

Among our many-faceted residents

McMurray who lives in East Arlington grew up in Champaign-Urbana Ill. and now focuses on crisp clean lines and precision. She constructs both silhouettes and three-dimensional buildings out of heavy-stock paper making one-of-a-kind portraits of homes.

Last fall she was asked to show her work as a backdrop for the NBC-TV show “Making It” which is airing with her crafts decorating the set along with the work of other creators.

'Happiest hour'

“It’s the happiest hour on TV” McMurray says of the program that asks contestants to make crafts in a variety of challenges. She compares it to the pleasant vibe of “The Great British Baking Show” whose contests are often described as “nice.” Hosts Nick Offerman and Burlington native Amy Poehler who starred together in “Parks and Recreation” add a goofy flavor sometimes making silly crafts of their own.

McMurray shows her work on Etsy the online crafts marketplace as well as at crafts shows and her website. One of the judges on “Making It” works for Etsy and saw her work when she was a finalist in an Etsy contest. She provided the show with three pieces of her work including one she made of the barn where the show takes place.

When not making things for “Making It” McMurray is busy filling commissions from all over the country. She began working in paper as a child when she made origami. She majored in art at Bradley University in Illinois and later began making banners and kits so that people could make paper crafts of their own.

One day a friend asked whether she could construct a church out of paper for a pastor because the church was closing and the friend wanted to give him a memento. She did realizing “it might be something people would be interested in. They might like a house portrait out of paper.” She figured out a process and asked people on social media if they wanted portraits and got a positive response.

How she creates

She works from a photo tracing the picture and making the illustration on a computer. From the illustration she separates the parts and the pieces and layers figuring out how she’ll build it out of paper. She has a computerized cutting machine. “It’s kind of like a tiny Exacto knife that moves back and forth almost like a printer but is able to cut any shape.” Were she to cut by hand she says the result wouldn’t be photo-realistic.

The result is a three-dimensional portrait complete with dormers porches doors and windows. The most challenging was an Arlington Victorian complete with curlicues and intricate woodwork. She also makes silhouettes of houses a much quicker process.

She is also now focusing on maps places around the Boston area she calls “paper places” of well-known areas such as Lowell or Cambridge but will also do custom maps such as a favorite place on a lake or a vacation setting.

Communicating with paper's form

Paper continues to appeal to McMurray because “it’s accessible and it’s everywhere. If you learn to make something out of paper you can make it again and again . . . Everyone expects paper’s primary job is printed content. I’m communicating with the form of it instead of what’s on the surface which is usually printing.”

McMurray and her husband Brian moved to Arlington four years ago and are pleased that they are within walking distance of the shops and cafes of Arlington Center as well as a five-minute walk to the Mystic River. She has participated in the Arlington Center for the Arts' Open Studios held in Arlington each year and will be back this fall.

Meanwhile there’s a wait for the three dimensional portraits. “It’s painstaking work” she says. “The last time I took orders was at the very end of March. I’ll be taking orders again in the fall.”

She can produce silhouettes faster and can turn around orders fairly quickly. Thanks to social media and the internet orders come from as far away as Australia and as close as Arlington.

I remember giddily going through the logical twists and turns of “wait … I mean … it is synonym night? Or is it … not opposite not day?” and so on ad infinitum.

Today’s puzzle by Alex Eaton-Salners is packed with the same 8-year-old-discovering-puns energy but with an elegance that I definitely lacked in third grade. Throw in some fabulous long non-theme entries at 2D 3D 9D 33D and 34D and we have ourselves a downright (I mean acrosswrong?!) good time!

Tricky Clues

4A. “Not in any way in dialect” is the clue for NO HOW which calls to mind the phrase “not no way not NO HOW.” If you use substitution and swap the entry for the clue in that sentence to see if it’s a perfect replacement you get “not no way not in anyway” which I enjoy and might have to start saying.

Moore the former team chaplain at Georgia Tech hosted a reception for players the summer before Johnson’s freshman season at the school. Johnson was the first player to arrive and immediately began helping Moore set up for the party.

When the party ended Johnson stayed late and helped clean up. He put away chairs picked up garbage and before he left asked Moore what else he could do to help.

[ For Calvin Johnson 2021 Pro Football Hall of Fame induction 'like a dream come true' ]

“It was very evident that he had qualities and characteristics that were just really unusual for a kid that’s that young” Moore said. “Just mature beyond his years. And I thought that to be of great attention to me and man it just jumped off the pages and it lit me up like a Christmas tree.”

Johnson and Moore have been close since that day 15 years ago and on Sunday Moore will have the “extraordinary” honor of presenting Johnson for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

“You don’t really have the ability to capture it in words because if you attempt it you’re going to fail miserably” Moore said. “There are a handful of people in the world that stood on the summit of Everest. This is an Everest experience for me. And Calvin he’s admired and adored by so many family members friends owners and players and boy he could have closed his eyes and picked a number of people to do this and (in) his own heart and mind I know what he means to me and I know what I mean to him. And I think the selection of my doing this has everything to do with our experiences together.”

MITCH ALBOM:Calvin Johnson's Hall of Fame shine shouldn't be clouded by Lions spat

Johnson is fifth in order to give his enshrinement speech Sunday after Drew Pearson Tom Flores Peyton Manning and John Lynch and before Alan Faneca and Charles Woodson.

Johnson said he is not nervous to give the 8-minute speech he has been working to refine for months.

Moore spent several weeks working on his presentation too but he has limited duties Sunday: He taped his speech for ESPN cameras at his South Carolina home in early July.

“They got the final cut and edited version of it” Moore said. “I’ve not seen it so I’m not certain how long it’s going to air. … I would imagine the better part of 3 minutes probably. Two-and-a-half minutes 3 minutes. You’re still dealing with television. Those guys are so good at doing sort of post-editing work and have the thing down to a science that they nailed it.”

Moore said he wrote down a top 10 list of things he wanted to say about Johnson and built those themes around one word that will be prevalent in his presentation ""megáleio"" the Greek word for greatness.

HEAD OF THE CLASS:Calvin Johnson Charles Woodson lead Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2021

“You hear the word mega in there” Moore said a nod to Johnson’s “Megatron” nickname.

Johnson has not heard Moore’s speech — which will play on the video board at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium before Johnson takes the stage — but the two were able to share several experiences already this week including Friday when Moore presented Johnson with his gold jacket.

“I’ve had a lot of great experiences in my now 53 years on this earth” Moore said. “When you see me come up and slap me two times. You think about Calvin but you’ve got Peyton Manning and you’ve got Charles Woodson and all the other incredible previous Hall of Famers. Man what in the world am I doing there?”

A spin-off is when a business unit of an existing public company is separated and becomes its own public company. For example PayPal Holdings used to be a part of eBay until it was spun off in 2015. Spin-offs can be an interesting place to look for investment ideas because unlike IPOs they don't tend to attract a lot of attention or excitement.

Last year IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC -2.27%) spun off its online dating app Match Group which went on to perform well in its first year as a public company. Last month IAC gave investors another spin-off to chew on with video publishing platform Vimeo (VMEO 0.51%).

Given the success of Match Group should investors pay attention to Vimeo?

What exactly is Vimeo?

Many people are familiar with Vimeo as a sort of little brother to Alphabet's YouTube. This was true five years ago but Vimeo pivoted its business model in 2017 from serving as a viewing platform to operating as a software company helping businesses and creators edit and publish high-quality ad-free videos.

Vimeo still operates its viewing platform which counts over 200 million users but it also allows creators to upload edit and publish videos that push to other websites including TikTok YouTube and Twitter. Vimeo's value proposition is two-fold. First it makes the process of editing and publishing videos online easy by providing tools that anyone can use. For example Vimeo recently acquired a company that harnesses artificial intelligence to help users create quality product videos in just a few clicks. Second Vimeo provides its tools and platform at a very low cost compared to other available options. The combination of cheap and easy-to-use is very powerful.

Vimeo also serves larger enterprises with features including live streaming video on demand subscription management viewer analytics and developer APIs that allow endless customization. During the COVID-19 pandemic Vimeo added many enterprise customers to enable ""town halls"" for communications between employees within organizations.

Vimeo has a compelling suite of products and has benefited from the increased need for powerful video solutions in recent years. The company appears to be in the right space at the right time.

Why did IAC spin off Vimeo?

If Vimeo is so promising then why did IAC decide to spin the company off? Well buying businesses building them up and spinning them off is a game IAC tends to play. IAC was founded by legendary media investor Barry Diller and has a storied track record of running this playbook. IAC has been the force behind many well-known media companies including Expedia Match Group and Angi formerly Angie's list to name a few examples.

This is exactly what IAC has done with Vimeo. IAC acquired Vimeo in 2006 as part of a package deal with a few other internet properties. In 2017 Anjali Sud was promoted as CEO to take the company in a new direction. Sud led the company on its journey from serving as a media viewing platform to selling its software and publishing solutions to creators and enterprises over the past four years.

Under IAC's stewardship Vimeo has bolstered its offering by acquiring several companies including Livestream (for its live stream capabilities) VHX (for its video distribution platforms) and Magistro (for its video editing capabilities).

The combination of putting new management in place funding acquisitions and providing the company the room to grow has resulted in a spin-off worth over $8 billion. This has been a home run investment for IAC and has initiated a new chapter for Vimeo to pursue its own destiny as an independent company.

A long-term growth opportunity in video

The video medium has become a more prominent staple for consuming entertainment advertising and communicating with friends and co-workers. And this trend has only strengthened in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vimeo has carved out an interesting and valuable niche in this new video communication ecosystem. The market for its services continues to grow at a rapid rate and the company is poised to capture that opportunity. This makes Vimeo an interesting technology stock to watch for the long run.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Be it photos files or applications storage requirements continue to grow. Instead of keeping up with those demands by deleting precious files or photos (or miscellaneous documents you don't remember creating) investing in an external drive is a move you won't regret making.

Aside from keeping extra files safe you can also use an external drive as a backup for your laptop or phone or even for extending your Xbox Series X or PS5 game storage. Whatever your needs is for buying an external storage solution we've got a pick for you. Here are the best HDDs and SSDs on the market.

HDD vs. SSD

Why you can trust Laptop Mag Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

Hard drive disks (HDD) traditional spinning hard drives are a much more affordable storage option. They use moving magnetic disks to store data while read/write heads manipulate data as needed. Because all of the data storage is physical you get the classic whirring sound as it operates. They also tend to be the larger option because of the space the spinning discs require. Unfortunately all the moving parts leave the device vulnerable to internal damage and transfer speeds are slow by today's standards.

Solid-state drives (SSD) on the other hand use an integrated circuit known as a microchip to store data. This means that they use electric pulses instead of moving parts to read write and store data. Without the need for moving parts SSDs process data much faster and can be built on a much more compact scale.

Why choose an HDD over an SSD?

Typically SSDs are the better choice for performance and portability. However this doesn’t always mean that they’ll be the right choice for you. While SSDs are becoming more affordable as they grow in popularity HDDs are a still much more affordable solution if you’re looking to store more “static” data. So if you’re just looking to store files such as documents photos and other files that aren’t needed on a day-to-day basis an HDD could be the perfect solution for you.

The WD My Passport Ultra HDD is a classic and affordable choice of an external hard drive that costs just $79. It’s a compact stylish storage solution for anyone looking to keep their essential photos or files within easy reach of their home setup but it's not great for traveling given the large design that lacks shock absorption. While it isn’t the most speedy solution offering top speeds of 115MB/s it’s reliable enough for storing large files.

3. Samsung T7 Touch Portable SSD The most secure external SSD Specifications Capacity: 500GB 1TB 2TB Interface: USB 3.2 Type-C Size: ‎3.4 x 2.2 x 0.3 inches Weight: 6.4 ounces Transfer Speed: Up to 1000 MB/s Color Options: Black Silver Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Reasons to buy + AES 256-bit encryption + Unlock with fingerprint OR password + Stylish design Reasons to avoid - Expensive - No water or dust resistance

Keeping information secure is the Samsung T7 Touch’s specialty. Whether you want to use it for personal or professional use the AES 256-bit encryption will keep your files private while a built-in fingerprint scanner provides quick access to your files. Keep in mind that software is required to set up the security features initially. After that it's relatively software-free. Aside from that the stylish brushed aluminum build also provides extra protection from impacts if dropped up to 6 feet which adds another layer of security to your device. However at $109 for 500GB of storage it does stray a little out of the budget-friendly ideal.

The LaCie rugged SSD Pro has you covered with 2TB storage speeds of up to 2800 MB/s and a build that’s both drop-resistant up to 3 meters and has an IP67 water-resistant rating. However $739 is a pretty penny to pay for 2TB of data and should really only be considered by those who can truly take advantage of its industry-leading high speeds and extra ruggedized protection.

After joining the PGA Tour in 2018 the 30-year-old entered the World Golf Championships-FedEx St. Jude Invitational with four runner-up finishes.

But on Sunday Ancer finally had his breakthrough moment.

On the second hole of a three-man playoff at TPC Southwind in Memphis he sank a 6-foot birdie putt to claim his first victory on Tour.

In the 121st start of his PGA Tour career he bested Hideki Matsuyama and Sam Burns who both narrowly missed birdie putts that would’ve sent the playoff to a third hole.

GIANNOTTO:The final round of the final WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational was a rollicking good time

“You never know; golf is crazy” Ancer said during the TV broadcast after the tournament. “It’s surreal.”

His victory came in the wake of a sudden and dramatic collapse from Harris English who made the turn at the final round Sunday with a three-stroke lead.

Cool calm and seemingly unflappable since storming out of the gate in Thursday's first round – with seven birdies on the first nine holes – English was poised for a wire-to-wire win and set to become the first on Tour this season with three victories.

Then disaster struck. Two double bogeys in a four-hole span and a bogey two holes after that English’s breakdown helped pave the way for the playoff.

Ancer Burns and Matsuyama each finished at 16-under-par 264 – one stroke ahead of English who won the FedEx St. Jude Classic in 2013.

English was paired with Bryson DeChambeau on Sunday. He said they were warned by officials that they were taking too much time on the front nine which forced him out of his usual rhythm.

""You definitely start the day in one rhythm and then you kind of get out of that having to walk faster having to do everything a little faster because you don't want to get a bad time"" English said. ""It was tough. The wind was swirling obviously coming down the stretch. There was some very important shots in there and it was tough. But I've got to learn to slow down go through my routine and not really worry about being put on the clock.""

Ancer’s round ended only minutes before the playoff began while Burns and Matsuyama had to stick around a while once their regulation performances were final. Burns and Matsuyama put themselves in the improbable position to get back on the course with stellar Sundays. Burns came into the final round tied for 11th eight strokes off the lead. Matsuyama was tied for 14th at 9-under and Ancer began the day in fourth – four strokes behind English – and shot 2-under 68 in the final round.

Burns overcame a double bogey carding a six on No. 13 by registering eight birdies for a 64 tied for the second-best score of the day.

Matsuyama did him one better in regulation with a bogey-free round (his first of the tournament) that was highlighted by seven birdies. The only birdie putt longer than 11 feet was a 23-footer on No. 14 which saw just eight birdies on Sunday.

The highlight of Ancer's Sunday before the playoff was a nearly 12-foot putt for birdie on No. 3. It was one of just three birdies he made to go along with one bogey.

The first run on No. 18 in the playoff saw all three par the hole. Matsuyama's 26-foot try for birdie lipped out leaving him with a 1-footer for par. The second time through the 18th Matsuyama missed a 20-foot birdie attempt. It was followed by Ancer's make and Burns' miss from 8 feet that also lipped out giving Ancer the win.

""It's tough to lose in a playoff but I didn't – I wasn't able to hit the fairway with either tee shot but I did my best"" Matsuyama said. ""I want to congratulate Abraham. He played great all week.""

But it was Ancer's approach shot on the second playoff hole that turned out to be the turning point. From the intermediate rough just to the right of the fairway he set himself up for a 6-foot putt with a 148-yard dagger.

“I told (caddie) Benjie (Thompson) on my second shot here ‘Hey we need to go get this’” he said. “’I’m gonna pretty much go right at her – just a little right so it just kind of funnels in.’ The shot played perfectly in my mind and it came out exactly how I pictured it.

“I thought I left so many shots out there on the back nine but you never know. There will be some times where I felt like I made enough birdies to win and I don’t win. So it’s just kind of how it goes. I’m happy I got lucky.”

After finishing at 16 under and beating Hideki Matsuyama and Sam Burns in a two-hole playoff at the 2021 WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational in Memphis that case can no longer be made.

Ancer was not immense for most of the the final round at TPC Southwind. He was good not spectacular shooting a nice 68 that should have netted him yet another top 10 which would have been his 10th in the last two years. However the final pairing of Harris English and Bryson DeChambeau wilted over the last nine holes -- they shot a combined 81 on the back nine -- and a surprised Ancer found himself in a playoff for his first career win despite trailing English by five heading into the back nine.

After three pars at the first playoff hole Ancer stuck his approach on the second and look like a sure thing to cash his first victory. Then Burns dropped his approach inside of Ancer and the ending got ambiguous. However after Ancer buried his 6-footer for birdie Burns missed his putt and Ancer's reward was (by far) the biggest win of his professional career.

There have been close calls over the course of his 121 PGA Tour starts. Four solo runner-up finishes in the last three years. A sweet run at the 2020 Masters. A T8 at this year's PGA Championship. Enough near-misses that it seemed inevitable that victory was imminent. Victories are never as close as they appear though and Ancer getting his first at a WGC event right before the 2021 FedEx Cup Playoffs is a huge deal.

That Ancer made his putt and Burns missed his on Sunday does not change how Ancer should be perceived. He's the same golfer now that he was at the beginning of the week. But because so much of professional golf is exclusively evaluated based on wins and losses it's nice that Ancer has a tally mark in that column now. He's no longer the best player on the PGA Tour with no wins. Given his game and his level of play over the last few years and the fact that he'll move into the top 20 in the world on Monday morning he might soon be the best player on tour with just one.

Here are the rest of our grades for the 2021 WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational.

T2. Hideki Matsuyama (-16): Matsuyama has had an amazing year month and now week. After winning the Masters in April and nearly medaling last week at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Matsuyama entered Saturday's third round T30 in this field before shooting nine-hole scores of 31-33-32-31 and basically not missing a shot for two straight days. He nipped the right edge from 18 feet on the first playoff hole and it easily could have fallen which may have made him the frontrunner for PGA Tour Player of the Year. Regardless it's great to see a locked-in Matsuyama having the season he's having with three huge playoff events on deck. Grade: A+

4. Harris English (-15): It seemed unfathomable at the turn -- with English at 20 under playing partner Bryson DeChambeau at 18 under and nobody else better than 16 under -- that there would eventually be a playoff and English would not be in it. But he hit both par-3 tee shots on the back nine in the water and shot 40 on that side. He said things were literally moving quickly. With a chance to secure his Ryder Cup spot move into the top spot for the FedEx Cup Playoffs and possibly even become the frontrunner for PGA Tour Player of the Year he faltered. English said officials told his pairing to speed play up  which threw off the rhythm he'd clearly found for the first 85% of the week.

""We were warned on the front nine kind of got behind felt like we were running pretty much the whole round and that really caught up"" said English. ""So you're having to run between the green and the tee and it's hard for me to slow down. I rushed that shot. I really wasn't ready for it and bad result but you've got to learn from it you've got to pick up and had a chance on 18 to get it done but it is what it is."" Grade: A

T8. Bryson DeChambeau (-12): For the second consecutive event DeChambeau legitimately had a chance to win on the back nine but failed to break 40. At the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines in June he shot 44 on the back nine and this one was not a lot better. DeChambeau bogeyed the last hole to shoot 41 and fall way out of even vying for the playoff over his last few holes. The whole thing is incredibly perplexing especially considering how well he and English had been playing. They played the first 63 holes in 38 under and the last nine in 11 over. It's easy to just point to the tee-to-green play but there has to be something at least affecting him mentally. DeChambeau has been a terrific closer over the course of his career but he looked absolutely lost on Sunday in Memphis. Grade: A-"

In June the Cincinnati-based supermarket chain launched a hiring campaign to add 10000 workers nationwide including 1000 targeted for its hometown.

So far Kroger indicates it's about halfway noting it made 5000 job offers to individuals who participated in a one-day hiring event in June that occurred at stores and digitally.

Kroger officials said they are still hiring but did not update their overall headcount. They added competition for workers is part of the reason the grocer has boosted wages and is raising them again this year.

Pay keeps rising but Kroger still can't find enough workers

""We know talent is selective"" Tim Massa Kroger’s chief people officer told The Enquirer in an email. ""We continue to improve every day and...are truly driven to be the best employer in the Greater Cincinnati region and one of the best places to work no matter your skill set role or ambitions.""

This spring Kroger said it would raise average worker pay to $16 per hour excluding benefits. The grocer said it spent $300 million in 2020 to boost regular wages to its associates which averaged $15.50 per hour before benefits.

Massa noted the average Kroger worker in Greater Cincinnati will ultimately get almost $20 per hour before benefits under a new five-year contract ratified earlier this year.

The labor squeeze comes as Kroger has big plans here and across the country: this spring the grocer opened the first of 20 planned robotic warehouses that are critical to its plans to ramp up its home delivery business. The new facility in Monroe a northern suburb of Cincinnati will ultimately employ 400 workers – many of them delivery drivers who will start at $19 per hour.

Beginning in the spring of 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic sent shock wages to Kroger and its workforce.

Already one of the world's largest private employers (four times the headcount of Cincinnati-based consumer titan Procter & Gamble) Kroger's stores were slammed with extra business as restaurants closed or cut back service and shoppers cooked more meals at home. Consumers also hoarded items like toilet paper.

Kroger's total sales surged 8.4% to $132.5 billion in 2020 helping to drive profits to $2.6 billion for the year up 5.6%.

Branded ""essential workers"" Kroger grocery associates were awarded a series of one-time ""hero pay"" bonuses in the early weeks of the pandemic that its largest union United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) said should have continued as the health crisis stretched into months.

In 2020 Kroger hired an eye-popping additional 100000 workers to handle the surge in extra demand. Most of those hires wound up being temporary as workers quit to resume their previous jobs in other sectors.

""Kroger has literally made billions in pandemic profits off the sacrifices of grocery workers in Seattle and across the country"" said UFCW president Marc Perrone earlier this year.

Kroger currently employs 465000 nationwide (more than 18000 in Greater Cincinnati) up from 30000 from last year prior to the pandemic.

Kroger and grocers are hardly alone several industries are struggling to hire workers some of who are hesitant to return to the workforce amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Local restaurateur John Lanni the co-founder and owner of Cincinnati restaurant group Thunderdome Restaurant Group even peppered President Joe Biden about the nation's worker shortage when he visited Cincinnati last month.

Besides Kroger stores the grocer operates several regional supermarket chains in 35 states including Fred Meyer Harris Teeter Ralphs Mariano's Fry's Smith's King Soopers QFC and others. The company has nearly 2800 stores.

Some of us have fond memories of riding along in the back seat of a car at night pausing and unpausing the game as the street lights overhead briefly give enough light to see the unlit display. The availability of third party IPS displays for these classic handhelds has largely eradicated this problem today but as you might expect the increased power requirements of the more modern screen reduces the system’s runtime.

As part of their examination into energy production the [Houston Museum of Natural Science] set out to see if they could improve things by adding a solar panel to the back of a Game Boy Pocket that had already been modified with an IPS display. The Pocket version of the Game Boy was selected as it has a nice flat back that made it easy to attach a solar panel and in fact the panel sourced for this mod is so well dimensioned it almost looks like the device came that way.

In the video below you can see the modification starts by cutting away a large section of the Game Boy’s rear panel to fit the 1000 mAh LiPo battery. The solar panel is then affixed over the back with super glue. A diode is soldered onto the solar cell and then wired into a charge controller that came with USB-C input. The placement of the charge controller ended up being trickier than expected but with a little hot glue it works just fine. Overall this is a simple mod but a brilliant idea.

This isn’t the first solar-powered handheld game system we’ve seen but it’s nice to see the idea revisited and expanded on particularly regarding ergonomics. In addition we love the incredible detail of narration that’s given as this hack slowly takes shape. Video after the break.

""We tend to refer to them as our decorative solar panels. They're just not turned on"" said Oren Friedman whose solar panels were installed months ago.

Friedman is passionate about saving the environment from LED light bulbs in the home to solar powered landscape lights outside and his electric vehicle in the driveway all powered by renewable energy. However the homeowner isn't yet generating the cost-savings he'd hoped when he had the panel installed.

""I look at the meter and I can see that we're just consuming a lot of power from the grid right now"" Friedman said.

Friedman signed a contract last summer with Sun Power to install solar panels on his roof. The job was finally completed in late March. He hadn't expected to wait five months for the installation but he says it was still a great moment.

""When the solar company first hooked them up you could actually see the meter going backwards. It was one of the coolest things ever. We were producing more electricity than the house was making"" Friedman said. ""They immediately had to flip a switch and turn them off. We're not allowed to use them until LADWP gives the green light.""

Without a permit to operate solar from Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the panels cannot be activated. Friedman said he's not alone.

""A good friend of mine his panels were installed over six months ago. He has still heard nothing from LADWP"" Friedman said.

At the outset Sun Power predicted a nine-week wait before Friedman's solar panels would be powering his home. Yet nearly nine months after signing the company's contract his DWP bill is as high as ever.

""It almost approached $2000"" Friedman said.

Sun Power told him the problem is the fault of DWP calling them ""the slowest of every utility we deal with.""

After CBSLA contacted LADWP to ask why the permit wasn't forthcoming the department issued it some two later.

While Sun Power blamed DWP the utility company told Friedman the delay was due to a problem with Sun Power's meter installation.

""We get all these announcements to please try to cut down on electricity in the summer. Obviously we all know that we're in a global crisis and here we are trying to do our part"" Friedman said. ""You would think that the power company which has all the issues of not being able to provide enough power with the grid dealing with wildfires talking about having to potentially do brown-outs that it'd be in their interest to try to turn it on.""

For its part Sun Power released the following statement:

""...there are currently a number of steps and stakeholders involved in the journey from purchase to activation. Solar customers sometimes experience installation delays due to external factors...Sun Power is not involved in the process of installing electricity meters and we work closely with our partners to avoid delays.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vc2V0dGluZ21pbmQuY29tL2l0cy10aW1lLXRvLXdlYXItc29saW9zLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyZWQtd2F0Y2hlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's Time to Wear Solios' Sustainable Solar-Powered Watches,"Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

The climate movement has given rise to a variety of eco-friendly fashion and accessories trends shining a light on innovative technologies and processes rooted in sustainability.

One such trend is that of solar-powered accessories such as watches. Solar-powered watches typically have panels that absorb sunlight before converting it into energy to power the watch. Though the first solar-powered watch dates back to the 1970s these environmentally mindful accessories have experienced a major boost in popularity in the last few years.

One brand leading the charge for solar-powered watches is Montreal-based Solios.

Since being founded in 2018 by Samuel Leroux and Alexandre Desabrais Solios has quickly made a name for itself thanks to its chic solar-powered watch styles for men and women.

Solios’ watches are conceived with everyday wear in mind and are intended to take the wearer from day to night with ease. Featuring a thin and sleek design their watches are so lightweight you’ll forget you’re even wearing one.

Further sustainability is at the core of everything Solios does. The Canadian brand is certified B Corp the first watch company in the world to earn this certification. They are committed to crafting quality innovative accessories with the environment in mind.

In fact since its inception Solios has had just one mission: to create a sustainable accessory with a flawless build. And it’s safe to say they’ve achieved just that.

Every single component of their solar watches was designed consciously. For example watches are made of durable eco-friendly materials to promote longevity. Such materials include certified recycled stainless steel casing recycled plastic (for the very small amount of plastic that is required in their quartz watches) and an anti-scratch sapphire coating to prevent scratches to the watch face.

The various strap options are also sustainable like their Eco Vegan Leather which is a silicone-based leather free from PU and PVC that features a cork inlay (rather than the traditional rubber). Another option includes a 316L stainless steel mesh bracelet that is not only adjustable but is made with a special metal colouration that is five to eight times more durable than typical metal colouring and is free from chemical waste.

Of course even without these additional features Solios’ watches would still be sustainable owing to the fact that they use solar technology. Traditional battery-powered watches have a lifespan of roughly two years at which point they become trash.

However this situation can easily be avoided using solar technology that has the same capacity as approximately 20 batteries. According to Solios if every watch brand switched to solar-powered technology it would prevent up to 300 million toxic batteries from ending up in a landfill.

The solar technology that Solios uses is clean renewable and a symbol of the future. Their watches feature a solar cell and power cell concealed behind the dial. How it works is when light beams hit the watch’s solar cell it recharges the power cell otherwise known as the watch’s energy storage unit which has a 6-month power reserve.

Even better all Solios watches require just two hours of exposure to light to completely charge the power cell. And it doesn’t even have to be natural sunlight the power cell can also be charged via exposure to indoor artificial lights.

Solios’ sustainability model extends beyond their best-selling products. All packaging is plastic-free and made of recycled paper that is also fully recyclable.

As further proof of their environmental commitments Solios is partnered with the Rainforest Trust to help with the mission of protecting endangered rainforest lands. 1% of each watch sold is donated by Solios to the global organization each year. 1% of each watch sold protects an acre of rainforest.

Solios’ collection of luxury timepieces are available on their website. The brand ships worldwide and prices start at $335 CAD ($260 USD).

Leading stock indexes extended last week’s rally and set new records. The S&P 500 index added around 20 points during the week while the Dow Jones Industrial Average stayed above the 35000-mark.

Earlier professional services provider Accenture expanded its portfolio further by adding IT consulting firm LEXTA to its fold. Meanwhile the bidding war for Veoneer reached the next level after chipmaker Qualcomm offered a whopping $4.6 billion for the Swedish auto parts company outbidding closest contender Magna International.

Foot Locker expanded its foothold in the Asia-Pacific and North America with the acquisition of Atmos brand owner Text Trading Company and footwear retailer Eurostar respectively. In another deal involving leading apparel brands Levi Strauss agreed to acquire the active-wear brand Beyond Yoga.

Thriving on the sharp increase in online content consumption thanks to the virus-induced shutdown Take-Two Interactive Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts reported robust second-quarter numbers early in the week – the first two game publishers on Monday and Tuesday respectively and the third one on Wednesday.

As usual Chinese eCommerce giant Alibaba made an impressive show posting stronger-than-expected results on Tuesday. It was joined by sportswear maker Under Armour in the pre-market.

The main events that elicited investor interest on Wednesday were the quarterly releases of CVS Health General Motors and streaming platform Roku. Dropbox Virgin Galactic and Beyond Meat unveiled their second-quarter data on Thursday.

The second-quarter earnings release of AMC Entertainment which created a buzz recently after the stock price shot up in a social media-driven buying spree is due on August 9. The financial reports of Tyson Foods and software firm Trade Desk are on tap before the opening bell. The next day Chesapeake Energy Corp. and cybersecurity firm McAfee will be reporting after the market’s close.

Vacation rental company Airbnb and Chinese tech firm Baidu are probably the only other major companies to report earnings in the relatively quiet week.

If you weren't one of the 20000-plus fans in the stands Sunday here's what you missed at practice:

Rain delay

A shelter in place order was issued by the team due to inclement weather just before practice was scheduled to start. Fans were instructed to move inside to the concourse area as heavy rain and lightning moved into the area.

The 12 p.m. practice was delayed for about 45 minutes until the weather cleared but that didn't stop the die hard Browns fans who stuck it out through the soggy conditions to watch their favorite players take the field.

Welcome back fans

After the shelter in place order was lifted fans flooded the stadium and as practice started were greeted with a message from both head coach Kevin Stefanski and quarterback Baker Mayfield.

""It is great to have you back in our house"" Stefanski said.

""We've been working we got a new team we're ready to roll"" Mayfield said. ""These guys are ready to rock for you guys. We're in this together Cleveland.

Baker Mayfield contract talks

While the Browns recently inked a contract extension with running back Nick Chubb Baker Mayfield's negotiations continue.

But as much as getting a long-term high-dollar deal is something any player aims for that isn't a priority for Mayfield right now who is letting his agent and the team worry about that while he focuses on winning games.

Conversations have erupted over Mayfield's contract and what it may look like after the Buffalo Bills gave their quarterback Josh Allen a six-year extension worth $258 million. With Allen's deal coming before the season many have wondered when Mayfield's might be complete.

But Mayfield said whether or not a deal gets done before the season starts or after he just wants to win Week 1 against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sept. 12.

""I'm not doing the negotiations so frankly I don't give a damn. I'm focused on winning Week 1 then go on to Week 2 and focus on that week. One week at a time—that's my mindset so no matter how many times I get asked this question throughout the year it's going to be the same answer because that's just the truth.""

Dungy was in the area for the Pro Football Hall of Fame inductions this weekend in Canton.

“I met Coach Dungy through (Bills defensive coordinator) Leslie Frazier years ago” Stefanski told reporters in his media session following practice. “Obviously he’s a Hall of Fame coach but he’s a Hall of Fame person. He has been very supportive of me and we have stayed in touch.

“I made sure if he was in town for the festivities down there I wanted him to come over and visit the team. I got to spend some time with him before practice and then he shared some words with the team. It was outstanding.”

The Browns are expected to make the playoffs for the second straight season. It will be a huge disappointment if they regress from finishing 11-5 last year. But Dungy’s message to the team was it will take more than talent to achieve their goal.

“Everybody you hear from you hear great things about him” Baker Mayfield said in his post-practice interview. “I got a chance to talk to him before practice and then his message to the team afterwards it’s not about talent and it’s not about bringing extra guys in. It’s about not being outworked doing your job and doing it at a very very high level. It is just a great message from somebody like that who has done it before.”

Dungy was was 139-69 as a head coach of the Buccaneers and Colts over 13 years. He coached the Colts to the Super Bowl championship in the 2006 season.

Amped up

The Browns seemed to have extra pep during practice at FirstEnergy Stadium. Credit goes to the estimated 27000 watching according to Stefanski.

“We track the intensity at practice via the GPS” Stefanski said. “It’s amazing when you’re in the stadium or the lights are on for a night practice and you have fans. All of a sudden guys are running faster and they’re running longer and the intensity picks up. Not surprised by that. Again just kudos to our fans for coming out in mass.”

Rain and lightning delayed the start of practice but not the enthusiasm of the fans.

Austin Hooper and Stephen Carlson didn't fare nearly as well as David Njoku and Harrison Bryant.

Hooper dropped three passes: one in 11 on 11 one in seven on seven and one in an 11-on-11 two-minute drill that cost the No. 1 offense a first down. The drive by quarterback Baker Mayfield and Co. fizzled. Later the first unit's second attempt at the two-minute drill went nowhere — Mayfield threw four incomplete passes out of bounds.

The Browns are counting on Hooper a two-time Pro Bowler with the Atlanta Falcons to be a reliable starter after signing him last year to a four-year $42 million contract.

On the bright side Njoku caught a 1-yard touchdown pass over safety Jovante Moffatt on a jump ball from backup quarterback Case Keenum on the last play of practice. In the second-team offense's other shot at the two-minute Bryant caught a 29-yard TD pass from Keenum in the back of the end zone over Moffatt.

Earlier in practice Njoku got a chance to do his ""Chief Slam"" celebration after catching a TD pass of about 21 yards from Mayfield. And Bryant jumped in the back of the end zone to grab a TD pass over rookie safety Richard LeCounte III on a pass from Keenum in 11 on 11.

Fourth on the depth chart Carlson dropped a would-be TD pass in the end zone from third-string quarterback Kyle Lauletta in 11 on 11.

Cleveland Browns fans show up outlast rain

The start of practice was delayed for about 45 minutes due to heavy rain and lightning pushing it back to 12:45 p.m. but plenty of fans stuck around and filled most of the stadium's lower bowl and club level.

All-Pro defensive end Myles Garrett ran onto the field before the rest of the team and motioned to the fans to get fired up.

A couple of minutes later coach Kevin Stefanski and Mayfield used a microphone to address the crowd. The Browns estimated about 27000 fans were in attendance. Last season capacity was limited to 6000 people and later 12000 due to COVID-19 restrictions.

""It is great to have you back in our house"" Stefanski said. ""Great to see all the families all the kids out here today. Thank you for being here.""

Then Stefanski passed the mic to Mayfield.

""It is great to see everybody here"" Mayfield said. ""I don't know anybody else in the country that would have this many fans here for a practice so we appreciate you guys more than you know. We've been working. We've got a new team. We're ready to roll. We're setting a new standard and these guys are ready to rock for you guys. We're in this together Cleveland.""

After practice Stefanski said he thought the energy was good.

""We track the intensity of practice via the GPS and it's amazing when you're in the stadium or the lights are on for a night practice and you've got fans"" Stefanski said. ""All of a sudden guys are running faster they're running longer the intensity picks up. Not surprised by that. Kudos to our fans.""

Cleveland Browns' Grant Delpit sitting out with hamstring injury

Safety Grant Delpit remained idle for the fifth consecutive practice. He's coming back from the ruptured Achilles tendon he suffered Aug. 24 but Stefanski revealed a hamstring injury is keeping him out now. A 2020 second-round draft pick Delpit missed his entire rookie season.

Cornerback Denzel Ward missed his second consecutive practice and worked out on the side of the field early in the session. Stefanski said it was a ""normal rest"" day for Ward.

Other players who didn't practice but worked out beside the field were linebackers Anthony Walker Jr. (knee) and Montrel Meander (hamstring) wide receivers Anthony Schwartz (hamstring) and Alexander Hollins (hamstring) and safety Ronnie Harrison Jr. (hamstring).

Defensive end Takk McKinley (excused absence for personal reasons) Sheldrick Redwine (ankle) and Tony Fields II (foot) were not on the field.

Receiver Odell Beckham Jr. right tackle Jack Conklin and defensive tackle Malik Jackson returned to practice after sitting out Saturday. Beckham was still limited to individual drills.

About an hour into practice defensive tackle Malik McDowell left the field with an oblique injury.

Rashard Higgins' red-carpet walk among Cleveland Browns highlights

• Receiver Rashard Higgins had a diving TD catch against the coverage of cornerback Greedy Williams in a seven-on-seven drill. Keenum threw the pass on a go route. After finishing the play ""Hollywood"" Higgins executed his red carpet-walk TD celebration while Njoku and Mayfield pretended to photograph him.

• Donovan Peoples-Jones finished a one-on-one drill pitting receivers against defensive backs by catching a TD pass. The DBs lost and had to do push-ups.

• Incumbent kicker Cody Parkey went 3-for-4 during a team field-goal period missing his final attempt from 49 yards wide left. Chase McLaughlin made all four of his attempts.

Cleveland Browns training camp schedule

The players are off Monday. The next practice is slated to begin at 2:25 p.m. Tuesday at CrossCountry Mortgage Campus in Berea.

But he clearly loves to see people try.

Barely five seconds after stepping on stage at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee for a 65-minute set Saturday the controversial comedian and host of the hugely popular podcast ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" was yelling about being ""canceled yesterday"" as if it was a point of pride.

Rogan didn't talk specifics about the latest scandal — on Friday's podcast he criticized vaccine passports suggesting they'd bring the country closer to a dictatorship. But Saturday night he addressed the backlash to his suggestion on an April episode that young healthy people didn't need to get the COVID-19 vaccine including criticism from Prince Harry.

That prompted Rogan — who claimed Saturday he was high and in his underwear at the time he saw Harry's comments reported on CNN — to comically fantasize about taking mushrooms with the royal.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

""I say dumb (expletive)"" Rogan said Saturday in the closest he came to a mea culpa. ""If you're getting vaccine advice from me is that really my fault?""

Critics suggest Rogan should be more responsible with his platform. But Rogan doesn't listen to critics. He doesn't apologize. He never holds himself accountable and dismisses anyone who tries to make him. He says whatever he wants on his podcast with whoever he wants whether it's Bernie Sanders or InfoWars' Alex Jones.

And it's made him incredibly successful. The former ""Fear Factor"" host and ""NewsRadio"" cast member (and ongoing UFC commentator) is headlining arenas albeit just the lower bowl at Fiserv Forum Saturday and hosts the most listened-to podcast in the United States according to Edison Research. It's why Spotify offered him a deal reportedly worth over $100 million.

So why would Rogan tarnish his brand and risk his fortune by being thoughtful? As he suggested Saturday he's too old to be woke.

Instead he complained about cancel culture and for a moment Saturday expressed genuine concern about what this age of social media-fueled criticism might mean for comedy.

That's a topic ripe for smart skewering in 2021 but Rogan who again Saturday proclaimed himself an idiot isn't the man for the job nor is that the man his fan base wants him to be.

Instead he thumbed his nose at political correctness with tasteless jokes.

He tried to balance the offensiveness with some progressive talking points — discussing the unfair double standards regarding sexual histories for women compared with men for instance.

There was an occasional disclosure to make it clear he didn't really mean what he was saying — he supported the gay community he suggested Saturday before dropping homophobic jokes.

And some jokes at his own expense — recounting a degrading TSA experience or sharing the stupid thoughts that ran through his head as he talked to a smarter person like Elon Musk — sought to make him more endearing and relatable.

But too often Rogan opted to be provocative for the sake of being provocative. He made nasty Nazi jokes belittled WNBA players used the appalling ""R"" word over and over again.

Was he sticking it to the culture police? I guess. Were people laughing? Sure.

But the shock tactics were easy and cheap and ultimately dull.

And whether Rogan cares to recognize it or not there could be consequences.

There was a moment Saturday when he exhibited a hint of self-awareness admitting he had said the ""N"" word in the past — not because he was racist he suggested but because he was repeating a Chris Rock bit.

Rogan's multiple uses of that word caught on camera became the basis for a compilation video that made the rounds online which Rogan suggested Saturday was embarrassing for him to watch.

During a moment of quiet in the arena Saturday after Rogan referred to it as the ""N-word"" there was one fan who gleefully appallingly urged Rogan to ""say it.""

Rogan didn't take the bait. He has his limits. But it's disturbing though not surprising to know that he has fans who don't want him to have any.

Rogan's openers include Milwaukee native — and a controversial comic

So what will the success of Joe Rogan mean for comedy? I'm guessing more guys like one of his openers Saturday Tony Hinchcliffe.

He's like a faded Xerox copy of the headliner — he's also into podcasting and like Rogan recently relocated to Texas — but with dumber and more blatantly offensive jokes. His targets Saturday included transgender athletes Amy Schumer and Helen Keller with a lot of ""R"" words and the six-letter ""F"" word delivered with a cocky Christian-Slater-meets-Matthew-McConaughey drawl.

Hinchcliffe experienced his own justified career setback this spring after he said racist jokes at a set prompting his agents to reportedly cut ties according to TMZ. But by bringing him on the road Saturday Rogan ensured that the fallout was short-lived.

The best part of Saturday's show was that it gave Milwaukee native Lara Beitz a chance to perform for a big audience in her hometown five years after she left for L.A. after she said she wasn't given a chance to perform at a local club. She's clearly having the last laugh winning over Saturday's crowd with a smart affirming 15-minute set born from tough subjects from men's patronizing behavior to being a single woman in the pandemic to her mother's bout with breast cancer.

The takeaways

This was the largest show in Milwaukee yet to use Yondr which requires audience members to put their phones and smartwatches in pouches after getting through security. The Yondr portion alone added a few extra minutes to what was already a long wait to get in and to leave the arena. There's a significantly larger Yondr show coming up at Summerfest when up to 23000 fans go to see Dave Chappelle at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater Sept. 11. So plan accordingly.

The rising number of COVID-19 cases across the country due to the delta variant has prompted Live Nation to permit artists to require masks and proof of vaccination or negative COVID tests for concerts and the Cactus Club is implementing that same policy for all shows beginning Monday. But it's the only venue in Milwaukee to do so thus far; a few Pabst Theater Group shows will have those criteria per the artists' request. Signs at Fiserv Forum Saturday encouraged people to wear masks if they were unvaccinated and gave permission for people to not wear them if they are vaccinated — although the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines suggest everyone should wear masks indoors regardless of vaccination status. Every employee at Fiserv Forum had a mask on Saturday but about 99% of showgoers did not.

The second one meanwhile might forever remain a mystery. So let’s get the facts straight. The obvious take is that we are not dealing with the same crimson Bronco used by the folks over at Car and Driver to break the Internet... while performing a mid-air stunt. Yes everyone (at least in the Bronco community) is now talking about the flying Bronco instead of the bucking Bronco.So with that out of the way here’s the official story as shared by the social media account of the James Duff Bronco Experts with help from a Hagerty-sanctioned event plaque (the 2021 Concours d’Elegance Of America July 25th Plymouth Michigan). Apparently not long after discontinuing the fifth generation Bronco the head honchos over at Ford mused about bringing it back to life as both a 2-Door and an all-new 4-Door . It all sounds familiar up to this point.But that was the early 2000s. Emphasis on early as this design proposal was created back in 2001 by a styling team led by Moray Callum. If the name sounds familiar it’s because we’re dealing with the current Vice President of Design for the Ford Motor Company. And also the elder brother of the renowned Ian Callum of Jaguar fame.The considered revival optioned the modern Bronco on the backbones of a future Ford Ranger architecture. Though in the end its success across company-ordered research didn’t materialize into a production model on the account of “business factors” its creation wasn’t without an echo. Of course we all know how much time the Detroit automaker needed to bring to market the reinvented sixth-generation...,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzgwOTI3MDgvb3JpZ2lucy1vZi10aGUtZml2ZS1kYXktd29ya3dlZWsv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly9nbG9iYWxuZXdzLmNhL25ld3MvODA5MjcwOC9vcmlnaW5zLW9mLXRoZS1maXZlLWRheS13b3Jrd2Vlay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Does a five-day workweek adopted in the 20th century make sense now?,"In 1926 Henry Ford the man at the helm of the Ford Motor Company shut down his seven-day automotive factories for two days a week — giving rise to the foundation of the five-day workweek in North America.

Ford touted it as a way to increase productivity by giving the people on the assembly line one week’s salary while only requiring them to work eight-hour shifts Monday through Friday.

“Just as the eight-hour day opened our way to prosperity so the five-day week will open our way to a still greater prosperity” Ford famously mused. He said his strategy was to give workers an extra day of recreation which would create the need to purchase more goods including vehicles.

In 1940 the 40-hour workweek was mandated nationally across the United States along with the two-day weekend. Canada and other countries followed suit.

As the COVID-19 pandemic forced offices and all kinds of workplaces across the country to re-examine how and when we work momentum for the four-day workweek movement is building. Some employers are calling into question whether it still makes sense that the modern-day 9-to-5 grind is modelled on a structure designed for the needs of factory workers from the early 1900s.

“Work is a very different thing than it was in the 20th century and so I don’t think the five-day workweek serves us very well” Gideon Forman tells Global News. He’s the climate change and transportation policy analyst with the David Suzuki Foundation an organization of 90 people who work compressed and staggered workweeks.

The Foundation has implemented four-day workweeks since the 1990s. Staff say it gives them more time to spend with family as well as pursuing hobbies and civic engagement.

“I work Monday to Thursday and on Fridays I spend some time volunteering at Canadian Blood Services. I wouldn’t be able to do that if I were working five days a week” says Gideon.

“We obviously want our employees to be happy and the nice side benefit is that the research shows that when you have a four-day workweek people tend to be more productive.”

In July Iceland released its findings of the largest known study of four-day workweeks — a four-year experiment within the ranks of the country’s public service.

Researchers declared the trials an “overwhelming success” in terms of benefits for workers’ mental health and productivity. This has led to unions pushing for this new model and currently 86 per cent of the Icelandic workforce is either on four-day work schedules or headed down that path.

Spain is currently testing out a four-day workweek for certain companies and the consumer goods multinational firm Unilever is offering staff the option to reduce their working hours by 20 per cent without a decrease in pay. There are several trials in Canada right now including the township of Zorra Ont. The municipality of Guysborough N.S. conducted a trial last year and the compressed workweek was adopted as a policy in April.

In the U.S. on July 29 legislation was introduced in Congress to shorten the standard workweek from 40 hours to 32. Democratic representative Mark Takano of Riverside in Southern California put forward the motion.

In a Twitter post he said “many countries and businesses that have experimented with a four-day workweek found it to be an overwhelming success as productivity grew and wages increased.”

He added that “the nature of work is rapidly changing we must keep up.”

Linda Nazareth an economist and the host of the Work and the Future podcast says the environmental benefits of a reduced staggered workweek is a major consideration as it can reduce congestion on the roads and pollution associated with commuting.

“I think the environment and climate change is something that’s going to be factored into work a lot more in the next two to 10 years. And that may mean we go to a four-day workweek” she tells Global News.

In a tight labour market Nazareth says the onus will be on employees to push for a shortened week. According to Nazareth a key hurdle is cultural. The pandemic has only intensified the expectation that workers remain available around the clock.

“We have this mindset that you have to be on all the time particularly if you’re anything but a very junior worker. And that is going to be a really hard sell I think to see this widely adopted” she says.

Chris Higgins has studied how companies can help employees achieve better work-life balance for more than 30 years. The professor emeritus at Western University’s Ivey School of Business tells Global News that compressed week trials during the 1980s which were conceived as an antidote to soaring prices at the pumps were abandoned as gas prices came down. Some roles weren’t a good fit for longer hours over fewer days.

“It was very very successful with one small caveat: in some types of jobs the extra hours led to a productivity slump like a physical labour job. People were good for eight hours but not 10” says Higgins.

But with an increasing number of jobs in the digital economy and a workforce spurred by the changes brought on by the pandemic in terms of how and how often we work advocates of the four-day workweek say momentum is building.

Time will tell if the events of the last 17 months will be a catalyst propelling a shift to a new work structure or merely a temporary disruption as workplaces revert to the nine-to-five Monday-to-Friday grind.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXJlcG9ydC8yMDIxLzA4LzA3L3RoZS1jYXJzLXRoYXQtc3RheS1vbi1kZWFsZXItbG90cy10aGUtbG9uZ2VzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Cars That Stay on Dealer Lots the Longest,"The Cars That Stay on Dealer Lots the Longest tomeng / iStock Unreleased via Getty Images

Though the U.S. auto market has improved significantly from where it was in 2020 car dealers are still struggling to get back to normal. According to automotive data company Black Book new car sales were down 14% in June 2021 compared to June of 2019 the most recent pre-pandemic year for auto sales.

With sales down some cars have been relegated to gathering dust on dealer lots. The average new car purchased in June took 41.7 days to sell. Yet some vehicles averaged more than three months to sell.

To determine the cars that stay on dealer lots the longest 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from car search engine iSeeCars on the new vehicles with the highest average days to sell as of June 2021.

Cars may take longer to sell for a number of reasons — they could have prices well beyond what consumers are willing to pay or they might just be much less popular than other similar cars.

Nearly all of the slowest selling cars are small to midsize sedans or small to midsize SUVs. There are five different Ford vehicles on the list the most of any manufacturer. Nissan vehicles appear on the list four times and Mitsubishi vehicles three times.

A worldwide semiconductor chip shortage has cut into manufacturers’ ability to produce new cars and significantly reduced the supply of cars getting to dealers’ lots. Demand meanwhile continued to be strong and June was the first month in which the inventory backlog was no longer sufficient to meet demand. In the case of some popular cars dealers only have a few weeks’ worth of supply remaining. This is how close dealers are to running out of America’s most popular cars.

Ferrari"" heads to auction","A 1966 Ford GT40 replica used in the filming of ""Ford v. Ferrari"" is headed to auction with Mecum. It's scheduled to cross the block at the auction company's Dallas sale scheduled for September 8-11.

Released in 2019 ""Ford v. Ferrari"" told the story of Ford-backed Shelby American's victory over the Scuderia at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans with the GT40. Because real GT40s are rare and expensive the production team used replicas like this one.

This car is one of six built by Race Car Replicas (RCR) for the movie playing two roles according to the auction listing. For the Le Mans scenes it was dressed as the number 3 car driven by Dan Gurney and Jerry Grant. That car didn't finish the real-life 1966 Le Mans and it's barely shown in the movie. Gurney won Le Mans in 1967 co-driving the later GT40 Mk IV with A.J. Foyt.

As shown here the car also wore the livery of the number 88 GT40 of William Wonder for a scene depicting the 1966 24 Hours of Daytona. A 5.7-liter V-8 sits behind the driver powering the rear wheels through a 6-speed manual transmission but the listing doesn't include any other specifications.

A signed movie poster and documentation (including a title) are included with the sale per the listing.

If you just want a car and not a movie prop Superformance offers its own GT40 replicas alongside replicas of the Shelby Cobra Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe and the original Corvette Grand Sport. The company is even working with U.K.-based Everrati on an electric GT40 replica."

Instead they can dream big take charge of their lives and become heroes.

It’s the kind of cheesy unabashedly optimistic sentiment that in any other action comedy particularly one set inside an ultra-violent video game would make you want to hurl and head for the exit. But in “Free Guy” that wide-eyed idealism not only works it seduces you slowly but effectively. By the end you’ll be up to your neck in warm and fuzzies and won’t even notice you’ve actually been duped.

That snarky action-hero movie starring the guy from “Deadpool” you’ve been sold? It’s really a heartful romantic workplace comedy.

Things don’t start out that way. When we first meet Guy he’s a wide-eyed innocent content to wear the same blue shirt drink the same coffee hum the same Mariah Carey tune and endure the same humiliation of multiple bank robberies every day. That all changes when he meets Molotovgirl (”Killing Eve” Emmy-winner Jodie Comer) who he believes is his soulmate. But after their meet-cute she has to break the bad news to him. Guy isn’t just not real he’s a non-playable character (NPC like the passengers and pedestrians in “Crazy Taxi” for example) in a first-person shooter video game called “Free City.” The objective: cause as much violent mayhem as possible.

Cut to the real world. Molotovgirl is the avatar of Millie (Comer in a movie-stealing dual role) a video game designer who suspects that Soonami Studios and its boss Antawn (Taika Waititi “Jojo Rabbit”) ripped off the code for “Free City” from her and her estranged friend Keys (Joe Keery “Stranger Things”) and has hidden the proof in the game. To help her find it she enlists Guy who has somehow evolved from a background character into an active player capable of making his own decisions.

In “Free Guy” director Shawn Levy (the “Night at the Museum” trilogy) has crafted one of the most inventive and engaging films of the year. Fueled by a smart and often sentimental script by Matt Lieberman and Zak Penn the trio aided by a digital effects team at the top of their game have built an impressive world within a video game that looks and feels authentic. And yet the most interesting part of the story happens outside “Free City” in the real world making it instantly more relatable than other stuck-in-a-video game movies like “Jumanji” “Tron” or “Wreck-It Ralph.”

That’s not to say action fans won’t leave the theater satisfied. Indeed the film is full of car chases explosions fights and meta-humor aplenty. But there is a method to the madness as Guy brought to life by Reynolds’ irresistible charm decides to level up by opting for good deeds over destruction. Amid his existential awakening he becomes a viral sensation encouraging Millie to come out of her shell and inspiring the other NPCs including his best friend Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) to step out of the background and live their lives with arms wide open. It’s not a subtle metaphor but “Free Guy” earns it and will make your heart swell and burst Ted Lasso-style!

But what happens inside ”Free City” is only in service to the heart of the film which is the mystery over the stolen code and who or what is behind Guy’s transformation. “Free Guy” in part feels like one of those 1980s screwball comedies where employees of a big corporation suspect their boss is up to something no good and then go to great lengths to take him down. There’s suspense corporate intrigue daring hijinks and a dorky guy with a crush on a girl. As Keys Keery has the unlikely hero thing down pat having played the role to acclaim in “Stranger Things.” But Steve never had to face a foe like Antawn an insufferable egomaniac portrayed with ridiculous abandon by Waititi who means to delete “Free City” and replace it with a sequel.

Both storylines eventually converge in a climax that’s both hilarious and uplifting: hilarious thanks to a few laugh-out-loud surprises courtesy of the merger between 20th Century Studios and the Walt Disney Company and uplifting because of the movie’s underlying message about having agency in your life.

If you haven’t noticed yet this is a high-concept film that’s sort of hard to explain. But beneath its blockbuster surface “Free Guy” is really just a feel-good romantic comedy about a boy asking a girl to love him by way of one of the most original grand gestures in the history of the genre. In short it’s the kind of movie that doesn’t make you want to simply have a good day. It inspires you to have a great day.

Hong Kong-based senior advisor to Citi’s fund management division for Asia and investment industry veteran Stewart Aldcroft will be leaving the group with effect from August 20.

Stewart Aldcroft

Aldcroft has been with the firm for 10 years and also holds the positions of managing director for Citi’s markets and securities services and chairman for Cititrust.

He will be taking a few months off to return to the UK before returning to Hong Kong in January. However his plans are “open” for now although there is a possibility he might take up a consulting role with Citi.

“The last decade has seen momentous changes in both Hong Kong and Citi and especially in the development of the funds and asset management business in Greater China” he wrote in a farewell note to colleagues and industry contacts.

“From a very small number in 2011 the fund management business in China has grown to become one of the largest in the world and growing faster than anywhere else. It has been a privilege to have witnessed that” his note wrote.

Hong Kong assets under management reached HK$34.9 trillion ($4.5 trillion) in 2020 a 21% increase from the year before and nearly four times the amount in 2011. Hong Kong also now has 48000 people working in the industry up from 34000 in 2016.

He also noted that in his 36 years in the funds and asset management business in Asia and Hong Kong he has observed the industry evolve from a western-dominated business in the 1980s to a part of local financial assets today.

“Institutional investors are perhaps more willing to embrace the many alternatives now offered whether it is ETFs (exchange-trade funds) or ESG (environmental social and governance) hedge and alternative funds” he wrote.

Aldcroft has worked in a variety of roles including at Franklin Templeton Investment Services Investec Asset Management (now rebranded as NinetyOne) Standard Chartered single-family office Horizon21 and asset management firm Enhanced Investments Products (EIP).

A Citi spokesperson told AsianInvestor a replacement has not been found but confirmed that Aldcroft could possibly continue in a consulting role in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9jZW50cmFsLWJhbmstb2YtdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWFubm91bmNlcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJvbGl2YXItcmVkZW5vbWluYXRpb24tcGxhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Central Bank of Venezuela Announces 'Digital Bolivar' Redenomination Plan – Emerging Markets Bitcoin News,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL251dm9jby12aXN0YXMtZ2FybmVycy1ycy0xNTAwLWNyb3JlLWZyb20tYW5jaG9yLWludmVzdG9ycy1haGVhZC1vZi1pcG8tNzQ0MzA4MC_SAYkBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbXBhbmllcy9udXZvY28tdmlzdGFzLWdhcm5lcnMtcnMtMTUwMC1jcm9yZS1mcm9tLWFuY2hvci1pbnZlc3RvcnMtYWhlYWQtb2YtaXBvLTc0NDMwODAvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nuvoco Vistas garners Rs 1500 crore from anchor investors ahead of IPO,"Cement manufacturer Nuvoco Vistas Corporation Ltd part of the Nirma Group has raised Rs 1500 crore from anchor investors ahead of its initial share sale which opens for public subscription on Monday.

GRMN,Garmin,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRjcmFpbm1ha2VyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4L2dhcm1pbi1hZGRzLW5ldy1hZHZlbnR1cmUtcmFjZS1hY3Rpdml0eS1wcm9maWxlLWFuLWV4cGxhaW5lci5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Adds New 'Adventure Race' Activity Profile: An Explainer,"While scanning through the list of beta firmware updates that posted this week I noticed a curious addition – a new ‘Adventure Race’ activity profile designed for races that prohibit GPS navigation during the race. Meaning that some races require competitors to do their own orienteering old-school style with maps and compass rather than depend on GPS devices.

But of course these athletes still want to record their race for posterity sake (because…Strava) but don’t want to run afoul of rules that limit navigational assistance. Many of these races/rules do allow GPS devices that can record only but not do any navigation or even distance tracking. Thus up till now people have largely had to use less capable and more basic GPS watches that often don’t have the battery life capabilities of Garmin’s higher-end models (if at all).

For example an older Forerunner 35 series device that can’t navigate (nor has Connect IQ) would fit the bill for some races but has a very limited battery life for adventure racing – especially compared to something like the Garmin Enduro which can reach into the hundreds of hours of GPS-on time depending on how it’s configured.

In any event as I said I was browsing through the mostly boring list of bug fixes when I noticed this one. And figured it was curiosity-inducing enough to mention even if some portion of the population will think it’s silly (just like some portion of the population thinks Wahoo’s watch singing happy birthday to you is silly).

So the feature is currently posted in public beta for the Garmin Fenix 6 Series (all editions) MARQ Series and Enduro. That’s part of the larger beta firmware update set so you’re actually getting a pile of other new features that Garmin has been adding to those watches in beta the last few months but hasn’t yet toggled over to production for these watches (but have on other watches) including:

Added Adventure Race activity

Added the ability to rate the perceived effort and feel of a Run Bike or Swim activity.

Added sleep tracking widget with sleep score and insights by Firstbeat Analytics.

Added metabolic calories into the total calories reported in the calories data field and recorded in the activity file.

Added setting to enable/disable workout audio prompts

Updated workout audio prompts for hundredths distance precision.

Updated Intensity Minutes determinations to align with guidance from CDC.

Plus a crap load of other things under the ‘improved’ banner that could agreeably be called ‘new’

Here’s the links to the beta updates and the full list of all those changes from basically 16.70 (most recent production build) till now:

Garmin Fenix 6 Series

Garmin MARQ Series

Garmin Enduro

So I charged up a Fenix 6 unit to throw the firmware on and see how it works and threw on the beta firmware:

First up you’ll add the ‘Adventure Race’ activity profile like you would any other random profile you’ve never used before by scrolling down forever through the massive list of profiles and selecting it.

Once that’s done you can crack it open. As with other GPS-based profiles it’s still going to acquire satellites like normal and show the coloring at the top that GPS signal has been acquired. Same goes with optical HR. And like other profiles it has a few default data pages. In this case it’s one data page showing altitude time heart rate and duration. Then one showing the compass and finally one showing your start time on a new ‘verification’ page.

And while you can still customize data pages/fields it’s not quite like normal. You won’t be able to add any distance fields navigational fields map fields or location/GPS coordinate fields. None of those are allowed. Nor are you allowed any mapping data pages or any navigational-related features/tools (such as course selection or routing options). Even auto-lap is disabled so you can’t figure out distance based on that.

In fact beyond those data field tweaks/disablements there’s a slew of tiny ones (of which I probably haven’t found all of). For example if you access the ‘Quick Access’ menu (long hold upper left button) it’ll disable the ability to quickly show/save Lat/Long as well as disables music and phone connectivity. As you hover over each of those options they’re now greyed out with a line through them and instead display ‘Adventure Race Active’. Further all Hot Keys are disabled too (and will say “Hot keys are disabled in this activity”).

However the singular (arguably massive) gap is Connect IQ fields are permitted. Given countless CIQ fields show distance data or even straight-up map/route data (like DWMap) that’s sorta leaving open a huge hole in the entire theory.

Then again I suppose if someone is going to cheat that way they’re probably just as easily going to cheat any other way. Cheaters gonna cheat and that’s unfortunately probably just a fact of life. Still I’m struggling to see why CIQ needs to be enabled in this scenario given the severity of the gap it opens relative to the benefits. Certainly there are some benefits – but this entire profile was designed to allow people to just capture their run GPS track after the fact not to boil the ocean.

Beyond that from a workout standpoint you’ll start/stop like any other activity and it *records* every bit of data just like any normal run (it simply doesn’t display it to you mid-run).

Nonetheless the one last interesting tidbit is that once you end the activity there’s a new ‘Verification’ tab of sorts in the list of post-workout data metrics:

When you crack that open it shows you this:

I presume the idea being to show race officials that data or such. Though I could see how having some sort of explainer text to show to race officials would also be useful such as “This event was recorded in Adventure Racing mode which disallows access to navigational distance and mapping related data during the activity”.

Still I’m sure someone will find this useful – and in many ways that’s been Garmin’s strategy for a while – keeping adding features that a small portion of the population finds useful. Ultimately covering virtually every use case and edge case out there.

Oh and finally to preempt what will invariably be the first comment below: When will Garmin announce a Fenix 7? Most definitely 7AM US Eastern time on Tuesday. Sometimes Wednesday or Thursday but certainly still 7AM US Eastern Time. Never a Monday or Friday though even at 7AM. Also probably not this Tuesday. Possibly linked to a trade show (those exist still?) or race but possibly not. Definitely before they announce a Fenix 8 though – and certainly before a Fenix 10 or Fenix 11.

With that thanks for reading!

Update: About 12 hours after publishing this post the Adventure Racing World Series announced that they’ll be allowing “securely locked” GPS watches during their races notably mentioning the Garmin Enduro. The first such race allowing it is Oct 1-10th in Spain. Also of note Garmin is a sponsor there. (Thanks to commenter Margusl below for catching this!)

Stick to the recommended placement and exercises and it can do a solid job of providing that insight into your effort levels and give you the versatility to move things around if you really can't get on with a chest strap. It's certainly not cheap and you could spend less for a top chest strap. But if you like the idea of moving the monitor around based on tracking a range of workout types then the MZ-Switch is a super all-rounder. Hit Comfortable wrist and forearm bands

Good HR data with the right placement

Works with third party apps/equipment Miss MyZone app could be cleaner

Chest strap still offers best accuracy

Not the cheapest

The MyZone MZ-Switch is a heart rate monitor designed for those that find chest strap monitors uncomfortable – and sports watches too unreliable.

As the name suggests the MyZone Switch is designed to be worn in multiple locations: it can be placed on the chest wrist or upper arm which offers versatility based on the kinds of sports you want to track.

While we've seen these style of armband monitors from Polar Wahoo Scosche we've yet to see something that combines three wearing options in one setup. Stick to the recommended wearing position for different workouts and MyZone believes you will still get a reliable hit of heart rate data.

At  this is a heart rate monitor that doesn't come cheap. However there isn't really a device like it – unless you're willing to pay for a combination of something like Polar's H9 or H10 chest strap monitor and one of its OH1 or Verity Sense armband monitors.

So does it deliver the HR goods where it matters? We've been strapping it on the chest forearm and wrist for a host of workouts to find out. Here's our full verdict on the MyZone MZ-Switch.

MyZone MZ-Switch: Design

At the heart of the MZ-Switch is the small round tracker which enables the ECG-style monitoring and also hosts an optical based sensor and clips into one of three straps. The first is the pretty standard looking chest strap which comes in standard small and large strap size options. The tracker snaps into place at the front with button-style clasps to make sure it will stay securely in place and it did not budge in our time with it.

When it's not living inside the strap you have the option to clip that tracker out and place it in either a strap that sits on your wrist or on the forearm. While the straps look similar the difference in materials indicate which one goes lower and higher up your arm.

Unlike the chest strap the tracker simply sits inside of a plastic cradle that does feel a little less secure but when pressed up against the forearm or wrist doesn't move around generally. There's velcro straps to keep them in place and the soft feel of the straps make them comfortable to wear during workouts. Unlike the chest strap you do have some different wrist and arm strap colour options to pick from if you don't want to go in with the all-red look.

On the tracker itself there's a solitary button that's hidden underneath the MyZone logo and that's what you'll use to turn it on when it's sitting in the arm or wrist strap. There's a single LED that flashes to indicate it's started to track a workout and can flash different colours to indicate real-time heart rate zones which are easier to see and make use of when it's on your wrist.

It's important to note that while the Switch setup offers both heart rate sensor technologies it doesn't use them at the same time. So when you're in chest strap mode it's using the ECG (electrocardiogram) method and when it's on the wrist or forearm it's switching to that optical-based PPG sensor technology. So it's essentially working in the same way that armbands like the Polar Verity Sense and Wahoo Tickr Fit operate.

We should also note that this is one you can jump in the pool with to track your heart rate too. It carries a water resistant rating for up to 10 metres depth with MyZone suggesting you grab the wrist strap option to track heart rate in the water.

MyZone MZ-Switch: Heart rate accuracy

So does the MyZone MZ-Switch where it matters? Well let's start by talking about what kind of accuracy we can expect from the two sensors that are at your disposal.

With the chest strap and the ECG sensor you can expect 99.4% accuracy and that's why it's still considered the gold standard for tracking effort levels during exercise. Switch over the PPG sensor and moving it to the wrist or forearm and you'll see that drop to 95%. So the accuracy does fall but should deliver pretty good results in theory.

The key here is that MyZone recommends where you should wear the module depending on the type of exercise you're planning to track. So if you're walking cycling or swimming you should stick it on your wrist. If you're running rowing or lifting it's better to switch to the arm. When it comes to high intensity workouts like HIIT and functional training stick to those recommendations and you'll get the best results.

The good news is that with that there's a few ways to put the setup to use. There's Bluetooth and ANT+ connectivity for starters which makes it suitable to work with third party fitness apps and can be paired up with watches and connected gym equipment. We had no problems pairing it up with a range of Garmin Forerunner watches and its Enduro watch. It was the same story for the Apple Watch Series 6 and it worked without issue with a connected rowing machine too.

There's also onboard storage here too which means you have space for 36 hours of workout time if you've put your phone away before a gym class or you just don't want to take it out with you for a run. You can also track a workout from MyZone's own companion iPhone or Android app where you'll be able to see your real-time heart rate zones and see your earned MEP (MyZone Effort Points).

Sticking to MyZone's recommended placement for workouts we ran rowed and performed HIIT workouts and here's how it fared.

Outdoor running

Outdoor running compared: MyZone MZ-Switch (left and centre) and Garmin HRM-Pro (right)



First up was running with the tracker worn on our forearm. The first thing to note much like Polar Wahoo and Scosche's armbands it's a problematic one to wear if you're wearing a long sleeve top. We found that doing that in colder conditions meant you could sometimes accidentally pop the tracker out of its cradle and could perhaps do with something that snaps into place more securely.

Accuracy-wise we did a mixture of slow steady and faster paced runs and generally found that average heart rate data around 1-2 bpm out from a Garmin HRM-Pro chest strap monitor so well within a margin for error that makes comparisons impossible.

There was a slightly larger difference between maximum heart rate readings but generally the graphs did tell a reliable story of our runs.

Indoor cycling

Indoor cycling compared: MyZone MZ-Switch (left and centre) and Garmin HRM-Pro (right)



Heading indoors for some cycling action we swapped the armband for the wrist strap which clearly makes more sense to wear on a bike where there's less wrist movement and should ensure you get more reliable heart rate stats.

Above is a sample indoor bike ride against the Garmin HRM-Pro chest strap and this time there was a 1BPM difference for average heart data and a 3BPM difference in maximum heart rate readings. This was consistent with the steady paced rides we tested the Switch with against a heart rate monitor chest strap. Again extremely closely matched.

HIIT workout

Where optical based wrist based sensors generally falter it for high intensity workouts. That's why MyZone recommends still using the chest strap option in this scenario and that's what we did for some HIIT sessions on home workout app FIIT.

Unsurprisingly the chest strap option here always felt like it served up the most reliable data. The wrist and forearm bands can offer good data but if you yearn for supreme accuracy there's still only one option in our eyes.

The Switch performs about as well as Polar Wahoo and Scosche's bands from the same place. It proves that you can get better data away from the chest just as long as you stick to the exercises where you can reduce some of the issues that can cause optical PPG heart rate monitors to deliver bad data.

MyZone MZ-Switch: MyZone app and battery life

MyZone has been making improvements over the years to its companion app and if you're planning to make it the main place that you look over your data we'd say maybe consider taking the option of using a third party app unless you're all about those Myzone Effort Points (MEPs).

The main home screen shows you a feed of workouts including monthly and lifetime MEPs. Hit the small MyZone logo at the bottom of the screen and that pushes you into a place you can access your body metrics including resting heart rate and maximum heart rate data.

If you've got other MyZone devices you can also display body fat percentage and basal metabolic rate here too. You can also make connection requests and track workouts from this screen as well.

It's an app UI that's bursting with colour but it almost feels like it could benefit from simplify things and hiding away some of features and focus on putting feeds and tracking workouts front and centre of the app.

There's a lot going for an app that's really about heart rate and it could look to other heart rate-centric fitness apps like Polar's Beat app for something that feels a bit more user-friendly.

In terms of battery life you're dealing with two different heart rate technologies which will drain the battery in very different ways. MyZone claims you can get between 3-4 months of battery life which should cover a mix of using the ECG sensor and the PPG sensor. Chest strap monitors can usually anywhere from 6-12 months using a coin cell battery. On the MZ-Switch it needs to be charged and uses a proprietary charging cable to power it up.

In our testing there was around a 4-5% battery drop-off using the PPG sensor on the wrist and the arm. Unsurprisingly using the chest strap monitor for 40 minute to 1 hour workouts performed much like MyZone's other chest strap monitors and doesn't take a big hit in the battery department. You can't view battery status on the sensor so you'll need to pair it up with the app to view battery status but it would be a nice addition to know on the device itself when it's getting low.

Back in 2017 GE engineers surprised the world when they took what was then the world’s most powerful jet engine and turned it into a power plant with the potential to generate enough electricity for thousands of households. The feat got plenty of attention but GE was not finished. Now another group from GE Aviation and GE Additive has turned the machine into an impressive example of lean management the business philosophy driving GE’s transformation. Using lean an international team was able to reduce the cost of four parts by as much as 35% in just 10 months all during the pandemic.

The project is an example of the versatility of lean. GE has used it to improve manufacturing and services reduce inventory simplify its office operations and now speed up innovation. “This is a game changer” says GE Aviation’s Eric Gatlin.

Change It Up

Every hour a GE 7F gas turbine isn’t making electricity can cost power producers tens of thousands of dollars. Which is why it’s essential that service crews perform scheduled maintenance as quickly as possible and finish the job on time. “I’m always asking questions” says Ezra Laurent a director of global field services at FieldCore the GE-owned service and maintenance subsidiary. “What can we do better? How can we change things? Who are our best performers? What can we do differently?”

It helps that Laurent is an expert in lean. Using lean Laurent and teams as far apart as Hungary and South Carolina were able to find a way to cut the time it takes to replace a critical turbine component from 25 hours to 13. “It was a beautiful thing to watch” said Funmi-Lola Ajayi North America Region fulfillment leader at GE.

Building on Michael Faraday’s discovery in the 19th century early electrical generators consisted of an electromagnet spinning inside a steel tube inlaid with copper wire called a stator. The same principle still governs today’s generators though Faraday would scarcely recognize them: The ones made by GE Gas Power in Schenectady New York for instance weigh many tons and generate electricity for customers the world over. As generators have gotten more complex of course so has their manufacture — and not long ago in Schenectady bottlenecks began to slow down plant production. Delays weren’t uncommon; neither were defects. It was clear something needed to change.

Plant operators turned to lean which emphasizes waste reduction and continuous improvement. In Schenectady one of the first steps was mapping the plant to identify root causes of the slowdown. It quickly became apparent that one part of the plant’s manufacturing was responsible for more than its share.

The shop was making 300-pound stator bars that fold together like a 3D puzzle to form the inside wall of the stator. To get further clarity the team created a 1:20 model of the plant to track the movement of a single stator bar through production. By focusing on eliminating unnecessary waste and retraining operators to understand holistically on the whole manufacturing process the plant’s managers were able to make huge gains: 18 months later they’ve halved lead time while also reducing inventory and freeing factory space.

Winds Of Change

Lean is at the core of GE’s turnaround and the management strategy is also at the center of a plan to overhaul how GE Renewable Energy services a continent-wide network of onshore wind turbines in Europe and Asia.

“Lean gives you the tools it slows you down and it forces you to step back and say: What exactly is wasting money and resources that I don’t need to spend?” says Bob Karl who runs global operations for Digital Services at GE Renewable Energy. The company had a good reason to ask: GE Renewable Energy has grown into a global giant over the past 20 years and now has 49000 onshore turbines in 35 countries. But as recently as last year it had an oversupply of expensive inventory spread around the world. Starting at two large warehouses in Spain and the Netherlands Karl and his colleagues set out to untangle the operations by centralizing inventory. The plan is working: At the end of 2020 the team reduced service inventory by tens of millions of dollars. And they’re not slowing down.

Virtual Lean

“We have hundreds of millions of dollars in potential businesses sitting in our sales funnel” says Betsy Bingham who is now at GE Aviation but also serves as senior vice president for lean and operations at GE Digital. Yet she says customers end up canceling one-third of projects in the pipeline and another 30% get pushed beyond the original deadline. “We end up working on it and it’s a waste. We need to bid on the right work and get it through the funnel faster” she says. Image credit: GE Digital.

In March 2020 employees from GE’s grid operations — who work with utilities and other customers to bring electricity to consumers around the globe — were set to gather in Florida for a working session associated with lean. GE has applied lean to fix production lines in its factories like Batesville and Greensville but it can be equally powerful within the office for project management software development and other commercial challenges. Still a problem presented itself even before participants could gather in the Sunshine State: The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns prevented them from getting there. Could lean work as well online?

That was a dilemma given the problem-solving power of people working in the same room together. Virtual gatherings said GE Digital’s Paul Sloup had to find a way to “tap into people’s creativity and their problem-solving skills but also to draw out of people their ideas and their thoughts.” Sloup and colleagues settled on a whiteboard software that made virtual collaboration easy and soon found that despite the challenges the online method yielded surprising benefits: instant digital storage of ideas and insights for instance and the ability to share them with more people. “I would never have been able to scale a physical event that easily in that way” Sloup said. When in-person meetings return they won’t be the same — thanks to the virtual tools discovered by Sloup and his colleagues they’ll be better.

Lean In A Hurry

Angie Norman is comfortable with uncertainty. As one of GE’s experts in lean management it’s her specialty to crack complex problems in urgent need of a solution. So in March 2020 when GE Healthcare needed to set up and attach accessories to thousands of medical monitors in record time to serve patients during the pandemic she was exactly the right person for the job. These monitors track heart rate and other vital signs and doctors and nurses need them to treat ailing patients. It was a complex task in a small window of time.

Norman doesn’t even work for GE Healthcare. At the time she worked for GE Aviation and she now serves as executive lean leader in finance. But it was her lean expertise that mattered in this case and Norman got down to brass tacks. She secured space to assemble the monitors in GE Aviation’s Cheltenham England plant which typically makes aircraft power systems. She spearheaded worker training and drafted a plan with her team who were soon putting in two shifts a day assembling the monitors. The first batch was ready to ship in early May 2020 just six weeks after the project had begun. It was all about having a plan to execute Norman said — and the teamwork to execute it: “It shows how powerful a common goal can be.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL3RhbWlsLW5hZHUvZGVmZW5jZS1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWNvcnJpZG9yLW5ldHMtMjAwMC1jci9hcnRpY2xlMzU3OTQ5NTMuZWNl0gFzaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvdGFtaWwtbmFkdS9kZWZlbmNlLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtY29ycmlkb3ItbmV0cy0yMDAwLWNyL2FydGljbGUzNTc5NDk1My5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Defence Industrial Corridor nets ₹2000 cr.,"August 08 2021 05:44 am | Updated 05:44 am IST - CHENNAI

Since its inception in January 2019 the Tamil Nadu Defence Industrial Corridor (TNDIC) has managed to bring in ₹2116 crore in investments.

According to the data provided by the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation Limited (TIDCO) during the launch of this corridor that comprises Chennai Coimbatore Tiruchi Salem and Hosur ₹3123.5 crore in investments were committed by 10 companies. Of this ₹966 crore has already been invested.

In addition after the launch of this corridor several firms came forward and evinced interest in investing in this venture.

Around 29 companies including government organisations have committed themselves to investing ₹8226 crore of which ₹1150 crore has already been invested.

Asked about the update on TNDIC Minister for Industries Thangam Thennarasu said the TIDCO had signed an MoU with GE Aviation for setting up a Centre of Excellence (CoE) at an estimated investment of ₹140 crore for the design and development of aircraft engine components.

“Three more proposals for setting up CoEs are in the advanced stage of finalisation by the TIDCO with a total investment of ₹900 crore” he said.

The Minister said the DMK government had inked a few deals in the defence and aviation sectors during Investment Conclave 2021 that was held in Chennai last month.

Land acquisition

Land acquisition is in progress for the new defence industrial park near Sulur. Around 500 acres will be needed for this park. Around 1000 acres of land have been identified for the defence industrial park at Annur.

In addition to this the TIDCO has earmarked around 700 acres in five locations for the aerospace and defence industries.

Details provided by the TIDCO show that land acquisition activities have commenced for the ISRO satellite launch station at Kulasekarapattinam in Thoothukudi district.

It will be established at an estimated investment of ₹2000 crore.

This new infrastructure along with the ISRO’s propulsion complex at Mahendragiri will further enhance the State’s position in the space sector.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2xvZ2lzdGljcy9uby1sb3ctY29zdC1haXJsaW5lLWluLWluZGlhL2FydGljbGUzNTc5NzIyMC5lY2XSAWxodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS9sb2dpc3RpY3Mvbm8tbG93LWNvc3QtYWlybGluZS1pbi1pbmRpYS9hcnRpY2xlMzU3OTcyMjAuZWNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No low-cost airline in India,"The term ‘low-cost carrier’ marches on in India largely due to its import from outside when the second wave of liberalisation spawned several airlines between 2003 and 2007.

In India there is really no ‘low-cost’ airline; the term ‘low-fare’ is more appropriate as no airline gets anything at a cost lower than its compatriot airlines. The comparatively low fares are engineered by internal mechanisms often bordering infractions of air safety regulations. Since 2015 it has been done through progressive unbundling of air fares the latest tranche being announced just a few days ago by way of preferential seats meals use of airport lounges check-in baggage transport of sports and musical equipment being made chargeable.

This latest regulation has the potential to make the basic fare more affordable and provides passengers with more options they can deprive themselves of to garner lower fares. It is difficult to imagine any other unbundling possibility except as humorously suggested by a WhatsApp forward charging a fee for use of onboard toilets! It is a bit confusing thus to hear of the term ‘ultra low-cost carrier’ being used for an upcoming airline — Akasa to be promoted by Rakesh Jhunjhunwala said to be India’s 48th richest man.

More than four-fifths of India’s airline seats are already low fare having grown steadily since Air Deccan’s advent (2003) and applying worrisome pressure on full service carriers causing them to shrink in proportion to low-fare ones. Two waves of Covid-19 (and an impending third one) have put immense pressure on full scale carriers with the low-fare model holding out substantial benefits over the former. Thus it makes good business sense to enter into the low-fare market. However the timing would have to be right and it would not be wise to start an airline now as there are several imponderable and unpredictable factors related to Covid-19. In the past Jhunjhunwala has made all his money by investing right and surely understands that correct timing is critical to harvesting bountiful returns on investment. His decision to cap his investment into the fledgling airline to only ₹260 crore (USD 35 million) is wise; his Midas touch should do the rest for him.

Back in 2017 GE engineers surprised the world when they took what was then the world’s most powerful jet engine and turned it into a power plant with the potential to generate enough electricity for thousands of households. The feat got plenty of attention but GE was not finished. Now another group from GE Aviation and GE Additive has turned the machine into an impressive example of lean management the business philosophy driving GE’s transformation. Using lean an international team was able to reduce the cost of four parts by as much as 35% in just 10 months all during the pandemic.

The project is an example of the versatility of lean. GE has used it to improve manufacturing and services reduce inventory simplify its office operations and now speed up innovation. “This is a game changer” says GE Aviation’s Eric Gatlin.

Change It Up

Every hour a GE 7F gas turbine isn’t making electricity can cost power producers tens of thousands of dollars. Which is why it’s essential that service crews perform scheduled maintenance as quickly as possible and finish the job on time. “I’m always asking questions” says Ezra Laurent a director of global field services at FieldCore the GE-owned service and maintenance subsidiary. “What can we do better? How can we change things? Who are our best performers? What can we do differently?”

It helps that Laurent is an expert in lean. Using lean Laurent and teams as far apart as Hungary and South Carolina were able to find a way to cut the time it takes to replace a critical turbine component from 25 hours to 13. “It was a beautiful thing to watch” said Funmi-Lola Ajayi North America Region fulfillment leader at GE.

Building on Michael Faraday’s discovery in the 19th century early electrical generators consisted of an electromagnet spinning inside a steel tube inlaid with copper wire called a stator. The same principle still governs today’s generators though Faraday would scarcely recognize them: The ones made by GE Gas Power in Schenectady New York for instance weigh many tons and generate electricity for customers the world over. As generators have gotten more complex of course so has their manufacture — and not long ago in Schenectady bottlenecks began to slow down plant production. Delays weren’t uncommon; neither were defects. It was clear something needed to change.

Plant operators turned to lean which emphasizes waste reduction and continuous improvement. In Schenectady one of the first steps was mapping the plant to identify root causes of the slowdown. It quickly became apparent that one part of the plant’s manufacturing was responsible for more than its share.

The shop was making 300-pound stator bars that fold together like a 3D puzzle to form the inside wall of the stator. To get further clarity the team created a 1:20 model of the plant to track the movement of a single stator bar through production. By focusing on eliminating unnecessary waste and retraining operators to understand holistically on the whole manufacturing process the plant’s managers were able to make huge gains: 18 months later they’ve halved lead time while also reducing inventory and freeing factory space.

Lean is at the core of GE’s turnaround and the management strategy is also at the center of a plan to overhaul how GE Renewable Energy services a continent-wide network of onshore wind turbines in Europe and Asia.

“Lean gives you the tools it slows you down and it forces you to step back and say: What exactly is wasting money and resources that I don’t need to spend?” says Bob Karl who runs global operations for Digital Services at GE Renewable Energy. The company had a good reason to ask: GE Renewable Energy has grown into a global giant over the past 20 years and now has 49000 onshore turbines in 35 countries. But as recently as last year it had an oversupply of expensive inventory spread around the world. Starting at two large warehouses in Spain and the Netherlands Karl and his colleagues set out to untangle the operations by centralizing inventory. The plan is working: At the end of 2020 the team reduced service inventory by tens of millions of dollars. And they’re not slowing down.

Virtual Lean

“We have hundreds of millions of dollars in potential businesses sitting in our sales funnel” says Betsy Bingham who is now at GE Aviation but also serves as senior vice president for lean and operations at GE Digital. Yet she says customers end up canceling one-third of projects in the pipeline and another 30% get pushed beyond the original deadline. “We end up working on it and it’s a waste. We need to bid on the right work and get it through the funnel faster” she says. Image credit: GE Digital.

In March 2020 employees from GE’s grid operations — who work with utilities and other customers to bring electricity to consumers around the globe — were set to gather in Florida for a working session associated with lean. GE has applied lean to fix production lines in its factories like Batesville and Greensville but it can be equally powerful within the office for project management software development and other commercial challenges. Still a problem presented itself even before participants could gather in the Sunshine State: The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns prevented them from getting there. Could lean work as well online?

That was a dilemma given the problem-solving power of people working in the same room together. Virtual gatherings said GE Digital’s Paul Sloup had to find a way to “tap into people’s creativity and their problem-solving skills but also to draw out of people their ideas and their thoughts.” Sloup and colleagues settled on a whiteboard software that made virtual collaboration easy and soon found that despite the challenges the online method yielded surprising benefits: instant digital storage of ideas and insights for instance and the ability to share them with more people. “I would never have been able to scale a physical event that easily in that way” Sloup said. When in-person meetings return they won’t be the same — thanks to the virtual tools discovered by Sloup and his colleagues they’ll be better.

Angie Norman is comfortable with uncertainty. As one of GE’s experts in lean management it’s her specialty to crack complex problems in urgent need of a solution. So in March 2020 when GE Healthcare needed to set up and attach accessories to thousands of medical monitors in record time to serve patients during the pandemic she was exactly the right person for the job. These monitors track heart rate and other vital signs and doctors and nurses need them to treat ailing patients. It was a complex task in a small window of time.

Norman doesn’t even work for GE Healthcare. At the time she worked for GE Aviation and she now serves as executive lean leader in finance. But it was her lean expertise that mattered in this case and Norman got down to brass tacks. She secured space to assemble the monitors in GE Aviation’s Cheltenham England plant which typically makes aircraft power systems. She spearheaded worker training and drafted a plan with her team who were soon putting in two shifts a day assembling the monitors. The first batch was ready to ship in early May 2020 just six weeks after the project had begun. It was all about having a plan to execute Norman said — and the teamwork to execute it: “It shows how powerful a common goal can be.”",,,,,,,,,

A father and son duo from Hinsdale look to bridge generational divide through their podcast.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- A Hinsdale father and son are tackling family issues between Generation X-ers and Z-ers using their own podcast.

""Hold Me Back"" is committed to bridging the growing generational divide. Aidan and Ash ElDifrawi approach each episode with a hot (and sometimes controversial) topic to discuss debate and challenge how teens today are being brought up.

They present research on the subject matter and then debates it from their respective perspective (Gen X or Gen Z). At the end of each episode the two take part in what they call the ""You Convinced Me"" section where they discuss what the other generation has taught them. Through each episode Gen X and Gen Z (parent and teen) listeners are able to see where they could possibly be holding back the other generation from living their best life and hear advice on bridging generational gaps within their own family.

Some of the topics they discuss include: swearing youth sports screen time relationship values and more.

Aidan is a 16-year-old who is going into his junior year at Hinsdale High School.

Its ability to follow users around gives it an edge over other smart displays and it justifies its premium price by packing in many attractive features. If you can get past the lack of some major streaming services and the high price Alexa-powered smart devices don't come much better than the Echo Show 10.

If you’re in the market for a smart speaker or a smart display with a digital assistant you will be flooded with options. Amazon itself offers several Alexa-powered Echo devices ranging from budget to pricier options. Google has its set of Nest products Apple has the HomePod and HomePod Mini and there are plenty of third-party smart speakers and displays that come equipped with either Alexa or Google Assistant.

However the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd gen) is unlike any smart speaker or smart display you’ll find out there as it’s the only one on the market right now that can follow you around. While the Echo Show 10 may be Amazon’s most innovative smart home device it still has a few shortcomings. Find out if the device is worth your money in this Android Authority Amazon Echo Show 10 review.

What you need to know about the Amazon Echo Show 10

Adamya Sharma / Android Authority

Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd gen): $249.99/£239.99/€249.99/Rs. 24999 The Echo Show 10 is Amazon’s answer to the Google Nest Hub Max. It’s a smart display and speaker with Amazon’s Alexa assistant baked in and is the third generation of the Echo Show 10 line.

Apart from doing things like listening to music controlling your smart home devices and asking Alexa all sorts of questions you can also stream content on it from apps like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix. YouTube is also accessible from the device albeit through Amazon’s Silk browser not an app. Helpfully there’s a YouTube browser shortcut in the videos section on the device for easy access. You can even use Alexa voice commands to search for videos on YouTube.

In India where we reviewed the device these three video streaming services were the only ones on offer. However the device also supports Hulu and a few other networks like Tubi in the US.

The biggest draw of the Echo Show 10 is its ability to follow you around. You can tilt the screen up and down manually and set the display to rotate 360-degrees automatically. The Echo Show 10 uses a combination of audio and computer vision to determine where you are in a room. When you move or talk to Alexa the screen will automatically follow you around. This also enables the smart display to double up as a home security camera.

You have the option of buying the device in two colors: Charcoal (pictured in this review) and Glacier White.

What’s good?

The Amazon Echo Show 10 has a punchy 10.1-inch touchscreen display that’s bright enough for indoor use. Think of it like a tablet attached to a speaker. It’s good enough for watching videos on YouTube or streaming your favorite TV shows while you cook in the kitchen or move around in your living room. Text on the display is also sharp and easy to read. Of course the experience is not comparable to a TV or monitor because of the size and low resolution (1280 x 800) but it won’t disappoint. For the sake of comparison the similarly-sized Fire HD 10 tablet has a 1920 x 1200 resolution. However Google’s Nest Hub Max also has a 1280 x 800 screen so the Echo Show 10 is in line with the competition.

The sound is vibrant and bass-heavy.

The speakers include two one-inch tweeters and a three-inch downward-facing woofer. Together they are loud enough for a house party or small gatherings. The sound is vibrant and bass-heavy and you can adjust it to your liking using the audio settings in the Alexa app. If you aren’t a serious audiophile and want speakers that are loud and attractive-sounding you’ll enjoy the Echo Show 10.

Another great use of the Echo Show 10 is as a security camera for your home. The device has a 13MP camera that sits on the corner of the display. The picture quality is pretty good in brightly lit conditions but come nightfall you can’t see a thing in the darkness. So if you want to monitor your home after sundown you’ll have to leave a light on in the room where you place the Echo Show 10.

You can place the Echo Show 10 centrally in your living room and check on your house while you are away through the Alexa app. It won’t really work for discreet monitoring if that’s what you’re hoping for because the display shows a prompt saying “A household member is viewing your camera” every time you start remote monitoring from the Alexa app. If you’re on the other end and don’t want someone dropping in on you through the Echo Show 10 you have the ability to physically close the privacy shutter (pictured above) and avoid unwanted surveillance.

The biggest draw of the Echo Show 10 is its ability to follow you around.

Overall though the moving screen is the biggest attraction of the Echo Show 10. The settings of the device allow you to set the range of motion customize it to when you’re doing certain activities like streaming turn it on only when you request Alexa to follow you or turn it off completely. I simply loved having the device in my kitchen while following recipes on YouTube or via an Alexa skill. I didn’t have to stand in one place and could freely move around while cooking. I even enjoyed watching and following workout videos because I didn’t have to worry about exercising in a single spot to keep the screen in view. Related: The best skills and apps for Alexa

What’s not so good?

Adamya Sharma / Android Authority

As handy as the screen motion is the following action of the Echo Show 10 is a little slow. If you expect the screen to move with you instantly you’ll be disappointed. It also doesn’t work 100% of the time. There were instances when the display just refused to follow me around but I could always call out “Alexa” and it would turn its head in my direction. If there are two or more people in the room the display gets easily confused as to who it should follow. The thick bezels around the display are also pretty reflective and can be distracting if you’re in a brightly lit room.

We wish Amazon would get more streaming partners on board.

Some streaming apps are sorely missed on the Echo Show 10. Between just Netflix and Amazon Prime Video I found myself resorting to my iPad more often for watching stuff on other platforms. We wish Amazon would get more streaming partners on board especially since it supports other services on Fire TV devices.

Another limitation of the Echo Show 10 is that it can only make and receive video calls via the Alexa app Skype or another Echo Show device. To test the device I made a few Alexa video calls and it worked just fine. The image and sound were clear and there was no network disruption or unwanted call drops.

The motion following trick was useful during the video calls as I could move around the room while talking to someone. Unfortunately it didn’t work in a dimly lit environment. The motion follow feature is unable to function when there’s not enough light in the room and the device displays a prompt when that happens. Also for a smart display that rotates it would have been great if the device supported more video calling apps and services. The slow following action was also a little bit of an issue during video calls.

Amazon Echo Show 10 review: Should I buy it?

Adamya Sharma / Android Authority

Whether the Echo Show 10 is the smart display for you depends on several factors. If Alexa is your preferred digital assistant then you’re in the right place. You would also be paying a premium of $249.99 for the device so you should consider it only if you feel you need a moving smart display as that’s the device’s biggest appeal.

However if you’ve decided to spend that money and aren’t too hung up on having all the popular streaming apps the Echo Show 10 is a solid buy. It’s certainly an eye-catching addition to your living room. It’s also a fun device to have around if you have kids as they can play interactive games sing along with the lyrics displayed on the screen and more.

If you want a smart display with Alexa they don't come any better than the Echo Show 10.

All-in-all I quite liked having the Echo Show 10 at home. If you want a smart home hub that tries to do everything this could be it. Our advice would be to try and buy the Echo Show 10 on sale if you think the price is too steep.

Alternatively you could also consider the Google Nest Hub Max ($229) which offers more advanced security camera features an excellent display and good sound quality. It’s also slightly cheaper than the Echo Show 10. If you want to save even more money the Echo Show 8 ($129) drops the rotating display but delivers similarly solid audio quality.

Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) Alexa can show you more with a 10.1-inch HD screen that follows you around The Amazon Echo Show 10 is a smart display that rotates on its base to follow its users. It also enables home monitoring streaming and a whole lot more. See price at Amazon See price at Amazon India See price at Amazon See price at Amazon

The digital initiative is now set to improve logistics efficiency reduce logistics cost and promote multi-modality and sustainability in a big way the commerce ministry said in a statement.

The platform is a solution to replace the present manual process of generation exchange and compliance of logistics documents with a digitised secure and seamless document exchange system.

“This will enable generation storage and interchange of logistics-related documents digitally using Aadhaar and blockchain-based security protocols for data security and authentication; it will also provide a complete audit trail of document transfer faster execution of transaction lower cost of shipping and overall carbon footprint easy verification of authenticity of documents lowered risk of fraud” it said.

According to the statement the calculator is an efficient and user-friendly tool which provides for calculating and comparing GHG (Green House Gas) emissions across different modes.

“It allows for commodity-wise comparison of GHG emissions and total cost of transportation including their environmental cost between movement by road and rail” it said.

Along with the SLDE the Centre also launched a Green House Gas (GFG) emission calculator as well. The GHG calculator is an efficient user-friendly tool and provides for calculating and comparing GHG emissions across different modes.

It allows for commodity-wise comparison of GHG emissions and total cost of transportation including their environmental cost between movement by road and rail. The tool is intended to facilitate appropriate modal choice for all concerned.

In his opening remarks Special Secretary (Logistics) Pawan Kumar Agarwal remarked on the importance of Digital Transformation in the Logistics space and highlighted the role of Logistics Division in facilitating digital integration across the sector through such critical initiatives that have interface with more than one Ministry / Department.

He further added that the initiatives launched at the event have the potential of creating a lasting and significant impact on the sector."

BOSTON—As usual this summer began with blooming flowers and vegetables in The Mishra Garden and my list of books to read. The first book on the list this year was: The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life by Alice Schroeder (2008 Bantam Books-960 pages.) As I began reading The Snowball a new book arrived at home anonymously sent: The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success by William N. Thorndike Jr. (2012 Harvard Business Review Press—250 pages.)

Generally I read one book at a time but this summer turned out to break almost every guidepost I had created for myself. I was not familiar with the names of many unconventional CEOs in the book which included Tom Murphy of Capital Cities Broadcasting; Henry Singleton of Teledyne; Bill Anders of General Dynamics; John Malone of TCI; Katharine Graham of The Washington Post Company; Bill Stiritz of Ralston Purina; Dick Smith of General Cinemas; and Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway.

I looked in my bookshelf and found Graham’s autobiography: Personal History by Katharine Graham (1998 Vintage Books—642 pages.) I pulled out that book. As I was hauling Personal History my eyes fell on another book: The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds by Michael Lewis (2017 W.W. Norton & Company-362 pages.) This book was also sent to me anonymously by a friend last year (I eventually found out who this dear friend is.) It’s a blessing to have a few good friends who know your interests taste and care about you.

Unfortunately against my own conventional wisdom I started reading all four books at the same time. It was a disaster; and I went back to my inner directive of doing only one thing at a time (Now I am convinced that multitasking is the dullest idea ever invented or evolved.) I finished reading The Outsiders first because it was a short book and each chapter was about an exemplary CEO and since three of them belonged to media and entertainment I wanted to know more about them. Then I read and re-read The Undoing Project. This book truly changed my thinking and decision-making. This book is the story of two friends and psychologists—Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Of these two Kahneman was awarded Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002 for his work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making.

Before I get into the Undoing Project I loved some unconventional thinking of The Outsiders CEOS. Here are a few quotes:

“It is impossible to produce superior performance unless you do something different” –John Templeton

“I change my mind when the facts change. What do you do?” –John Maynard Keynes.

“My only plan is to keep coming to work…I like to steer the boat each day rather than plan ahead way into the future” –Henry Singleton.

“They have not repealed the laws of arithmetic” John Malone.

“Despite her success (Katharine) Graham was plagued by occasional bouts of self-doubt well into her nearly 30-year tenure as CEO. Fortunately she was also strong willed independent and comfortable making controversial unconventional decisions…” The Outsiders.

“Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat energy devoted to changing vessel is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks” –Warren Buffett.

“You’re right not because others agree with you but because your facts and reasoning are sound” –Benjamin Graham.

Now as I said earlier The Undoing Project did change my mind in many ways. It made me realize the stark differences between emotional and rational decisions and how often we make emotional decisions that contain many errors. How we justify our decisions how we experience happiness with anticipation when we experience it and when we remember it? How human mind works or fails to work when it is forming judgements and making decisions? Are we smart to know our own mind well enough to mistrust it? Should we look for the right answer or better answer?

What about all the biases that comfortably reside in our mind and make us err many of our decisions? “Human mind was just bad at seeing things it did not expect to see and a bit too eager to see what it expected to see.” “Maybe the mind’s best trick of all was to lead its owner to a feeling of certainty about inherently uncertain things.”

How often we are impressed by charming personalities? But what the charm might mask: “addictions personality disorders injuries a deep disinterest in hard work.” The book quotes Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey as saying: “Your mind needs to be in a constant state of defense against all this crap that is trying to mislead you. We’re always trying to figure out what’s a trick and what’s real.”

What is the role of memory in human judgement? Can you observe what is happening in our own mind? Most importantly: Is your behavior driven not by thoughts and feelings but by external rewards validations and punishments?

I found the simple questions raised in the book fascinating. For example: “How does the brain creates meaning? Hoe does it turn the fragments collected by the senses into a coherent picture of reality? Why does the picture s so often seem to be imposed by the mind upon the world around it rather by the world upon the mind? How does a person’s understanding of what he sees changes with the context in which he sees it?”

The book emphatically disputes the fact long held by economists that people are smart and rational. Daniel Kahneman thought: “This is what happens when people become attached to a theory. They fit the evidence to the theory rather than the theory to the evidence. They cease to see what is right under their nose.”

The book also touches upon memory of experience of pain and pleasure. People seem to remember the last experience of enduring pain more than the happy times of bygone days. We often see this phenomenon in relationships. When relationship break ups are bitter people forget all the great times they had together in the past and only remember the worst memories pain unhappiness and bitterness. “Last impressions can be lasting impressions” said Dr. Don Redelmeier in the book. So forget about the first impression and seriously think about the last but the lasting impression that is going to linger in the mind for the rest of the life.

The $1.1-trillion tsunami of liquidity that has washed over the land starting in February through the drawdown of Treasury General Account (TGA) has just about run its course and is now petering out.

As of the Fed’s balance sheet for the period ended August 4 the TGA – the government’s checking account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York – fell by another $31 billion from the prior week and by $219 billion for the four-week period to $506 billion.

The Yellen Treasury announced in January that it would draw down this account from $1.6 trillion at the time to $500 billion by this summer. And we’ve arrived:

To accomplish this drawdown the Treasury which is spending money hand over fist raised less money in new debt particularly in short-term Treasury bills and made up the funding shortfall by drawing down its checking account the TGA.

This drawdown has caused $1.1 trillion in cash to flow from the TGA into the economy and thereby into the financial system between February 2021 and now.

The situation originated in the spring 2020 when the Treasury Department issued $3 trillion in new debt to pay for the stimulus and bailout programs and when the Fed bought $3 trillion in securities to monetize this new debt so that the market didn’t have to absorb it.

However the government didn’t spend the $3 trillion it had raised and the unspent amounts remained in the TGA peaked at $1.8 trillion in July 2020 and by the end of the year was still at $1.6 trillion.

The purposeful drawdown of the TGA ends when the account reaches $500 billion which is about now. Going forward the account balance will fluctuate as checking accounts do but it should largely remain around $500 billion.

The $1.1 trillion tsunami of liquidity made its way from the TGA and the Fed’s books (where the TGA is a liability) into the financial system and caused all kinds of issues in the money markets where interest rates began to drop below 0% as all this cash was trying to find a place to go. Even 30-day Treasury bills were trading at 0% or below 0% by early June.

This is when the Fed started mopping up extra cash via its overnight “reverse repos” (RRP). At first the Fed’s offering rate for overnight RRPs was 0% interest. On June 16 it raised the interest it is paying by five basis points to 0.05% (annualized rate). This triggered a flood of cash mostly by money market funds to be handed to the Fed via RRPs and these RRPs have now been at around $1 trillion for over a month.

On Friday the Fed sold $952 billion in overnight – well through Monday morning – reverse repos to 68 counterparties. These counterparties have mostly been money market funds. In other words they handed the Fed $952 billion in cash and obtained securities from the Fed for that amount to earn an annual rate of 0.05% interest on that $952 billion.

Those reverse repos will mature and unwind Monday morning and there will be new repos in a different amount that will unwind on Tuesday.

Reverse repos do the opposite of QE: They absorb cash as the Fed sells Treasury securities for cash and removes that cash from the financial system. With RRPs fluctuating at around $1 trillion the Fed has undone over eight months of QE at $120 billion per month.

Another way of looking at the effects of the RRPs is that they have removed the $1 trillion in liquidity from the financial markets that the drawdown of the TGA has pumped into the financial markets.

Either way of looking at it the RRPs have been a giant sucking sound of cash. One of the effects with the offering rate of 0.05% is that short-term interest rates have risen from 0% or below 0% in early June to around 0.05% now including 30-day Treasury bills and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR the newfangled Libor replacement).

For money market funds banks and other financial institutions that handed the Fed this $1 trillion via RRPs the 0.05% interest that the Fed pays them amounts to an interest income of $1.4 million per 24-hour period. Over the weekend all together they made about $4 million in interest income on the $952 billion in RRPs. If they do this for a whole year it would amount to $500 million in risk-free interest income.

A: Positioning is the art of sacrifice. In essence that means that being really good at something will result in not being as good at something else compared to someone else. And this is OK! Trying to be good at all things to all people is virtually impossible and will leave a company falling short on every metric.

A former colleague of mine from General Mills loves to use the example of Dinner Tonight vs. Chicken Tonight. Dinner Tonight lost the share battle to Chicken Tonight due to positioning.

While one could argue that Dinner Tonight had broader appeal (good for all proteins) if families were serving chicken it became obvious which dinner solution they would choose — the one developed particularly for chicken.

Chicken Tonight sacrificed being good at proteins that weren't chicken.

Positioning is made up of four components: the target the frame of reference (also known as point of parity) the point of difference and the reason to believe.

The target is not always demographically described. Sometimes it is based on a psychographic measure (or a values-driven difference) or a behavioral difference (people looking for gifts) or a particular benefit sought (cavity-prevention toothpaste).

It is important to define a particular segment to target (and note the targeting process requires sacrifice as well).

The frame of reference defines with whom you are competing. Notably Subway defined its frame of reference as fast-food places vs. other sub shops because it was a national pioneer the fast-food market was large and it had a real point of difference compared with other fast-food offerings.

Which leads to the point of difference: The benefit that a product or service offers that is superior to the others in the frame of reference. In Subway's case it was healthiness.

Lastly the reason to believe helps you substantiate your point-of-difference claim. In the case of Subway the ingredients are fresher the sandwiches are made in front of customers and many offerings have fewer calories than fast food.

It is important to write out a positioning statement using all four components. The positioning statement helps guide marketing implementation decisions (product features pricing placement strategy and promotion). Without knowing your positioning you risk having tactics that will not enable you to strategically fulfill your goals in the marketplace.

There’s even evidence to suggest that stevia a popular sugar alternative and natural sweetener may contribute to infertility.

Not all sugar alternatives are created equal and even though something may be labeled as “natural” doesn’t mean it’s without its flaws. Alternative sweeteners in particular are often advertised as healthier choices compared to sugar but in reality they present a whole host of potential health problems if they become a dominant aspect of your diet.

The Artificial Sweetener Craze

We’ve been consuming both natural and refined sugars in our day-to-day diets for as long as we can remember. In the 1950s as the post-war boom in progressive industry and technology blossomed artificial sweeteners became known as “healthier” than sugar and our parents and grandparents’ generations took that concept and ran with it.

Artificial sweeteners became known as “healthier” than sugar in the 1950s.

Even now the fact that a regular soda may contain hundreds of calories versus a diet “sugar free” alternative is pretty compelling to the simplistic part of our brains that may be actively counting calories. But in reality the artificially sweetened option isn’t all that healthy either. Regardless many people watching their weight or being pushed by suggestive marketing may think that choosing an artificial sweetener is actually better for them.

These marketing tactics are especially enticing when foods or drinks are branded as “zero calorie” or “sugar free.” Added sugars are included in the majority of products we passively consume every day and the average adult consumes 22 teaspoons of sugar each day (kids and teenagers consume even more). With this information in mind and with millions of adults facing obesity and conflicting ways of how to combat it it’s no wonder that artificial sweeteners though controversial since their implementation play a major role in our food production.

Is Stevia Affecting Fertility?

There are two distinct kinds of sweeteners: natural and artificial.

Because natural sweeteners are chemical compounds that occur in nature they’re often touted as “better” for us because they’re not synthetic like artificial sweeteners are. But is that really the case? Though stevia an extremely popular sugar alternative is found in nature and has been used for thousands of years there are reported concerns and risks which have long been associated with its consumption.

Native Indians indigenous to South America have been using the stevia rebaudiana herb for generations as a naturopathic remedy in the form of medicinal teas. Stevia is several hundred times sweeter than traditional sugar and is calorie-free making it a natural sugar substitute.

Matto Grosso Indians in Paraguay used stevia leaves in teas as a form of contraception.

Stevia as a sweetener is most commonly found in an isolated compound form. Stevia in its whole leaf form has not been approved by the FDA as of 2016 and there are conflicting reports which allege that stevia in its most base form can be potentially harmful to fertility. This direct risk is associated with a 1968 report which outlines how Matto Grosso Indians in Paraguay were using stevia leaves in teas as a form of contraception.

A subsequent study at Purdue University and another one thereafter in Brazil studied male and female rats and their consumption of stevia with the findings asserting that the stevia-consuming rats were unable to produce as much offspring as the control groups. However many modern fertility specialists have had issues with the methodology of these studies and the possible contraceptive attributes of stevia are still under argument today.

Health Risks Associated with Artificial Sweeteners

While the jury may be out currently on all the potential risks associated with natural sweeteners we’re now fortunately aware of the myriad of risks that artificial sugar alternatives pose to our health. These include popular brands most of us turn to instead of sugar like products containing aspartame xylitol sorbitol NutraSweet Sweet ‘n Low and Splenda. These and many other artificial alternatives can be found in your salad dressing toothpaste yogurt cereal gum and alcoholic drinks among other things.

Ideally zero-calorie artificial sweeteners should be a perfect way for most of us to cut back on sugar and lose weight. But unfortunately constant reliance on artificial sweeteners poses both long and short-term problems.

Artificial sweeteners can increase our risk of obesity diabetes and metabolic disorders.

In the short term artificial sweeteners satiate our cravings for sweetness by confusing our metabolism. As Dr. Stephen Sinatra explains “When you drink a diet soda the sweetener activates your taste receptors just like sugar does – and that in turn stimulates appetite and causes your body to release a number of hormones. One of those hormones is insulin which is produced to remove the anticipated influx of glucose from the blood. However because the sweetener doesn’t have any actual glucose in it the insulin ends up removing whatever sugar is already in the blood – causing blood sugar to dip too low and further triggering the appetite to compensate.”

In the end because our hunger hormones have been essentially tricked into thinking we’ve consumed sugar when we actually haven’t we might end up overeating other junk food to actually satiate those hormones.

In the long run artificial sweeteners can increase our risk of obesity diabetes and metabolic disorders. It can also seriously mess with our gut microbiome which is a delicate ecosystem and can affect everything from digestion to mood.

Artificial sweeteners should also be monitored during pregnancy as overindulgence can lead to risks of developing gestational diabetes and insulin resistance.

Closing Thoughts

Long ago we might have thought of sugar alternatives as our saving grace when it comes to sugar consumption. But experts agree: just because it’s not refined or natural sugar doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best alternative.

In reality there’s no perfect solution to our obsession with sugar and sweeteners in our food although we do know there’s a heavy reliance on both in the food we eat every day.

It’s true that every individual’s diet and needs are different but knowing the risks beforehand of exactly what we’re consuming makes us smarter and better informed eaters as well as consumers.

GM,General Motors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvY2Fycy9nZW5lcmFsLW1vdG9ycy8yMDIxLzA4LzA3L2dtLW9mZmVycy1hcG9sb2d5LWFuZC1zY3JhbWJsZXMtZmluZC1maXgtYm9sdC1maXJlLXJpc2svNTUwMTIxNzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM offers apology and scrambles to find a fix for Bolt fire risk,"On June 13 a 26-year-old Arizona woman woke up to find her 2017 Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle charger's adaptor smoking and melted in her home garage.

She was alarmed. She said she had not received any notice from her dealer or General Motors of a recall on her car. GM had first issued a recall on 68000 of the 2017 through 2019 model year cars last November.

""You could definitely smell the burning and the wall I plug it into had burn marks up it and all the metal around the adaptor had melted"" the woman said. ""We didn’t know if the fire was out or if it was still burning. I Googled it and that’s when I saw all the articles about the Bolt fires.”

From that day forward she said she and her mother have called GM customer care the EV hotline her Chevrolet dealer and the Chevrolet concierge nearly daily. But they are left frustrated because there has been no resolution.

“It’s the scariness and the fear of ‘Will I be able to charge my car? Will I make it work?’ "" she said noting she has a 50-mile roundtrip commute. ""Every day is unknown now. Before I could charge my car at home and have it be fully charged. So it’s been stressful. I charge my car at the public library in case the car sets on fire again.”

The woman who bought the car new in November 2017 asked to not be named to protect her privacy and personal safety. But she's a young professional and her family has traditionally bought Chevy vehicles. She wanted the Bolt — and still wants an EV —because she loved the car and she cares about the environment.

The second global recall was two weeks ago after two more Bolts caught fire recently. After that recall the woman said she received four notices from her dealer.

A class action lawsuit filed earlier this year in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleges that Chevrolet Bolt owners are not receiving the range they paid for because GM recommends owners not fully charge the batteries. The lawsuit alleges that GM may have concealed widespread defects in the batteries suspected of causing the Bolts to catch fire. On Friday a GM spokesman said ""we are not going to comment on ongoing litigation.""

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration records posted online for the 2017 Bolts there have been two recalls and 153 related complaints. In 2018 there were three recalls and 25 associated complaints. And for the 2019 model year there have been four recalls and 78 complaints.

GM engineers are scrambling to find a fix that will keep the cars from catching on fire and GM says it is doing everything it can to appease Bolt customers.

""GM and LG engineers are working around the clock on a fix"" GM spokesman Dan Flores told the Free Press on Monday. ""We understand this second recall is a huge inconvenience for our customers. All I can do is apologize. We are working around the clock. We want to get it done and get the procedure to dealers as soon as we can.”

He could not speak to the Arizona woman's case because he was not familiar with it but he said until there is a fix customers should follow GM's safety procedures including not parking the car in their home garage and keeping it at only a 90% state of charge. GM said those measures should reduce any risks and the vehicle ""should be safe to drive.""

""If someone is not satisfied with that or wants a buyback or trade-in to a different vehicle we are looking at that on a case-by-case basis"" Flores said.

Lemon laws

The Arizona woman wants GM to find her a different car or put in a new battery that assures her the car won't go up in flames.

""To me a resolution would be just to be able to work with GM"" the woman said. ""Neither me or my mom have had luck with finding anyone who’s helpful.""

Short of a fix she would like GM to make a reasonable offer for her car that she paid close to $40000 for an offer that would include the $687 she paid for the charger and now charred adaptor.

As far as getting a refund for the car every state's ""Lemon Laws"" are different said Erik Gordon business and law professor at University of Michigan. In Michigan he said the law offer two ways to get a refund on a car purchase.

If the problem persists after a ""reasonable number of attempts to repair it"" a person is entitled to a refund. It’s presumed that four attempts to repair the same problem within two years crosses the reasonable line.

If the vehicle is out-of-service for 30 or more days during the term of its warranty or during the first year after its delivery whichever comes first.

Most lemon laws follow state guidelines Gordon said because the federal lemon law guidelines are too vague.

According to the federal law Gordon said ""if you’ve been given a full warranty they’re supposed to honor the warranty and repair the vehicle within a reasonable amount of time but it doesn’t define a reasonable amount of time or a reasonable amount of times to repair it"" Gordon said. ""So if you go through the federal law or federal courts you just don’t know if you’ll win or lose.”

Losing ground in the EV race?

But the legal issue is not what's at stake for GM Gordon said it's their reputation with customers and risk in the stock market if it doesn't get a handle on the problems with the Bolts.

“GM is in the court of public opinion where their product looks to people to be so unsafe that you better leave it outside or else it’ll burn your house down"" Gordon said. ""It’s not a courtroom where they have to provide evidence it’s the court of customer opinion.”

Then there's Wall Street.

""If equity analysts and investors look at this as a signal that for all of the announcements GM has made they can’t produce a reliable EV and they can’t figure out how to fix it that is not good for your stock price"" Gordon said.

It's not good for GM's bottom line either. The Bolt recall has already cost GM $800 million the automaker said Wednesday in its second quarter earnings report. That cost made up the bulk of GM’s $1.3 billion in warranty expenses in the quarter. GM still had a good quarter despite a global shortage of semiconductor chips reporting net income of $2.8 billion compared with a net loss of $738 million in the year-ago period.

But GM does not want to lose current or future EV customers over these recalls Flores said. The company spokesman noted that the 2020 and 2021 Bolts use different batteries than those affected by the recall and there have been no problems with the 2020-21 model year cars. Likewise the 30 new EVs GM promises to launch by 2025 will operate on GM's new Ultium battery platform.

""The GMC Hummer EV pickup that will be launched later this year has battery technology that’s two generations beyond the batteries being recalled"" Flores said. ""But I am not downplaying it if they bought these vehicles brand new they expect to not have a problem with the batteries and we’re working as fast as we can to fix it.""

Seven Bolts burn

In November GM issued the first recall on all the 68000 2017-19 model year Bolts because the vehicles potentially posed a fire risk.

GM said at the time the batteries in five vehicles caught fire and injured two people with smoke inhalation. According to GM's initial investigation the five Bolts all had the high-voltage batteries made by LG Chem’s Ochang South Korea facility.

Another commonality among the five vehicles was they were at full charge or right below that when they caught fire. GM warned owners of those vehicles that until dealers can make a software fix the owners should reset their batteries to a maximum of 90% charge to lessen the risk of the car catching fire. If they cannot do that GM advised owners to keep their parked cars away from their garage or carport.

By April GM engineers said they'd figured out how to fix the battery problem. They developed diagnostic software to look for anomalies in the batteries. If problems are found the company will replace faulty parts of the battery. The software was available to the Bolt owners by the end of May.

But since that first recall there have been two more Bolt fires. Earlier this month GM again warned owners of the same Bolt EVs not to park the vehicles in the garage.

“One of the fires we can confirm was a battery fire” Flores said. “It was in Vermont and we confirmed that the fire was battery-related and that customer did have the recall software performed and did everything he was supposed to do.”

The 2019 Bolt that caught fire belonged to Vermont state Rep. Tim Briglin the Associated Press reported. He drove it to work and back home on June 30 depleting the battery to around 10% of its range. He plugged it into a 240-volt outdoor charger that evening and left the Bolt in his driveway.

Around 6:30 a.m. the next day Briglin saw smoke coming from the rear of the car and called the fire department. Only some nearby plants were damaged.

The other EV that caught fire was in New Jersey. GM could not confirm the cause of that fire because the Bolt was on a flatbed truck which was later stolen. That Bolt has not been found.

GM safety recommendations

The existing software fix GM performed on the Bolts during the first recall has been largely successful Flores said but ""not fully effective"" to eliminate fire risk since there was at least one more fire related to the battery.

""We don’t want any more fires we don’t want customers to have to deal with this"" Flores said. ""We don’t have the specific fix determined yet but if you do A B and C we believe you’re effectively reducing the risk of a fire.""

By ""A B and C"" he means:

Return the vehicle to the 90% state of charge limitation using Hilltop Reserve mode (for 2017-18 model years) or Target Charge Level mode (for 2019 model year).

Charge the vehicle after each use and avoid depleting the battery below 70 miles of remaining range.

Park the vehicle outside immediately after charging and do not leave the vehicle charging overnight.

Customers who have not received the advanced diagnostics software should visit their dealer to get the update. After obtaining the software limit the state of charge to 90% and follow the advice above.

The Arizona woman said she is following all the recommendations but the charging restrictions add to her stress.

“You can only charge it up to 90% and not go below 70 miles which limits my mileage” she said. “If I go to work and then want to visit family afterward I burn through that charge in a day.""

And GM's argument that the recalls won't damage its future EV customer base because of new and different battery technology falls flat with Gordon.

""That’s like Boeing saying 'Don’t worry about our 737 crashing because our Dreamliner will be different' "" Gordon said. ""The perception is bad and you’ve got to turn that around. You don’t do that by saying 'Our new ones are a different technology.' You always thought every technology would work.”

The Arizona woman said she and her mother have worked “full on"" since June 13 to get a call back from GM. Finally on July 28 her mother called GM customer care who then patched her to the third-party claims processor and to speak to a claims agent. The women sent in all the required paperwork the agent requested that day but she still has not received a resolution.

The Arizona woman said “I always want to be electric. I know Chevy is coming out with more electric cars but it’s tough going back to them after dealing with all of this.”

GM's Flores said if a customer has an issue they should call the Chevrolet EV Concierge 833-EVCHEVY which is available 8 a.m.-12 a.m. Monday-Friday; noon-9 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Or call their dealer.

""Even one battery fire is not acceptable"" Flores said. ""We’re committed to fixing the issue.”

Special to The Desert Sun

While no longer the tallest arguably the most recognizable skyscraper in the world is the Empire State Building. That the iconic building exists at all is truly remarkable and is due to a quintessential New Yorker John Jacob Raskob.

Raskob was a figure of impressive organizational skills and was considered a financial wizard serving simultaneously as vice president of finance for both DuPont de Nemours and Company and General Motors. In the latter capacity Raskob created the innovative and groundbreaking General Motors Acceptance Corporation the pioneer in automotive credit that for the first time allowed customers the opportunity to buy cars on installment directly from dealers.

Raskob’s time at General Motors came to an end in 1928 when he was offered the national chairmanship of the Democratic Party by his old friend and Democratic nominee for president Alfred E. Smith. When Raskob’s boss at General Motors the very Republican Alfred P. Sloan heard of the offer he demanded that Raskob make a choice either General Motors or the Democrats. Raskob chose the latter serving as DNC chairman from 1928 to 1932.

As one of the nation’s wealthiest men Raskob had the means to build the world’s tallest skyscraper. The roaring 20s made everything seem possible and then the Stock Market Crash of 1929 threw the economy and the country into chaos.

Just two months before the crash Raskob opined for Ladies Home Journal in a piece entitled “Everybody Ought to be Rich.” He suggested every American could become wealthy by investing $15 per month in common stocks at a time when average American's weekly salary was between $17 to $22. “Suppose a man marries at the age of twenty-three and begins a regular savings of fifteen dollars a month — and almost anyone who is employed can do that if he tries. If he invests in good common stocks and allows the dividends and rights to accumulate he will at the end of twenty years have at least eighty thousand dollars… I am firm in my belief than anyone not only can be rich but ought to be rich.”

The ensuing stock market crash caused Raskob and the particularly ironic title of the article to be ridiculed and reviled (yet his concept is fully embraced today).

Raskob so believed in the Empire State Building that despite the crash he invested his immense fortune into its construction. The mammoth project teetered on the very edge of financial disaster and threatened to take Raskob down with it. Against staggering odds Raskob called in every favor he had and managed to bring the unprecedented project to completion. According to Time Magazine the building required 3439 workers and only one year and 45 days to build (the feat is even more impressive when compared to how long building projects take today).

The building opened in the spring of 1931 with Raskob’s dear friend Al Smith in attendance alongside then-Governor Franklin Roosevelt whom Raskob would come to detest. The country was slipping deeper into the Depression and the building would languish for the next decade being referred to as the “Empty State Building.” But after the herculean task of completing the project Raskob deserved a holiday.

From the time of his first visit to Palm Springs Raskob fell under the spell of the desert. He had come originally to visit his friend and fellow New Yorker Samuel Untermyer at his home The Willows. Soon he began returning regularly whenever his business allowed generally traveling via his plush private rail car the Skipaway. The relaxing atmosphere of Palm Springs had a visible effect on the normally shy Raskob to such a degree he began making news not by huge corporate or political dealings but by his heretofore unknown skill at dancing contests at the El Mirador Hotel. The hotel’s tower was the tallest most iconic building in the desert for many years and naturally appealed to Raskob.

Understanding the allure of the West Raskob invested in precious metal mining in Nevada and New Mexico ranching pesticides the aeronautical industry and in a vast tract of desert land.

The Desert Sun took note “It is reported that the old well at the new Desert Springs development across the desert north of Palm Springs has been cleaned out by workmen and found to contain a goodly amount of water. It is also reported that workmen are at this time starting to put down another well on the property… The property adjoins the 2500 acres owned by John J. Raskob…north of Garnet and U.S. Highway 99.” Raskob’s extensive holdings of “hot water bearing lands” would eventually become Desert Hot Springs.

“Road crews are grading streets and a well is being drilled on the upper end of a 2500-acre tract north of Garnet which was purchased last year by John J. Raskob General Motors executive and former National Democratic Committee chairman. This newspaper was unable to contact Mr. Raskob yesterday who is a guest at El Mirador Hotel in Palm Springs. It is reported he is planning to develop his land into one of the finest and most exclusive residential districts on the desert with all utilities underground so that there will be no poles to mar the landscape. It is also said there will be architectural restrictions and only large estates so that residents may have privacy.”

Tony Burke publicity man at the El Mirador and aspiring realtor brokered the huge purchase and was forever grateful to Raskob whom he described as “a diminutive gentleman physically but a giant of industry.” Burke thought Raskob charming and visionary. He initiated plans “for large estates linked by paved roads lined with lampposts with utilities underground. This was a revolutionary concept for any locale outside a big city…provide elegant desert hones on spacious estates for the wintertime use of big corporation executives from the East. Regrettably the plan was dropped when his arch political enemy Mr. Roosevelt was elected president. Raskob vowed he would not advance any project ‘while that man is in the White House.’”

Raskob continued to visit the village of Palm Springs. The newspaper is littered with mentions of his whereabouts and activities. “John Raskob briskest of village walkers quick-striding along the street and very natty sartorially in a brown outfit….” As most New Yorkers seem to rush about the description was fitting of the most quintessential of New Yorkers and builder of the most iconic of New York skyscrapers.

The Detroit-based automaker is credited with building America’s very first muscle car in 1949 and has been churning out hits for more than 70 years.

The muscle cars of today might look different than their ancestors but the idea is still the same: shove a huge V8 engine under the hood and crank up the horsepower. Now GM is revamping its famed COPO Camaro for 2022 and offering it with the largest gas-powered V8 available in a passenger-sized car today.

When customers want to buy a new car these days some automakers let potential buyers simply configure their desired vehicle online and wait for it to be delivered. In the 1960s however customers had no option but to go into a dealership and place an order in-person. The dealer would then order the car with the manufacturer through a specific ordering process—for Chevrolet this could be performed through the Central Office Production Order (COPO) system.

The COPO process was meant for dealers to order very specific options for fleet cars. But before long some dealerships figured out that they could use the COPO process to order crazy performance-oriented versions of street cars by inputting part-specific codes into the vehicle configuration order sheet. In 1968 one Illinois dealer found out that they could order the compact Chevy Nova with a larger big block engine only meant for Chevrolet’s full-sized cars like the Impala. This was the same process used to order the powertrains for some of the famed Yenko Camaros.

Within a few years General Motors got wise to this process and shut it down. There would be no more COPO-built performance cars until Chevrolet officially unveiled its factory-built COPO Camaro in 2011 using that famed COPO term but definitely designing it to their own factory-tuned specifications.

The COPO Camaro known today is a race-specific vehicle meaning that Chevy builds the car specifically to partake in NHRA drag races. As such the manufacturer builds the car with a number of high-performance engines under the hood.

New for 2022 is a 9.4-liter naturally-aspirated V8—the largest V8 available in a car this size from the factory period. This particular motor is built on GM’s “big block” platform like its ancestors from the ‘60s versus all official COPO Camaros produced from 2011 onward which were available only in GM’s “small block” footprint or its more modern LS-coded platform.

The 572-cubic-inch Big Block V-8 engine. Chevy

Using the big block’s larger engine casting Chevy was able to significantly increase the engine’s internal volume by widening the diameter of each cylinder (called the “bore”) and increasing the distance that the piston can travel (“stroke”). These two dimensions make up the displacement of a motor in cubic inches—a measurement of how much air can be pumped through an engine. The 9.4-liter V8 for example has a bore of roughly 4.6 inches and a stroke of 4.4 inches yielding a total volume of 572 cubic inches across its eight cylinders. The small block 5.7-liter V8 has a bore of 4 inches and a stroke of about 3.5 inches or 350 cubic inches.

Larger volume doesn’t necessarily mean more power out of the box. Displacement can generally translate into higher power outputs but there are a number of other factors that influence an engine’s final horsepower.

The 2022 COPO Camaro’s flagship motor is its 5.7-liter small block. Thanks to a factory-fitted supercharger this engine makes 600 horsepower. The 7.0-liter LS-based V8 is another option though it offers a more modest 470 horsepower. And counterintuitively at the bottom of the rankings sits the new 9.4-liter V8 which (despite its physical size) is rated at just 430 horsepower.

The 572 as GM calls the 9.4-liter due to its cylinder displacement has been available to purchase as a standalone performance crate motor for years making as much as 727-horsepower out of the box. The COPO Camaro however receives a significantly more watered-down version—but there’s a reason for that.

[Related: What’s the difference between a sports car a supercar and a hypercar?]

As part of the design process these purpose-built Camaros receive a horsepower rating from the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) the largest motorsports sanctioning body in the world. The organization works to host drag racing events all over the U.S. all of which contain different classes that cars can compete in. These classes help to ensure that a race is fair for participants by imposing restrictions on power weight safety equipment and modifications.

Chevrolet’s race-only Camaro for example is used to compete in the NHRA’s Stock and Super Stock classes based on its weight and the classes’ modification limitations both of which are then subdivided into small subclasses of competing cars. The NHRA determines which subclass a vehicle can participate in based on a ratio of the vehicle’s shipping weight to its horsepower rating and can further limit classes if a vehicle consistently runs a quarter miles faster than the subclass’ index time.

Depending on which motor the vehicle is purchased with its shipping weight and factory NHRA-certified horsepower will determine the class it competes in and for the customers actually buying this car to race that’s a big deal.

As for price expect to foot out $105000 for the vehicle packing the new 9.4-liter or as much as $130000 for the horsepower-hungry 5.7-liter. Chevrolet also offers the car as a rolling chassis where customers can bring their own engine though a price isn’t listed due to limited production. All cars ship with a carbon fiber hood for weight savings and wheelie bars for safety. Plus an optional trunk-mounted parachute can be equipped if desired.

Sadly you won’t find a COPO Camaro roaming the streets. Despite looking similar to something that would end up on a dealer lot the COPO isn’t a street-legal vehicle. Buyers who spring for one of GM’s most brawny rides will only get to use it on the drag strip—but that’s one of the reasons why the car still actually exists."

Khartoum: AlTaghyeer: Interview

Mr. Torre who oversees all VISA operations in more than 90 countries across the CEMEA region was received with a gala dinner at Khartoum’s Corinthia hotel in celebration of his symbolic visit Sudan’s reintegration into the global economy and both VISA and the UCB’s endeavors aimed at ushering Sudan into the cashless digital era.

The industry vet spoke to AlTaghyeer about the purposes of his landmark visit helping Sudan in going cashless and VISA’s commitment to safety and security.

*What are the purposes of your visit to Sudan?

Earlier this year together with our partner United Capital Bank (UCB) we issued the first Visa cards which was a major milestone and was hailed by Sudanese Prime Minister Dr. Abdalla Hamdok as a symbol of the country’s long-awaited reintegration into the global economy.

And now on this important visit to Sudan I look forward to meeting with several major financial institutions and senior government officials to explore opportunities for close cooperation and to advance the adoption of digital payments in the country.

This is directly in line with our commitment to Sudan where we aim to work closely as a partner for the Sudanese government and financial institutions to advance digital payments. This will allow the people of Sudan gain wider access to a reliable convenient and secure payment option and drive financial inclusion – all of which are important for Sudan’s economic growth and development.

As we have seen globally going cashless is a global trend and demand for digital forms of payments including tap-to-pay or online retail is rapidly increasing. Even over the last year we have seen a significant surge in consumer demand for digital or cashless solutions around the world driven by the need to have safe and convenient ways to pay.

We are pleased to be exploring further opportunities to work with partners in Sudan to expand the access to digital payments and financial services more broadly.

*According to the data you’ve gathered would you say that the Sudanese banking system is qualified and up-to-date to utilize Visa’s financial services?

At Visa we believe in working step by step to enable and empower banks to leverage the endless possibilities of digital payments. We are already actively working with eight financial institutions in Sudan and the launch of the first Sudanese Visa card with United Capital Bank (UCB) earlier this year is clear evidence of local interest from both the industry and consumers in being part of a global payments network.

To develop the broader financial ecosystem contribute to the government’s economic reform agenda drive the adoption of digital payments and strengthen consumer education and financial inclusion efforts we rely on the support of our bank partners – and that is why partnerships are very important to us.

We are looking forward to further strengthening partnerships we have in place and establishing new collaborations so that more companies – from financial services companies to mobile operators and telecoms firms can enjoy the benefits that digital payments bring.

*Will Visa operate through local bank agents or will there be other agents?

Yes we are in constant constructive dialogue with key local banks/financial institutions government agencies and other economic stakeholders to see how new partnerships can be forged to build a trusted payments ecosystem in Sudan that will drive digital payments adoption which in turn will help solidify the country’s economic expansion and development efforts.

As mentioned earlier we are already actively working with eight financial institutions in Sudan in addition to our existing partnership with United Capital Bank (UCB). We hope to build more close local partnerships with both traditional and emerging players in Sudan so that they can leverage the resources of our platform to scale and grow their businesses faster and more effectively. This type of partnership approach creates a more inclusive ecosystem with products that can reach the under-banked and unbanked segments of the population.

*What services can the company provide for the Sudanese market?

As the global leader in digital payments Visa’s mission is to connect the world through the most innovative reliable and secure payments network – so individuals businesses and economies can thrive. Visa is more than a credit card and is understood to be the trusted engine of commerce that provides access to the global economy for everyone everywhere.

We facilitate commerce in more than 200 countries and territories among a global group of consumers merchants financial institutions businesses strategic partners and government entities through innovative technologies.

Visa has been providing electronic payments to businesses and consumers for decades and continues to invest in improving convenience reliability security and value. The technology behind Visa is our global network: VisaNet which enables a full range of domestic transaction processing services and provides governments central banks domestic financial institutions and merchants with an instant connection to the global economy.

*Has the company ran preliminary checks on market indicators and how receptive the Sudanese public would be to the visa system?

Going cashless is a global trend which has only been accelerated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The convenience security and reliability of digital payments offers consumers a strong alternative to cash and from our experience globally we have seen that when consumers are given the option to pay digitally they are receptive especially if they’ve had positive experiences.

We also look at a number of other indicators which inform readiness for digital payments and we believe that with a young and growing population and continued strengthening economy that consumers merchants and all stakeholders would benefit from the security and ease digital payments bring. Digital payments enable consumers safer and more convenient ways to pay businesses to drive growth and profits help governments reduce crime raise tax receipts and deliver public services more efficiently.

As consumers in Sudan and globally begin to pay for more goods and services online or with digital payment options we at Visa are committed to ensure they’re doing so safely by leveraging our best practices and experiences in maintaining the highest levels of security.

*Would your company be interested in organizing training courses for those interested in banking services?

As a payments technology network Visa offers a range of product platforms which our financial institution clients (banks) use to deliver credit debit prepaid and commercial programs to their customers. While Visa does not offer banking services we provide training courses to our Visa partners and clients to capture the opportunity that exists.

*Cardholders may have worries pertaining to electronic piracy. How well adapted are the Visa company’s systems in ensuring safe and reliable transaction services for its customer base?

Security underpins everything we do at Visa. We work with our partners globally to promote transparency and improved information sharing regarding threats vulnerabilities and controls between government and private industry between government agencies and between the governments of different nations.

Moving from cash to digital can provide enormous direct advantages to consumers businesses and governments. Digital payments enable consumers safer and more convenient ways to pay businesses to drive growth and profits help governments reduce crime raise tax receipts and deliver public services more efficiently.

As customers in Sudan and globally begin to pay for more goods and services online or with digital payment options we at Visa are committed to ensure they’re doing so safely by leveraging our best practices and experiences in maintaining the highest levels of security.

Our experience in keeping global fraud rates at historic lows—less than 0.1 percent—through a multi-layered approach of investing in human intelligence and technology like A.I.; empowering consumers and clients with tools resources and control to manage risk; and setting governance processes to help businesses and regulators stay nimble is crucial to our work in Sudan.

In addition Visa’s customers (banks and merchants) benefit from a number of other security features that help prevent and disrupt payment fraud (ATM cashouts cybercrime threats eCommerce etc.) These are available to them at no additional cost or sign-up as part of Visa’s continued investment in intelligence and technology.

Consumers identified Visa as the most trusted company to provide financial services or payments among all payment networks and we believe it is due to Visa’s unrelenting focus on eliminating fraud and protecting the payment ecosystem and we are committed to translating our global experience to help in the development of Sudan’s cashless journey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZmludGVjaG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsLXBheW1lbnRzL2ZpbnRlY2gtaW5zaWdodC1hZnRlcnBhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FinTech Insight: Afterpay,"For many global businesses the COVID-19 pandemic has been nothing short of a train wreck but for Afterpay it seems to have had the opposite effect.

The buy-now-pay-later giant has been acquired in a A$39 billion deal by the US company Square whose chief executive Jack Dorsey also founded social media giant Twitter.

Afterpay’s co-founders Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar have taken the group from zero to $39 billion in just six years and we are going to take a look at some key events in their history.

Afterpay Timeline



Afterpay’s co-founders Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar met as neighbours and the pair forged a working relationship. In 2014 they founded Innovative Payments the tool that would blossom into the Afterpay we know today.

2015 -

Afterpay took the first step in its mission with the introduction of its first product in 2015 interest-free instalment plans available instantly at retail stores – either online on mobile or in-store. To pursue its strategy Afterpay needed a technology partner with extensive experience and capability and partnered with Touchcorp.

Princess Polly became the first retail customer with young customers many didn’t have credit cards and started using Afterpay. This allowed them to pay in 4 smaller instalments which boosted average basket size orders by $44 relative to Paypal directly lifting its revenues by 15%.

In June Afterpay raised $8 million recruiting the help of stockbroker Hugh Robertson.

2016 -

May 4th - Afterpay listed at midday at $1 and ended the day at $1.25. The company made a net loss after tax of $1.25 million in the first half of the financial year 2016 on revenue of $220000.

2017 -

In February Afterpay and Touchcorp agreed to merge in a deal worth an estimated $500 million. Under the deal a new listed entity (NewCo) acquired Afterpay and Touchcorp to be owned approximately 64% by Afterpay shareholders and 36% by Touchcorp investors.

That year Afterpay hit 1 million customers and over 7200 merchant partners as they launched in New Zealand.

Afterpay is now looking to expand into new markets in Europe such as Spain and Italy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvbmV3cy9jYW5hZGEvYnJpdGlzaC1jb2x1bWJpYS9iYy1mZXJyaWVzLXN0cnVnZ2xlcy10by1hdHRyYWN0LXF1YWxpZmllZC1tYXJpbmVycy1hbWlkLWdsb2JhbC1zaG9ydGFnZS0xLjYxMzI2MjXSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjEzMjYyNQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BC Ferries struggles to attract qualified mariners amid global shortage employee poaching,"Travellers on BC Ferries are feeling the impacts of a global shortage of experienced mariners as the corporation struggles to hire more than 100 new staff members.

""We are actively recruiting for approximately 60 officer and 50 other key positions"" said Mark Collins BC Ferries president and CEO in a statement. ""Unfortunately the global shortage means qualified mariners are very difficult to find.""

Two sailings between Victoria and Vancouver were cancelled Wednesday evening because of staffing shortages and Collins said BC Ferries was challenged to find replacement personnel on short notice.

Worldwide problem

The ripple effect of staffing issues is being felt around the world as demand for skilled seafarers outpaces supply. Shortages of captains first mates chief engineers and even entry-level seafarers has become acute.

In large part the qualified pool is diminishing due to aging and retirements. A report by the Seafarers' International Union in 2019 said 20 per cent of its membership was set to retire in five years.

The Seafarers' most recent report estimates that by 2026 an additional 89510 officers will be needed to operate the world merchant fleet and there currently exists a shortfall of 26240 certified officers.

BC Ferries CEO says qualified mariners are hard to find due to a global shortage affecting shipping worldwide. (BC Ferries)

Capt. Philip McCarter associate dean of BCIT's marine department says the school actively promotes and markets its seafaring programs but it can be an uphill battle attracting students to a field that doesn't tend to get much limelight.

""It's a tough competitive marketplace to try and hook these young people to at least enter the profession and then stick with it"" McCarter said.

Poaching employees

Students graduating from marine programs at BCIT are immediately snapped up McCarter says. But once an employee is firmly planted in the industry others in the sector will be actively trying to poach them from their employers.

""Shipping companies are hungry for them"" McCarter said. ""Incentives become important not just salaries but work-life incentives.""

BC Ferries is right in the midst of that tough competitive environment as it moves to hire more than 100 staff. McCarter says the company is aggressive in making sure staff are well looked after with the added bonus that they aren't out at sea for months on end.

But it may all be for naught — as travel restrictions ease and the cruise industry gets back on its feet — employee poaching will intensify.

""It's just going to mushroom"" McCarter said."

On this date in Texas Rangers history Rangers pitcher Bartolo Colón won his 246th career game making him the winningest Major League pitcher born in Latin America.

The moment came on August 7 2018 as Colón was playing the final season of his 21-year big league career. At 45 years of age he was winding down a 7-12 season for the Rangers. At Globe Life Park in Arlington Colón and the Rangers hosted the Seattle Mariners as he was looking for his sixth win of the season.

Colón threw well that night going seven innings giving up four runs on eight hits while striking out one and walking none. Colón and the Rangers were down 3-0 going into the bottom of the third inning then the Rangers’ offense went off scoring four runs in the third inning to take the lead and eventually a 12-5 win.

Jurickson Profar Rougned Odor and Adrián Beltré all hit home runs for the Rangers. Odor Joey Gallo and Carlos Tocci each had two hits.

Few pitchers can say they threw longer than Colón who broke into the Majors in 1997 with Cleveland and pitched until 2018 with a one-year break in 2010. His best season came in 2005 when he led the American League with 21 wins while pitching for the Los Angeles Angels. It also turned out to be the season he won his only Cy Young Award. That capped a 10-year run of 10-win seasons along with two All-Star nods.

He resurrected his career in 2012 winning 10 games for Oakland. After that he won 18 games for Oakland in 2013 at the age of 40 and then won 15 14 and 15 games respectively for the New York Mets from 2014-16 with his 15 wins in 2016 earning him his final All-Star Game berth.

He finished his career with 247 wins and 2535 strikeouts.

Also on this date …

Aug. 7 2011: Michael Young became the first Rangers player to reach 2000 hits hitting an infield single off Cleveland’s Josh Tomlin.

That morning in February had started like an ordinary one for the 69-year-old Vietnamese immigrant: By 4:30 a.m. he was out the door of his vanilla-colored Quincy bungalow making the near mile-long walk in the dark to the North Quincy Red Line station to catch a northbound train. Tran always allowed plenty of time so he wouldn’t be late for the 6:45 shift at the foam factory in Somerville where he has worked for more than two decades.

In an instant before the sun rose on a winter’s day the lives of Liem Tran and his family were forever changed.

And just as suddenly he was punched in the left temple the brute force knocking his 110-pound 5-foot-4-inch frame to the sidewalk. His head was cut open and spinal cord severely damaged. A passerby found Tran crumpled and unconscious mistaking him at first in the dark for a trash bag. Police said there was a large amount of blood at the scene.

The mugger fled with Tran’s backpack. But all he got was Tran’s lunch: a serving of rice and caramelized pork. Tran’s wallet containing $58 remained on him.

Police would later arrest 34-year-old Brian Kenney of Quincy and charge him with the attack. Kenney allegedly mugged a second person that same day snatching the handbag of an Asian American woman outside the same T station. She was unharmed.

Six months later long after the headlines of the attacks have faded Tran continues to replay that moment in his head ricocheting between anger that it happened to him and gratitude that he is alive.

Despite a wave of assaults against elderly Asian Americans across the country authorities have ruled that Tran’s attack was not a hate crime but one of opportunity. Kenney who is white has been indicted on two counts of unarmed robbery and one count of assault and battery on a person over 60 causing serious bodily injury. He has entered a plea of not guilty and sits in the Norfolk County jail as his case wends its way through the criminal justice system.

Tran through a translator argued his robbery should be classified as a hate crime because the suspect appears to have targeted Asian Americans. It’s also the only way he can explain the viciousness of what happened.

“I believe the added element of violence is because of anti-Asian hate” he said.

Tran’s family would like to pursue a hate crime charge but Quincy police and the Norfolk County District Attorney’s office say they could not find evidence that race was a motivating factor in the attacks.

“It’s a little disheartening” said Tran’s son Dennis 26 who has moved back home to help take care of his father. “We had to change everything in our lifestyle. I want to guarantee that people don’t get off lightly so it doesn’t happen to anyone else.”

By the time Liem Tran could come home from the hospital spring had arrived ― two months of surgeries recovery and rehab. He arrived in a neck brace and wheelchair. Still it was an improvement. His wife Trang recalled that in the days immediately following the attack he suffered from agonizing pain and was given so much medication it was hard for her to keep track.

Today Tran can walk on his own but he remains frail. His family is too scared to leave him home alone for long stretches fearing a fall would leave him helpless on the floor.

“The doctor said if he hits his neck one more time he can’t move” Trang said in a recent interview at the couple’s Quincy home.

The attack affected nerves that control the right side of Tran’s body. His right shoulder is rigid. His right arm dangles awkwardly. His right hand is non-functional. His sense of balance is off. He cannot dress or bathe himself and he only recently is able to use the bathroom unaided.

While he’s made a lot of progress doctors have told his family not to expect much more.

Trang a nail technician and Dennis take turns staying home. The family has installed web cameras throughout the house for the times they can’t be there. More recently Tran has been going out three times a week picked up by a bus to spend the day at a senior care center in Boston. So far he doesn’t much like it his wife said because he has difficulty participating in some of the activities such tai chi and yoga. But having him out of the house gives a much-needed break to the rest of the family

“It has been an exhausting process doing the caretaking” said Dennis.

Before the attack Tran was not one to sit still. He was supposed to retire two years ago from Rogers Foam Corp. where he did assembly work that included operating a saw machine and lifting heavy cases. But he kept going. Instead of working 60 to 70 hours a week including overtime on weekends he pulled back to 40. Tran put in those many marathon days so he could send money to Vietnam to help his mother ― who has since died ― and later to fund the education of Dennis and his other son Jessie.

Even on weekends he used to be out of the home by 7 a.m. his family said. He doesn’t drive and would walk to most places. Sometimes he took the subway to shop at Asian grocery stores in Dorchester. He especially liked to prepare sweet-and-sour soup curries and steamed fish.

Tran came to the United States because he didn’t have much of a future in Vietnam after serving in the South Vietnamese military and siding with the Americans to fight the Communist North. After the United States withdrew and Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese in 1975 Tran and others like him were imprisoned. He spent at least five years in confinement at times under grueling conditions. After his release he moved to Malaysia and later resettled in Boston in 1989.

“He’s very simple. He didn’t bother nobody” said Luat Nguyen a close friend who is also his supervisor at work.

These days Tran spends most of his time watching Vietnamese TV shows and listening to music. His eyes lit up when asked to tick off favorite artists among them Mariah Carey and Celine Dion and eagerly showed off his collection of DVDs of concerts and performances.

It’s not the life he and his family had expected for him before the violence of that February morning but they know the outcome could have been worse.

Dennis recalled doctors telling the family that “if he had fallen an inch off in a different direction he could have died.”

Kenney was apprehended in March after his wife called police to say he had a drug problem and had trashed their Quincy apartment. Officers arrived to find Kenney incomprehensible swaying from side to side. He then became unresponsive and had to be administered Narcan according to the police report.

The Kenneys live near where Tran was robbed and Quincy detectives wondered if there was a connection. After the overdose episode officers put him under surveillance and observed how Kenney wore a gray winter jacket and a pair of Saucony sneakers that matched those of the suspect from the robberies.

Last week a Norfolk County Superior Court judge set a court date in October for Kenney. If convicted he faces up to 15 years in prison on the assault and battery charge alone.

Meanwhile Tran’s medical bills pile up. He remains on a dizzying array of drugs about 17 pills a day. Tran has health insurance but his care still costs about $4200 a month. The family is burning through savings but also has been buoyed by the generosity of friends teachers and alumni of Boston College High School which both sons attended in helping to raise about $34000 through a GoFundMe campaign.

Throughout his months-long ordeal Tran has seldom complained about his plight. But when a court document arrives in the mail the feelings can be hard to contain. The reminder of a slow motion legal process unleashes his frustration.

This humble man who survived prison raised a family in a new land and lived a peaceful productive life until being brutally struck down can’t help but ask: “Why did this happen?”

Doug Saunders is The Globe and Mail’s international affairs columnist and the author of books including Arrival City and Maximum Canada.

The story begins in a tired corner of the city maybe an old light-industrial district. First come the artists and students drawn by low rents and gritty charms; they bring galleries and bars and restaurants. Immigrant families settle buy cheap houses open shops. The resulting street life attracts visitors with cash in their pockets. Some stick around decide it’s an okay place to buy a home and raise children and bring another level of services and businesses. For a while its streets are the liveliest place in town until higher rents and middle-class stasis drive the young and creative into another run-down district a few blocks away leaving the neighbourhood stable and prosperous but more homogenous and somewhat boring.

That vision of the urban district as a living organism morphing and evolving and improving on its own is a familiar story today. Sixty years ago it was almost beyond imagination. In 1961 cities were depopulating as middle classes abandoned them their old downtown districts portrayed as repellant accumulations of filth and crime that governments wanted replaced with public-housing projects or elevated highways. Banks often wouldn’t make mortgage loans for downtown houses while a move to the ballooning ‘burbs was subsidized.

So it’s hard to exaggerate the shock of novelty provoked by the publication that year of The Death and Life of Great American Cities a book that offered an almost scientific dissection of urban neighbourhoods and the forces of life and economics that governed them. Its starting point was that story about an old district layering ever-new communities onto its little streets – a flourishing of urban life its author Jane Jacobs called “the sidewalk ballet.”

That was one of many novel phrases and concepts the book introduced or popularized. So too were the notion of high population density and crowded sidewalks as the solution to crime (“eyes on the street”) the tight mingling of housing and industry and commerce on the same streets as a path to tranquil neighbourhoods the understanding of landlords and developers as potential forces of good of big-money government redevelopment projects as a problem of local-level spontaneity and microscale local investments – “organized complexity” – as a solution.

No other book has so transformed our understanding of cities not just in North America but worldwide – and now 60 years after its publication and 15 years after Ms. Jacobs’s death in Toronto it’s fair to say that no work has transformed cities themselves so much.

And that’s become a problem. While The Death and Life of Great American Cities remains a book everyone ought to read for its conversationally persuasive style as much as for its ideas it is far less valuable today as a guide to action for mayors and planners – in large part because it has become a victim of its own overwhelming success. Ms. Jacobs’s act of painstaking observation has had the effect of changing the very thing being observed to the point that our opening story of the gritty old neighbourhood no longer exists in most real-life cities.

Yet it is at just this moment that Death and Life has become every mayor’s favourite book. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and London Mayor Sadiq Khan have both evoked Ms. Jacobs’s name in launching bold pandemic-era plans explicitly modeled on the ideas in its pages to revitalize their city neighbourhoods and render them more intimate – at least in the central-city areas that were Ms. Jacobs’s focus. Scores of other mayors from Portland to Ottawa to Lisbon are rushing to embrace the “15-minute city” concepts Ms. Hidalgo has popularized in which each downtown neighbourhood has all key aspects of life within walking distance a concept drawn directly from this book.

That’s partly because this is now comparatively easy to do if you limit your scope to the urban core – in good part because Ms. Jacobs’s diverse-neighbourhood ideas have been mainstream urban politics since the 1970s.

The biggest neighbourhood-level challenges facing mayors today involve challenges -- and parts of town -- that weren’t envisioned in her book. Cozy central-city neighbourhoods are no longer jeopardized by mega-freeways and huge inhuman housing projects; if anything they suffer too much intimacy too little population and too little change. And the suburbanization of immigration and poverty mean the districts that most need to shift and evolve are the ones least able to do it on their own without large-scale rescues. The book’s ideas remain compelling but today’s mayors need a few new chapters.

In 1961 Death and Life attracted hate mail from famous planners and politicians and received an essay-length misogyny-tinged denunciation from the great historian Lewis Mumford who saw socialist central-planned garden-city neighbourhoods and strict separation of working and residential districts as the only urban solution. Today that opposition has largely vanished and the book’s core concepts are mainstream canon in urban-design schools and big-city planning departments.

Which might seem surprising because Death and Life is first and foremost an attack on urban planning a cry to get the state out of the neighbourhood and leave it to shift and grow and plan on its own.

Among its most compelling chapters are those making the case against government-owned public housing pedestrianized streets community centres and other perennial planner favourites.

And Ms. Jacobs is perhaps best remembered beyond this book as an activist who waged legendary and much-chronicled battles against the visions of two mighty planning bosses Robert Moses of New York and Fred Gardiner of Toronto.

The two homes she famously lived in 555 Hudson St. in New York’s West Village (then half-industrial and rat-infested) and then 69 Albany Ave. in Toronto’s Annex neighbourhood (then a low-rent student ghetto) were both in the heart of districts that would have been destroyed by those men’s plans. They would have cut their cities in half with superhighways running though New York’s SoHo Little Italy and Greenwich Village and through Toronto’s dense residential neighbourhoods surrounding Spadina Avenue and Dupont Street both of which were to become 10-lane expressways.

It was during her fight against the first project Mr. Moses’s Lower Manhattan Freeway that Ms. Jacobs developed many of the ideas that animate Death and Life. Some she drew from the innovative concepts of the University of Chicago’s pioneering urban sociology department others from heterodox urbanists and scientists of the time. But most came from her own journalist’s critical eye from her constant probing questioning and notetaking.

The hated freeway proposals made her notice something crucial about neighbourhoods something that became central to her case in Death and Life and which remains important today: If they’re not tightly interconnected if they don’t easily bring foot traffic from adjoining districts richer and poorer they will eventually fail as neighbourhoods.

As much as neighbourhoods need to be walkable and diverse in activity in order to thrive – the part of the Jane Jacobs formula that’s invoked by mayors today – she was equally clear that none of that will work if any kind of border or barrier physical or psychological prevents people from easily entering. Whether those borders take the form of freeways or the winding grassy streets of an apartment complex or a campus or industrial park she writes they will “tear a city to tatters.” Boundaries are urban death.

After her victories against the mega-boundaries of Messrs. Moses and Gardiner in the early 1970s cities in North America and Europe largely stopped trying to use top-down planning to create these kinds of physical borders in their inner cities.

As a consequence those gritty urban neighbourhoods began to thrive even if they didn’t always have the population density or diverse range of commercial activities to completely fulfil her “conditions to generate exuberant diversity.”

Downtown is no longer a blank slate. Ms. Jacobs’s former flat at 555 Hudson most recently sold a dozen years ago for US$3.5-million – as she said a few years before her death she could never afford to be a writer there now. Her Albany Avenue house is now certainly worth more than $2-million. There are increasingly few former wholesale districts or neglected residential quarters near the city centre in New York or Toronto or any economically successful major city that can metamorphose and transform the way neighbourhoods do in The Death and Life of Great American Cities.

The neighbourhoods that are hungry for transformation today are more often located far into the inner-suburban perimeter surrounded by those grassy boundaries where no community organizing or bicycle lane or “15-minute” plan or gradual organic change will remove those visitor-blocking barriers and make the sidewalks dance. Today’s urban challenges need another approach.

When I was on a a lecture tour of China nine years ago to discuss my book Arrival City an urban-planning student at Peking University raised her hand to ask a question. “She wants to know if your work is an example of –” and the next phrase gave my translator pause – “Jane-Jacobs-Thought?”

I’d hear variations on that question in several cities and they surprised me. Not the question itself which was a good one – my work in this area really began with conversations and interviews I had with Ms. Jacobs in the 1990s and is in many ways an elaboration on and argument with her ideas.

Rather I was surprised to discover that Death and Life was well-known reading in many Chinese urban-planning departments. You don’t need to spend much time in China’s major cities to notice that Jane-Jacobs-Thought has hardly won the day – the top-down big-money ideas of Mr. Moses and his ilk are a lot more visible.

Where the book’s ideas have prevailed in mainland China however is in the latter-day movements to preserve the remaining fragments of the old working-class districts of major cities – the alleyways and narrow courtyards of Beijing’s old low-rise hutong districts and Shanghai’s labyrinthine shikumen neighbourhoods. The bits of these that have been saved while popular with hipster homebuyers and pleasant to visit are often more museum pieces than living neighbourhoods. They are far from urban organisms owing to the heavy-handed planning and the barriers physical and psychological that surround them. It is impossible for these districts ever again to change from within.

That’s also the big flaw in the use of Death and Life by mayors today. Ms. Hidalgo’s “15-minute” plans are nothing but virtuous and are well worth imitating. But they don’t extend beyond Paris’s ring road that divides city from suburb and in practice are mainly focused within the 17th-century wall that delineates the grand boulevards best known to tourists. The problem is that within this circle with a few important and deserving exceptions Paris already largely is a 15-minute city and has been for a long time.

Likewise the pandemic-era instinct to add bicycle lanes and wider sidewalks to already tight-knit sections of a city is absolutely virtuous and welcomed by privileged downtown residents like me. But most of those districts are no longer the ones that need help – they’re mostly finished evolving. In an already-successful setting these small well-meaning interventions come close to what Ms. Jacobs called “the art of urban taxidermy.”

The sociologist and urbanist Richard Sennett was a friend of Ms. Jacobs’s from her Greenwich Village years (there’s a famous photo from 1962 of the two of them chatting in the Village’s White Horse Tavern a man passed out between them). He recently published a fascinating book Building and Dwelling in which he comes to terms with the limits of Death and Life – “I dwelt in Jane Jacobs’s shadow as a young man” he writes “Gradually I have emerged from it.”

Specifically what he sees missing what he calls “Jane Jacobs’s Achilles heel” is the sort of large-format planning and infrastructure that makes her bottom-up microscale evolutions possible in the first place. He writes: “It won’t do to call as she does the city a ‘collection of communities’ – infrastructure like roads electricity or water needs to be built by scaling from whole to part.”

If the urban circle of life is to be restored amid crises of affordability and segregation much larger interventions will be required. Mayors and urban activists need to think beyond this book and imagine a set of chapters that Ms. Jacobs herself could not have imagined.

The part of Death and Life that should continue to be required reading for any mayor is her description of the four things that make urban neighbourhoods economically and socially successful organic and self-evolving places.

Those four factors – “good mixtures of primary uses frequent streets a close-grained mingling of different ages in their buildings and a high concentration of people” – remain true as much so in the alleyways of downtown as in the grassy slab-apartment districts of the inner ‘burbs. But they happen to be four things that simply don’t exist in today’s most troubled urban neighbourhoods -- and their problems won’t be solved until those factors are delivered. This should be the goal of any mayor today.

First those all-housing apartment districts need to become real neighbourhoods -- and they lack the power or resources to do it on their own. It’s no coincidence that the highest rates of COVID-19 in virtually every major Canadian and U.S. city were located in apartment suburbs (for example northern Etobicoke and western North York in Toronto; Surrey in Greater Vancouver). Their residents overwhelmingly rely on “essential” jobs that are located a long bus ride outside their cluster of apartment buildings leaving them exposed to threats. Those districts need lot more shops and businesses and sidewalks and straight streets and transit stations -- things that won’t suddenly appear simply because some new entrepreneurial-minded people have moved in.

Second there needs to be a lot more high-density housing in neighbourhoods that think they don’t want it -- for example the absence of any apartment buildings in huge single-family-housing swaths of Toronto and Vancouver not only prevents much-needed housing supply increases but leaves those neighbourhoods stagnant and unchanging lacking enough people to justify the subway stations mixed uses and busy sidewalks that allow Jacobs-style evolution to start taking place again.

Third there needs to be a mass knocking-down of boundaries both physical and psychological -- the barriers to human activity and community connection that slow and patient change won’t fix. But the worst of those boundaries are no longer found in the historic urban core; they’re planned and designed into the very shape of today’s most challenged neighbourhoods.

The sort of activist campaigns Ms. Jacobs waged in Greenwich Village in the 1950s and in the Annex in the 1960s and ‘70s need to be adopted by a whole new constituency who live not in dusty 19th-century neighbourhoods but in grassy formerly visionary late 20th-century ones. There’s a difference though: While the last century’s Jane Jacobs campaigned against the interventions of planners this century’s successors need to be campaigning for them. No amount of local committee meetings will create easy foot traffic between poor and wealthy suburban blocks; simple protests won’t straighten the streets and fill the empty spaces with shops and more housing and bring employment into the centre of high-rise districts even when it becomes legal to do so. The entire planning and development-approval process needs to be reoriented to serve the potential future residents of neighbourhoods not their current ones.

Here we begin to see the missing chapters of The Death and Life of Great American Cities. That old story of the ever-evolving sidewalk hasn’t become obsolete -- it’s just that too many neighbourhoods lack the ingredients including sidewalks themselves that might allow that story to begin. To turn tomorrow’s neighbourhoods into living organisms full of tight-knit vitality is going to require more than bike paths. Mayors who want to make a Jacobs-scale difference today need to look beyond the pages of this 60-year-old book.

This single slide — marked up in the yellow scrawl of SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son — captures this era's euphoria over the hyper-scaling of tech startups combusting with extremely low interest rates: The big picture: Cash gushers chase indefensible valuations on delusional growth prospects and paths to profitability with little regard for the reality of the underlying business and market structure.

The slide was uncovered by Wall Street Journal reporters Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell as they wrote the delicious new book ""The Cult of We"" chronicling the wiles and humiliation of Adam Neumann WeWork's day-drinking co-founder former CEO and chief snake-oil salesman.

""As he pondered a bigger investment in WeWork"" the authors write ""Son pushed WeWork's already ambitious financial projections into territory unprecedented in business history. During a meeting with Neumann he scribbled out a vision for a company worth $10 trillion.""

Graphic from ""The Cult of We"" by kind permission of the authors Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell

SoftBank made Goldman Sachs look downright restrained in a pitch deck also obtained by the authors to take WeWork public.

Goldman bankers included the bar chart shown above (""Your Path to $1 Trillion"") which ""played to both Neumann's hunger for a giant valuation and his affinity for simple visuals.""

On the book's cover business journalist Charles Duhigg calls it a portrait ""of how grifters came to be called visionaries.""

The wild-haired Neumann — a yeller who combined a televangelist's frenzy with tequila and weed plus quirks that included strolling Manhattan barefoot — eventually drove his baby off a financial cliff:

The rise and fall of WeWork was enabled by a collision of forces: a man characterized by charisma unbridled optimism and astute salesmanship met an entire financial system primed to fall under his spell.

""Had a frothy venture capital sector not been so obsessed with the search for eccentric and visionary founders"" the authors continue ""WeWork might still occupy only a smattering of buildings in Brooklyn and lower Manhattan.""

The authors told me that COVID shutdown had sunk their reporting travel plans. But it turned out to be easier to talk to key players in the drama when they were stuck at home rather than trying to meet them and gain their trust in a coffee shop. Maureen Farrell who's on The Journal's Deals team told me it's scary how much capital was destroyed during the We Work saga:

""In this era of so much money chasing the next great idea it makes people willing to not have the checks and balances.""

Eliot Brown who covered venture capital and now writes about the SPAC frenzy said Neumann got ""smart people to do dumb things"":

""Theranos was a charismatic entrepreneur making up numbers to trick investors. This was a charismatic entrepreneur using real numbers — but getting them to delude themselves.""

“Wrestling’s a very tough sport” investment banker Andy Rosen who met Novogratz in college told The Post. “When you are on the mat it’s just you. There are no excuses no way out. Mike loves the fight. He also loves a party. I don’t see him going down again because he’s having too much fun now.”

Mike a cryptocurrency billionaire who’s almost as well known for his splashy summer parties as he is for his colorful career on Wall Street certainly seemed to be having fun at his over-the-top bash on Aug. 1.

“A little fire in the belly let’s go!” Mike the CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners yelled before gulping a Fireball whisky shot from an ice luge.

Mermaids aerialists stilt-walkers and hot-dog eating champ Joey Chestnut all played into the Coney Island-meets-Atlantic City boardwalk theme. Neon lights spelled out “Novopark” on the grounds of Mike’s Hamptons horse farm next to his lavish hilltop estate.

As the 56-year-old host strolled the grounds in a metallic blazer with no shirt underneath — only dramatically painted-on abs — buzzy British singer Yola performed. So did Miley Cyrus who Mike paid a reported $1 million and flew in by private jet.

It wasn’t exactly John F. Kennedy partying with the Rat Pack but then again it wasn’t so far off.

Mike is one of seven siblings all of whom are accomplished photogenic and power players in their fields — which often involve a philanthropic public-service element. Like the Kennedys but minus the politics and the sailing the Novogratzes are ambitious close-knit and driven by their parents.

The comparison comes up a lot.

Even when Mike and his siblings were young and living in Heidelberg Germany where their dad was stationed in the military they were always compared to that famous family.

“Nice family. Reminded our family of the Kennedys” said a Novogratz friend from Heidelberg. “So many of them all good-looking.”

In this analogy Mike would be their JFK: Ivy League-educated sporty magnetic loving the limelight and close with his big family.

Instead of Camelot politics Mike became a success — then a failure then a success again — on Wall Street. But it could have gone another way. As he recalled to the New Yorker in 2018 growing up his mother “told everyone I was going to be a senator.”

“They’re the kind of people you think don’t exist because it seems like a lot they touch turns to gold” a friend who has known all the Novogratzes for more than 30 years told The Post. “They’re flawed and they have their ups and downs like everyone else but the planets do seem to align for all of them in many ways.”

Key to the family’s success is their patriarch Robert Sr. who seems to hold as much influence over them as Joe Kennedy did over his own clan.

Now 84 Robert Sr. was a football star at West Point who won the esteemed Knute Rockne athletic award in 1958. He served in the Army for 30 years retiring as a colonel. Along with his wife of 61 years Barbara 80 he moved his brood 18 times in 12 years while he served three terms of duty one in Korea and two in Vietnam.

One report said that “Pops” required his kids to rise at 6 a.m. every day even on weekends.

“The parents expected great things from their kids and they still do” Rosen said. “Family events are monumental to them. No matter how successful all those kids are they still care about what their parents think.”

Mike’s brother Robert Jr. and his wife Cortney named the youngest of their seven kids Major after one of Robert Sr.’s military ranks.

Barbara Novogratz told The Post from her home in Virginia grandchildren shrieking in the background that she’s aware of the Kennedy comparison but shies away from it.

“I love the Kennedys don’t get me wrong” Barbara said. “But you know the [Kennedy] kids came from a lot of money. They had a lot of advantages. Our kids come from an Army family. It’s true we’re all very close … They’re just a nice group of kids who love their families.”

Robert Jr. who goes by Bob and Cortney are perhaps the most well-known of the Novogratz bunch thanks to their TV career: Along with their telegenic children now ranging in age from 12 to 23 and including two sets of fraternal twins they starred in the Bravo reality show “9 By Design” and HGTV’s “Home by Novogratz.”

The duo have gut-renovated and flipped homes in New York and LA for more than 20 years. In 2015 they moved to a 1926 home called “the Castle” in the Hollywood Hills. They bought it for $3.25 million and sold it for $12 million in 2018 after renovating it. Currently they’re overhauling an iconic pink townhouse at 114 Waverly Place in Greenwich Village that they bought in 2019 for $8.5 million.

Their oldest child Wolfgang 24 left a promising high school basketball career to become an actor and has been in six movies since 2018.

Son Breaker 20 and named for the 1980 Australian film “Breaker Morant” (about “a real renaissance guy a poet who would break the wild horses” Cortney has said) is touring the country with his band this summer.

One downtown mom called the social media accounts of Bob Cortney and their kids the “guilty pleasure” of her social set. “People are always checking their Instagrams to see what incredible new thing or place they’re up to today.”

They detail their lives in New York in St. Tropez at their getaway in the Berkshires — where they weathered the pandemic — and their palatial beach digs in Trancoso Brazil.

“You want to hate them but they’re pretty nice people” said another downtowner whose children went to school with some of the kids.

Among Robert Sr. and Barbara’s other accomplished Kennedy-esque children is Jacqueline Novogratz 61 the founder and CEO of Acumen a non-profit global venture capital fund investing in startups that helps the world’s poorest communities. She is married to Chris Anderson who runs the TED Talks organization.

Her 2020 book “Manifesto for a Moral Revolution: Practices to Build a Better World” is opposite in personality many say to her high-octane brother Mike. But she told the Wall Street Journal that he’s a fixed member of her “kitchen cabinet.”

“We would have these big debates with him saying that the key was to make a lot of money and then give back to the world and I’d say it was to just start giving to the world” Jacqueline said.

One brother John 47 is a principal at Millennium a global alternative investment firm and another 43-year-old Matt is a co-founder of Candy Digital a tech firm that teamed with Major League Baseball to buy trade and share officially licensed baseball content NFTs.

There is also Elizabeth 49 who runs The Well Daily — a wellness newsletter — along with Mike’s wife Sukey. Sister Amy 45 recovered from a brain tumor about 10 years ago and founded a Netherlands-based sustainable seafood fund Aqua-Spark that includes 19 portfolio companies valued at $180 million.

But the flashiest of the high-achieving siblings sources agree is Mike.

A self-made billionaire he was a top wrestler at Princeton and briefly a helicopter pilot with the National Guard. His Wall Street career includes time at Goldman Sachs and the Fortress Group but he crashed and burned through at least two fortunes before betting big on Bitcoin.

He calls himself the “Forrest Gump” of Bitcoin because he was in the right place at the right time a longtime friend told The Post. Crypto was taking off “and Mike had the balls to run with it.”

He met his wife Sukey Cáceres whose parents come from Puerto Rico on a blind date when he was 25 and they now have four kids ranging in age from 18 to 25. All were in attendance at Dad’s big party last week: Sons Nacho and Chris respectively dressed as a French sailor and in a toga and daughters Gabriela and Anna danced with other guests on the headphones-only dance floor.

The wildly extravagant bash “was par for the course with Mike and more than worth it” said old friend Rosen.

But according to several sources the party animal also has a philanthropic side. He’s chairman of the Hudson River Park Friends and his family foundation focuses on criminal justice reform.

Mel Carter grew up in a poor neighborhood in Flatbush and overcame considerable odds he said to become a senior vice-president at Republic Records. Mike became his financial mentor in 2018 after they met — where else? — at a party.

“Once a month he sits down with me and says ‘This is what you should invest in this is what you shouldn’t'” Carter told The Post. “For people like me from the ‘hood [and] without a lot of education we don’t always make the best financial investments. Mike was so good that I started linking him up with rappers and we go live on Instagram every month going over this stuff. He is an amazing dude.”

A dude not afraid to administer a metaphorical chokehold — not unlike how the Kennedys exerted their own form of pressure to succeed.

“Don’t kid yourself — Wall Street is filled with guys like him” said one person who knows Mike from the Goldman Sachs days. “You either have your quiet geeks who get by with their brains or you have your alpha athletes or military guys like Novogratz who run down anyone in their way. You gotta be like that. Novogratz goes long and loud on crypto everywhere he can and he moves markets. That’s how you play the game.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA4LTA3L2JhcmNlbG9uYS1naXZlcy11cC1tZXNzaS1zLXN0YXItcG93ZXItdG8tdHJ5LWZpeGluZy1pdHMtZmluYW5jZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barcelona Gives Up Messi's Star Power to Try Fixing Its Finances,"Widely regarded as the best player of his generation Lionel Messi couldn’t make FC Barcelona’s balance sheet a winner.

“Food is playing a much more central part in office life and businesses are using their food offers to try and influence behaviour” said Robin Mills UK and Ireland managing director at catering company Compass Group. “We are now fully part of these reopening conversations and part of this new world as companies think about how to get people to come back.”

After more than a year of empty offices and zoom calls pandemic restrictions are easing and businesses are trying to figure out how to manage in-office working plans. With uncertainty over whether Britain’s vaccination program will contain the fast-spreading delta variant some workers don’t want to return to the office at all. Companies are treading a fine line allowing flexibility while trying to fill expensive office space and reinvigorate their business culture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvYnVzaW5lc3Mvd29ya3BsYWNlLXZhY2NpbmF0aW9ucy1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1yZW9wZW5pbmdzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,They Don't Want the Shot. They Don't Want Colleagues to Know. (Published 2021),"Vincent Taranto has felt like less of a pariah at work in the last few days.

For more than two months Mr. Taranto 31 was among the only employees required to wear a mask at his job because he was unvaccinated. Though he was wary of the vaccine and skeptical that he was at risk of getting seriously sick he was concerned that his decision to avoid the shot had left him exposed to judgment from colleagues.

“I don’t want to look like the crazy anti-vaxxer to my co-workers” he said.

But after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended last week that Americans in high-risk areas should wear masks indoors Mr. Taranto who works at a large company in the outdoor industry no longer worried that he was sticking out like a sore thumb.

“Everyone complained about it” he said about the new masking guidelines. “And I’m like ‘It’s not that big of a deal; I’ve been doing it the whole time.’”

Whether or not to receive a coronavirus vaccine has for the most part been a private medical decision. But as some workplaces have begun determining how to safely bring employees back to the office — drawing them from behind dissociated Zoom screens into interactive meeting rooms — that choice is becoming increasingly public."

By Molly Bronner

[broadstreet zone=”59982″]

FRAMINGHAM – The City of Framingham recently evaluated all city-owned culverts to determine the condition of each and form a plan to extend their usage.

There are 98 culverts in Framingham. A culvert is “a tunnel carrying a stream or open drain

under a road or railroad” as defined by Oxford Languages.

The culverts throughout the city range in age from 5 to 100 years.

The City found 9 of the culverts to be in critical condition.

The City identified 33 to be in poor condition with 56 culverts to be satisfactory.

Hartford Street’s culvert ranked highest on their scale with a risk score of 88.

[broadstreet zone=”59983″]

The City’s main focus is now directed towards the 9 culverts in critical condition specifically

those ranking in the top five.

The City used a modified version of the 2017 Culvert Condition Assessment Manual from the

Nature Conservatory at UMass Amherst and the MobileVUE app in order to approach the task of evaluating each culvert. The manual provided the team with a list of key factors to identify in each culvert which they could then mark using the app.

Once this data was collected those numbers were then translated over into risk scores.

Each criteria was weighted differently and all collectively totaled up to a score between 0 and 100 with 100 meaning it is at the highest risk of failure.

“Our risk scoring results show it’s valuable to address the culverts of the highest risk and work

down the list to reduce the chances of culvert failures” said Kelly Siry the Water Resources

Specialist at VHB during a meeting last month.

[broadstreet zone=”59984″]

These risk scores could then be translated over into a map and chart that allowed for easy

comparison of the culverts around the city explained Framingham Project Manager Matthew Hayes.

The City of Framingham will seek grants for the culvert repairs with the rest of the funding coming from the City’s general fund.

Culvert failure can cause flooding damaged utilities collapsed roadways and other serious

issues explained the experts in the meeting.

“Understanding culvert conditions helps the City develop inspection and maintenance plans to

prevent further failures down the road” Siry said.

The current culvert repair plan will take place over the course of 5 years and focus on the 5 culverts in the most critical condition.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts announced a municipal culvert grant program earlier this year but the deadline to apply was March 18 2021. Up to $200000 was available for each application. It is unknown if the City of Framingham applied. The state’s program was developed to encourage municipalities to replace culverts with better-designed crossings that meet improved structural and environmental design standards and climate resiliency criteria.

Hasbro has announced three more action figures from the 6″ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles X Power Rangers line. This news delivers the last of the four turtles and their greatest villains: Red Ranger Raph Green Ranger Shredder and a Foot Soldier Tommy round this latest release.

First up is the two-pack of Foot Soldier Tommy and Red Ranger Raphael. It seems a little odd to throw Tommy the Green Ranger in as a member of the Foot Clan. This is made even stranger with the other figure that was recently announced.





Tommy infiltrates the Foot Clan and when the teens from Angel Grove are cut off from their powers Raphael uses Jason’s morpher to become a new Red Ranger.

Of course Raph would be the Red Ranger. That was a given. Pink would have worked too. Imagine Raphael overcoming being put in the most feminine color while being the most fierce of the four brothers. Oh the narrative possibilities would have been endless with that struggle.

Did you expect The Shredder to appear as a version of one of the Power Rangers’ villains? Me too. However Chrome Dome makes his debut in this series as the Green Ranger. Why? I don’t know… He does look pretty cool though.



Shredder uses the power of the Tommy’s coin and morphs into a twisted evil version of the Green Ranger.

The Green Ranger’s outfit suits Shredder well. This design of the prickly villain looks reminiscent of the 2003 TMNT series. He would also make for an awesome cosplay costume.

I was expecting Shredder to be Rita Repulsa and I am still holding out that Kraang will be morphed with Lord Zedd. It makes sense. He’s got an exposed brain and Kraan is a talking brain. What are your thoughts on what other TMNT characters should appear as members of the Power Rangers franchise? Let us know in the comments.

The center hosted Trains at the Tracks for families to learn about the significance of the railroad system in downtown Hershey.

The event included interactive model trains food trucks kids crafts live music and even a self-propelled railcar.

Hershey History Center partnered with model railroaders from Capital PenNScalers NTRAK and Lebanon Valley Rail to display model train layouts including the center's newest exhibit Return of the Chocolate Town Special.

The exhibit is a replica of a 1920s scene of rural life and downtown Hershey and features three N scale model trains that depict the Lebanon branch of the Reading Railroad. It will also display models of historic Hershey buildings including the Hershey Chocolate factory and operating trolley cars.

Hanoi (VNA) - Vietnam has been listed in top 10 emerging markets in the global data centre market by ResearchAndMarkets the world's leading market research store.

ResearchAndMarkets commented that Vietnam has impressive growth international standard service delivery capacity and a large number of organisations and enterprises.

The Vietnamese data centre market stood at 858 million USD last year and is forecast to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of over 14.64 percent until 2026.



The growth in the Vietnamese data centre market was driven by government projects and initiatives the report said.



Data protection is a matter of global concern and is becoming an important issue on the agenda of the Vietnamese Government.



The data localisation requirement under the Cybersecurity Law plus the need for better processing speeds to assist Vietnamese users are the main drivers which are anticipated to significantly enhance the demand for data centres in the country.



The Vietnamese Government's inclination toward digitisation has further bolstered the demand for data centres across the country.



Furthermore the Vietnamese data centre market is driven by the shifting of enterprise data to cloud platforms. This has led to an increase in the adoption of data storage solutions which in turn is expected to positively influence the growth of the market. Additionally growing adoption of big data solutions IoT and cloud-based solutions among others is expected to propel market growth through 2026.

According to the report major players in the Vietnamese data centre market are FPT Viettel-CHT Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group KDDI Hitachi Asia (Vietnam) Hewlett Packard SAP Vietnam IBM Vietnam Microsoft Vietnam and Amazon Web Services Vietnam./.",,,,,,,,,,,,

View the current offers here.

Despite its cool name Iceland is a hot tourism destination right now. Summer in this very northern country sees 24 hours of daylight every day allowing for plenty of time to explore some of the most spectacular scenery you will find anywhere in the world.

The country relies heavily on tourism so has been focused on welcoming back tourists as quickly and safely as possible following COVID-19 lockdowns thanks to a successful vaccine roll-out strict entry requirements and good mask and hygiene compliance.

I was in the country's capital Reykjavik after flying into the country on Iceland's newest airline Play. There are a good number of points hotel options in Reykjavik -- TPG's Andrew Kunesh was one of the first international tourists to enter Iceland this year and was able to review some of the top hotel options.

I settled on the Canopy by Hilton Reykjavik City Centre. While I stay at Hilton group properties fairly regularly since I appreciate that they provide gold status members with free breakfast I had never stayed in a Canopy and didn't know much about the brand. Hilton's marketing team describes Canopy as ""a modern boutique hotel experience offering simple pleasures thoughtful extras and nice surprises.""

There are currently 33 Canopy properties across Europe North America Asia South America and the Middle East. Interesting the Iceland property I stayed in was the very first Canopy hotel.

Here's what I found at the Canopy by Hilton.

Booking

Though you might find a cheap flight there Iceland is definitely not a cheap destination for anything else. Accommodation food alcohol activities and local transportation are usually very pricey especially during the peak summer tourist season.

I booked a King Premium Room at the Canopy hotel directly with Hilton.com at a Hilton Honors discounted rate of ISK 58021 per night (around $462 per night) which included breakfast.

The Hilton Honors program doesn't have an awards chart so it's hard to give you an exact estimate of the cost in points. A standard room reward is priced from as low as 71000 Hilton points per night though in peak periods like when I stayed the points cost rises well over 100000 points per night and up to 218000 points per night for a premium room reward so paying cash for this stay was the sensible option.

Screenshot from Hilton.com

To pay for Hilton hotel stays the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card stands out in the crowded mid-tier category of cobranded hotel credit cards. It comes with elite-like perks at a reasonable annual fee. New cardholders earn 130000 Hilton Honors bonus points after you spend $2000 in purchases on the card within your first three months of card membership. You will also earn 12X Hilton Honors Bonus Points for each dollar of eligible purchases charged on your Card directly with a hotel or resort within the Hilton portfolio.

Location

The hotel has an ideal location right in the center of Reykjavik as the name suggests.

It's located at Smiðjustígur Street (no I still don't know how to pronounce that either) just off Laugavegur the city's main pedestrian street full of charming cafes bars boutiques and restaurants and very easy to find.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

I adored the sense of fun with the bright colors up and down this street both in the giant hopscotch game and brightly colored buildings.

The hotel building itself adopts a far more neutral color scheme and is unlikely to be winning any design awards. Do remember while I was treated to some sunny skies the country experiences some of the most extreme weather of any place in the world so the architecture is designed with that front of mind.

Check-in

As I walked through the main entrance I was immediately struck by the upmarket yet very homey feel. The check-in desk wasn't some hole in the wall at back of the room -- instead it was more like a dining table you might find in a big family home.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

The friendly and relaxed front desk staff member quickly checked me in though brushed over any real features of the property other than breakfast times. She did not advise me if there was a fitness center available at the hotel and I had to ask specifically about any lunch or dinner dining options.

She thanked me for being a Hilton Honors member and handed over a small bar of Icelandic chocolate as a thank you.

She also advised me that masks were no longer legally required anywhere in Iceland including in the hotel. No staff members wore masks at any time during my stay.

This took some getting used to after more than a year of religiously sliding a mask over my nose and mouth when entering any public space though it was a wonderful sense of pre-pandemic normality once I became used to it.

Classic vinyl and a record player and interesting design magazine and hardcover books added to the sense that I'm visiting some cool friend or relative not some stuffy cookie-cutter chain hotel.

Room

The hotel is much larger than it seems from the outside as the owners have decided to link several buildings together creating a rather confusing rabbit warren of stairs and corridors.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

I was assigned Room 303 -- the King Premium Room I had booked. Thankfully it was located in the main hotel building so it was easy to find among the multiple buildings that make up the hotel.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

Upon entering the room there was an open closet to my left with the bathroom to the right.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

I was pleased to see an actual ironing board in the room -- I cannot tell you the number of hotel rooms I've stayed in that provide an iron without the accompanying ironing board meaning I have to pester reception to deliver a board to the room.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

There were nice big and deep drawers with plenty of storage for my belongings.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

I'm not sure it would be properly washed between each guest but I also liked the big heavy warm blanket on top of the wardrobe as well as the kimono-style branded bathrobe. Both would be great for snuggling up in a hotel room on a cold Icelandic day.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

The Canopy brand adopts bright orange as their signature color -- I noticed it on the hotel logo and it was also on these pairs of very loud but very comfortable socks which I did wear several times during my stay and brought home with me too.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

At 215 square feet the room was mostly taken up by the huge inviting and very comfortable king-size bed in the center of the room.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

There was also a day bed squashed into the corner next to the bed.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

There were USB charging plugs and regular European outlets all over the room. I was a little disappointed the plugs were not universal.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

As it is located on a side street I wasn't expecting sweeping ocean views.

The view out of my window was about as bland as you can get.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

What did catch my eye were the artworks and decorations around the large flat-screen television -- a nod to both the country's folklore and liberal politics. Marriage equality has been legalized in Iceland since 2010.

The retro Nordic desk chair was surprisingly comfortable to work at during my stay.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

In between the desk and wardrobe I found some familiar hotel amenities -- an (emptied) mini bar kettle and pod-style coffee machine. There was a sign advising me that Icelandic tap water is some of the purest in the entire world so I should not bother with bottled water.

I can confirm Icelandic tap water is delicious.

The bathroom featured stylish subway tiles with a huge walk-in frosted glass shower.

Apivita toiletries were provided in individual bottles.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

While not huge I thought the room was well appointed and very comfortable. It seemed to fit the Nordic surroundings well.

I kept thinking to myself -- if I were ever to live in Iceland I would want my bedroom to look exactly like this.

Amenities

After being told very little that the hotel had to offer guests I had a good hunt around on my own. Outside were hotel bikes in the signature Canopy orange. Reykjavik is a very walkable city and the weather is rarely warm enough for a breezy bike ride so I doubt these get much use.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

There was no information about any fitness center given to me at check-in or provided in my room via the on-screen menu of hotel amenities so I only stumbled across its by following corridor signage.

It's a great set-up and was deserted so I don't know why the hotel doesn't tell guests about it.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

I also found a rooftop with a few random tables and chairs. I imagine this is for smokers to use as it didn't have the sort of vibes for a sunset drink not that the sun sets in Iceland in the middle of summer anyway.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

Food and beverage

The hotel has three separate food and beverage areas. In the reception area there is a very casual grab and go section where guests can purchase a light meal to either eat in the lobby or take back to their rooms.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

While the space was nice the food was not.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

The limp sandwich I had for lunch tasted like it had been there for several days and was the sort of quality you would expect from a rural highway gas station.

I would recommend the two-minute stroll up to Laugavegur where you'll find considerably better quality food.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

There's also a bar area that connects the main reception area with the main restaurant. It's a pleasant space with a variety of seating options.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

There's a small staffed bar with happy hour drink specials each evening. Given the high price of alcohol in Iceland any savings are very welcome.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

The only food options available are a few bar snacks which I washed down with a local Icelandic beer.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

The bar has an outdoor area though keep in mind it's rarely warm enough to sit outside in Iceland even in the middle of summer.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

Geiri Smart is the name of the hotel's fine dining restaurant.

Despite the removal of many social distancing restrictions like mask-wearing and a city bustling with tourists I was disappointed to discover this was still closed for lunch and dinner because of the pandemic.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

This means that outside of bar snacks and the pre-packaged fairly bland offerings in the lobby there is no food available at the hotel after breakfast.

The restaurant does open for breakfast for hotel guests and it's a really cool space which made me wish I could have had lunch or dinner there even more.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

There was a good range of breakfast options available with cold options including fresh fruit pastries cold cuts muesli and famous Icelandic Skyr yogurt.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

Hot options included bacon eggs potatoes sausages and pancakes.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

Everything was well prepared and good quality.

For the first time during the pandemic I experienced completely normal buffets and it was a wonderful sense of normality in travel.

Juice and filter coffee were available though guests had to pay extra for barista-style coffee.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

A cappuccino was abut $5.50 extra.

(Photo by Ben Smithson/The Points Guy)

With the price this hotel is charging for rooms this left a bitter taste in my mouth and very few people seemed to be ordering specialty coffee once they were advised of the cost. This should have been included in the standard breakfast.

Service

Staff at the Canopy by Hilton provided relaxed friendly yet a little reserved service which I have come to expect with Icelandic people. You won't find staff jumping to open a door for you but they will happily help you if you have any queries.

I was disappointed the staff did not advise me of the available amenities in the hotel like the fitness center given how few options were available. Many guests to Iceland just want a comfortable nights sleep as they're out and about exploring the spectacular scenery but staff should promote things like the hotel's excellent fitness center.

Overall impression

This hotel felt more like I was staying with a stylish Nordic friend than a brand from an international hotel chain. The furnishings and decor struck just the right balance between style and comfort. It was instantly inviting especially during the chilly Icelandic summer.

I doubt I will ever have the chance to actually live in Iceland but if I do I would want my bedroom and bathroom to look exactly like my room at the Canopy did.

The location is perfect -- central enough to be a few minutes walk from the cities best attractions while quiet enough to enjoy uninterrupted rest as it's tucked away on a side street. The only disappointment was the day and evening food offerings although breakfast was good. Hopefully the main restaurant will reopen soon to provide more dining options.

The Canopy brand seems to work really well in this setting -- perhaps that is why Iceland was chosen for the world's first. Iceland is a pricey destination but you'll enjoy a comfortable stay at this hotel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL3RoZS12ZXJ0LWhvdGVsLWEtbmV3LW9sZC1mZWF0dXJlLW9mLWplcnVzYWxlbXMtaG9wZWZ1bC1ob3RlbC1pbmR1c3RyeS02NzYxMDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Vert Hotel – a new-old feature of Jerusalem's hopeful hotel industry,"The view from the 21st floor of the Business and Diplomats Lounge of the recently opened Vert Hotel in Jerusalem is nothing short of breathtaking. Large windows offer a 180-degree perspective of the panorama of Jerusalem and on a clear day one can see right into Jordan.

It is also obvious from this height why the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) put a stop to construction of the new Prime Minister’s Office and Residence on the site initially chosen. Anyone standing on the 21st floor of the hotel with or without a telescope would have a perfect view of the comings and goings in the prime minister’s compound.

Other high-rise towers are planned in the immediate vicinity.

But for the foreseeable future the Vert stands over and above its neighbors.

The building in itself is not new although the interior has undergone a major renovation.

When the hotel opened some 40 years ago it was the first Hilton hotel in Jerusalem and the only luxury hotel within a five-kilometer radius. It later became the Jerusalem Crowne Plaza as part of the Africa Israel Group then headed by Lev Leviev. Four years ago Africa Israel Hotels were bought out by the Dayan family of 12 siblings who have hotel and real estate interests in Israel and abroad.

In keeping with current green trends they renamed the Jerusalem facility Vert made it non-smoking and so far serve meat only through room service and in the dining room on Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Otherwise the menu comprises dairy foods salads and fish.

The hotel though of a higher standard than in the past is not as large as it used to be.

Of the 388 rooms and suites that were part of the original structure only 138 have been allocated to the Vert Hotel and 250 had been remodeled and fitted with kitchenettes to solve the problem of the elderly residents of the Diplomat Hotel at the other end of town.

In June 2014 the American Embassy purchased the Diplomat which had been used by the Aliyah and Integration Ministry to house more than 400 senior citizens most of them immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The Americans were very patient in allowing the residents to remain until they received an alternative accommodation. In the interim some residents died and others moved elsewhere but the overwhelming majority remained at the Diplomat until a permanent solution could be found.

The hotel section also has a new general manager in the person of Sheldon Ritz long known as the diplomat’s diplomat at the King David Hotel with which he was identified for more than 20 years.

Ritz who was born in Durban South Africa has the hotel business in his DNA. His grandfather owned hotels and Ritz’s boyhood dream was to be a hotel general manager. After graduating from the M.L. Sultan Hotel School in Durban and undertaking a couple of hotel courses at Cornell University in New York Ritz relocated to Israel in 1992 and within a few months landed a job as assistant banquet manager at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem the flagship hotel in the Dan chain. He remained there for four years and then moved down the road to what is now the David Citadel but which was then the Jerusalem Hilton (the original Jerusalem Hilton having already been renamed).

Ritz was there for the opening of the hotel and for the visit in 1998 by US president Bill Clinton who together with his entourage took up 385 rooms for four nights. It was an amazing coup over the King David which Ritz describes as “the Blair House of Jerusalem.”

Indeed it was this perspective that caused him to return to the King David in his former position. But Ritz had greater ambitions and in 2000 opened his own business whereby he brought people from overseas to Israel for corporate and family events. In 2003 the intifada put a significant stop to trips to Israel forcing Ritz to close his business. In 2004 he was back at the King David again as assistant banquet manager a factor that did not make him happy but at least he was working in a prestigious hotel.

Fortunately Haim Shkedi the long-time general manager of the King David recognized Ritz’s potential and gave him the opportunity to prove it. Ritz worked his way up through the ranks of the hotel ladder eventually becoming Shkedi’s deputy responsible for dealing with diplomats and foreign delegations.

Always able to deliver on requests even when there were two or three foreign delegations in the hotel at the one time never flustered familiar with protocol and unerringly polite Ritz did such a good job that he was moved to head office where he was in charge of marketing and sales to embassies and government ministries.

However whenever there was a very important foreign delegation he was recalled to the King David for temporary duty and eventually returned there full time.

Ritz has an enviable reputation in the hotel industry and over the years he received several offers to leave the Dan chain and to join another hotel chain. But he had immense loyalty to the King David to Shkedi who he says was his mentor and to the Federmann family which has the controlling interest in the Dan chain.

BUT SUCH loyalty coupled with devotion to duty has a price. Ritz had hoped that when Shkedi retired in early 2020 after 43 years with the Dan chain and 25 as general manager of the King David that he would be tapped to succeed him. But no.

Ritz was so good at his job as No. 2 that there was no chance of him being promoted to No. 1.

It was a lot easier to find someone with the qualifications for general manager than it was to find someone with Ritz’s talent for engaging people and to be unstintingly obliging.

When Tamir Kobrin a native Jerusalemite who had spent many years in luxury hotels abroad was appointed general manager of the King David Ritz stayed on as his assistant and even helped to promote him to the media.

But then came an offer that he could not refuse.

Africa Israel wanted him to be the general manager of its new Vert Hotel and aside from dangling a much improved salary also gave him a free hand to make whatever decisions he saw fit.

When he wanted to use the Presidential Suite for VIP cocktail receptions and asked permission to move the furniture out of the living room the response was “Sheldon you’re the general manager. Do what you want.”

Ritz admits that he left the King David with a heavy heart but at age 55 he realized that if he did not follow his dream now there might never be another opportunity for his aspirations to become a reality.

He is still becoming acclimatized to his new role and is thrilled that in its first week of operations the Vert hosted 80 guests – people who wanted to say that they had been there from the very beginning.

He is confident that there will be many diplomats among his future guests because it will be more convenient for those who are visiting the Foreign Ministry or the Knesset to come to the Vert than to go to one of the luxury hotels on the other side of town. They can come for breakfast lunch or dinner or simply to relax in the 21st floor lounge where they can get refreshments enjoy the view or work if they have to. There are computers in a cubicle in the lounge at the disposal of business people and diplomats.

The fact that the hotel is at the entrance to the city cuts down considerably on travel time. Sometimes getting into or out of Jerusalem takes longer than traveling from the outskirts of Jerusalem to Tel Aviv.

Aside from that the hotel takes comfort and aesthetics into account.

It starts with the circular front desk in the entrance lobby which enables incoming guests to register quickly instead of having to stand in line.

The dining room is only a couple of meters away with strategically distanced tables for two four six and eight and one corner reserved for a larger group.

In the corridor in front of the dining room there are separate buffets to avoid crowding and to enable people with specific tastes to go straight for what they like best.

In addition there’s a bar opposite the buffet with various salads and hot delicacies including small personal shakshukas served in mini skillets.

Inside the dining room there’s also a buffet of cereals and stewed fruits.

The lobby has clusters of armchair sofas and coffee tables in various styles and colors

Among the amenities are a large swimming pool that is covered in winter so as to enable guests to swim year-round; a well-equipped gymnasium; six treatment rooms for massages and a sauna; and balconies attached to every guest room.

Ritz who at the King David greeted five American presidents plus personalities such Prince Charles and Prince William Narendra Modi Silvio Berlusconi Giorgio Napolitano Angela Merkel Nicolas Sarkozy Emmanuel Macron King Hussein Hosni Mubarak Barbra Streisand Bette Midler Warren Buffett and so many others too numerous to mention is hopeful that he will also be able to host royals heads of state prime ministers and foreign ministers at the Vert which he says has an advantage security wise in that the Presidential Suite which was once Leviev’s home away from home is sealed off from other rooms has three separate entrances and of course a spectacular view. Not only is it suitable for heads of state but also for internationally renowned rabbis in that the kitchen in the suite has two entirely separate stainless steel sinks which can be easily kashered to meet the rabbi’s requirements plenty of counter space a glass topped stove and an oven.

The dining room table can comfortably accommodate 10 people; and the large living room has an artificial fireplace replete with ""wood"" logs and a giant television screen.

The bedroom has a large double bed a work table lots of drawers and a walk-in closet; and the bathroom has a closed door toilet a large jacuzzi a shower stall and a sauna.

But perhaps from the perspective of the Foreign Ministry as well as that of foreign embassies all of which are on tight budgets is the issue of affordability.

All new hotels charge running-in prices. The Vert which is no exception will charge considerably less than the average $360-$400 per room per night that most embassies pay.

The benefit for the bona fide tourist is location.

HOLX,Hologic,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzA3LzMtbWVkaWNhbC1kaWFnbm9zdGljLXN0b2Nrcy10aGF0LWxvb2stbGlrZS1ncmVhdC1iL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Medical Diagnostic Stocks That Look Like Great Buys Right Now,"They are coming off strong quarters yet appear to be underpriced based on their fundamentals. Is now a good time to buy?

Everyone loves a bargain and investors certainly aren't immune to that desire. However there's a difference between cheap and underpriced stocks. ""Cheap"" is in the eye of the beholder. An underpriced stock though is one that has a lower share price than its fundamentals say it should.

Three such stocks that fit in the latter category all of which are connected in some way to diagnostic testing are Quest Diagnostics (DGX -0.58%) Hologic (HOLX -0.32%) and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO -4.16%).

Try Quest Diagnostics if you're seeking a deal

Quest Diagnostics is the world's largest provider of medical diagnostic services. Basically if your physician requests bloodwork on you the chances are pretty good (one in three according to Quest) that the company will analyze the test.

The stock us up more than 23% for the year yet its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a miserly 8.7. This is for a company that has three years of revenue growth including last year when a lot of medical tests were deferred.

Quest just reported its second-quarter earnings and through the first six months of the year it had revenue of $5.3 billion up 44% year over year. Net income jumped a reported 284% to $1.1 billion through six months. The company said in its outlook that it expects to have yearly revenue this year between $9.54 billion and $9.79 billion compared to $9.4 billion in 2020.

The reason Quest's stock isn't higher -- along with its P/E ratio -- is investors are concerned that once the pandemic ebbs the need for COVID-19 testing will subside. That has been a revenue driver for more than a year for Quest. However the delta variant's spread shows that the need for COVID-19 testing may likely remain steady or even increase at least through the end of the year as businesses and schools increase testing requirements for employees and students to return.

Looking past that as the pandemic eases more typical medical procedures and testing will likely pick up. Quest has been a consistent stock whose total return has outperformed the S&P 500 Healthcare and Equipment Services Index three of the past five years including last year.

Hologic keeps growing revenue

Hologic focuses on women's health through the early detection of cervical sexual and vaginal issues. The company operates in four segments: breast health diagnostics GYN surgical and skeletal health and makes a variety of diagnostic detection and surgical products from assays to mammography systems and radiographs. The company's stock is up over 4% for the year but despite that it has a P/E ratio of only 9.7.

Hologic's stock hasn't fully rebounded yet from a second-quarter earnings miss despite reporting very strong third-quarter numbers.

Like Quest Hologic is active in COVID-19 testing but according to Hologic CEO Steve MacMillan it has seen an upswing in more traditional healthcare procedures.

In the third quarter the company reported revenue of $1.17 billion up 42% year over year and earnings per share of $1.04 up 96.2% compared to the third quarter in 2020. While diagnostics the segment that includes revenue from Hologic's COVID-19 assays was up 25% the growth in the other segments was more pronounced. GYN surgical was up 148.4% skeletal health grew 70.4% and breast health was up 55.8%. All three of those groups are bouncing back after being slowed by the pandemic last year.

Through nine months the company reported revenue of $3.8 billion already surpassing last year's total for the year of $3.78 billion and making it the 11th consecutive year Hologic has grown revenue. Through nine months the company also lists net income of $1.5 billion more than double the $616 million it reported last year through nine months.

Bio-Rad Laboratories keeps trending upward

Bio-Rad stock is up more than 29% for the year but even with that growth its P/E ratio is a tiny 5.6. The life science research and clinical diagnostics company's stock has grown annual revenue for five consecutive years giving investors a total return of 410.6% over that period.

Bio-Rad has diagnostic tests for nearly everything from veterinary care to food-borne pathogens and CRISPR gene-editing kits.

The company reported second-quarter revenue of $715.9 million up 33.4% year over year with gross margin increasing to 56.1% compared to 54.6 in the same period in 2020.

Bio-Rad's revenue streams are diverse. Chief Financial Officer Ilan Daskal on the company's second-quarter earnings call said that it made $68 million from COVID-19 testing in the quarter which represented about 9.5% of its total revenue.

The one downside in the quarterly report was that net income of $914.1 million was down from $966.4 million in the same period in 2020. That drop was related to changes in the company's Sartorius holdings management said. Taking a further look back at the company's comparative six-month numbers the company reported $1.89 billion in net income compared to $1.65 billion the year before.

A difficult decision

Of the three healthcare stocks Bio-Rad's low valuation diversity beyond COVID-19 testing and history of total return growth make it the most enticing stock for me. But in reality all three stocks should do well as things reopen as none of them are too dependent on COVID-19 testing. Quest's sheer size gives it some advantages of scale and its lower multiple gives it the edge to me over Hologic though that company has the longest track record of revenue increases.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9saWZlLWN1bHR1cmUvYmF5LW1hZ2F6aW5lLzIwMjEvMDgvMDgvYW5udWFsLWRvbmF0aW9ucy10by1zdC1hbnRob255cy1ob3NwaXRhbC1mb3VuZGF0aW9uLWVhc2Utd29ycmllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Annual donations to St. Anthony's Hospital Foundation ease worries,"For an annual donation of $1000 women in the community can help provide critical equipment at St. Anthony’s Hospital in St. Petersburg and make future hospital stays for themselves and their family members a little more reassuring.

“Everyone gets the same clinical excellence at St. Anthony’s” said Donna Cothron of the St. Anthony’s Hospital Foundation. “The hospital provides the big-ticket items but this program can help with things that aren’t in the capital budget.”

Cothron who oversees the philanthropy project for the foundation said the women who contribute “have the opportunity to see advances in health care and be a part of it by providing vital equipment. And they improve access and outcomes for all of our patients.”

The Women in Philanthropy program was launched 14 years ago when Helen Leslie and the late Bettye Black met for lunch and conceived the idea of a women-focused philanthropy project. Both longtime St. Petersburg community supporters wanted to find ways for women to help pay for some necessary and innovative equipment. They also wanted to provide a welcoming environment for local families during hospital stays.

“It’s a fact that women are the principal health care decision makers for their families so they’re intensely interested in the future of health care” states the program’s website.

Women in Philanthropy members make the annual contribution and also vote on how they want the money to be spent. The foundation hosts an annual luncheon for members which Cothron hopes will exceed 200 this year. The luncheon is Sept. 23.

To date the 188 current and past members have donated more than $1.5 million for hospital equipment.

One of their most widely used purchases is the SonoSite ultrasound machine which helps technicians locate veins for IVs in less than 25 seconds with 99 percent accuracy.

“Anybody who has had several unsuccessful needle sticks knows how painful that can be” said Cothron adding that infection rates rise with every failed attempt.

The female philanthropists also funded the LUCAS mechanical CPR machine which can be substituted for in-person chest compressions when a patient is in cardiac arrest. Cothron said a recent patient suffered a heart attack on site and required over an hour of chest compressions. “It would have been very very difficult for a nurse or a group of nurses to have done CPR consecutively for an hour” she said. “Things like this make all the difference.”

In return for their annual contributions Women in Philanthropy members get personal advocates in Cothron and her staff. The foundation representatives will help arrange rooms make physician referrals and visit donors and their family members if they are at St. Anthony’s.

Associated Press

Businesses large and small from McDonald's and Home Depot to local yoga studios are reinstituting mask mandates as coronavirus cases rise. Bars gyms and restaurants across the country are requiring vaccines to get inside.

After a largely mask-free summer it's a reversal no one wanted to see brought on by the fast-spreading delta variant and new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But business owners and workers say they will do what they can to keep their doors open and not slow the economic gains of the past few months.

""We've already been through the worst of the challenges when we shut down the indoors last year"" said Brack May the chef and owner of Cowbell a New Orleans burger joint. ""Let's just get ahead of the curve here.""

May recently began requiring customers to show their vaccine cards for indoor dining. He said he wants to protect his workers who are required to be vaccinated but have children at home as well as his neighborhood where some musicians recently contracted the coronavirus.

►Mask requirement:McDonald's requires masks again for customers and employees in areas with high COVID transmission

►Gallery:These companies are requiring employees to be fully vaccinated

May expects that eventually vaccine rules like his will be commonplace. Next month New York City will start requiring vaccinations to enter restaurants gyms and theaters.

But for now customers are far more likely to encounter mask mandates. After lifting mask recommendations for fully vaccinated people in May the CDC reversed course in late July recommending masks for vaccinated and unvaccinated people in areas of higher transmission.

Confusing requirements

The shifting guidance has caused confusion over which rules to enforce and how. Walmart and Target for instance recently began requiring masks for employees – but not customers – in areas where virus transmission rates are high. McDonald's is requiring masks for both employees and customers. Home Depot's mask mandate is nationwide.

A handful of places like Louisiana the San Francisco Bay Area and Las Vegas are requiring masks indoors.

Many business owners didn't wait for the CDC or their local governments before acting. In mid-July Tamra Patterson reinstituted a mask mandate and reduced seating capacity from 200 to 65 at Chef Tam's Underground Cafe the restaurant she owns in Memphis Tennessee.

""I need every dollar and dime and penny I can get but if I don't have employees healthy I don't have a business. If customers are sick I have nothing"" Patterson said.

Customers are generally receptive to the mask mandate Patterson said. Only one has walked out.

PanTerra Gallery a women's clothing store in Bisbee Arizona reinstated a mask mandate for customers a few weeks ago after watching cases climb nationwide.

""We're a tourist town so it was just a matter of time before it reached us again"" said Lisa Wines a PanTerra employee. Most people are fine with the new mandate she said but some turn around and stomp out of the store.

Not every business supports the mandates. Basilico's Pasta e Vino a restaurant in Huntington Beach California has railed against masks on social media. A sign on its door requires patrons to prove that they're unvaccinated.

Some workers also don't want to see masks return.

Dru W. a grocery employee in Houston who asked not to use his full name for fear of reprisals at work said he was fully vaccinated months ago and enjoys the freedom it gives him to go without a mask. Few stores around him are enforcing the new CDC guidelines he said and he won't either.

""I didn't get both my doses and deal with the rather gnarly side effects only to be told to go back to the way things were during the pandemic"" he said.

But other retail workers see masks as an important way to end the pandemic. Austin Ray Shanks who works at a Walmart in Monroe Washington said he finds masks uncomfortable but necessary. He's disappointed that many customers at his store refuse to wear them.

Marshall Crawley said his gym in Morrisville North Carolina recently announced that it would require masks for vaccinated and unvaccinated patrons. But the rule isn't being enforced he said.

""It doesn't really feel like it is doing much good wearing a mask when everyone around me is not"" said Crawley a client manager for J&J Editorial a managed services company for scholarly publishing.

Crawley believes the CDC went too far when it told vaccinated people they could remove their masks this spring. Now he said it will be too hard to persuade people to put them back on.

Jose Backer who works in customer service at a food packaging manufacturer in Los Angeles County said his company began letting vaccinated workers remove their masks earlier this year. But soon everyone stopped wearing them. That angered Backer who doesn't want a repeat of a COVID-19 outbreak that sickened him and others at his workplace last year. He's relieved that his county is requiring masks for everyone again.

The new wave of mandates give some comfort to companies that never gave up on masks even when U.S. cases ebbed earlier this summer.

Liz Manasek co-owner of Warner Bodies a custom truck manufacturer in Elwood Indiana kept a mask policy in place after watching other companies struggle with different rules for vaccinated and unvaccinated workers.

About 60% of the company's 105 employees are now vaccinated she said. She has told employees she won't consider removing the mandate until that level reaches 80%.

Manasek has gotten some pushback from workers but she reminds them that the policy has been effective. Only one or two employees have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began she said.

""We've just got to hold out and keep on the basics"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc3JlY29yZG5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC9mb290YmFsbC8yMDIxLzA4LzA4L29sbmV5LWN1YnMtMjAyMS1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1mb290YmFsbC1wcmV2aWV3LzU1MDc4ODIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Olney Cubs 2021 high school football preview,"Cory Hogue

Special for the Wichita Falls Times Record News

Jody Guy did not need extra motivation when he was hired in early 2018 to lead an Olney Cubs program that had not won a game in three consecutive seasons.

But the Cubs coach had an encounter at a department store in Wichita Falls that added fuel to his fire.

""Shortly after I was hired I went to Home Depot wearing an Olney t-shirt and an older gentleman asked me if I was from Olney” Guy recently recalled. “I said 'Yes sir' and he asked me if I coach. After I told him I was the new football coach he turned around took a couple of steps turned back around and said 'Good luck' and that stuck in my craw. So I would like to let that man know we've done a pretty good job so far but we're not done.""

Guy has reason to brag about his team after the Cubs made the playoffs in 2020 for the first time since 2006. The five wins for Olney last season equaled the total number of wins over the past nine seasons.

Has the recent success calmed the fire inside Guy? Not even close.

""When we went 0-10 in 2019 I told the team that 0-10 is done and it will never happen again” Guy said. “We made sure that we did the things necessary to put ourselves in a position to have success.

""After we lost in the playoffs last year I told them losing in bi-district is done. We're setting our goals to win as many playoff games as possible. They understand that making the playoffs isn't good enough anymore. They know that goal has been achieved and if we don't achieve more then we haven't been successful.""

Watching the Cubs flexbone offense brings nostalgia to the heart of fans who fondly recall the days before the modern spread formations. Olney’s players have bought into the “retro” system.

""Our kids understand this is what we do and what has made us successful to this point” Guy said. “They enjoy the offense and they like the physicality of our scheme So we’re and our coaches have done a great job selling what we want to do.""

The player tasked with making the reads from under center is sophomore quarterback Gatlin Guy who gained 907 yards rushing with 11 touchdowns last year.

""He expects more out of himself than what I expect from him” Jody said about his son. “He's a good leader and he doesn't get rattled a lot. He doesn't get overly excited and he doesn't get down on himself which is a rarity from a quarterback. That's what we need for our offense to be successful.""

The Cubs had a solid defense last year and will again be led by junior linebacker AB Marquez who led Olney with 128 tackles.

""He's a lot like Gatlin in that he's an even keel kid. He plays one play to the next and is our quarterback on defense. He makes sure we're lined up correctly and he understands our schemes” Guy said. “He's a student of the game and we feel fortunate to have him playing linebacker for us. He has a nose for the football and he's a physical kid.""

While Guy expects his team to play multiple rounds in the postseason winning the program’s first district title since 2000 will be challenging in the highly competitive District 6-2A DII.

""We expect to be competitive. I know some teams are expected to be very good and have been traditional powers but we expect to be competitive” Guy said. “Our kids are stepping off the bus knowing they can win games and that's the attitude shift these kids have made.

""We have to continue to work and gel as a team. We need the guys to continue being students of the game and understand what we're asking them to do and we need our role players to step up this year.""

OFFENSE

The Cubs have six starters returning from last season’s team yet none of the returners played on the offensive line last year.

""We have some good skill guys and we need to stay healthy but we have to replace our offensive line” Guy said. “The offensive coordinator Greg Fortner is the offensive line coach and he took some kids last year that we weren't expecting a ton from and he made them successful.

""I'm confident he'll make sure the guys are in the right spot and playing together. We have some older kids to fill those spots — it's just going to take them some time to gel together and work as a group.""

DEFENSE

The Olney defense was solid in 2020 holding four opponents under 10 points including two shutouts. Guy believes his defense will be reliable this season but is concerned about the depth on his roster.

""Defensively we are not as deep as we were last year” Guy said. “The kids are going to have to rotate on both sides of the ball where last year they only played one side of the ball. Our conditioning may be an issue early in the season as the kids adjust to playing on both sides of the ball.""

EXTRA POINT

Olney ended the Wichita Falls area's longest playoff drought at 14 seasons in 2020. The Cubs haven't made consecutive postseason appearances since qualifying three seasons in a row from 1999 to 2001.

MULTICS was developed in the 1960s by MIT and General Electric as a commercial operating system and had been the system which UNIX writers [Thompson] and [Ritchie] had used. It became a Honeywell product and the source code for its final commercial version was eventually released to the public. Has it become a dusty relic of interest only to historians? Seemingly not because a new version has been released. It’s intended for us on the dps8m Honeywell mainframe simulator rather than physical hardware so perhaps while it’s not such a dusty relic it remains something only for the enthusiast.

We won’t pretend to be experts on the architectures of 1960s mainframe operating systems but it’s interesting to read for a moment about what it was in MULTICS that caused UNIX to be written. For something described by [Ken Thompson] as “Close to unusable” with a fresh release in its 52nd year it isn’t doing badly.

We’ve traced the UNIX story in the past without realising that MULTICS never entirely went away. Shame on us for the omission!

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

The open-top sports car has been equipped with the company’s RS 830+ package that churns out an extraordinary 880 hp and 737 lb-ft (1000 Nm) of torque. Posaidon has achieved these gains by fitting two new ball-bearing turbochargers forged high-performance pistons a sports air filter improved fuel pumps and high-performance spark plugs. In addition the RS 830+ package includes new exhaust manifolds and downpipes with sports catalytic converters as well as tweaks to the ECU.

With its added grunt the GT R Roadster can now sprint to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.9 seconds and hit a 224 mph (360 km/h) top speed. Changes have also been made to the seven-speed dual-clutch transmission to handle the added oomph.

For those that want some added performance from their Mercedes-AMG GT R but don’t want the full 880 hp and 737 lb-ft Posaidon also offers an 830 hp and 700 lb-ft (950 Nm) package. A kit that retains the standard turbochargers is also offered complete with 780 hp and 627 lb-ft (850 Nm). There is also a simple ECU tune available that increases power of the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 to 670 hp and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL25ldy1zdGFybGluay1kaXNoZXMtZm9yLWNhcnMtcGxhbmVzLXRvLWNhcnJ5LXJhZGlhdGlvbi1oYXphcmQtd2FybmluZy_SAV9odHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9uZXctc3RhcmxpbmstZGlzaGVzLWZvci1jYXJzLXBsYW5lcy10by1jYXJyeS1yYWRpYXRpb24taGF6YXJkLXdhcm5pbmcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Starlink Dishes For Cars Planes To Carry Radiation Hazard Warning,"This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp.'s (SpaceX) Starlink satellite internet service is making progress in delivering internet connectivity to vehicles. SpaceX's subsidiary SpaceX Services Inc also referred to as SpaceX has filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) asking it to operate brand new user terminals. These terminals 'high performance' variants of the dishes currently under use by Starlink's beta-testers will provide coverage to moving vehicles including automobiles vessels and aircraft. In its application SpaceX collectively refers to the terminals as Earth Stations In Motion (ESIMs) and it provides details for their technical parameters such as power output and transmit duty cycles.

Starlink Terminals For Vehicles Will Stay Connected To Satellites For Longer

The new terminals will be used on all kinds of moving vehicles including those operating on the ground and in the sea and air. According to SpaceX's application they will lower their transmit power but feature a higher signal gain alongside a higher scan angle and other adjustments suited to their use cases.

While collectively the new terminals are called Earth Stations in Motion (ESIMs) a segment of these are designed to withstand stringent environmental conditions. SpaceX calls this segment of terminals 'High Performance' or HP. Some of the changes that the HP terminals will feature include handling harsher environments by withstanding longer changes in temperature operating at higher and lower extreme temperatures and improving snow melting capabilities.

The company's current dishes are capable of operating at as temperatures low as -30°C (-22°F) and as high as 40°C (104°F) and SpaceX has tested them at 45°C (113°F). A recent heatwave that plagued the United States also revealed a mixed bag of performance for the dishes with some failing at 122°F while others working at a slightly lower temperature of 111°F.

2 of 9

The filing also details Starlink's plans for providing internet coverage on commercial airplanes with SpaceX aiming to provide coverage on U.S.-registered aircraft flying worldwide and non-U.S. aircraft in American airspace. Starlink will coordinate with the local administrations to determine operating parameters and adhere to frequency and spectrum rules for the former use case.

Additionally and more importantly the new terminals will be divided into two categories. One of these will be for the general public with radiation levels in the near field and on the antenna surface below the 1.0 mW/cm² (milliwatts per square centimeters) limit. One mW/cm² equals 10W/m² and the Commission limits radiation to 1.0mW/cm² for 2.4GHz for the general public.

The other set of terminals are for 'occupational' use and their near field and antenna surface power densities stand at 1.57 mW/cm² and 2.12 mW/cm² respectively. For these terminals SpaceX personnel will install them on the desired locations and the terminals will feature a radiation hazard warning showing regions where the radiation exceeds the maximum radiation limit.

As SpaceX notes in the filing:

SpaceX Services will ensure installation of HP ESIM terminals on vehicles vessels and aircraft by qualified installers who have an understanding of the antenna's radiation environment and the measures best suited to maximize protection of the general public and persons operating the vehicle and equipment. An HP ESIM terminal exhibiting radiation exposure levels exceeding 1.0 mW/cm² in accessible areas such as the exterior surface of a radome will have a label attached to the surface of the terminal warning about the radiation hazard and will include thereon a diagram showing the regions around the terminal where the radiation levels could exceed the maximum radiation exposure limit specified in 47 C.F.R. § 1.1310 Table 1.

SpaceX's data also shows that the 'Occupational' terminals will stay connected to the orbiting satellites for a longer duration. This is evident through their transmit duty cycle a value that highlights the percentage of time a dish is actively transmitting data of 33% - a value more than double than that for the terminals designed for general use.

The Federal Communications Commission's guidelines for Radiofrequency exposure limits. Image: 47 CFR § 1.1310 - Radiofrequency radiation exposure limits/ Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute

Finally SpaceX also requested the Commission to grant it a waiver to operate the mobile Starlink terminals in the 12.2 - 12.7GHz frequency band. Like the ordinary terminals these also use this band for receiving data from the operating satellites and current FCC rules do not include mobile satellite terminals under the band.

SpaceX argues that this omission is not due to any technical implications from the ESIMs but is the result of the rules for geostationary satellite terminals being extended to include non-geostationary systems such as Starlink. The wavier enables better service for mobile platforms argues the company due to which it is in the public interest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vYXUucGNtYWcuY29tL2NvbXB1dGVyLW1pY2UvODg2OTUvaHAtOTMwLWNyZWF0b3Itd2lyZWxlc3MtbW91c2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP 930 Creator Wireless Mouse - Review 2021,"Unlike gaming peripherals productivity mice tend toward modest design. The HP 930 Creator Wireless Mouse ($89.99) the company’s newest high-end office mouse for power users is about as far out there as productivity mice get which isn't far: It has a thumb wing and more side buttons than usual. Its solid shape makes it comfortable for long work days. Competing with elite office mice like the $99.99 Logitech MX Master 3 our Editors' Choice pick in this category the 930 Creator also has strong customization features and long battery life. It’s a fine productivity mouse for creative professionals and anyone else.

It’s a Lot of Office Mouse

The HP 930 Creator riffs on what I think of as the modern model for premium office mice. Clad in silver and gray it has a tall wide design—1.72 by 3.06 by 4.88 inches (HWD)—that feels even wider when you factor in the large ripple-textured thumb support protruding from the left side. It weighs 4.66 ounces which is quite heavy for a mouse; you might feel the heft during precision image editing and gaming but otherwise it feels neither heavy nor light. The mildly sloping chassis provides plenty of support across the full width of your hand and the thumb wing allows you to rest your hand on the mouse without gripping it tightly.

The 930 Creator has 10 buttons seven of which are customizable. On top is the usual layout: two clicks a scroll wheel and a button in the center column. In addition to the usual center click the scroll wheel can tilt left or right. The tilt actions scroll left and right by default but I think they serve better for app-specific functions such as opening a new tab in Chrome or showing and hiding meeting participants in Zoom. I also like using the tilt inputs for vertical scrolling as the wheel itself feels loose and at times a bit imprecise.

Four additional buttons are lined up along the seam between the mouse’s top and side plates. The first three are set to back Windows task view and forward; all are customizable. The last button offset slightly behind those is a quick select button that lets you switch among the mouse’s three wireless channels. Once you pair the mouse with multiple devices the quick switch allows you to swap among them with a couple of presses. Having the ability to jump from device to device is really helpful if you regularly use both a laptop and desktop throughout the day.

Let’s talk about those signals a bit. The 930 Creator features two Bluetooth channels which will pair with any Bluetooth-enabled device and a low-latency 2.4GHz wireless connection that pairs via a wireless USB dongle. The 2.4GHz dongle has become the connection of choice in recent years especially for gamers because it tends to be more stable and introduces less lag. However Bluetooth drains less battery and can connect to a wider range of devices. All three channels worked fine for me for general computing including word processing and web browsing even in a “crowded” environment with lots of Bluetooth signals in the air. A dongle storage slot is hidden under a removable panel covering the bottom of the mouse so you won't lose that crucial tiny piece of hardware.

Regardless of whether you use it in Bluetooth or 2.4GHz mode the 930 Creator gets great battery life. According to HP the mouse should last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. That estimate is most likely based on using it in Bluetooth mode but I used the mouse for more than two weeks in 2.4GHz mode and found the battery level only dropped by about 20%. When you need to charge you can continue using the mouse while plugging it in via its USB-C charging cable. However unlike many wireless mice it won't establish a wired connection over the cable so you will need to keep your wireless connection open.

A Near-Excess of Configuration Options

The 930 Creator has a surprisingly robust set of customization features that you access through HP Accessory Center HP’s configuration app for productivity gear. The app (which runs on both Windows and macOS) looks a bit dark and plain but it's very usable. It allows you to remap most of the mouse’s buttons and set multiple types of custom non-input shortcuts among a host of other features.

As with many productivity mice you don’t quite get full control. HP Accessory Center lets you remap seven of the 10 buttons on the 930 Creator; left click wireless select and the button just below the scroll wheel (which switches between segmented and unfettered wheel-scrolling) are locked. It isn’t a huge loss—you shouldn’t remap either of the first two at least—but limiting users this way has always felt a little obnoxious.

Still the set of options you have at your disposal is impressive. Accessory Center allows you to reset your default inputs and make custom profiles for individual apps. For popular apps such as Chrome Microsoft Office and Zoom custom input options include app-specific functions such as opening new documents or tabs. Some apps also allow you to set a radial menu for access to multiple functions. It’s worth noting that figuring out what some of these features do and how they work can get slightly confusing. As you wade deeper into the custom configuration pool you may have to use trial and error to get functions to work as expected.

In addition to your inputs Accessory Center allows you to set extra shortcuts using Edge Layout which triggers actions when you move your cursor to the corners or sides of your screen. Edge Layout works really well for some kinds of shortcuts but not for others. For example if you set one corner to mute your system you won’t be able to unmute it via the same corner because the function is Mute not Toggle Mute. Also if you use multiple monitors the Edge Layout shortcuts apply to both monitors individually which may lead you to accidentally trigger a shortcut when you move your cursor from one screen to another.

A Solid Pick for Creators...and Everyone Else

The HP 930 Creator is a very nice productivity mouse. The name belies a lack of distinctively creative-specific features but power users of any kind will appreciate the bevy of buttons and customization options.

At $89.99 the 930 Creator costs just $10 less than our favorite productivity mouse the Logitech MX Master 3. The two mice are comparable but the MX Master 3 feels more polished in a few small but noticeable ways particularly its precise electromagnetic scroll wheel. Don't give up on the 930 Creator just because there's something even better out there though. It's still one of the best office mice you can get."

The $3.1 million contract for the second phase of the multi-phase contract will allow the developer of autonomous control systems to test a full-scale oceangoing replenishment platform.

Sea Machines said the contract followed a proof-of-concept demonstration which was completed after the company was selected to lead the program in October 2020.

The company proved that its “kit” which turns conventional barges into autonomous platforms could deliver assets to the defense forces capable of replenishing rotary wing aircraft surface vessels and shore stations.

Sea Machines previously said the ready-to-deploy system kits would enable autonomous self-propelled operation of opportunistically available barges.

The equipment will include Sea Machines’ SM300 autonomous-command and control systems barge propulsion sensing positioning communications and refueling equipment as well as items required for global deployment. According to the company each modular kit will meet US Navy criteria and will be in compliance with classifications and regulations from the DOD’s aviation bodies.

Using the SM300 shoreside operators will have remote situational awareness and will be able to demonstrate the capabilities of remote command and control of the vessel her operating systems and flight deck.

Sea Machines is working with FOSS Maritime who is providing naval architecture support engineering and operations management to outfit a remotely commanded deck barge to land helicopters and host a scaled fueling station for aircraft surface vessels and shore replenishment.

Other partners of the program include Huntington Ingalls Industries and Bell Flight a producer of commercial and military vertical-lift aircraft.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Technology companies around the world have been struggling to hire for a long time. In New Zealand there isn't enough ready and available tech talent and the pandemic has effectively turned off the tap for businesses who have relied on overseas recruiting for years.

Fusion Networks CEO Andrew Gurr is maddened by companies who blame the Government or education system for the skills gap.

""They need to take some responsibility themselves for resourcing in their business area. We're just providing an opportunity for them to do that and follow a model that has been so successful for us.""

That opportunity is Awhi a Tinder-like web and mobile app that tries to connect high school students with companies keen to offer work experience and - fingers crossed - full-time jobs.

Gurr's IT services company has been running a paid internship programme targeting Māori and Pasifika high-schoolers since 2018 and recently received a $100000 grant to scale it up.

Awhi means nurture or cherish in Māori and the idea for it was hashed out by techies at an Auckland hackathon in April. Funding from the Launching Pad Charitable Trust and Tāmaki Regeneration Company came through shortly afterwards.

Gurr says 12 companies and two schools Tāmaki College and Westlake Girls High School have signed up so far and Awhi is expected to go live in October.

Tāmaki College has a strong Pasifika and Māori student base who are well aware of the traditional pathways in sport engineering and health sciences says deputy principal Russell Dunn but very few opt to study digital technologies because of a lack of exposure.

""They don't see themselves in these (tech) roles because the people in these roles don't look familiar to them"" he told the Herald.

IBM's P-TECH or Pathways in Technology programme is also going in at the high school level. It kicked off last year recruiting nearly a hundred Year 10 and 11 students from South Auckland's Aorere College and Manurewa High School in a five-year programme that will see them earn a tech diploma on top of NCEA qualifications at completion putting them first in line for jobs at IBM and the Warehouse.

""It's really about recognising capability over credentials"" said Jade Moffat corporate social responsibility leader for IBM New Zealand and Australia who believes engaging at a younger age is a critical way of diversifying the tech workforce.

More than a quarter of the P-TECH students are girls 28 per cent are Māori and 19 per cent are Pasifika.

""There's a growing category of jobs in areas like cloud computing cyber security digital design for example and they require a high school advanced diploma but not necessarily a four-year degree.""

But a university degree remains a formidable barrier to entry says Sam Allen one of the people behind the technology social enterprise Elevating Aotearoa's Future (EAF).

In April EAF and Australia's ARQ Group piloted a training bootcamp specifically geared towards Māori and Pasifika candidates. No prior IT experience or qualifications needed anyone could apply.

Hundreds did and 13 were selected for a 10-week fully paid bootcamp in data analytics followed by work contracts at Government agencies like the ministries of education social development and health.

""We've got amazingly smart people in New Zealand"" says Allen so it's possible to fill the skills gap from within our borders.

Muller says programmes like these are necessary but no silver bullet to the pressing skills shortage.

""Companies have to build their talent pipeline themselves but they also have to make enough money to pay their bills. If their customers are looking for digital transformation and they have to employ data scientists you can't take someone out of Year 12 or 13 and get them to do the job.""

IBM's Moffat says sure but they're not just feeling the labour crunch at the top.

And if students are supported as they develop their careers they won't stay at entry-level for long. ""They have to start somewhere"" she says.",,,,,,

Reach Research Level 2 to unlock Gyarados for Mightywide River (Day). Gyarados appears after you hit a hidden Crystabloom behind one of the waterfalls with an Illumina Orb. You can hit this Crystabloom with an Illumina Orb even at Research Level 1. However nothing happens until Research Level 2.

Players plunge down a waterfall and into another part of the river early in the course. At this point different Pokemon can be found hanging off the protruding branch over the water -- Toucannon Feraligatr Arbok and others. Behind this branch is a waterfall. Scan for a prompt about something that seems to be behind the wall of water. That's the hidden Crystabloom.

Lob Illumina Orbs toward the center of the waterfall until it lights up with a golden glow. Players should see the tips of Gyarados' face and fins poke out of the water as it swims out from behind the waterfall. You can photograph Gyarados here but it's better to wait until later. It doesn't expose enough of its body for a high-scoring shot.

Gyarados won't pop out of the water until the very end of the course. Look for it to your right as the finish line is in sight. Droplets should splash your screen as its head springs out of the water. Take your time: Gyarados stays above the water until the finish point.

While there were a number of quality of life updates applied one of the reasons to be excited is the New Pokemon Snap Barren Badlands Level. Taking place on Voluca Island between the Sweltering Sands and Fireflow Volcano this new level brings with it new sights to see and most importantly new pokemon to take photos of. In this guide we'll be going over which Pokemon you can see in the day and night variants of the level as well as how to get some of the 3-star and 4-star opportunities that we've come across.

New Pokemon Snap Barren Badlands Alternate Path

After reaching Research Level 2 in Barren Badlands you'll be able to unlock the alternate route. As soon as you're able to fire an Illumina Orb at the Crystabloom next to the teetering rock chances are you've already knocked this rock down a couple of times but haven't figured out what it does. If you knock the ball into the water while you're still in front of the geyser you'll be able to take a pathway that leads to the left around the rock and up another geyser.

At night on Research Level 2 Minior won't be obliging enough to shoot down the rock. Instead you need to in the opening segment throw Illumina Orbs at 4 Diglett underground (shown by the dirt moving some) and surfacing them. Once at least four have been awoken throw an Illumina Orb at the Crystalbloom to get them to knock it down.

New Pokemon Snap Barren Badlands - Day

Below is a list of Pokemon you can find in this area:

Diglett

Tepig

Onix

Crustle

Mandibuzz

Hippowdon

Silicobra

Koffing

Swalot

Shinx

Lycanroc (Midnight Form)

Minior

Torchic

Rockruff (RL 2)

Kangaskhan (RL 2)

Scolipede (RL 2)

Salazzle (RL 3)

3-Star Opportunities

Tepig - RL 1

Throw a fruit in front of Tepig and he will run up to it and torch it. Take a photo as he’s cooking his dinner and you’ll get an easy 3-star

Lycanroc - RL 1

Trow a fruit at the Lycanroc and he’ll walk up to it. Instead of eating it he’ll pick it up look at it and then throw it away. Take a photo at any point during this time for it to count as a 3-star.

Crustle - RL 2

On the far side of the geyser at the start of the level you’ll see two Crustle off in the distance hitting each other. Get a good photo of them colliding for a 3-star photo.

Scolipede - RL 2

At the beginning of the level look to your left and up and you’ll see a Hippowdon and behind that is a Scolipede chasing after two Silicobra. Take a photo of it in pursuit and you’ll earn a 3-star photo.

On RL 3 if you take the alternate path you’ll be able to find two Scolipede butting heads with one another. Take a photo of them now for a 3-Star.

Rockruff - RL 2

Take the alternate path and follow it to where the Rockruff and Lycanroc are together. Keep an eye on the Rockruff and at one point he’ll sit down and smile at you. That’s the perfect time for this 3-star photo.

Mandibuzz - RL 2

After the poison pool once you're about to reach the Onix rock walls there will be a Mandibuzz on the ground in front of you. Toss it a piece of fruit and snap a photo while it's eating for a 3-star picture.

Hippowdon - RL 3

Immediately to the left as you begin you’ll see a Hippowdon on a cliff. Watch it and wait for it to shoot sand out of its holes to get this photo.

4-Star Opportunities

Torchic - RL 2

Wehn you are coming past Minior to the point where the two paths meet looking back along the other path you'll see Torchic as well as a Shinx and Tepig. Toss out a fluff fruit near Torchic and to get it he'll jump in the air and fry it giving you a 4-star image for this air frier.

Scolipede - RL 3

Take the alternate path by using the Crystabloom to tip the giant rock into the pool. From there follow the path till you get to the two Scolipede fighting one another. Wait until after they’ve finished butting heads and they’ll lean in and roar at one another take a photo here for the 4-star.

Crustle - RL 3

When you are coming down the entry and see the two Crustle's bashing each other give one of them an Illumina orb. Watch as it knocks the other down and starts celebrating... and take a picture of the crab rave to get a 4-star image.

New Pokemon Snap Barren Badlands - Night

Below is a list of Pokemon you can find in this area:

Tyranitar

Torchic

Rockruff

Lycanroc

Vivillon

Shinx

Mandibuzz

Tepig

Crustle

Scolipede

Swalot

Kangaskhan

Magikarp (RL 2)

Sandshrew (RL 2)

Gliscor (RL 2)

Diglett (RL 2)

Zeraora (RL 2)

3-Star Opportunities

Swalot - RL 1 and 2

In the poison swamp area the Swalot are all under the poison lake. Illuminate the Crystabloom and Swalot all over will burst to the surface. Take a photo of one mid-jump and you’ll get your 3-star.

Kangaskhan - RL 1

After the poison swamp area you’ll go down a slope towards the final stretch of the stage. While you’re here you’ll see a sleeping Kangaskhan wake it up and watch as it walks towards the Lycanroc. It will scare away the Lycanroc take a photo while it’s shouting for the 3-star.

Scolipede - RL 1

Watch the Scolipede in the poison swamp area. If you hit the Crystabloom he’ll approach the poison water and roll around in it.

Tyranitar - RL 2

Wake the slumbering Tyranitar along the path and watch as it throws a tantrum. With it’s hitting its tail on the ground and roaring or when it chases after the NEO-ONE and gets all up in your face you can get a great 3-star Alternatively you can take pictures of it roaring at Zeraora if you trigger their fight for a 3-star image.

Vivillon - RL 2

Take a photo of a Vivillon that’s on the boulder and it should count as a 3-star.

Gliscor - RL 2

Wake up a sleeping Gliscor. As it’s beginning to move and stretch its arms you can get a 3-star photo of it.

Sandshrew - RL 2

Keep an eye on the Sandshrew between the geyser area and poison pool area but don’t do anything to it. After a while it will sit down on its butt. Take a photo of it while it takes a rest there.

Diglett - RL 2

Early on before you can head down the alternate route after you have awoken with the Illumina orb at least 4 Digletts and throw an orb at the crystabloom watch under the rock that gets knocked own and take a picture of the Digletts working together to knock the boulder over. This can be a tough one due to the timing and angles but once you get it you get a 3-star image.

Rockruff - RL 2

On the alternate route as you come across the final chasm you'll see at the far end a foursome of Rockruff Torchic Sphinx and Tepig sleeping. As Mandibuzz approaches wake up Rockruff with a Fluffruit and then light him up with an Illumina orb. Take a picture of him defending his friends for a 3-star image.

Mandibuzz - RL 2

On the alternate route after Rockruff has faced off Mandibuzz it will go to the nearest Kangaskhan. Light it up with an Illumina Orb and it will take out its bad temper at an ignoring Kangaskhan.

Zeraora - RL 2

Before the alternate path wake up Zeraora and let it run up the cliffs. Then while you're out of sight of Tyranitar wake it up. Being annoyed it decides to kick up a sandstorm... and Zeraora doesn't like this. Take a picture of Zeraora while its jumping around or intervening for a 3-star picture.

4-Star Opportunities

Vivillon - RL 1

To the right of the tippable boulder there is a Vivillon on a branch that has the savannah pattern. Take a photo of it for a 4-star shot. Alternatively on the boulder there are a number of Vivillon's. Get one with its wings out wide with the Savannah pattern on the rock for a four-star image.

Shinx - RL 1

During the final section of the level each of the small pokemon you’ve been seeing through the level will keep popping out of holes. Take photos of them as you go and at the end of the stage they’ll be waving to you take photos of Shinx and then snap the final one.

Crustle - RL 2

Wake up the sleeping Tyranitar from a distance instead of attacking you it will instead attack and flip a Crustle nearby. Take a photo of the Crustle while it’s upside down and you’ll get your 4-star photo (poor Crustle)

Tyranitar - RL 2

The other side of the Crustle image above when you wake up the sleeping Tyranitar from a distance take a picture of it roaring and attacking Crustle and you'll have a 4-star Tyranitar image. Alternatively you can take pictures of it fighting Zeraora if you trigger that for a 4-star image.

Kangaskhan - RL 2

After the poison swamp area you’ll go down a slope towards the final stretch of the stage. While you’re here you’ll see several sleeping Kangaskhan. Wake one up and let it stand up a bit then toss a fluffruit in front of it. It will pick it up to feed to the little baby in its pouch.

Rockruff - RL 2

Following standing off Mandibuzz before Rockruff will turn to celebrate with his friends. Take a picture of this good boy on his hind legs to get a 4-star image.

Zeraora - RL 2

Exactly like in the three-star image you need to wake up Zeraora let it run up the hills and then wake up Tyranitar while out of sight so it kicks up a sandstorm. Zeraora will come down to stop it and this time you want to take your image while it's attacking Tyranitar for a four-star image. Alternatively hitting it with an Illumina Orb at the start can also provide some good images.

In addition the company aims to build it adjacent to a university to simplify the hiring of new personnel.

As part of its IDM 2.0 strategy Intel is set to decide on the exact location of its next major semiconductor manufacturing hub in the U.S by the end of this year. The fab will include between six and eight modules that will produce chips using the company’s leading-edge fabrication processes will be able to package chips using Intel’s proprietary techniques like EMIB and Foveros and will also run a dedicated power plant Pat Gelsinger said in an interview with the Washington Post.

Each semiconductor fabrication module will cost between $10 billion and $15 billion so Intel’s investments into the hub over the next decade could be as ‘low’ as $60 billion and could top $120 billion.

“We are looking broadly across the U.S.” Gelsinger told the Washington Post. “This would be a very large site so six to eight fab modules and at each of those fab modules between 10- and $15 billion. It's a project over the next decade on the order of $100 billion of capital 10000 direct jobs. 100000 jobs are created as a result of those 10000 by our experience. So essentially we want to build a little city.”

At this point Intel does not disclose which nodes the first module of the fab will support. Yet since it will start operations sometime in 2024 at the earliest the new facility will probably produce chips using the Intel 4 and the Intel 3 manufacturing technologies. Eventually the fab complex will adopt more advanced fabrication technologies. The production capacity of the upcoming fab is unknown so is its location. Intel needs to build its next manufacturing in a location with well-developed infrastructure adequate supply of water and energy. Also the company plans to build it near big cities with universities in a bid to higher qualified personnel.

“We're engaging with a number of states across the United States today who are giving us proposals for site locations energy water environmentals near universities skill capacity and I expect to make an announcement about that location before the end of this year” Gelsinger said.

Earlier this year Intel outlined plans to spend $20 billion on advancing its manufacturing operations in Arizona. In addition the company will announce a location for its brand new fab hub such as those the company has in Arizona and Oregon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vd2QtYmxhY2stc244NTAtMXRiLW52bWUtc3NkLXJldmlldy10ZXN0aW5nLW9uLWFtZC1hbmQtaW50ZWwtY3B1cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WD Black SN850 1TB NVMe SSD Review Testing on AMD and Intel CPUs,"Today we are taking a look at the WD Black SN850 1TB SSD. This review will be a bit different than other SSD reviews I have published; I actually benchmarked this drive three separate times. The reasoning behind this is that during the timeframe where I was testing this drive my test bench received an upgrade to a Ryzen 9 5900X and in addition I acquired an Intel i5-11600K test platform as well and I ran benchmarks with this drive on all three platforms to see the differences.

The inclusion of the Intel platform is not intended to turn this article into an AMD versus Intel comparison; the Intel chip is operating at a handicap with far fewer threads. Instead I simply wanted to illustrate the differences the benchmark platform can make on drive performance.

Obviously this more than tripled my benchmarking time so it is unlikely to happen again in future drive reviews. One other note this review was actually written a few months ago but kept getting publication pushed back. This matters because this review predates the recent ADATA XPG S70 1TB review so most of this review was written before we had tested that drive.

WD Black SN850 1TB

The WD Black SN850 1TB comes in a double-sided M.2 2280 (80mm) form factor.

As you can see our drive has a preinstalled heatsink on it. Potential buyers need to be aware this heatsink is not intended to be removable. Removing the heatsink will damage either the heatsink the SSD or both. I should know since I removed mine:

Underneath the heatsink are two NAND packages a DRAM cache and the WD controller. Both the controller and the NAND are branded SanDisk and are manufactured by WD themselves. WD calls the controller the “G2” and the NAND 96L TLC. The back of the drive contains nothing at all.

The inability to remove the heatsink might affect some users with motherboards that have built-in M.2 heatsinks and if that is the case then buyers need to take care to acquire the SN850 that comes without the heatsink. I hope that in the future WD can settle on a heatsink design that is removable in a non-destructive manner.

WD Black SN850 Specs

The WD Black SN850 line of TLC-based SSDs is available in sizes ranging from 500GB to 2TB.

My review unit is the middle capacity at 1TB and offers a rated 7000 MB/s read and 5300 MB/s write. Both of these numbers are excellent and position the SN850 as a member of the second wave of PCIe 4.0 SSDs along with the Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus and Samsung 980 PRO. The endurance is rated at 600 TBW which has sadly become the average endurance for drives at this capacity. While 600 TBW is a lot and likely far more than most users will ask of their drives it nonetheless represents a step backward from the endurance seen by the first-gen PCIe 4.0 drives like the Sabrent Rocket NVMe 4.0 that came in well north of 1000 TBW.

CrystalDiskInfo can give us some basic information about the SSD and confirms we are operating at PCIe 4.0 x4 speeds using NVMe 1.4.

Test System Configuration

We are using the following configuration for this test:

Motherboard : ASUS PRIME X570-P

: ASUS PRIME X570-P CPU : AMD Ryzen 9 3900X (12C/24T) / AMD Ryzen 9 5900X (12C/24T)

: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X (12C/24T) / AMD Ryzen 9 5900X (12C/24T) RAM: 2x 16GB DDR4-3200 UDIMMs

Intel system:

Motherboard : GIGABYTE Z590 AORUS ELITE AX

: GIGABYTE Z590 AORUS ELITE AX CPU : Intel i5-11600K (6C/12T)

: Intel i5-11600K (6C/12T) RAM: 2x 16GB DDR4-3200 UDIMMs

Our testing uses the WD Black SN850 1TB as the boot drive for the system installed in the M.2_1 slot on the motherboard. The drive is filled to 85% capacity with data and then some is deleted leaving around 60% used space on the volume.

When moving the SSD between test platforms the drive was erased TRIM’d and allowed to rest for at least an hour before the loading procedure was repeated. The testing order was the 3900X first followed by the i5-11600K and then the 5900X.

Next we are going to get into our performance testing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvbmV3cy9pbnRlbC1oYXMtZGlzY2xvc2VkLW5ldy1kZXRhaWxzLWFib3V0LWl0cy1mYWItY29tcGxleC10aGF0LXdpbGwtcmVzZW1ibGUtYS1saXR0bGUtY2l0eS_SAXJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZW93aW4ubmV0L2FtcC9pbnRlbC1oYXMtZGlzY2xvc2VkLW5ldy1kZXRhaWxzLWFib3V0LWl0cy1mYWItY29tcGxleC10aGF0LXdpbGwtcmVzZW1ibGUtYS1saXR0bGUtY2l0eS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel has disclosed new details about its fab complex that will resemble a little city,"When you purchase through links on our site we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works

Intel has provided new details regarding its latest fab complex in the United States. Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger stated that the new fab campus will cost between $60 billion and $120 billion.

Gelsinger also stated:

We are looking broadly across the U.S.. This would be a very large site so six to eight fab modules and at each of those fab modules between 10- and $15 billion. It's a project over the next decade on the order of $100 billion of capital 10000 direct jobs. 100000 jobs are created as a result of those 10000 by our experience. So essentially we want to build a little city.

By the end of this year Intel will finalize the location of its upcoming major semiconductor manufacturing hub in the United States as part of its IDM 2.0 strategy. The complex will incorporate between six and eight modules that will manufacture chips by employing the avant-garde fabrication processes of the company. Furthermore it will be capable of packaging chips by making use of Intel's propriety techniques such as EMIB and Foveros and will operate a dedicated power plant.

Intel has not revealed which nodes the initial module of the latest facility will support but since it will probably be operational as early as 2024 the fab will likely manufacture chips by employing the Intel 4 and the Intel 3 manufacturing technologies. The production capacity of the new facility has also not been revealed yet.

Gelsinger further said that:

We're engaging with a number of states across the United States today who are giving us proposals for site locations energy water environmentals near universities skill capacity and I expect to make an announcement about that location before the end of this year.

Each semiconductor fabrication module will cost between $10 billion and $15 billion so there is a possibility that the investments by Intel into the complex over the course of the next ten years could top $120 billion or be as low as $60 billion.

A stunning drone light show by Intel was one of the major highlights of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Opening Ceremony bringing the city to life with a spectacle that highlighted the unifying power of the Olympic Games. But this wasn’t the first time all eyes were on Intel at the Olympics. They had done this before at the Winter Olympics in 2018. And yet it didn’t get any easier the second time around.

Both shows were performed on a huge global international stage before a wide audience live broadcast stations and news media. And each came with its own set of unique challenges.

Many of the custom animations were over 300 feet high creating a stunning performance that showcased the creative potential of technology and engineering. These record-breaking drones along with our on-site team had to be strong resilient and able to withstand PyeongChang’s sub-zero weather which barely rose above freezing for the event’s 15 days.

And one in the midst of a global pandemic

For Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games as the official drone partner Intel launched 1824 drones before a wide online audience that reached hundreds of millions across the globe. But this time Intel wasn’t eyeing world records. It wanted to achieve something even more important something all-powerful: unity in an uncertain time. As Ong puts it:

Following a year of struggles and fears because of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic our team strived to bring a global connection of hope and optimism to the Opening Ceremony with the breathtaking symbolic 3D animation of the world floating high above the Olympic Stadium. But the environmental conditions in Tokyo were completely the opposite to those in PyeongChang. The heat was sweltering humidity near 100% and there was a threat of heavy rains but still our team endured and exhibited its unwavering reliability by taking our drones to the sky.

Now while we would’ve certainly loved to see more of Intel at the Tokyo Olympics Closing Ceremony we are sure the team is already working on its next awe-inspiring drone light show. For now here’s a behind-the-scenes video from Intel and Dollywood that explains how these mesmerizing drone light shows actually work.

It was chaos it was compulsively watchable and it was funny. (I still say “Sorry Barilla” out loud every time I open a box of pasta.) Like so many of our modern-content origin stories the video went viral a major streaming platform bought it and now weighing in at six episodes of around 25 minutes each Netflix is pleased to announce the arrival of Cooking with Paris. (Both Netflix and Paris are doing well thank you.)

Some could define the word “cooking” as “preparing (food) for eating especially by using heat” and I can say after watching her use heat to prepare food for eating that Paris is definitely cooking. But I’m not here to critique this as a serious cooking show because it’s not. Cooking with Paris is undeniably “not about the pasta.”

The show follows a vague talk-show format: someone hot charming and famous (Saweetie Demi Lovato and Kim Kardashian West whom I would love to cook with because it seems like she might? She cleans as she goes so I already adore her) comes over to “sous-chef” with Paris to make some sort of themed meal. “Have these two people ever met before?” you might ask yourself. Maybe but who cares? The guests are the least interesting part of this affair.

Note the fingerless gloves.

Some of those who watched the lasagna video that launched 5.2 million views ridiculed Paris’s technique for “searing” meatballs. As I watched her struggle to remove ricotta cheese from its container I remember thinking Damn Paris Hilton is truly so smart. So quintessentially good at being Paris Hilton. Come on—obviously she’s opened a container of something at least resembling ricotta. Right? While you were laughing at her she was laughing at you for laughing at her. And that’s what makes her an artist with a gift for turning public opinion up to 11 spinning straw into even more gold which she then spins into fingerless gloves to cook in.

After watching four and a half episodes I’m still not sure if she can cook or not toggling between giving her too much credit (is she playing up her naïveté in some subversive feminist trope?) and not enough. I am worried for her safety—why is she using a blender to simply combine eggs and cream?

While you were laughing at her she was laughing at you for laughing at her.

And we may never know. That is her brilliance her mystery her gift. It’s why some of us have been collectively obsessed with her for the better part of 25 years fueling her trajectory from rich and famous to richer and famouser. She plays to the people we love her for it and it’s wonderful to see the whole exchange in action.

As a person who has dedicated her life to earnestly attempting to teach people how to cook I have never spent much time with reality television. This show by design is not for me. But something tells me Paris doesn’t care either way.

The mutual fund industry is poised to lose its crown as the dominant passive investment vehicle with the non-active exchange traded fund sector on track to surpass it for the first time.

Global assets under management of passive index-tracking ETFs hit a record $8.66tn at the end of June according to data from Morningstar just $132bn shy of those in passive mutual funds.

The gap has narrowed from $623bn at the end of 2019 and $305bn in December 2020 suggesting that stronger inflows will make ETFs the dominant format for index investment globally in the second half of this year.

Andrew Jamieson global head of ETF product at Citi said the rise of ETFs was “clearly the direction of travel” with the fund structure “setting new records [for assets under management] all the time”.

Net flows into ETFs hit a record $661bn in the first six months of the year according to consultancy ETFGI smashing the previous first-half record of $294bn set in 2020.

“I have been working in the industry for eight years and from the first day I walked in it has been assumed that ETFs are the future. They are just a more efficient fund wrapper than the traditional mutual fund” said Kenneth Lamont senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar.

Passive ETFs have already overtaken index-based mutual funds in the US where the instruments have an explicit tax advantage due to a quirk in capital gains tax regulations.

When mutual fund investors redeem the fund sells some of its underlying holdings in a “cash” transaction potentially triggering a capital gains tax liability for all investors even those not redeeming.

In contrast ETFs do not usually need to sell their underlying securities instead delivering baskets of securities “in-kind” to the authorised participants that create and redeem ETF shares. Trading activity and any capital gains thus occur outside the fund so there is no tax pass-through to investors.

Inflows in to ETFs for the year so far in the US hit $506bn last week comfortably ahead of the $411bn pumped in the country’s mutual funds cumulatively since 2014 according to SPDR ETFs.

While the US tax advantage does not apply elsewhere ETFs are still often cheaper than mutual funds more transparent in terms of their holdings and more liquid offering intraday trading whereas mutual fund transactions take a day or two to be processed.

“In the US assets in passive ETFs have already surpassed passive mutual funds. Outside of the US it’s very possible this trend will continue as we are seeing the general trend towards greater adoption by a wider range of investors” said Eamonn O’Callaghan vice-president European ETF product at Brown Brothers Harriman

Bankers and analysts agree that holdout investors will come under increasing pressure to adapt to ETFs.

Martin Gilbert founder and former CEO of Aberdeen Asset Management lent weight to this argument in a recent interview with ETF Stream saying “one of the mistakes I made [at Aberdeen] was not realising how big [ETFs] would get. Asset managers should have an ETF business; it is the future.”

AssetCo Gilbert’s latest outfit unveiled a deal to buy a majority stake in thematic provider Rize ETF in July.

With ETFs poised for supremacy in the passive field the question is whether they could eventually overhaul mutual funds for active investment as well.

Lamont believed there were “huge regulatory barriers which would need to be crossed” for this to happen with few countries outside the US yet having approved the portfolio-shielding non-transparent ETF models that many active managers crave.

“There is a consensus that even for active funds the ETF wrapper is still superior but the advantages are not enormous over the traditional fund structure so there isn’t a huge incentive for asset managers to pile into the active ETF space” he said.

However Jamieson was confident that active ETFs would “surpass mutual funds in time”. Indeed looking out further still he questioned the long-term survival of mutual funds at all.

“In many ways the ETF wrapper is just the mutual fund version 2.0” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvYWxsaWUtYmV0aC1zdHVja2V5cy10d2l0dGVyLXJlc3RvcmVkLWFmdGVyLW1pc2dlbmRlcmluZy10d2VldC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Allie Beth Stuckey's Twitter restored after 'misgendering' tweet | U.S. News,"Home News Allie Beth Stuckey back on Twitter after being censored by tech giant over ‘misgendering’ tweet

Christian author and podcaster Allie Beth Stuckey gained back access to her Twitter account without having to back down from her comments after the social media giant temporarily locked her account for “misgendering” a trans-identified weightlifter from New Zealand Laurel Hubbard.

“Good morning. I’m out of Twitter jail. Men are still men. Thank you” Stuckey the host of “Relatable” tweeted following the restoration of her Twitter account Friday hours after it was suspended for her previous tweet that said “Hubbard failing at an event doesn’t make his inclusion fair. He’s still a man and men shouldn’t compete against women in weightlifting.”

Twitter removed what it deemed as an “offending” tweet from its platform.

Also on Friday the conservative host tweeted “Remember you can threaten dox harass post porn spread Chinese propaganda and tweet as a member of a terrorist regime here on Twitter but you cannot call a man ‘he’ because that is ‘promoting violence.’”

In an email Twitter had told Stuckey “You may not promote violence against threaten or harass other people on the basis of race ethnicity national origin sexual orientation gender gender identity religious affiliation age disability or serious disease.”

After being censored by Twitter Stuckey told Faithwire in a statement that she had no intention of backing down from her comments about the athlete.

“As a Christian I know two things to be true” she was quoted as saying. “One all people are made in God’s image no matter their stated identity and therefore have immense value and two men are men and women are women. Biology matters. Sex differences matter. Facts matter. I won’t budge on this.”

Hubbard was eliminated from women’s weightlifting at the Tokyo Olympics after failing three attempts in the women’s 87+ kilogram competition but still made history as the first trans-identified individual to compete in the Olympic Games.

Hubbard who has competed against biologically female athletes for years made headlines in June for reportedly being the first trans-identified athlete to qualify for the Olympics. Hubbard physically ""transitioned"" to look more like a woman at the age of 35.

At the 2019 Pacific Games Hubbard won gold by defeating two women from Samoa by lifting 268 kilograms 7 kilograms more than the silver medal winner.

Beth Stelzer a weightlifter and founder of Save Women’s Sports an activist group opposed to allowing biologically male athletes to compete in female athletic competitions denounced the decision to allow Hubbard to compete against women at the Olympics as “shameful” and “a mockery of the sport.”

“We cannot change our sex. A male cannot become a female by lowering their testosterone. Women are not a hormone level” Stelzer said in a statement emailed to The Christian Post in June. “Identities do not play sports; bodies play sports. The rights of females should not end where the feelings of a few males begin.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdW5pc29jLWFubm91bmNlcy13b3JsZC1maXJzdC01Zy0xMDE2MDcxMzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UNISOC Announces World's First 5G NR Rel-16 Ready,"UNISOC together with China Unicom successfully completed end-to-end service validation of the world's first eMBB+uRLLC+IIoT (enhanced mobile broadband + ultra-reliable and low latency communications + industrial Internet of things) based on the 3GPP R16 standard laying a foundation for the commercial use of 5G R16.

Sustinvest assesses Coupang's ESG policies as 'passive'



By Kim Yoo-chul



Coupang is countering recent claims by a local proxy advisor saying it remains passive in terms of articulating and moving forward with strong environmental social and corporate governance (ESG) policies and practices.



In a recent report released by the domestic proxy advisory firm Sustinvest Coupang was found to be weaker in terms of the social index of its ESG rating due to a series of employee deaths and the higher rate of industrial accident cases filed by its employees to government agencies.



The report added its rationale for Coupang being weaker in its ""S"" index is also based on the domestic e-commerce giant's alleged involvement in various types of unfair business practices such as partner companies in its supply chain structure having disputes over copyright issues and its demands for preferential treatment.



Institutional investors are actively embracing updated ESG ratings as rationale when advising shareholders on investments. Major proxy advisory firms are paying attention to the significance of ESG performance which is increasingly scrutinized by stakeholders and investors clients and even rating agencies.



The proxy asked Coupang to pay more attention to how its ESG performance affects one of its core stakeholder groups: its employees. Coupang which completed a very successful initial public offering (IPO) earlier this year on the NYSE has been seeking to improve workplace safety.

Hospitals in London Liverpool Oxford Stevenage Coventry and Norwich are among those which have significantly increased robotic surgery in the past year. In June NHS Scotland announced the purchase of ten robots.

Ben Challacombe head of robotic surgery at Guy’s and St Thomas’ in London said using the technology allowed patients to recover far more quickly than after traditional open surgery.

Switch Exploring Potential REIT Conversion

Switch and Elliott Investment Management the data center provider’s largest Class A shareholder are taking a close look at the company’s financial structure exploring a REIT conversion as one of the potential outcomes of the review.

Elliott a well-known activist investor holds 11 percent of Switch Class A shares. As part of the process being kicked off Switch plans to add Elliott portfolio manager Jason Genrich to its board of directors. He will be one of four Switch directors on the REIT committee evaluating the conversion.

Some of the largest US-based data center providers operate as REITs including Equinix Digital Realty CoreSite QTS CyrusOne and Iron Mountain.

REITs don’t pay corporate taxes in exchange for an obligation to pay out dividends to their shareholders who then pay taxes on those dividends.

Switch stock rose sharply on the announcement of the review Friday jumping from roughly $20 to $25 per share.

The company went public in 2017 with the opening IPO price of $17 per share and a $4.2 billion valuation.

Switch reported second-quarter earnings Thursday (see results below).

QTS Iron Mountain Switch Report Solid Q2 Earnings

The US-based publicly traded data center operators’ 2021 second-quarter earnings season is now complete. QTS Iron Mountain and Switch reported their results this week following last week’s reports by Equinix Digital Realty CyrusOne and CoreSite.

All three operators that reported this week had a solid quarter with healthy revenue growth. (Numbers in the chart below)

This is probably the last earnings report we’ll see from QTS which is in the process of being acquired and taken private by Blackstone. Shareholder approval of the acquisition is still pending with a vote scheduled for August 26. If the approval is secured the deal is expected to close before the end of the third quarter.

“We believe the announced acquisition of QTS by Blackstone represents a strong return for shareholders while positioning QTS to achieve our strategic objectives in our next phase of growth” QTS CEO Chad Williams said in a statement.

Iron Mountain’s numbers in the chart below reflect the entirety of its business which in addition to a growing data center operation also includes the document storage and management services the now seven-decades-old company is best known for. (Iron Mountain is celebrating its 70th anniversary this month.)

Iron Mountain doesn’t break out revenue from its data enter business. The company however said its data center revenue grew 15.3% year over year in the second quarter.

Iron Mountain said it signed 12.6MW in leases during the quarter and now expects to have leased more than 30MW in the full year. Its previous data center leasing guidance for 2021 was 25MW to 30MW.

A couple notes on the Switch numbers in the chart:

Switch isn’t a REIT yet so FFO per share isn’t reported.

The revenue number doesn’t include Data Foundry’s revenue for the quarter which was $3.3 million. Switch closed its Data Foundry acquisition in early June.

Dropbox Says Energy Powering Its Storage Servers Is 100% Renewable

Dropbox announced that the energy used by storage servers in its data centers is now “covered by 100% renewable electricity.”

It’s unclear whether that 100% is achieved through offsets renewable energy credits purchases of energy that powers facilities directly on the local grids or a combination of all three. (A combination is the most likely scenario.)

Dropbox said it’s making “significant investments to procure renewable energy” this year.

Last year it committed to sourcing 100 percent renewable energy for all its operations and achieving carbon neutrality for scope 1 2 and 3 business travel emissions by 2030.

Complicating matters on the data center side of things is Dropbox’s reliance on a mix of on-prem data centers and cloud services. It has to negotiate with its data center providers and cloud operators region by region to get renewable energy to each site.

Even in places where it’s possible to secure enough generation capacity to match a data center’s power consumption there’s currently no scalable solution to intermittency of wind and solar.

Solving the technology market-structure and regulatory obstacles to powering data centers with carbon-free energy around the clock is a goal some of the world’s largest data center operators most notably Google and Microsoft have set out to hit by 2030.

Hyperscaler Landlord Vantage Makes Zero-Carbon Pledge

Vantage Data Centers has set a goal to fully eliminate carbon emissions that result from its operations by 2030. It plans to get there by working with utilities investing in technology and collaborating with its data center tenants.

The company acknowledged that it may not be possible to go fully carbon-free within the timeframe it’s committed to and that it will likely have to use carbon offsets to fill the gap.

As outlined in the story about Dropbox above powering data centers with carbon-free energy around the clock is a gargantuan challenge.

But Vantage’s business revolves around building and leasing data center space wholesale to the world’s largest tech companies including the likes of Google and Microsoft both of whom have committed to get to zero carbon by 2030 as well.

Because hyperscaler platforms lease a lot of their capacity from the likes of Vantage their solution to reaching their carbon goals will include energy that powers their data center landlords’ facilities.

I Squared Capital Agrees to Buy Mexican Operator Kio

I Squared Capital has agreed to acquire Kio Networks which it described as the largest data center provider in Mexico.

The sale price was not disclosed but Bloomberg reported last year that Kio backed by Tresalia Capital was exploring a potential sale that could fetch as much as $1 billion.

Kio is a major data center provider to the Mexican government. Its reliance on that relationship as a business was cited as a factor working against Tresalia’s efforts to sell. Moody’s last year explained its B2 rating of Kio’s stock (a rating reserved for risky junk stocks) by the provider’s “weak liquidity and revenue concentration in Mexico with a particularly large exposure to the government of Mexico and to some large contracts.”

I Squared Capital also known as ISQ is an infrastructure investment manager. It has invested in utilities energy transport and social infrastructure and says it has made six investments in digital infrastructure that total $3 billion.

Kio operates 11 core data center campuses and 11 edge facilities in Mexico Central America and the Caribbean totaling 20MW of installed capacity and “significant expansion potential” according to the announcement.

ISQ owns the Hong Kong network and data center operator HGC which it acquired in 2017.

In July ISQ announced acquisition of the Houston-area fiber network operator ICTX WaveMedia through a newly formed Ezee Fiber platform for investment in fiber networks in growing and underserved US markets.

In 2020 ISQ reached an agreement to acquire the global network operator GTT for $2.15 billion but the deal appears to have stalled.

Mantra Data Centers Says It Has $1 Billion to Build Data Centers in India

Another new player is promising to enter the global data center market. A company called Mantra Data Centers announced plans to invest $1 billion in data center construction in India one of the hottest emerging cloud and data center markets.

MDC which describes itself as an “independent platform and wholesale colocation provider” said it will start by building 20MW data centers in Mumbai Delhi Chennai Bangalore Hyderabad and Kolkata. The company said it has signed MOUs for data center development in three of those markets with the respective state governments.

American and Chinese cloud providers are investing in infrastructure to serve India’s massive population. International and Indian data center providers – both established and newly formed – are racing to take advantage of the opportunity to lease data center facilities to those cloud platforms and support enterprise requirements.

In its announcement MDC said that besides India’s growing digitization data center demand in the market could be further spurred by enactment of the Personal Data Protection Bill that’s been under consideration since 2019. If enacted the bill would require all “sensitive personal data” of Indian citizens to be stored in India.

It has been reported that John Meadows has died at 49 years old. John Meadows well known in the bodybuilding world as the “Mountain Dog” reportedly died of a pulmonary embolism in his sleep on Sunday August 8th 2021. John Meadows is a former IFBB Pro bodybuilder and well known coach. Most recently he trained IFBB pro bodybuilder Shaun Clarida leading up to his 2020 Men’s 212 Olympia win.

The news has been reported to Generation Iron by multiple sources. At the time of his passing there was no official announcement made by his family or on John Meadows official social media pages. However the following message was recently posted to Facebook by Brooke Nappo on behalf of Meadows’ wife Mary.

“Dear Friends & Family

I am posting this on behalf of Mary. This morning John passed away unexpectedly and peacefully in their home. As you can imagine this is a complete shock to her and the boys. She will update as soon as she can. Please know she is very thankful for all the prayers and support she knows her and the boys will receive from you all.

-Brooke Nappo”

John Meadows is a bodybuilder who during his early days in the sport suffered from a rare colon disease that nearly killed him. Eventually his colon burst and he was rushed to the hospital. Luckily he survived and after months of recovery he returned to bodybuilding to do what he loved. He earned his IFBB Pro card despite these major health setbacks.

His past health conditions gave him a different perspective on bodybuilding and life. His aim became to continually put a focus on his health in a way many people don’t. After retiring from competitive bodybuilding – he continued as a nutritionist and coach. He’s guided many bodybuilders through their pro careers. Most notably he recently coached Shaun Clarida in 2020 – when he won the Men’s 212 Olympia. Generation Iron documented the journey alongside Shaun Clarida Meadows and the team at Nutrabio.

On May 11 2020 John Meadows suffered from a heart attack due to a clotting disorder in his blood vessels. He was hospitalized but was quickly brought back to a stable condition. The news was first announced by his wife Mary Meadows and covered here at Generation Iron.

John credits his wife as his biggest influence in life. She was with him through “ups” and “downs” always supporting his decisions in life. “I couldn’t have done it without her” John Meadows states of his wife. “When I was sick and got out of the hospital and I was too weak to look after myself she did everything for me including sanitary things I can’t talk about.”

“IF I SAY I WANT TO DO SOMETHING WE’LL TALK ABOUT IT MAKE SURE IT’S WORKABLE AND THEN SHE GETS BEHIND ME AND SUPPORTS THE IDEA AND ME ALL THE WAY. AND WHEN I’M HURTING THE LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS OF MY DIET SHE SEES THE LOOK ON MY FACE AND SAYS ‘JUST HANG IN THERE IT’S GOING TO BE WORTH IT.’ AND I NEED TO HEAR THAT AT THAT STAGE.”

John Meadows soon left the hospital focused on recovery and soon returned to coaching pro bodybuilders. Just this weekend one of his coached athletes Brooke Walker won the Europa Phoenix Games 2021 and earned her Olympia qualification. It has not been confirmed that his death was tied to his previous heart attack or blood clotting disorder.

After his recovery Generation Iron reconnected with John Meadows for a GI Exclusive interview discussing his heart attack recovery and future plans in bodybuilding. You can watch the full uncut video below:

John Meadows was a well known and beloved bodybuilder coach father and husband. He was a vital part of bodybuilding over the past few decades and will be missed severely by the entire community. Generation Iron sends condolences to his friend and family during this time.

Many bodybuilders have begun sending an outpour of support on social media. The news was reported to us by multiple sources – including our Talking Huge host Craig Golias who directly confirmed with Generation Iron. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

That's OK -- his work speaks plenty loud enough for him. Since he was 22 years old the prolific Hitt has been making a living doing what he loves to do; photography he says is his hobby as well as his career. He has a diverse roster of clients that includes professional sports organizations like the NFL the NBA and NASCAR; iconic Arkansas institutions and businesses like the University of Arkansas Walmart Tyson Foods J.B. Hunt TheatreSquared and a bevy of Arkansas hospitals; and national organizations and publications like Getty Images Discovery Channel The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Yet the photography exhibit currently at TheatreSquared is the first time his body of work has been on display.

""When all of this all came about I had to sit down and look at my work and think 'Well what do I want to show?'"" says Hitt. ""I wanted to show something that not everybody sees."" He made his choices and when he saw the complete exhibit he noticed a pattern: There were plenty of photos that showed his skill in sports photography and other dynamic situations but he had chosen a lot of ""still"" photos as well. ""I started looking at the pictures that are in the exhibit and I thought 'Holy cow my whole career has been running up and down the sidelines or photographing people in motion and everything that I wanted to show were just these quiet simple moments.' And that's the opposite of what I do for a living. I think when I'm out on my own -- I call it 'seeing' driving around or on vacation -- that's where my mind goes to that 'simple.' It's just so easy for me to look at those kinds of scenes and see it. Pretty pictures I like taking pretty pictures I think.""

Hitt received a camera for a high school graduation present and he was hooked. He attended a photography school in Massachusetts that emphasized business skills for artists.

""I think that helped more than anything"" says Hitt. ""Their philosophy was that 'We can only teach you so much about photography -- you're going to learn by doing. But if we can give you the knowledge about how business works and how to run a business then you can make a career out of it.'""

Hitt's first foray into sports photography was through a friend's passion for motocross.

""I'm definitely an introvert and was very shy back then"" he says. ""It was kind of a way to go along and have something to do at motocross [races]. When I'm taking pictures I kind of hit a zone and I don't think about anything else. And it just kind of took off from there. This will be my 23rd or 24th year as an NFL photographer. I was the Razorback photographer for 10 years Houston through Petrino and so I'm known more for sports. But I've mostly done commercial and advertising work. I started in Little Rock working with ad agencies and people like that.""

Hitt hasn't limited his career to one photographic specialty but instead has found that his skills are ideal for a wide range of assignments.

""I've shot the [Walmart] shareholders meeting for 10 years"" he says. ""I shoot down front and one of the people that works there said they've noticed that I'm really good at capturing moments on stage. That's why they like hiring me. And again that's sports too.""

It's also what makes him good at shooting theater. He's been photographing moments on stage for TheatreSquared for many seasons now.

""Theatre is ephemeral it exists live and for just that moment. Representing it in photos is so challenging"" says Martin Miller T2 Executive Director. ""We are so fortunate to work with a world-class photographer like Wesley Hitt who can capture that moment where light and movement make magic for our audiences.""

""We are so excited to celebrate Wesley's work in The Commons this month"" says T2's Director of Marketing and Communications Joanna Sheehan Bell. ""Wesley brings an ability to almost stop time with his camera. I love that in the exhibition we get to see that skill in the remarkable work he does to capture amazing moments on our stages and also the gorgeous vistas and vignettes he's captured from all over Arkansas.""

Hitt says the exhibit shows off a side of his work that isn’t always seen — “pretty pictures” of quiet scenes taken in Arkansas and around the country. (Photo by Wesley Hitt)",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the 1960s Ms. Jacobs made her mark as one of the world's leading urbanists with her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

Doug Saunders is The Globe and Mail’s international affairs columnist and the author of books including Arrival City and Maximum Canada.

The story begins in a tired corner of the city maybe an old light-industrial district. First come the artists and students drawn by low rents and gritty charms; they bring galleries and bars and restaurants. Immigrant families settle buy cheap houses open shops. The resulting street life attracts visitors with cash in their pockets. Some stick around decide it’s an okay place to buy a home and raise children and bring another level of services and businesses. For a while its streets are the liveliest place in town until higher rents and middle-class stasis drive the young and creative into another run-down district a few blocks away leaving the neighbourhood stable and prosperous but more homogenous and somewhat boring.

That vision of the urban district as a living organism morphing and evolving and improving on its own is a familiar story today. Sixty years ago it was almost beyond imagination. In 1961 cities were depopulating as middle classes abandoned them their old downtown districts portrayed as repellant accumulations of filth and crime that governments wanted replaced with public-housing projects or elevated highways. Banks often wouldn’t make mortgage loans for downtown houses while a move to the ballooning ‘burbs was subsidized.

So it’s hard to exaggerate the shock of novelty provoked by the publication that year of The Death and Life of Great American Cities a book that offered an almost scientific dissection of urban neighbourhoods and the forces of life and economics that governed them. Its starting point was that story about an old district layering ever-new communities onto its little streets – a flourishing of urban life its author Jane Jacobs called “the sidewalk ballet.”

That was one of many novel phrases and concepts the book introduced or popularized. So too were the notion of high population density and crowded sidewalks as the solution to crime (“eyes on the street”) the tight mingling of housing and industry and commerce on the same streets as a path to tranquil neighbourhoods the understanding of landlords and developers as potential forces of good of big-money government redevelopment projects as a problem of local-level spontaneity and microscale local investments – “organized complexity” – as a solution.

No other book has so transformed our understanding of cities not just in North America but worldwide – and now 60 years after its publication and 15 years after Ms. Jacobs’s death in Toronto it’s fair to say that no work has transformed cities themselves so much.

And that’s become a problem. While The Death and Life of Great American Cities remains a book everyone ought to read for its conversationally persuasive style as much as for its ideas it is far less valuable today as a guide to action for mayors and planners – in large part because it has become a victim of its own overwhelming success. Ms. Jacobs’s act of painstaking observation has had the effect of changing the very thing being observed to the point that our opening story of the gritty old neighbourhood no longer exists in most real-life cities.

Yet it is at just this moment that Death and Life has become every mayor’s favourite book. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and London Mayor Sadiq Khan have both evoked Ms. Jacobs’s name in launching bold pandemic-era plans explicitly modeled on the ideas in its pages to revitalize their city neighbourhoods and render them more intimate – at least in the central-city areas that were Ms. Jacobs’s focus. Scores of other mayors from Portland to Ottawa to Lisbon are rushing to embrace the “15-minute city” concepts Ms. Hidalgo has popularized in which each downtown neighbourhood has all key aspects of life within walking distance a concept drawn directly from this book.

That’s partly because this is now comparatively easy to do if you limit your scope to the urban core – in good part because Ms. Jacobs’s diverse-neighbourhood ideas have been mainstream urban politics since the 1970s.

The biggest neighbourhood-level challenges facing mayors today involve challenges -- and parts of town -- that weren’t envisioned in her book. Cozy central-city neighbourhoods are no longer jeopardized by mega-freeways and huge inhuman housing projects; if anything they suffer too much intimacy too little population and too little change. And the suburbanization of immigration and poverty mean the districts that most need to shift and evolve are the ones least able to do it on their own without large-scale rescues. The book’s ideas remain compelling but today’s mayors need a few new chapters.

In 1961 Death and Life attracted hate mail from famous planners and politicians and received an essay-length misogyny-tinged denunciation from the great historian Lewis Mumford who saw socialist central-planned garden-city neighbourhoods and strict separation of working and residential districts as the only urban solution. Today that opposition has largely vanished and the book’s core concepts are mainstream canon in urban-design schools and big-city planning departments.

Which might seem surprising because Death and Life is first and foremost an attack on urban planning a cry to get the state out of the neighbourhood and leave it to shift and grow and plan on its own.

Among its most compelling chapters are those making the case against government-owned public housing pedestrianized streets community centres and other perennial planner favourites.

And Ms. Jacobs is perhaps best remembered beyond this book as an activist who waged legendary and much-chronicled battles against the visions of two mighty planning bosses Robert Moses of New York and Fred Gardiner of Toronto.

The two homes she famously lived in 555 Hudson St. in New York’s West Village (then half-industrial and rat-infested) and then 69 Albany Ave. in Toronto’s Annex neighbourhood (then a low-rent student ghetto) were both in the heart of districts that would have been destroyed by those men’s plans. They would have cut their cities in half with superhighways running though New York’s SoHo Little Italy and Greenwich Village and through Toronto’s dense residential neighbourhoods surrounding Spadina Avenue and Dupont Street both of which were to become 10-lane expressways.

It was during her fight against the first project Mr. Moses’s Lower Manhattan Freeway that Ms. Jacobs developed many of the ideas that animate Death and Life. Some she drew from the innovative concepts of the University of Chicago’s pioneering urban sociology department others from heterodox urbanists and scientists of the time. But most came from her own journalist’s critical eye from her constant probing questioning and notetaking.

The hated freeway proposals made her notice something crucial about neighbourhoods something that became central to her case in Death and Life and which remains important today: If they’re not tightly interconnected if they don’t easily bring foot traffic from adjoining districts richer and poorer they will eventually fail as neighbourhoods.

As much as neighbourhoods need to be walkable and diverse in activity in order to thrive – the part of the Jane Jacobs formula that’s invoked by mayors today – she was equally clear that none of that will work if any kind of border or barrier physical or psychological prevents people from easily entering. Whether those borders take the form of freeways or the winding grassy streets of an apartment complex or a campus or industrial park she writes they will “tear a city to tatters.” Boundaries are urban death.

After her victories against the mega-boundaries of Messrs. Moses and Gardiner in the early 1970s cities in North America and Europe largely stopped trying to use top-down planning to create these kinds of physical borders in their inner cities.

As a consequence those gritty urban neighbourhoods began to thrive even if they didn’t always have the population density or diverse range of commercial activities to completely fulfil her “conditions to generate exuberant diversity.”

Downtown is no longer a blank slate. Ms. Jacobs’s former flat at 555 Hudson most recently sold a dozen years ago for US$3.5-million – as she said a few years before her death she could never afford to be a writer there now. Her Albany Avenue house is now certainly worth more than $2-million. There are increasingly few former wholesale districts or neglected residential quarters near the city centre in New York or Toronto or any economically successful major city that can metamorphose and transform the way neighbourhoods do in The Death and Life of Great American Cities.

The neighbourhoods that are hungry for transformation today are more often located far into the inner-suburban perimeter surrounded by those grassy boundaries where no community organizing or bicycle lane or “15-minute” plan or gradual organic change will remove those visitor-blocking barriers and make the sidewalks dance. Today’s urban challenges need another approach.

When I was on a a lecture tour of China nine years ago to discuss my book Arrival City an urban-planning student at Peking University raised her hand to ask a question. “She wants to know if your work is an example of –” and the next phrase gave my translator pause – “Jane-Jacobs-Thought?”

I’d hear variations on that question in several cities and they surprised me. Not the question itself which was a good one – my work in this area really began with conversations and interviews I had with Ms. Jacobs in the 1990s and is in many ways an elaboration on and argument with her ideas.

Rather I was surprised to discover that Death and Life was well-known reading in many Chinese urban-planning departments. You don’t need to spend much time in China’s major cities to notice that Jane-Jacobs-Thought has hardly won the day – the top-down big-money ideas of Mr. Moses and his ilk are a lot more visible.

Where the book’s ideas have prevailed in mainland China however is in the latter-day movements to preserve the remaining fragments of the old working-class districts of major cities – the alleyways and narrow courtyards of Beijing’s old low-rise hutong districts and Shanghai’s labyrinthine shikumen neighbourhoods. The bits of these that have been saved while popular with hipster homebuyers and pleasant to visit are often more museum pieces than living neighbourhoods. They are far from urban organisms owing to the heavy-handed planning and the barriers physical and psychological that surround them. It is impossible for these districts ever again to change from within.

That’s also the big flaw in the use of Death and Life by mayors today. Ms. Hidalgo’s “15-minute” plans are nothing but virtuous and are well worth imitating. But they don’t extend beyond Paris’s ring road that divides city from suburb and in practice are mainly focused within the 17th-century wall that delineates the grand boulevards best known to tourists. The problem is that within this circle with a few important and deserving exceptions Paris already largely is a 15-minute city and has been for a long time.

Likewise the pandemic-era instinct to add bicycle lanes and wider sidewalks to already tight-knit sections of a city is absolutely virtuous and welcomed by privileged downtown residents like me. But most of those districts are no longer the ones that need help – they’re mostly finished evolving. In an already-successful setting these small well-meaning interventions come close to what Ms. Jacobs called “the art of urban taxidermy.”

The sociologist and urbanist Richard Sennett was a friend of Ms. Jacobs’s from her Greenwich Village years (there’s a famous photo from 1962 of the two of them chatting in the Village’s White Horse Tavern a man passed out between them). He recently published a fascinating book Building and Dwelling in which he comes to terms with the limits of Death and Life – “I dwelt in Jane Jacobs’s shadow as a young man” he writes “Gradually I have emerged from it.”

Specifically what he sees missing what he calls “Jane Jacobs’s Achilles heel” is the sort of large-format planning and infrastructure that makes her bottom-up microscale evolutions possible in the first place. He writes: “It won’t do to call as she does the city a ‘collection of communities’ – infrastructure like roads electricity or water needs to be built by scaling from whole to part.”

If the urban circle of life is to be restored amid crises of affordability and segregation much larger interventions will be required. Mayors and urban activists need to think beyond this book and imagine a set of chapters that Ms. Jacobs herself could not have imagined.

The part of Death and Life that should continue to be required reading for any mayor is her description of the four things that make urban neighbourhoods economically and socially successful organic and self-evolving places.

Those four factors – “good mixtures of primary uses frequent streets a close-grained mingling of different ages in their buildings and a high concentration of people” – remain true as much so in the alleyways of downtown as in the grassy slab-apartment districts of the inner ‘burbs. But they happen to be four things that simply don’t exist in today’s most troubled urban neighbourhoods -- and their problems won’t be solved until those factors are delivered. This should be the goal of any mayor today.

First those all-housing apartment districts need to become real neighbourhoods -- and they lack the power or resources to do it on their own. It’s no coincidence that the highest rates of COVID-19 in virtually every major Canadian and U.S. city were located in apartment suburbs (for example northern Etobicoke and western North York in Toronto; Surrey in Greater Vancouver). Their residents overwhelmingly rely on “essential” jobs that are located a long bus ride outside their cluster of apartment buildings leaving them exposed to threats. Those districts need lot more shops and businesses and sidewalks and straight streets and transit stations -- things that won’t suddenly appear simply because some new entrepreneurial-minded people have moved in.

Second there needs to be a lot more high-density housing in neighbourhoods that think they don’t want it -- for example the absence of any apartment buildings in huge single-family-housing swaths of Toronto and Vancouver not only prevents much-needed housing supply increases but leaves those neighbourhoods stagnant and unchanging lacking enough people to justify the subway stations mixed uses and busy sidewalks that allow Jacobs-style evolution to start taking place again.

Third there needs to be a mass knocking-down of boundaries both physical and psychological -- the barriers to human activity and community connection that slow and patient change won’t fix. But the worst of those boundaries are no longer found in the historic urban core; they’re planned and designed into the very shape of today’s most challenged neighbourhoods.

The sort of activist campaigns Ms. Jacobs waged in Greenwich Village in the 1950s and in the Annex in the 1960s and ‘70s need to be adopted by a whole new constituency who live not in dusty 19th-century neighbourhoods but in grassy formerly visionary late 20th-century ones. There’s a difference though: While the last century’s Jane Jacobs campaigned against the interventions of planners this century’s successors need to be campaigning for them. No amount of local committee meetings will create easy foot traffic between poor and wealthy suburban blocks; simple protests won’t straighten the streets and fill the empty spaces with shops and more housing and bring employment into the centre of high-rise districts even when it becomes legal to do so. The entire planning and development-approval process needs to be reoriented to serve the potential future residents of neighbourhoods not their current ones.

Here we begin to see the missing chapters of The Death and Life of Great American Cities. That old story of the ever-evolving sidewalk hasn’t become obsolete -- it’s just that too many neighbourhoods lack the ingredients including sidewalks themselves that might allow that story to begin. To turn tomorrow’s neighbourhoods into living organisms full of tight-knit vitality is going to require more than bike paths. Mayors who want to make a Jacobs-scale difference today need to look beyond the pages of this 60-year-old book.

Marcello Magnani who represents the 26-year-old former long jumper who now stands at the top of the sprint world also issued a categorical denial that his athlete has ever used performance-enhancing drugs.

Magnani told The Telegraph his athlete severed ties with Spazzini upon hearing about the investigation.

Jacobs set a European record of 9.80sec in becoming the surprise Olympic 100m champion.

He ran the second leg for the Italian team that beat Britain to sprint relay gold by one hundredth of a second.

Jacobs had never run under 10s for the 100m until May this year.

He came to general notice by winning the European indoor title in March in an Italian record of 6.47sec.

Spazzini is a body builder and fitness consultant who has previously given interviews about his role in helping Jacobs.

In a statement issued to The Telegraph Magnani said: ""I confirm you that Marcell stopped to work with Giacomo Spazzini in March as soon as he has known about the investigation.""

Jacobs American-born serves as a police officer in Brescia.

A spokesman for the local police in Milan told The Times that the Operation Muscle Bound investigation ""had not concerned the athlete Marcell Jacobs.""

He reportedly confirmed the inquiry examined alleged links between ""the nutritionist Giacomo Spazzini and an unnamed individual accused of providing illegally procured growth hormones and anabolic steroids"".

Spazzini was quoted in the Libero Quotidiano newspaper last week talking about how he had worked with the double Olympic champion.

In a statement Spazzini’s lawyer Stefano D’Apolito told The Times: ""I write the following at the request of my client Giacomo Spazzini in relation to stories that have appeared in recent days in various publications.

""To settle any doubt I would make clear that the athlete Jacobs was assisted - until the month of March - in a nutritional capacity by medical professionals of the centre that my client runs as a business owner.

""He is not a nutritionist and has never carried out such an activity which I repeat the centre offers its clients via specialist medical professionals.

""As regards the contact between my client and Jacobs this has its basis in a relationship of friendship.

""Finally I wish to make clear that in the penal proceedings in which Spazzini is being investigated evidential elements have emerged in the course of these investigations that exonerate my client of all responsibility.

""I therefore trust that my client will be absolved in the preliminary phase of proceedings.""

Antonio La Torre the head coach of Italy’s track and field team said that Jacobs can run even faster.

La Torre said: ""With his infinite talent I dare to say that he’s a man who can run close to 9.70 — or maybe even faster.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ud2l0aW1lcy9uYW1lL2phY29iLXZhbnZlc3Nlbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0yMTM1Mjg4NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob VanVessen Obituary (1980 - 2021) - Munster IN - The Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/nwitimes/name/jacob-vanvessen-obituary?id=21352886 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ud2l0aW1lcy9uYW1lL2phY29iLXZhbnZlc3Nlbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0yMTM1Mjg4NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Marjorie Taylor Greene on Wednesday officially triggered a vote on her motion to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson but within minutes Democrats joined almost all Republicans to overwhelmingly reject her move.

There were audible boos from lawmakers in the chamber as Greene spoke at length about her grievances with Johnson as she called for a vote.

The Georgia congresswoman flanked by co-sponsor GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky asserted Johnson had ""not lived up to a single one"" of the promises he made the Republican conference after he was elected to the top post in October.

""By passing the Democrats' agenda and handcuffing the Republicans' ability and influence legislation our elected Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has aided and abetted the Democrats and the Biden administration in destroying our country"" Greene said.

Johnson was on the House floor with his leadership team as Greene read her resolution.

The House quickly moved to hold a vote on a motion to table or effectively kill Greene's effort to oust Johnson. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise rose to request the vote on tabling Greene's resolution which passed with bipartisan support.

The final vote to dismiss Greene's motion was 359-43 with seven lawmakers voting present. Lawmakers cheered when the tally was read out.

Eleven Republicans and 32 Democrats voted against killing Greene's motion.

Johnson joked with reporters after the vote saying ""it’s just another Wednesday on Capitol Hill.""

The speaker called Greene's resolution a ""misguided effort"" and thanked his colleagues for supporting him.

""Hopefully this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress. It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans and we're better than this. We need to get beyond it"" Johnson said.

Greene told ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott after the vote that she was not surprised by the vote against her motion to vacate the speaker's chair.

""I think this is exactly the American people needed to see"" she said.

""I didn't run for Congress to come up here and join the uni-party and the uni-party was on full display today"" she added. ""As a matter of fact [the Republican Party] proved they're ready to do everything with the Democrats.""

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his party's decision to help save Johnson's job was aimed at restoring common sense and quelling chaos in Washington.

""Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner"" the New York congressman told reporters. ""We need more common sense and less chaos in Washington D.C. Marjorie Taylor Greene and extreme MAGA Republicans are chaos agents.""

When asked repeatedly whether Democrats would vote to save Johnson again if further motions to remove him are filed -- or if Democrats would demand concessions from Johnson to do so in the future -- Jeffries said ""the vote clearly speaks for itself.""

""It was a vote of conscience. It was overwhelming. It was decisive. And we need to move forward as a Congress"" he added.

Greene did not answer when asked if she plans on trying to kick out Johnson again.

Former President Donald Trump who has backed Johnson during his feud with Greene said in a post on Truth Social that now was not the time to be making motions to vacate.

""If we show DISUNITY which will be portrayed as CHAOS it will negatively affect everything! Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard. I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months but we will get them done together"" he said.

Nevertheless Greene said she was thankful for Trump's support.

Greene's move Wednesday was a sudden shift in tactics after she appeared to be backing off her weekslong threat following back-to-back meetings with Johnson on Monday and Tuesday.

In between meetings she had given Johnson a list of demands she wanted implemented which included no more aid to Ukraine and defunding special counsel Jack Smith's office.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) failed to grow her ouster campaign beyond a handful of votes. Why it matters: Johnson avoided becoming the second speaker ousted this Congress. He became a midsession speaker in October after the historic ouster of Kevin McCarthy.

Greene introduced her resolution on Wednesday evening after two days of closed-door conversations this week with Johnson.

Her motion was quickly blocked as House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) moved to table the motion passing with an overwhelming majority.

Zoom in: Republican hardliners brought the motion after Johnson passed a $95 billion aid package that included military humanitarian and economic assistance to Ukraine.

Democrats largely praised the move and said they didn't want to punish Johnson for doing the right thing and working across the aisle.

Another key factor Democrats cited: They view Johnson as a more honest broker than McCarthy who they unanimously voted to oust last fall.

""The motion to vacate does not offer a recipe for conservative policy— it's a recipe for chaos. And I think obviously the vast majority of our of our colleagues understand that very well"" Johnson recently told Axios.

While nearly a dozen Republicans voted against tabling the motion to vacate the vast majority were outraged Wednesday night that Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene went through with a move that was going to fail and show party disunity ahead of the election.

“She’s trying to take out our Speaker of the United States Congress over her preference on a policy decision” Rep. John Duarte said. “We are protecting the world from her inate behavior. I am surprised she has even one ally. Thomas Massie should be embarrassed of himself.”

Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota called Greene’s behavior “destructive” and warned it would sow discord.

“All of us in life get to decide how we handle disappointment. You can be productive or you can be destructive. Ms. Taylor Greene is choosing destructive” he said. “We know that this motion is not going to do one thing to make America stronger. It's not going to do one thing to deliver a conservative victory. It's going to sow discord and dissent.”

But Republicans who backed the House speaker say they are divided about whether or not to punish those who voted against tabling the resolution.

Duarte said with a narrow majority administering consequences is difficult. ""Her voters need to deliver consequences to her"" he added.

Johnson also argued that consequences may not work adding that ""people need to sit down and analyze what’s possible and make the institution stronger.""

""There may be people interested in punishment. I’m not interested in punishment. That doesn’t work"" Johnson said. ""For me my question is what rules do we need in place so the House can function.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson has officially failed.

But 11 House Republicans voted to at least allow debate on the matter.

Most lawmakers who voted with Greene were Democrats who are opposed to Johnson's politics.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to boot Speaker Mike Johnson has officially failed after the House voted by a 359-43 margin to table the Georgia Republican's motion to vacate on Wednesday.

11 Republicans sided with Greene voting against a procedural vote to table her motion. Basically they voted to allow a debate on Greene's effort rather than simply quashing it.

Just two other Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona — officially cosponsored her resolution.

Seven Democrats voted ""present.""

Greene's move was somewhat of a surprise with the congresswoman forcing the vote just one day after seemingly backing off of her threat.

Former President Donald Trump weighed in shortly after the vote saying that while he ""absolutely"" loves Greene he did not believe House Republicans were ""in a position to voting"" on the ouster bid.

The far-right congresswoman's effort was long expected to fail given Democratic leaders' decision to vote to table the motion. Ultimately 163 Democrats did so.

32 Democrats voted with Greene citing their opposition to Johnson's politics and their belief that Democrats should have asked for more in exchange for their votes.

I am not happy with where we are now but would not vote to vacate the speaker at this time. However I fought a lot to change Pelosi rules and have more accountability on the speaker in Congress so I voted not to table the motion consistent with my vote on McCarthy last fall. — Rep. Victoria Spartz (@RepSpartz) May 8 2024





""I'm not going to support MTG's silliness but I don't want to support the most homophobic speaker in American history"" Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan previously told BI referencing Johnson's opposition to LGBTQ+ rights.

It remains unclear whether Greene will continue to force votes on ousting Johnson.

Here are the 11 House Republicans who voted to advance the effort to oust Johnson:

Eric Burlison of Missouri

Eli Crane of Arizona

Future missions will require enormous amounts of electrical power and hardware to support astronauts and drive new technologies. The amount of heat created by this increase in power needs to be removed so all the spacecraft systems can function.

The proposed research aims to develop an integrated two-phase flow boiling/condensation facility which will launch to the International Space Station (ISS) this month.

“Because a liquid/vapour mixture and interface behave differently in space scientists need to investigate how boiling and condensation change in microgravity and obtain the data needed to apply what we’ve learned to design future heat transfer systems” said NASA Glenn Research Center engineer Nancy Hall.

Hall is the project manager for the Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment or FBCE which will launch to the ISS aboard Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus on the company’s 16th commercial resupply services mission for NASA.

Built and tested at NASA Glenn in Cleveland FBCE will conduct a variety of experiments on the space station to investigate flow boiling and condensation in microgravity conditions. This research is a joint effort between Glenn and the Purdue University Boiling and Two-Phase Flow Laboratory funded by the NASA Science Mission Directorate’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division.

“When it comes to microgravity condensation and flow boiling heat transfer data and models are extremely limited” said Monica Guzik FBCE chief engineer. “This experiment is critical to future NASA missions that require increased efficiency beyond the current single-phase systems.”

NASA has previously worked with Purdue University on developing a vapour compression fridge that will work at zero gravity and in different orientations to provide longer-lasting and more nutritious food for astronauts.

Aug. 8 2021

“Is it your biggest interview ever?” my friend asked when hearing what was on my schedule last week.

That answer was a quick “no.”

My biggest interviews happened when I was just starting in the profession – I was actually a teenager – and those would make a whole series of columns themselves.

You could argue interviewing Jamie Dimon wasn’t even my “biggest” interview this week given I also had a chance to sit down with Ashley Furniture founder and chairman Ron Wanek – who also could be another column.

But I absolutely was thrilled with the chance to interview Dimon who’s not only CEO of the nation’s largest bank JPMorgan Chase but also a leader among the world’s CEOs.

This is someone who has been voted among the most influential and respected business leaders both by his peers and by the business media.

The only part where I struggled a little was with the questions. What do you ask someone who has been interviewed by everyone? That’s what makes high-profile interviews tough. It can feel like every quote has been given every sound bite recorded.

I always default to a foundational element: my audience. I report for those interested in local business news. So I would attempt to keep this conversation local and focused on what my audience would want to know.

I did not expect my first exchange with Dimon would involve him asking a question instead of me.

But as he arrived in Sioux Falls to waving Chase flags and pompoms shook some hands and made his way to the podium where he would speak at the bank’s ribbon-cutting for its first branch in South Dakota he veered my way first.

We shook hands and he did the same with the two student-reporters standing next to me.

“Are these your kids?” he asked.

“Not exactly” was the first thing that my “caught off-guard” self thought to reply.

I later explained to him that as their boss there are some definite parallels to parenthood which he understood. Molly Wetsch and Chloe Houwman have been reporting for us the past several months and both plan to study business and finance in college so I wanted them to experience this with me.

By the end of the day it definitely had been a learning experience for all of us.

You can watch the full interview below but essentially I talked about the Sioux Falls market how it fit into some larger national themes and what Dimon’s thoughts were on our post-pandemic future.

I was lucky – the team at Chase granted me a generous amount of time and had no restrictions on what could be discussed.

But if they had given me time for only two questions these would have been them.

First I thought about what is the Sioux Falls economy’s biggest threat to growth the element that would both interest and potentially concern my leadership audience the most.

Labor.

Right?

Right.

And I’ve become increasingly frustrated by those even in leadership who insist on oversimplifying this issue.

They are quick to tell you the reason we don’t have more people working is because certain people can make more on enhanced government benefits because of the pandemic than in some jobs.

And at least in Sioux Falls I just can’t logically make a case for that in this moment in time. Not with less than 3 percent unemployment and a still-robust labor force participation rate. There’s something more going on. But what is it?

Dimon didn’t claim to have all the answers. But he did immediately acknowledge it’s not that simple.

“People are always looking for the simple answer” he said while going on to suggest there are at least four distinct reasons why businesses might be struggling to hire.

Of the 7 million people out of the workforce 1 million or 2 million probably have decided to retire he said.

“That’s fine. That takes place. We think it accelerated that” he said.

There could be another 2 million waiting for school to start before looking for a job Dimon continued.

“They have kids at home. They have people at home. They don’t have care. So they’re going to wait until September.”

Another 2 million could be still bringing in more in benefits than employment he acknowledged giving the example of someone whose benefits equate to $20 per hour being reluctant to return to a $12-per-hour service job.

“That job will always be available. It isn’t like they’re going to lose a good job” he said.

And the rest is likely churn. People have moved.

“They’ll eventually start looking for jobs around here but they haven’t even started yet” he said. “So it’s a whole bunch of reasons.”

He also reminded me that a tight labor market can be “a great thing.”

“Jobs are plentiful. That’s good. Wages are going up particularly for low pay. That’s not so bad” he said.

“This is the most dynamic prosperous economy the world’s ever seen. It will find a way to grow again.”

That was the first question. And the second was one I probably most wanted to know.

This one was about being a CEO today. If you’re a true leader it always has been about more than just leading your business. It’s about being a leader in your business community your state and even your nation if given the opportunity.

And what it means to be a CEO is changing. In the past year our CEOs have been asked to weigh in on public health election law social justice and any number of other issues outside the core of their business.

“How do you feel the role has changed and what is most necessary to be an effective leader at this moment?” I asked Dimon.

His first words on the topic were these:

“First of all I think business and government have to collaborate to succeed with civic society” he said which includes institutions such as churches and community colleges.

“It will not work if we’re at each other’s throats.”

America has seen a period of slow growth in the past 20 years Dimon continued which “has hurt lower-paid people more than anyone and minorities more than anyone” he said.

“I think it’s because of health care education regulation taxation immigration litigation. If we fix those things I think we could grow a lot more.”

He gave the example of health care where America produces some of the best people and facilities in the world and spends 18 percent of gross domestic product while the rest of the world is at approximately 9 percent yet “our outcomes aren’t that better. In fact they’re worse” he said. “We have more infant mortality. We have more obesity; people dying younger. We have drug problems.”

Fix these and other problems and “America will be healthier for it” he continued. “And health is an important part of productivity and happiness.”

They were all great points I thought and worthy topics that a CEO should be helping tackle in addition to the individual’s actual business. But then one word popped into my head and I figured it was worth a quick follow-up.

The word was trust.

I guarantee you there will be people reading my work or watching my interview who for whatever reason don’t trust Jamie Dimon or others in similar roles. They’re “big banks” part of “big business.” Those same people likely don’t trust me either. I’m “the media” which we all know carries a stigma that sadly has taken root even deeper in recent years. And they certainly don’t trust “the government.” That’s probably an entirely separate column.

You can’t lead if people won’t follow and they won’t follow if they don’t trust. I didn’t even pose it in the form of a question for Dimon so much as I did a thought.

“I trust you” he responded. “I can tell by talking to you. But you earn it every day and you look at what people actually do.”

I consider Dimon trustworthy as well but as he continued: “Too many people blanket with the same ‘Oh the media is not trustworthy.’ That’s prejudice. Some are quite trustworthy. Some aren’t. Make a distinction. It takes a little courage to make a distinction.”

It takes courage to lead in today’s environment too whether you’re a small-business person as I am or the leader of the nation’s largest bank or somewhere in between. It also takes a willingness to engage in your community to be part of the solution when it comes to educating people who will become your future workers supporting better health for all and pointing out when policy is limiting our potential shared prosperity.

And the point about earning trust can’t be underestimated. It’s the same thing I tell myself and others about the need to approach how we do our jobs in a climate of distrust. And it applies just as well to anyone in business as it does to someone like me in the media. You earn it every day as Dimon said.

The whole interaction lasted less than 20 minutes and also involved some great conversation with the students when Dimon asked about their career plans and reminded all of us he believes journalism plays a critical role in the nation’s democracy. You can tell a lot about a businessperson by how that person treats the youngest employees. Want to work your way to the very top as Dimon did? That seems like a good place to start.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXJrcmVjb3JkLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BhcmstY2l0eS9qcG1vcmdhbi1jaGFzZS1jZW8tamFtaWUtZGltb24tc3RvcHBpbmctaW4tcGFyay1jaXR5LW1ha2VzLWJ1bGxpc2gtcHJlZGljdGlvbi1mb3Itc2tpLXNlYXNvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stopping in Park City makes bullish prediction for ski season,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.parkrecord.com/news/park-city/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-stopping-in-park-city-makes-bullish-prediction-for-ski-season/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXJrcmVjb3JkLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BhcmstY2l0eS9qcG1vcmdhbi1jaGFzZS1jZW8tamFtaWUtZGltb24tc3RvcHBpbmctaW4tcGFyay1jaXR5LW1ha2VzLWJ1bGxpc2gtcHJlZGljdGlvbi1mb3Itc2tpLXNlYXNvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2Nhci1wYXJ0LXByaWNlcy1oZWFkaW5nLWhpZ2hlctIBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2Nhci1wYXJ0LXByaWNlcy1oZWFkaW5nLWhpZ2hlci5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Car part prices are heading higher,"Auto part prices will continue to rise into year-end as cost pressures show no signs of abating according to one industry executive.

Higher costs for products shipping containers and labor will result in auto part prices rising another 5% by year-end CarParts CEO Lev Peker said. Prices have already increased about 5% to 7% this year.

""Everything is back ordered"" Peker told FOX Business. ""Everything takes weeks or months. It's a very tight supply chain right now.""

Ticker Security Last Change Change % PRTS CARPARTS.COM INC. 1.13 -0.03 -2.59%

He added that the whole process of moving product through the supply chain takes two months longer now than before the pandemic.

The industry like many others has grappled with a shortage of containers and cargo ships which has expanded shipping times. Once the ships arrive at port they face another delay due to slow unloading times caused by a labor shortage. Then a shortage of delivery truck drivers adds to wait times.

All of that has resulted in higher costs that are being passed onto the consumer.

JEEP RAISED THE PRICE OF BEST-SELLING PLUG-IN HYBRID WRANGLER 4XE THAT BIDEN DROVE

The auto-part industry has historically been able to raise prices on the customer due to the infrequent nature of purchases. Customers typically don’t need to buy the same part for one or two years or longer and don’t really know how much those components should cost.

Peker believes the current period of higher prices is likely transitory but he doesn't know when there will be a leveling off.

""Is it going to go for six months nine months 12 months that I'm not sure about"" he said.

CarParts.com isn’t alone in warning that auto parts prices are headed higher.

""We're beginning to see some pretty significant inflation on certain product categories"" said AutoZone CEO William Rhodes on the company’s third-quarter earnings call in May adding that his firm would ""pass those costs along"" to customers.

Advance Auto Parts CFO Jeff Shepherd said on his company’s quarterly conference call in June that higher costs for product freight and labor caused the company to model 3% inflation going forward.

Both Advanced Auto Parts and AutoZone are scheduled to report their quarterly results on Aug. 24.

CarParts.com on Thursday evening reported strong quarterly results.

AS AUTO INSURANCE RATES RISE INSURERS FACE BUMPY ROAD AHEAD

Second-quarter sales surged 32% year over year to a record $157.5 million. Net income was $2.1 million or 4 cents per diluted share up from $1.6 million last year.

Earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization hit a record $8.3 million.

Peker says his company has benefitted from the do-it-yourself mentality spurred by the pandemic and the wide availability of videos on YouTube and elsewhere that show consumers how to care for their cars themselves.

A third driver of growth although less significant was the used-car boom caused by the chip shortage. CarParts.com expects to see a bigger benefit from the recent surge in used-car sales down the road as the vehicles go out of warranty and owners are more apt to fix issues on their own.

CarParts.com’s typical customer has a vehicle that is 6-14 years old. The average age of a customer’s car is 12 years and getting older.

Peker is enthusiastic that his company’s recent success is just the beginning.

Dai (DAI) is a stablecoin linked to the value of the U.S. dollar. To maintain its price stability DAI’s value is regulated by MakerDAO its decentralized governance community. While actual DAI stablecoins are produced via its Maker Protocol platform that accepts various cryptocurrencies as collateral DAI can also be bought directly using fiat money (like the U.S. dollar) on most regulated crypto exchanges such as:

Let's take a look at the basics of DAI so you can decide if it's the right cryptocurrency for you.

Understanding DAI

There are three fundamental concepts that are necessary to understand DAI and what it does.

What's a stablecoin?

Stablecoins are a distinct subset of cryptocurrencies that strive to minimize the volatility usually associated with cryptos. Stablecoins also provide the expected crypto benefits of:

Secure transactions

Instant transfers anywhere in the world

Lower fees

Speedy settlements

Stablecoins such as DAI can do this because they are backed by a reserve currency or other underlying asset.

What's the Maker Protocol?

Maker Protocol is the foundational system developed by DAI creator Rune Christensen. It allows anyone in the world to produce the DAI stablecoin using a variety of cryptocurrencies as collateral. Some of the coins and tokens accepted as collateral include:

Ethereum (ETH)

Compound (COMP)

USD Coin (USDC)

Basic Attention Token (BAT)

What's a decentralized exchange?

A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange such as UniSwap or ByBit where users can easily exchange coins or tokens. For clarity coins run on their own blockchain while tokens run on another blockchain. With DEX transactions there's no third party brokering the deal so it's known as a ""permissionless"" transaction. A DEX runs on a piece of computer programming code -- known as a smart contract -- which runs on a blockchain. The nature of the blockchain and code together execute the transaction without a credit check bank approval or any delay.

DAI basics

What it does: DAI is a decentralized stablecoin with a 1:1 value ratio linked to $1 U.S.

Date launched: December 2017

Market cap: $5.69 billion (CoinMarketCap August 2021)

Availability: Available on several major centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken as well as DEXs including Uniswap ByBit and DAI's proprietary Maker Protocol

Should I buy it?

One of the key benefits of DAI is that it provides the transactional benefits of a cryptocurrency with hardly any volatility due to its linkage to the U.S. dollar. DAI is an ERC-20 token that was built specifically to run on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC stands for ""Ethereum Request for Comment"" which is the standard developed in 2015 that creates and enables smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

DAI can be purchased outright on either centralized cryptocurrency exchanges or DEXs. Using the Maker Protocol you can also borrow DAI by depositing Ethereum-based assets as collateral to underwrite the amount of DAI borrowed. DAI requires a larger collateral deposit than the amount of DAI borrowed to ensure network liquidity. If the value of your crypto-collateral drops below the value of the issued DAI tokens the collateral can be forfeited. However if your collateral increases in value your DAI borrowing limit increases proportionately. The Maker Protocol operates similar to an escrow account that holds collateral until the borrowed DAI and processing fees are returned.

Another benefit unique to DAI is how widely integrated it is within the Ethereum blockchain. Once bought or borrowed it can be used in hundreds of decentralized apps including:

Here are a few other features worth considering.

1. Passive income

DAI also has a unique interest-generating program called the DAI Savings Rate (DSR). It allows users to put idle DAI tokens to work producing a variable interest income through a lockup period. Another passive income option is where the DAI owner deposits the tokens directly into a MakerDAO smart contract. The smart contract is programmed to automatically add interest to the account. The investment and accrued earnings can be withdrawn anytime and has no minimum deposit.

2. Decentralized freedom

DAI investors benefit from unrestricted access to their funds thanks to DAI's decentralized design. There are no intermediaries approvals or credit checks due to its permissionless and transparent system. That's not always the case for other assets or fiat currencies.

3. Very secure

Routine audits DAI's secure integrated wallet two-factor authentication and other security measures boost the safety of the DAI ecosystem. Additionally developers in the MakerDAO community verify all smart contracts on the blockchain to ensure liquidity and network viability.

Bottom line

DAI provides a tremendous amount of flexibility and utility with the price stability of the U.S. dollar to boot. If you buy DAI it can be used across the Ethereum network in a number of ways including:

Staking of idle tokens to produce interest income

Borrowing DAI to buy other coins

Using it as a stable investment to hold profits from other token sales

For in-game purchases

One downside is potential loss of your overcollateralized asset if you borrow DAI on the Maker Protocol. Otherwise the upside of this unique asset makes it an easy way to dip your toe into crypto through a viable investment worthy of serious consideration."

ODEM Texas — 52-year-old James McCreary and 38-year-old Kimberly Arevalo were arrested Friday night just before midnight following reports that they were stealing copper from a facility near Odem.

San Patricio County Sheriff Oscar Rivera says they got a call about the theft and sent deputies to the area.

The pair were pulled over along interstate 37 and after a search of the vehicle deputies found two copper rectifier devices which are used in power supplies to convert alternate current to low voltage direct current.



According to the sheriff the items belong to the Kinder Morgan Company. McCreary and Arevalo were both arrested for felony theft of copper. Arevalo is also facing a drug charge after deputies allegedly found cocaine inside her purse.

HARRIS COUNTY Texas (KTRK) -- Gunfire from a nearby domestic dispute wounded an innocent driver overnight outside a northwest Harris County grocery store.

It happened around midnight at a Kroger in the 9100 block of West Sam Houston Tollway and West Road.

The victim was inside a vehicle in the parking lot when someone fired a gun during a fight nearby authorities said. The bullet pierced the man's vehicle critically injuring him.

He was taken to Ben Taub Hospital where he was in critical condition but was stable.

Investigators were still looking into what led to the shooting and no arrests had been made Saturday morning.

In June the Cincinnati-based supermarket chain launched a hiring campaign to add 10000 workers nationwide including 1000 targeted for its hometown.

So far Kroger indicates it's about halfway noting it made 5000 job offers to individuals who participated in a one-day hiring event in June that occurred at stores and digitally.

Kroger officials said they are still hiring but did not update their overall headcount. They added competition for workers is part of the reason the grocer has boosted wages and is raising them again this year.

Pay keeps rising but Kroger still can't find enough workers

""We know talent is selective"" Tim Massa Kroger’s chief people officer told The Enquirer in an email. ""We continue to improve every day and...are truly driven to be the best employer in the Greater Cincinnati region and one of the best places to work no matter your skill set role or ambitions.""

This spring Kroger said it would raise average worker pay to $16 per hour excluding benefits. The grocer said it spent $300 million in 2020 to boost regular wages to its associates which averaged $15.50 per hour before benefits.

Massa noted the average Kroger worker in Greater Cincinnati will ultimately get almost $20 per hour before benefits under a new five-year contract ratified earlier this year.

The labor squeeze comes as Kroger has big plans here and across the country: this spring the grocer opened the first of 20 planned robotic warehouses that are critical to its plans to ramp up its home delivery business. The new facility in Monroe a northern suburb of Cincinnati will ultimately employ 400 workers – many of them delivery drivers who will start at $19 per hour.

Beginning in the spring of 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic sent shock wages to Kroger and its workforce.

Already one of the world's largest private employers (four times the headcount of Cincinnati-based consumer titan Procter & Gamble) Kroger's stores were slammed with extra business as restaurants closed or cut back service and shoppers cooked more meals at home. Consumers also hoarded items like toilet paper.

Kroger's total sales surged 8.4% to $132.5 billion in 2020 helping to drive profits to $2.6 billion for the year up 5.6%.

Branded ""essential workers"" Kroger grocery associates were awarded a series of one-time ""hero pay"" bonuses in the early weeks of the pandemic that its largest union United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) said should have continued as the health crisis stretched into months.

In 2020 Kroger hired an eye-popping additional 100000 workers to handle the surge in extra demand. Most of those hires wound up being temporary as workers quit to resume their previous jobs in other sectors.

""Kroger has literally made billions in pandemic profits off the sacrifices of grocery workers in Seattle and across the country"" said UFCW president Marc Perrone earlier this year.

Kroger currently employs 465000 nationwide (more than 18000 in Greater Cincinnati) up from 30000 from last year prior to the pandemic.

Kroger and grocers are hardly alone several industries are struggling to hire workers some of who are hesitant to return to the workforce amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Local restaurateur John Lanni the co-founder and owner of Cincinnati restaurant group Thunderdome Restaurant Group even peppered President Joe Biden about the nation's worker shortage when he visited Cincinnati last month.

Besides Kroger stores the grocer operates several regional supermarket chains in 35 states including Fred Meyer Harris Teeter Ralphs Mariano's Fry's Smith's King Soopers QFC and others. The company has nearly 2800 stores.

B

Big Bear revolutionized shopping in the Midwest having been the first self-service grocery store in the whole region when the first store opened in Columbus in 1934.

That store on West Lane Avenue was opened in what had previously been a horse show ring and before that a roller skating rink. Though the start was precarious the chain was to thrive in Ohio and West Virginia for decades lasting until 2004 before folding.

The chain changed retail shopping nationwide when they introduced motorized conveyor belts operated by cashiers at the checkout an innovation that was soon taken up by almost every rival. They were also one of the first stores to introduce the use of grocery carts for customers to carry goods.

The chain was near its peak when the Mount Vernon store opened before other chains began gaining on Big Bear. The chain rapidly lost ground in the 1980s and 90s to Kroger and Meijer and was sold to a holding company which filed for bankruptcy in 2004. Many store locations had already closed before then.

Mount Vernon had the distinction of having had a Big Bear grand opening twice. Jim Delozier came to town in 1983 to manage the original store then he oversaw the planning and building of the new store located a little further out Coshocton Road.

He eventually left the company and passed away in Mount Vernon in 2008 according to his obituary.

Someone who is better versed in cars will have to identify the models seen in the photo from the 1961 opening. I would say that they look to be largely (if not exclusively) American-made cars many quite recent models for the 1961 date of the event — definitely not the description of the cars at any grand opening today!"
LHX,L3Harris,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vdXJnZW50Y29tbS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8wNy9mbG9yaWRhLWNvbnRyYWN0LXdpdGgtbDNoYXJyaXMtZm9yLXNsZXJzLXAyNS1maXJzdG5ldC1pbnRlcm9wZXJhYmlsaXR5LXRvdGFscy00NTAtbWlsbGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida contract with L3Harris for SLERS P25 FirstNet interoperability totals $450 million - Urgent Comms,"L3Harris Technologies this week announced that it will maintain and upgrade the Florida Statewide Law Enforcement Radio Systems (SLERS) to Project 25 (P25) Phase 2 under a 15-year contract worth $450 million—the largest public-safety LMR contract awarded in the United States in years according to industry sources.

There was no surprise associated with L3Harris being named as the contractor to build the P25 SLERS which is known as SLERS-2—the Florida Legislature made the award to L3Harris as part of budget process and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the budget into law. But L3Harris CEO Chris Kubasik was the first to publicly state the terms of the 15-year $450 million deal which was announced during the company’s quarterly earnings call on Tuesday.

Florida’s elected leaders took the unusual step of preempting on ongoing second SLERS-2 procurement with the budgetary award just weeks before the existing SLERS contract with L3Harris was about to expire. A second SLERS-2 procurement was initiated after the vendor selected in the initial SLERS-2 procurement—Motorola Solutions—could not reach a contract agreement with the state after submitting a winning bid of $687.8 million which was more than $300 million less than the bid from L3Harris at the time.

Many within the public-safety-communications arena have been monitoring Florida SLERS developments closely. In addition to the size of the contract sources throughout the industry have been intrigued to learn how the state of Florida would seek to realize its plans for a “next-generation system” that is designed to provide first responders interoperable access to both P25 LMR and LTE-based FirstNet technologies.

According to the new agreement with the Florida Department of Management Services (DMS) L3Harris will operate and maintain the statewide system and will be paid $19 million annually—a figure similar to the payments it has received for years as the SLERS incumbent—for 15 years for a total of $285 million. L3Harris also will be paid $111 million to upgrade the 197 SLERS sites from aging EDACS-EA to P25 technology.

In addition to the $396 million contract for the LMR network the state of Florida will pay L3Harris $54 million for new portable and mobile radios that state officials intend to be operational in the field by June 30 next year.

These new devices will be capable of operating on both the EDACS-EA and P25 networks—as well as on the FirstNet system—as part of the interoperability vision for SLERS-2.

“SLERS-2 shall support interoperability between SLERS-2 and other radio systems used throughout the state for mutual-aid and interoperable communications” according to the contract. “SLERS-2 shall be a standards-based communications system allowing for interoperability between P25 Compliance Assessment Program (CAP) compliant radios.

“SLERS-2 shall be equipped and licensed with Inter-RF Subsystem Interface (ISSI) equipment providing interoperability with other P25 systems that meets P-25 (ISSI) standards. SLERS-2 shall support equipment and services for the Interoperability Subsystem.”

One unique aspect of SLERS-2 is the requirement that it support interoperable communications with FirstNet the nationwide public-safety broadband network being built by AT&T. To make this vision a reality the L3Harris contract stipulates that SLERS-2 will have a Smartphone/Broadband Device Integration (SPBBI) Subsystem that will “integrate voice and data between SLERS-2 broadband devices and/or smartphone applications and SLERS-2 systems and subsystems.”

The contract outlines the push-to-talk capabilities that the SPBBI must enable.

“The SPBBI Subsystem shall provide Push-to-Talk (PTT) communications operating over private and public Wi-Fi networks 3G/4G/5G carrier networks including but not limited to FirstNet’s LTE network. The SPBBI Subsystem must support the following:

“1. Carrier integrated PTT over cellular (PTToC)

“2. Over-the-top PTToC operation on carrier networks

“3. PTT communications on private and public Wi-Fi and other broadband networks (PTToBB)

“4. Contractor [L3Harris] will not be held responsible for performance of the cellular network.”

L3Harris also must supply a computer-aided-dispatch (CAD) interface service that will support communications with a new CAD system that is expected to be deployed beginning in 2023 according to the contract.

Signed on June 30—the final day of the initial SLERS contract between the state of Florida and L3Harris—and effective on July 1 the new SLERS-2 contract ensured that Florida first responders maintained mission-critical voice communications without disruption a DMS spokesperson confirmed.

Looking ahead the contract outlines that L3Harris will begin by installing VIDA Premier Cores in the Orlandoo and Jacksonville areas upgrading existing P25 Aircraft and Public Safety Interoperable Communications (PSIC) locations from P25 Phase 1 to P25 Phase 2 and replacing microwave links in the southeastern and east-central parts of the state.

After that L3 Harris is expected to implement phased upgrades from the aging EDACS-EA technology—SLERS is the last network in the world to use the proprietary protocol—to P25 Phase 2 on a region-by-region basis.

“The goal of the P25 upgrade plan is to keep the EDACS-EA system operational while users in each region are transitioned to the upgraded P25 system within that region” the contract states. “During the transition a link will be established via the VIDA IP Gateway to allow communications between users of both SLERS-2 and the EDACS-EA system.

“At the completion of each region cutover to the upgraded P25 system will take place. Existing SLERS EDACS-EA equipment will remain in place and offline during this period for fallback capability.”

P25 equipment first will be “installed commissioned and P25 Verification Test Procedures performed at all sites” in the Miami and Lake Worth regions according to the contract. This process will be repeated sequentially in the Orlando and Jacksonville region the Tampa and Ft. Myers region and then the Tallahassee and Pensacola region.

New equipment—notably Symphony consoles from L3Harris—also will be deployed in regional dispatch centers according to the contract.

“Work in the dispatch centers located in each region is essential for a successful cutover” the contract states. “Consoles will be replaced on a one-for-one basis. Connectivity between the new console and the legacy EDACS-EA SLERS equipment will be maintained through the VIDA IP Gateway. Contractor and the State will have a dispatch workshop to review the capabilities of the new Symphony console and develop a standard/default Symphony console screen layout.

“Once the above upgrade work is completed users can be successfully cutover to the upgraded SLERS-2 radio system on a region-by-region basis.”

After the transition to P25 Phase 2 technology is completed use of the EDACS-EA technology will be discontinued according to the contract.

Scheduled target dates for completing each phase of the P25 Phase 2 rollout are not publicly available yet as the publicly available contract is heavily redacted in sections where that information likely exists.

However contract language associated with the conveyance of SLERS towers from L3Harris to the state of Florida may provide some indication about the scheduled timing for completion of the overall project. According to the contract the towers would be conveyed within 60 days of July 1 2026 or of the final acceptance of the SLER-2 upgrade whichever is earlier.

This conveyance language in the contract should address a longtime concern about access to the towers which was cited as one of the reasons that Motorola Solutions was unable to reach a contract agreement with the DMS in late 2019.

“The Contractor [L3Harris] shall convey all Conveyed Towers along with the Communications System and SLERS-2 to the Department in their “as is” condition free and clear of all liens and encumbrances at no cost to the Department” the new contract states.

In addition contract language indicates potential changes in the makeup of the SLERS tower portfolio noting that DMS and L3Harris “will evaluate ways to reduce the number of third-party leased towers used in the Communications System including without limitation opportunities to use towers owned by state agencies as well as opportunities to construct new towers on state-owned real property.

“The objective will be to develop a mutually agreed upon amendment to this contract for the construction or use of a new tower(s) (and end a third-party tower lease) including without limitation the project requirements project schedule and potential compensation for the contractor [L3Harris].”

This new contract with L3Harris was established under a budget framework approved by the Florida Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Budget language called for DMS to sign a 15-year contract with L3Harris to maintain the existing EDACS EA network—the last one in the world to use this technology—and build a new P25 system as well as earmarking $55 million to be spent on the new EDAC/P25 radios.

The reason the legislative action for a P25 upgrade to SLERS was deemed necessary by many is that Motorola Solutions did not agree to a contract with the state after being selected in the procurement phase and surviving a lengthy protest from L3Harris. In January 2020 DMS announced that it ended talks with Motorola Solutions after the LMR giant declined to sign a contract based on the terms of its bid according to a state official.

Florida lawmakers awarded the no-bid contract to L3Harris—referenced as “the entity that was operating the statewide radio communications system”—at the end of April during the final week of this year’s legislative session. Legislators took the unusual measure while citing the need for “emergency action” as the existing SLERS contract with L3Harris was due to expire on June 30.",,,,,,,,,,,,
LH,LabCorp,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiHWh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXlpbmMuY29tL2xhYmNvcnAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20 Things You Didn't Know About LabCorp,"LabCorp is the abbreviation of the company that is officially titled Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings. They operate a network of clinical laboratories They're an American company and if you haven't heard about them but have an interest in laboratory testing they're an important corporation to know about because you may be familiar with some of their subsidiaries. To let everyone know about the interesting and important facts about them here are 20 things you didn't know about LabCorp.

1. They operate one of the biggest clinical laboratory networks on the planet

LabCorp has a network of 36 laboratories which serve as their primary locations. These are within the United States. There are many more outside of the borders of its home country. They also operate large network affiliates in Canada and in Puerto Rico.

2. LabCorp pioneered genomic testing

The company is an important and valuable resource for the United States as well as the entire world because of the significant contributions that its labs have made in the field of genomic testing. LabCorp was one of the first to pioneer genomic testing through the use of an innovative technology known as polymerase chain reaction or PCR. This was accomplished at its Triangle Park North Carolina location called the Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology in Research.

3. Their research could lead to a cure for current health epidemics

LabCorp also performs other types of molecular diagnostics. They take common life-threatening diseases and perform genotyping and phenotyping to learn more about what makes these diseases thrive and how to arrest their growth. Two important forms of this testing that they do is oncology which deals with cancer and human immunodeficiency virus or HIV testing. Research in these areas and the development of knowledge about them that can lead to a cure may be vital for our survival as a species.

4. The company was founded under a different name

When this massive clinical laboratory network giant first formed it was under a different name. It was called National Health Laboratories Incorporated. They began as a national laboratory for testing of blood and pathology samples and they were originally owned by the Revlon Health Care Group which served as the parent company.

5. Going public and turning a profit

National Health Laboratories went public as a company on the NASDAQ exchange in 1988. Revlon only retained 24% of the common shares of the company. The revenues for the company climbed to a high of $500 million by 1990 with earnings in the US of more than $70 million. It was at this time that the company started paying out cash dividends to its shareholders. The company was performing extremely well and even continued to profit during the recession of 1990-1991 with an increase in revenue to nearly $90 million in earnings.

6. Prior to 1995 They were known under a different name

The name of the company that has emerged into a giant in the industry was Roche BioMedical. This is an interesting fact about the history of LabCorp in the process of its evolution. Roche BioMedical merged with National Health Laboratory in 1995. We see a pattern of mergers of major laboratory companies and in many instances the company that does the acquisition absorbs the company into its main structure but sometimes when the acquired company performs functions that are established under its own brand name they are allowed to maintain the same name as a subsidiary company. The entire process gets complicated.

7. LabCorp owned a genetics lab

LabCorp also operates a genetics testing facility and laboratory. The name of the company is National Genetics Institute Inc. The facility is located in Los Angeles California. NGI develops PCR testing methods. It's interesting to discover just how many different branches of testing and laboratory disciplines fall under the umbrella of the mega-giant in the industry. They also own a ViroMed facility which performs PCR microbial testing in real-time with lab-developed assays. This facility was originally located in Minnetonka Minnesota but in 2013 it was relocated to Burlington North Carolina.

8. LabCorp has a fleet of aircraft

It really comes as no surprise that LabCorp uses a total of eight aircraft to make runs from one facility alone. These aircraft make nightly flights without fail. Tests and other products are flown from the facility in Burlington North Carolina to the East Coast for use at labs and other facilities in these locations.

9. LabCorp was investigated for fraud in 1991

There was a huge crackdown on health care system fraud in a nationwide operation that was titled ""Labscam."" The U.S. Attorney's Office was in charge of the investigation. Changes were filed against LabCorp along with many other labs accusing them of submitting false claims for payment from government health care agencies including Medicaid and Medicare for tests which were never ordered by physicians. The company that was now LabCorp was prosecuted under its previous name National Health Laboratories and it was one of the first companies to be prosecuted for the crimes of fraud.

10. National Health Laboratories was fined millions

When the case against National Health Laboratories concluded in the Labcam investigation it wasn't a positive outcome for the company. They entered into a settlement agreement that required them to make a payment of $111 million in 1992 then make another payment the following year for a total of $173 million dollars in the settlement. This was most certainly a scandalous event and it came at the time when insurance rates were rising because of the high number of fraudulent claims that were being made not only on government insurance accounts but also through the entire sector of private insurance carriers. It is estimated that the total amount of funds which were obtained from insurance companies for unnecessary unauthorized and fraudulent test claims amounted to billions of dollars. The costs were passed along to consumers were then charged higher premiums higher deductibles and higher co-payments often with a reduction in their benefits plans.

11. The Labscam fines were more than their profits

The year that National Health Laboratories was required to make their first payment on the Labscam settlement was in 1992. Their profits for the year in actual earnings were just $40 million even though the reported revenues were $720 million.

12. A candy distributor owned part interest in National Health Laboratories

The company had gone through a major reorganization in 1994 and officially changed their name to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. Twenty-four percent ownership of the company was held by the Revlon Holding's Group. It's a fun fact that this company distributed licorice extract and chocolate.

13. LabCorp has an interesting history of acquisitions

They started out as National Health Laboratories Incorporated in 1978. The acquired Allied Clinical Laboratories Inc in 1994. In 1995 the company merged with Roche Biomedical Laboratories Inc then acquired Litholink Corporation in 2006. In 2007 they acquired Tandem Labs followed by Monogram Biosciences in 2009 Genzyme Genetics in 2011 MedTOX in 2012 Covance Inc in 2015 Sequenom in 2016 and Clear Path Diagnostics in 2016 along with Chiltern.

14. They hit more financial problems in 1994

Granted this is a massive corporation and as such a bad year now and then doesn't necessarily signal the end of its existence but it's not good for the shareholders. The company that did well through the financial crisis that hit the country from 1990-91 was now struggling with a drop of more than two thirds in revenue with a total of just $30 million. The stock trade stayed below its peak from the previous year by a little over half.

15. LabCorp of America Holdings took a marginal loss

When the company officially became known as LabCorp in 1995 it took a big hit and actually lost funds in the amount of a few million dollars. It had reached a frightening level of difficulty. The price of its stock took a drop of nearly half over the year and this would be within 10% of its all-time low since it went public six years earlier.

16. It failed in an agreement with Universal Standard Healthcare

In the summer of 1998 LabCorp made the acquisition of Universal Standard Healthare with an equity position and it became their clinical laboratory testing provider for the long-term. The agreement was terminated just one year later. When we attempted to identify the reason for the dissolution of the agreement there were no records available to explain why it didn't work out but it could have been for a number of reasons. They still retained control of the company but no longer performed their long-term testing assignments.

17. By 2000 LabCorp was in the pink with substantial growth

In the year 2000 LabCorp had made several prosperous acquisitions and they were operating throughout a variety of disciplines within the laboratory/testing industry. Their revenue for the year reached the amount of $1.9 billion and they employed more than 18000 workers. Over the next few years they would continue to make one large acquisition after another adding to their clinical diagnostic testing disciplines in virology molecular biology microbiology mycology serology mycobacteriology and testing for tissue and eye banks. In late 2001 LabCorp also became a genomics and proteomics predictive cancer test product marketer exclusively with products made by Myraid Genetics Inc.

18. LabCorp made 4.1 billion in revenues in 2007

From May of 2002 through 2007 the company continued to add to its long list of subsidiary companies by making yet more acquisitions and moving into the medical laboratory territory of companies established in three Canadian provinces. This was a massive expansion of the LabCorp company. They were growing and on the move.

19. LabCorp really got into HIV and DNA testing services

DNA testing is a very lucrative business with all of the advances in research that pose yet more questions testing hit a boom. There were so many different types of DNA testing in demand that it made sense to acquire companies with a heavy focus on this industry. Interest in ancestry as well as research that is looking for treatments and cures of a variety of genetic conditions and predispositions spurred the need for an increase in this type of testing facility with newer and improved DNA testing that could yield more data than ever before. LabCorp companies also specialized in paternity testing as a part of their DNA diagnostics center. One of their most interesting acquisitions in this area came in December of 2014 when LabCorp completes its agreement to acquire the Bode Technology Group which specializes in forensic DNA analysis and DNA collection products. The scope of their DNA testing facilities covered nearly every aspect of the science which had been established at this point in time. Work on HIV testing also continued to be a large focus with multiple subsidiaries specializing in this field of research.

20. LabCorp also dabbles in the Food Industry

When it comes to Laboratory testing one important industry that cannot be overlooked is the food manufacturers. LabCorp expanded its interests into this arena in October of 2015. They made the official announcement at this time that they would acquire Safe Foods International Holdings LLC. Along with the newly purchased company was included two subsidiaries which were International Food Network and The National Food Laboratory. The amount of the deal was never disclosed publicly. Although this wasn't new territory for LabCorp it was their most significant entrance into this part of the industry. This expanded the capabilities of the larger parent company in expanding their testing into the food and beverage product development as well as for generating products and services that ensured product integrity. Through all of their ups and downs LabCorp has done a little bit of everything that you can imagine when it comes to laboratory testing and more. They're represented by companies that you never would have imagined are under their massive umbrella of subsidiaries.",,,,,,,,,,,,

You won’t see their names on Las Vegas Boulevard marquees and you may not have even heard of them.

But two heavyweight firms Vici Properties and The Blackstone Group are emerging as two of the biggest players on the Strip.

Their role? Collecting rent.

Vici a Caesars Entertainment spinoff announced a $17.2 billion deal Wednesday to acquire MGM Resorts International spinoff MGM Growth Properties giving Vici real estate ownership of many of the biggest hotel-casinos on the Strip.

Blackstone has its own growing portfolio of hotels on Las Vegas Boulevard and overall the two companies are slated to own more than a dozen megaresorts combined along the famed casino corridor mostly as landlords.

All this wheeling and dealing probably has little if any effect on guests at the properties or any immediate impact on the employees other than changing where companies send their rent checks.

But the two New York firms are betting billions that tourism here will thrive — and that casino operators can pay a fortune in rent.

‘On time and in cash’

Vici a casino landlord and Blackstone a financial conglomerate are buying hotels as Las Vegas bounces back from the still-raging coronavirus outbreak which dealt a catastrophic economic blow to Southern Nevada.

The pandemic temporarily turned the Strip into a ghost town of shuttered resorts last year sparked huge job losses in the casino-heavy region and kept people home and away from crowds for fear of getting infected devastating the tourism industry.

The landlords’ line of business however seems to be fine.

Vici CEO Ed Pitoniak said on a conference call Wednesday that both MGM Growth and his company have collected “100 percent of our rent so far through COVID on time and in cash.”

Vici’s real estate holdings include Caesars Palace and Harrah’s Las Vegas. In early March it also announced a deal with Apollo Global Management to purchase The Venetian Palazzo and Sands Expo and Convention Center for about $6.25 billion from casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp. with Vici acquiring the real estate and Apollo buying the operations side. The deal is expected to close early next year.

With its purchase of MGM Growth Vici is buying several MGM Resorts-operated properties including The Mirage Park MGM Luxor New York-New York and Excalibur.

Betting billions

Blackstone not only dropped $1.73 billion in 2014 for The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas it also has a history of multibillion-dollar real estate deals with MGM Resorts.

As announced in early July Blackstone is buying the Aria and Vdara hotels for nearly $3.9 billion and leasing them back to MGM. Blackstone also partnered with MGM Growth on a $4.6 billion deal early last year to acquire the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay’s real estate and lease them back to MGM Resorts with Vici saying this week it will retain MGM Growth’s stake in the venture.

Moreover Blackstone bought the Bellagio in 2019 for about $4.2 billion from MGM Resorts and leased it back.

As you can imagine leasing a resort with thousands of rooms is not cheap. The Bellagio sale for instance called for an initial annual rent of $245 million.

Las Vegas’ tourism industry has by no means fully recovered from the pandemic and the public health crisis is far from over. But the local economy has come a long way since the early chaos of the outbreak and Las Vegas is still a place where people spend big on hotels — not to mention gambling and booze.

“As much as parents like to spend money on their kids whether in Orlando and other locations I don’t think anybody’s ever spent $10000 on a bottle of apple juice” Pitoniak said this week.

He's an American who has made billions in the hospitality and recreation industry and has risen to the status of b1. usiness magnate. He's in his eighties and he's led an interesting life on his journey which is still ongoing. If you're not familiar with Adelson you're in the right place to learn about some significant achievements and contributions that he's made. Here are 10 things that you didn't know about Sheldon Adelson but may be glad to know.

Michael Brown

The Highlands is Caldwell Home’s newest master-planned community coming soon to Montgomery County will feature 4000 homes from award-winning builders and with amenities for a highly active lifestyle. Inspired by the thick forestation of the 2300-acre site The Highlands presents itself like a national park featuring large recreational lakes a 300-acre nature preserve and a sandy beach along the San Jacinto River just west of FM 1314 along the Grand Parkway.

“The topography of this site is what really sets it apart” said Peter Barnhart vice president of land development for Caldwell in a release. “We wanted to be good stewards of the natural resources and the densely-treed setting has greatly inspired the development direction of the community. Even the streets are named after national parks.”

Groundbreaking on The Highlands has begun with a grand opening planned for mid-2022. The Highlands will offer the best in master-planned community amenities including a semi-private 18-hole golf course and clubhouse miles of scenic hiking and biking trails waterpark and lazy river onsite fitness tennis and pickle ball courts an event lawn and pavilion for live music and more. These amenities along with a full-time event director will provide an unparalleled living experience for residents while also promoting an outdoor lifestyle in which families and friends can connect and socialize in harmony with their surroundings.

“If you’re in the market for a home The Highlands is definitely worth the wait” said Jennifer Symons vice president of marketing. “From the forty miles of rated trails along an elevated ridge of the property to the unique nature-inspired waterpark residents at The Highlands will experience a wealth of amenities unlike any other we’ve designed.”

Known for building extraordinary places that enrich lives Caldwell has won local regional and national recognition for its communities and has been named Developer of the Year by the GHBA. Caldwell has built many award-winning communities throughout Houston including Towne Lake which was recently named the “Best Community in Houston” by the Houston Chronicle and a Landmark award recipient of the HBJ.

Resident HOA dues will include a social membership to the semi-private 18-hole golf course Highland Pines built by Augusta Pines developer Tour18. Highland Pines will be the first all-zoysia grass course and provide a robust juniors program for kids looking to enhance their golf skills.

The Highlands will also be home to a new onsite elementary school slated for Fall 2024. Zoned to New Caney ISD one of the fastest growing school districts in Texas The Highlands students currently attend Crippen Elementary New Caney Middle School and New Caney High School.

“We’ve gone to great lengths to make sure that there’s something for everyone at The Highlands” says Barnhart. “Homes will be priced from the $290’s and up and offer a wide variety of home types for residents in every stage of life.”

Built by Houston’s most notable builders buyers will be able to browse floor plans in the community’s Model Home Park later this fall. The Highlands builder lineup includes Beazer Homes Caldwell Homes Coventry Homes David Weekley Homes Drees Homes Empire Communities Highland Homes Lennar Homes Newmark Homes Partners In Building Perry Homes and Ravenna Homes.

The Highlands will also include active-adult homes nestled within the community specifically designed for those 55 and better. Patio homes for active-adults will include lawn maintenance in the HOA dues for the ultimate lock-and-leave lifestyle.

Located in North Houston The Highlands provides a lush forested setting just minutes away from top destinations such as The Woodlands Old Town Spring and George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH). Residents will have an easy commuter access to all major freeways including I-45 and Hwy 69 with close proximity to major area employers such as Anadarko Chevron and Exxon Mobil.

“It feels like an escape from Houston yet still close to it all so homeowners get the best of both worlds.” said Symons.

Development is currently underway and the community is slated for a soft opening late fall with a Grand Opening mid-2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8va2V2c2Jlc3QuY29tL2hvbWUtYnVpbGRlcnMtaW4tbGFzLXZlZ2FzLW52L9IBM2h0dHBzOi8va2V2c2Jlc3QuY29tL2hvbWUtYnVpbGRlcnMtaW4tbGFzLXZlZ2FzLW52Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Best Home Builders in Las Vegas NV,"Below is a list of the top and leading Home Builders in Las Vegas.

Read more

Japanese Breakfast’s joyous show at Union Transfer on Friday was a triumphant homecoming the first of a five-night run for the Philadelphia band led by Michelle Zauner that vividly demonstrated live music’s spirit-sustaining power at a heightened moment when it’s once again under threat.

The evening was emotionally charged for a number of reasons. It was the first show back at the Spring Garden Street venue since the coronavirus shutdown began.

And the artist and venue have a history: When Zauner was living in Philadelphia after graduating from Bryn Mawr College in 2011 she worked the indie rock venue’s coat check while trying to make it with her band Little Big League.

“It’s so good to be home” Zauner said early on center stage in a ruffled white dress in front of her six-piece band before singing the bittersweet “Kokomo IN” from her new album Jubilee. “Five [expletive] nights. How did this happen? I don’t know. But thank you so much for giving us this wonderful gift. It’s not lost on me.”

How it happened is that Zauner has been building an intimate relationship with fans since the first Japanese Breakfast album Psychopomp in 2016 and its follow-up Soft Sounds From Another Planet which came out the following year.

Both of those albums were written in reaction to the death of her mother Chongmi in 2014 as was Crying In H Mart her artful acutely insightful best-selling memoir about connecting with her Korean identity through food that she is now adapting into a feature film for Orion Pictures.

Pop stars write songs that make us feel they know us and we in turn believe we know them. The bond between Zauner and the Philly crowd is deeper than most because she’s been so open about learning to live with the grief that led to the hard-earned optimism of Jubilee.

As she bounded about in thigh-high boots opening the set with the new album’s ecstatic “Paprika” Zauner banged on a gong as the band built to a payoff line that expressed how it felt to once again be at a show with such a sense of occasion: “It’s a rush!”

Indeed it was. But of course it was also an angst-inducing experience that at once felt reassuringly familiar and uncomfortably uncertain. When this run of Union Transfer shows — which will continue Saturday and Sunday with Philly punk band Mannequin Pussy opening and Tuesday and Wednesday with local psych-rockers Spirit Of The Beehive — were announced they were meant to be post-pandemic celebrations.

With fears about the delta variant and frustration with vaccine resistance it’s again unclear whether the return to indoor shows in particular will be able to carry on. The U.S. is now averaging 100000 new COVID-19 infections a day a level not seen since the winter surge.

This past Monday Japanese Breakfast pointed to what will hopefully be a safe way forward on their tour by making it mandatory for audience members to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test to enter venues and to wear a mask when not eating or drinking. By Friday afternoon dominant promoter Live Nation had changed its policy to accommodate the growing call to have vax-only shows be at the discretion of artists.

At Union Transfer the newly implemented system worked as orderly as one could hope. Two people checked vaccination cards — or photos of them on phones — in a quick-moving line outside the venue. Owner Sean Agnew said that of the 5850 tickets sold for the five shows 160 were refunded due to the vaccine and testing policy. As a result few tickets remain for Sunday Tuesday and Wednesday at uniontransfer.com.

Inside the venue I took a spot up front to the far right of the stage. The general admission floor of the room is all-ages which is an added bonus: Nobody’s drinking so no one’s sliding off their mask.

Save for one dude who called out to a friend across the room I didn’t see a single nose or mouth all night. It was the most crowded space I’ve been in in 17 months but it never felt crushed even when a mini mosh pit broke out while Mannequin Pussy’s Marisa Dabice led the five-piece band through an alternately dreamy and trashy satisfying 45-minute set.

Back to Japanese Breakfast. Zauner’s rapport with the crowd and growing confidence as a bandleader relaxed the room as the evening went along. The band’s musicality was on display throughout.

Slide guitar licks by Peter Bradley who is Zauner’s husband made “Kokomo IN” stick. “Posing In Bondage” cast a dreamy trippy spell full of longing. Zauner played piano on Dolly Parton’s “Here You Come Again.”

She explained that the enticingly melodic “Boyish” was inspired by working at Society Hill restaurant Xochitl and that as “a true Philadelphian” she wrote “Posing For Cars” about taking mushrooms in the Poconos.

Zauner writes about serious stuff and you might get the impression that her music is a downer. But her pop sensibility makes sure even songs like “In Hell” — about putting down the family dog — are balanced out with buoyancy and occasionally out and out bliss as on the ebullient “Everybody Wants To Love You.”

Before that song she handed a piñata to an audience member and asked them to wait until her guitar solo got so good that the natural reaction would be she “can shred!” She can and the piñata was smashed and the song and the whole show delivered the release everyone had been waiting for for so long.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy8xNDczNjAwL3F1ZWVuLWFkYW0tbGFtYmVydC1uby1tb3JlLW11c2ljLW1hdGVyaWFsLXJlY29yZGluZ3Mtc29uZ3Mtc2luZ2Vycy1iYW5k0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy8xNDczNjAwL3F1ZWVuLWFkYW0tbGFtYmVydC1uby1tb3JlLW11c2ljLW1hdGVyaWFsLXJlY29yZGluZ3Mtc29uZ3Mtc2luZ2Vycy1iYW5kL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Another one bites the dust...

His new book Fretted & Moaning is already exciting TV interest ‑ and it’s not published yet. “I met with someone this week to talk about adapting it” guitarist Andy tells me from his home in Santa Monica California. “There’s definitely room for something oddball and quietly weird on TV.”

He’s written 45 short stories ‑ one for every rpm of a seven-inch single. All feature a dark twist. Fans won’t be surprised by the deftness of Summers’s writing ‑ his droll honest One Train After is one of the best rock autobiographies ‑ or by his sense of humour. Andy wrote two of The Police’s funniest songs Mother and Be My Girl ‑ Sally about one man’s love for his inflatable doll. “You need a sense of humour in this business” he chuckles. “Gallows’ humour to get through the life of a musician.” Andy’s stories introduce us to rival country stars Carter Lewis & Lewis Carter and Sullivan ‑ “a composite rock star” he says. “I liked him so he’s in four of the stories.” His own favourites are Western saga Sagebrush and the 1930s-set A Corpse In Tinsel Town. Characters include an ahem inventive publicist ‑ affectionately inspired by rock PR Keith Altham the man who told Jimi Hendrix to set fire to his guitar and handled the Police’s press for years. “I liked Keith but we were so innocent we went along with whatever he suggested.” Lowbrow culture rubs shoulders with highbrow. Ivan Ilyich and Zen Buddhism are both mentioned. One story riffs on Casablanca and classical guitar piece Etude No 11 features in a vivid fantasy. All of the tales are music related many drawing on first-hand experiences. Even The Stalker ‑ “I had one standing outside my house” says Andy 78. “So it wasn’t difficult to go from that to this made-up scenario.” The Police “went through it all” he says. “We spent a night trapped in a dressing room in Italy while riots raged outside. Another time we couldn’t leave our hotel for three days. We got a toilet roll and rolled it out with the word ‘help’ written on it… “I’ve had a lifetime on this scene so I had a lot to draw on.” He isn’t kidding. Lancashire-born Summers has been a global star for 42 years and a pro musician for twenty more.

All of the stories are music related and draw on personal experience

Five years after The Police were pushing their broken van through the streets of London after “playing to no one” they were headlining New York’s Shea Stadium. That same year 1983 they topped the US chart with their last studio album Synchronicity for four consecutive months. The band became a multi-million-dollar industry notching up unforgettable hits like Walking On The Moon Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic and Don’t Stand So Close To Me. Andy’s mastery of complex chords harmonics and effects were an essential part of The Police’s sound. His guitarwork on Every Breath You Take took the song to a different level. Summers is “a pretty literary person” he says. “As a teenager I read Herman Hesse Siddhartha that kind of s***. My buddy was pretty bookish too. We read Dostoyevsky but I’d get a better grip of it if I read it now.”

The Police became a multi-million-dollar band

Born Andrew Somers war-baby Andy grew up in Bournemouth. His father was in the RAF his mother worked in a bomb factory. He was 13 when he formed The Midnights playing US folk standards like Midnight Special with school pals but jazz (along with Brigitte Bardot) fired his teenage dreams. “Jazz was where I started ‑ Kenny Burrell Wes Montgomery Miles Davis Courtney Pine” he says. “I listen to pretty esoteric music now.” His first proper group was Zoot Money’s Big Roll Band an R&B combo popular on the early sixties Mod scene. Some weeks they’d play thirteen gigs over a weekend packing in regular shows all-nighters and a Sunday afternoon set. Their only hit was Big Time Operator in 1966. A year later they became psychedelic acid-rock band Dantalian’s Chariot. When the Chariot’s wheels came off Andy joined avant-garde combo Soft Machine and then a late US based line-up of The Animals with Zoot. He lived in Los Angeles throughout the hippy era and met Kate his wife and the love of his life there. The couple split in 1981 for four and a half years at the height of the Police’s stardom for standard rock ’n’ roll reasons but reconciled. They have three grown-up children.

After the Police’s first final gig in Melbourne in 1984 Summers played more jazz and pursued his interest in photography.

There have been many missions to various asteroids and comets by NASA and other space agencies. But one group of asteroids that still hasn’t been visited is the Trojans – until now. NASA’s Lucy spacecraft will be the first to travel to these asteroids which share an orbit with Jupiter. And now Lucy has arrived at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to begin preparations for its launch this fall NASA announced earlier this week.

“This spacecraft is so much more than a piece of hardware it’s a work of art and I’m incredibly proud of how the team came together to build this through a global pandemic” said Rich Lipe Lockheed Martin Lucy program manager. “To be here now starting to prepare for launch is a terrific feeling.”

Lucy has been designed and built by Lockheed Martin and is scheduled to be launched on Oct. 16 2021 with a 23-day launch window.

Last Friday Lucy was loaded onto a cargo plane at Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora Colorado. The spacecraft had previously been stored inside a converted shipping container at the Lockheed Martin facility in Littleton Colorado. The conversion turned the shipping container into a mini-cleanroom essential for keeping Lucy clean and free from contamination.

About 40 people from Lockheed Martin NASA and Southwest Research Institute were needed to load Lucy onto a C-17 transport aircraft. The flight ended at the Space Shuttle Landing Strip at Kennedy Space Center where the spacecraft was then transported to its final destination Astrotech Space Operations.

Lucy will now undergo preparations and testing ahead of its launch.

Lucy is the seventh of 13 NASA Discovery-class missions that Lockheed Martin has participated in. Lockheed Martin will also be building two NASA spacecraft to return to Venus at the end of the decade.

During its journey Lucy will visit one asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and seven asteroids in the Trojans. The first flyby in the main asteroid belt will be in 2025 the first Trojans flyby in 2027 and the last Trojans flyby will occur in 2033.

Lucy will carry updated versions of three heritage instruments:

L’Ralph NASA Goddard Space Flight Center – This camera is capable of taking images of the Trojan asteroids on the visible and infrared spectrums. Its images will help scientists determine what the Trojans’ surfaces are made of as they look for the presence of things like ice hydrated minerals and other organic materials.

L’LORRI (Long Range Reconnaissance Imager) Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory – Functioning like the Hubble Space Telescope this telescopic camera will take black and white images of the Trojans from afar and produce incredibly detailed high resolution visuals of things like craters on their surfaces — even though the asteroids are not illuminated by any light source. If you were standing on one end of a football field you’d be able to see a fly on the other end of the field with L’LORRI! Thanks to its ability to look across large distances L’LORRI will also help Lucy orient itself and navigate through space.

L’TES (Thermal Emission Spectrometer) Arizona State University – Think of this as the world’s most sophisticated thermometer. It will measure the infrared energy emitted by the asteroids as the sun warms them and detect unique spectral signatures of individual minerals and other surface properties.

It also builds on previous Lockheed Martin planetary missions such as Mars Odyssey OSIRIS-REx and InSight.

Lucy is named after the 3.2-million-year-old hominin skeleton dubbed “Lucy.” That fossil advanced our knowledge of human evolution and Lucy will try to uncover new knowledge about the origins of our Solar System and planets.

So why is this mission important?

The Trojan asteroids are considered to be “fossils” left over from the early formation of the Solar System. Since they are still relatively unchanged they can provide valuable clues about what the Solar System was like a few billion years ago and how it evolved. It is thought that they may contain carbon water and other volatile compounds necessary for life. They may also give us a glimpse into the physical environment that existed when the planets formed as well as the conditions that fostered their formation.

The Trojan asteroids share the same orbit as Jupiter. One group moves ahead of Jupiter in its orbit while the other trails behind the planet. These asteroids are trapped within gravity wells created by the gravitational pull of both the Sun and Jupiter.

Until now scientists have only been able to study these small primitive bodies with ground-based and Earth-orbiting telescopes. Lucy will provide the first-ever close-up looks at these worlds.

According to current scientific undersanding the Trojan asteroids were scattered during the formation of the outer Solar System about four billion years ago. They were eventually caught by Jupiter’s gravity and settled into the two groups on either side of the planet that we see today. They have remained there ever since.

The first confirmed Trojan asteroid was discovered by German astrophotographer Max Wolf on Feb. 22 1906. As more continued to be discovered they were named after heroes of the Trojan War in Greek mythology and thus referred to as Trojan asteroids.

There are estimated to be about one million Trojans larger than 0.6 miles (one km) in diameter.

While probes have now been sent to all of the planets and many dwarf planets moons asteroids and comets there are still many places in our Solar System yet to be explored. The Trojans are one such destination and in just a few years from now we will have our first close-up look at these primordial bodies.

The completion of the next-gen OPIR subsystems and payload CDR will allow Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace team to manufacture integrate and test the flight mission payload. Delivery to Lockheed Martin who is responsible for delivering the satellites for the geosynchronous orbit is scheduled for 2023.

In addition to developing a payload design for the Next-Gen GEO program Northrop Grumman was selected by the Space Force to design and develop two polar-orbiting Next-Gen OPIR space vehicles under a $2.37 billion contract from May 2020.

The first block of the new constellation will include five satellites three of which will be in geosynchronous orbit and two will be in polar orbit. Lockheed Martin will deliver the satellites for the geosynchronous orbit while Northrop Grumman will deliver polar orbit satellites.

“The Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace team brings deep mission expertise in missile warning and tracking to this program” said Scott Lee vice president and general manager payload and ground systems Northrop Grumman. “Together we’re delivering another generation of unblinking eyes in space as part of our nation’s strategic deterrence.”

As the successor to the space based infrared system (SBIRS) Next-Gen OPIR will provide an improved more resilient missile warning system to counter current and emerging threats.

The Next-Gen OPIR GEO satellites are being designed and built by Lockheed Martin. Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace are one of two teams selected by Lockheed Martin in 2018 to develop a competitive payload design for the program. Raytheon is the other competitor.

“Decades of mission experience with modern agile infrared sensor development are the hallmarks of the Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace team” said Deirdre Walsh vice president Strategic Operations Ball Aerospace. “This collaborative effort has enabled us to successfully execute the critical design review of the Next-Gen OPIR GEO Block 0 mission payload – a mission critical to our nation’s security.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvaWYtc3ItNzItc3VjY2VlZHMtd2FyLWFuZC1mbGlnaHQtd2lsbC1uZXZlci1iZS1zYW1lLTE5MTM5MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If the SR-72 Succeeds War and Flight Will Never Be the Same,"The SR-72 will fly twice as fast as the SR-71—so fast that at top speed the very air entering its engines will be moving as fast as an SR-71.

Here's What You Need To Remember: That’s what makes the SR-72 really amazing. If Lockheed Martin and its partners call pull it off flight will never be the same. Aerojet-Rocketdyne has a long distinguished pedigree in the propulsion field ranging from 21-foot-wide solid fuel boosters and nuclear rockets to the Saturn V and Space Shuttle main engines.

Like a bolt out of the blue Lockheed Martin’s renown Skunk Works publicly teased one of aviation’s great snark hunts—revealing plans for a successor to the SR-71 the legendary Mach-3 reconnaissance plane designed with slide rules and retired when the millennials were born.

That 59-year old aircraft originally developed as an uber-interceptor still holds the record for fastest sustained supersonic flight at 2100 miles per hour—much faster than a .50-caliber bullet.

But the new plane just announced the SR-72 will fly twice as fast—so fast that at top speed the very air entering its engines will be moving as fast as an SR-71. Keeping combustion and thrust going under such conditions has been likened to lighting a cigar in a hurricane. The SR-72’s planned ability to go from a standing start to Mach 6 and back again is a hat trick no one has been able to pull off.

Yet an SR-72 demonstrator reportedly first appeared in plain view in California in July 2017.

According to Aviation Week Skunk Works has developed a way to run turbojet engines at high temperatures and power levels high enough to push the SR-72 to Mach 2.5. The ramjet-scramjet second stage requires speeds above Mach 3 or 3.5 to operate a “thrust chasm” which Lockheed Martin says it’s solved … though it won’t say how.

Turbojet? Ramjet? Scramjet? A turbojet spins many blades to compress and heat incoming air before setting it on fire and riding the resulting plume of hot expanding gas. A ramjet moves so fast that the air entering the engine is already hot and compressed enough to ignite the fuel. A scramjet—short for “supersonic combustion ramjet”—is just that a ramjet where the incoming air is moving at supersonic speeds.

At hypersonic speeds there’s no additional sonic boom but the air piles up so fast along the aircraft’s leading edges that they reach blast-furnace temperatures.

The SR-71 heated up so much due to the friction of its flight that its body panels fit together loosely on the ground and expanded snugly in flight.

But the breathtaking potential of hypersonic flight at Mach 5 and above has driven research forward for more than 70 years in good times and bad from Nazi wonder weapons to the Right Stuff and the Pacific pivot. Even before any man-made machine had reached supersonic speeds the hypersonic domain enchanted some remarkable minds.

Das Flug aus die Silbervogel:

Eugene Saenger first tackled the concept of a multi-thousand-mile-per-hour aircraft in his 1933 doctoral thesis; breakthrough work on cooling rocket engines by re-circulating cryogenic fuel through their walls brought him to the attention of Hitler’s regime. Like Wernher von Braun Saenger was encouraged to apply his radical ideas to building the Reich’s might.

Von Braun’s V-2 ballistic missile rammed home the frightful speed and power of supersonic weapons; the citizens of London and Antwerp got no warning of the huge missiles which fell three times faster than the sound they made. Saenger and colleague Irene Bredt’s design the Silbervogel or “Silverbird” in English might have brought stealthy death to New York and Chicago from halfway around the world.

The Silverbird also known as the Antipodal Bomber combined so many crazy ideas in one slick package that it’s easy to understand its hold on imaginations so many years later and why the Reich Air Ministry passed on building a prototype. The Nazi space plane’s final design was a 91-foot-long plank-bellied lifting body sporting stubby wings a monster 100-ton-thrust rocket motor and the fuel and liquid oxygen tanks to feed it.

Mounted on a giant rocket sled traveling down a two-mile-long monorail the single pilot and his single (big) bomb would be hurled into the sky at nearly Mach 2 before the Silverbird’s own rocket took it 70 miles up at Mach 19.

Seem familiar? It’s because the system inspired a certain 1950s science-fiction movie.

As if the launch and boost phase weren’t enough this dieselpunk spaceplane’s flight phase the “skip-glide” technique became a strategic warfighter’s dream. Get an aerospace vehicle going high and fast enough then drop it back into the atmosphere just so and it will skip off the denser air like a tossed stone skipping off a quiet lake.

The skip then carries the vehicle back into space friction slowing the vehicle with every skip. Saenger and Bredt calculated that the Silverbird could achieve a range of over 14000 miles nearly halfway to the Antipodes by skip-gliding around the world from an initial boost in Germany.

Alas later calculations revealed that the Silverbird would more than likely have suffered the fate of the Space Shuttle Columbia sometime during the flight.

Despite its magnificent technical sweetness the Silverbird’s mission was a mix of strategic bombing and pure terror. A four-ton bomb can do a lot of damage and the psychological impact of a continental American city being bombed out of the blue would have been tremendous. Planned strategic targets included aluminum smelters and aircraft plants.

Goering’s air ministry dismissed the Saenger-Bredt concept and pursued other methods of attacking the United States. Joseph Stalin however took the concept seriously enough that after the war he ordered the NKVD to (unsuccessfuly) kidnap Saenger and Bredt from France.

Like many other aerospace rivalries hypersonic research took off in both Cold War superpowers from its start under Hitler.

The Right Stuff:

In the United States flight at Mach 5-plus was fitted into the ongoing national effort that took Maj. Chuck Yeager through the sound barrier.

By the mid 1950s the X-15 program had focused on designs materials and protocols for hypersonic flight and by the early 1960’s X-15 pilots sporting astronauts’ wings were routinely flying into space at Mach 6 from Edwards Air Force Base in California. As Tom Wolfe lyrically recounted in his classic work The Right Stuff the X-15’s winged piloted approach soon gave way to the rounded capsules of Mercury Gemini and Apollo.

The Air Force nearly achieved hypersonic flight half a century ago with the X-20 DynaSoar the great might-have-been link between the Silverbird the Space Shuttle and the SR-72. Designed to soar into space atop a Titan missile orbit like a space capsule and land like a fighter plane the X-20 fulfilled the Silverbird dream only to be killed off by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.

Space Shuttle engineers in the 1970s relied on X-20 research in designing their spaceship. Today the recently-retired Space Shuttle is perhaps the most familiar hypersonic vehicle in the world. The Space Shuttles soared into space at Mach 23 before leaving the atmosphere—and flew “like bricks with wings“ at hypersonic speeds during their fiery descents.

The tremendous heat experienced by the Shuttle during re-entry gives us a glimpse of the challenges facing the SR-72—the slightest crack in the surface can let in blowtorch heat and wind. And could destroy the vehicle and crew.

All successful hypersonic vehicles to date have been hurled forward by rocket power from the WAC Corporal in 1949 to the X-51 Waverider this spring. Most recent U.S. hypersonic research has been focused on developing prompt long-range strike weapons in the form of air sea and sub-launched payloads boosted up to cruise speed by rocket power.

Indeed SpaceX’s Falcon 1 rocket was funded in part to create a booster for hypersonic payloads.

And that’s what makes the SR-72 really amazing. If Lockheed Martin and its partners call pull it off flight will never be the same. Aerojet-Rocketdyne has a long distinguished pedigree in the propulsion field ranging from 21-foot-wide solid fuel boosters and nuclear rockets to the Saturn V and Space Shuttle main engines.

An aircraft that can take off and land on standard runways fly faster than a speeding bullet—and do so affordably—would quickly find its technology spreading throughout the aviation industry. The V-22 Osprey shrunk Iraq to the size of Rhode Island. The SR-72 and its kin could shrink the Indo-Pacific to the size of California.

AIR-6500 is a joint “system-of-systems” that will completely revolutionize the way the Australian Defence Force operates. It synchronizes air and missile defense operations thus forming the core architecture of the ADF’s future Integrated Missile and Air Defence (IAMD) capability.

The AIR 6500/1 will improve situational awareness and enhance the speed of decision-making as it connects disparate ADF systems and platforms across all domains into a cohesive 21st-century operational environment.

JBAMS will also connect assets across air land sea cyber and space for improved defense against primary threats to national security.

It will enable ADF to maintain high interoperability levels with coalition partners. Australian Defence Minister Peter Dutton and Minister of Defence Industry Melissa Price made the announcement together on August 5 and marked the official inauguration of the second phase of the Competitive Evaluation Process (CEPS2) in order to choose the company which will oversee design development and delivery of the JBAMS.

“Defence found the down-selected companies demonstrated the best understanding of its capability requirements as well as a strong commitment to developing Australian industry capability” Price said in a statement.

“I look forward to seeing the advanced technical solutions and prototypes that will be developed as these companies refine their final offering for the Joint Air Battle Management System” she added.

These two successful companies as well as Boeing Defence Australia and Raytheon Australia were shortlisted at a preliminary stage of the CEPS program in 2016. According to the two ministers Boeing and Raytheon are still going to be involved in the development of the JBAMs and will help in boosting the Australian Defence Force’s future.

Another program Air 6502 Phase 1 (Medium Range Ground-Based Air Defence Capability) is reported to provide command-and-control systems radars and missile launchers.

According to reports both of these projects are going to be closely integrated with the Australian Army’s Land 19 Phase 7B (Short Range Ground Based Air Defence) program. Raytheon Australia had been selected to be the prime contractor for this in March 2019.

“Today’s announcement marks the next step of Air 6500/1 to work in partnership with the Australian Defence Force and industry partners to support the Royal Australian Air Force’s vision to transform into a next-generation force through delivering a sovereign highly-advanced JABMS system to protect Australia’s security” said Joe North chief executive Lockheed Martin (Australia and New Zealand).

“We look forward to collaborating with Australian industry and the RAAF to progress the solution as part of CEPS2”.

Christine Zeitz Asia Pacific managing director for Northrop Grumman also underlined the significance of growing an Australian Industrial Capability (AIC) in the development of a sovereign IAMD system.

“We will employ a highly collaborative ‘JABMS Enterprise’ approach that will bring together capabilities developed by Australia’s defense industry including active and passive sensors intelligent agents data fusion and processing through a solution architecture that is flexible open modular secure and adaptable by design” Zeitz said.

The selected strategic partner for the JBAMS system will be announced by the Australian government in late 2023.

Turkey originally intended to deploy the Lockheed Martin F-35B from the LHD but the Lightning II is no longer option due to a chill in relations between Ankara and Washington (following Turkey’s procurement of S-400 air defence systems from Russia).

The MIUS will reportedly offer a payload of 1500 kg and flight endurance of five hours. Baykar Makina is designing the MIUS to reach a top speed of Mach 0.64.[3] Turkey intends to equip the MIUS with air-to-air missiles (AAM) air-to-surface munitions and reportedly air-launched cruise missiles (ALCM). According to Selçuk Bayraktar Baykar Makina’s CTO the MIUS will also draw on artificial intelligence (AI) and other automation technologies so that MIUS UCAVs can operate autonomously.[4] The MIUS may use the Motor Sich AI-25 turbofan engine.[5]

The current target date for the MIUS’ maiden test flight is reportedly in 2023.[6] In its concept illustrations of the MIUS Baykar Makina also revealed the Bayraktar TB-3 which will be an enlarged variant of the TB-2 medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Though Turkey is studying the idea of developing a manned fixed-wing carrier-borne fighter (potentially based on the Hürjet trainer) its initial vision for the LHD’s aviation wing centers on deploying drones.[7]

The This Morning star called their relationship a 'work in progress' earlier this year and insisted they hadn't discussed divorce.

Late last year the host admitted he is 'not fixed in any way' and he still has to 'come to terms' with his life after publicly coming out as gay in February.

Talking about his family on BBC Radio 5 Live the Dancing On Ice star said: 'We love each other massively. We are a loving family that hasn't changed... it's us four but different.

Absent: Holly who was invited to the wedding and couldn't make it took to Instagram on Friday to post a fresh faced selfie while enjoying her time away

'We are a work in progress. I've been very honest about all of this and there's no question we have to pick our way through this daily as a family.

'And that's what we are doing. We are making our way through very unusual and unexpected waters.'

The media personality also explained how a legal end to their marriage has not been brought up telling Chris Evans on his How To Wow podcast: 'I'm still married to Steph. There is a great deal of talk of divorce - we have not discussed that at all.'

It is the bleeding but also impulsive Marco Bezeecchi who has been the Moto2 leader since Friday in Styria. A position that he owes to his good FP1 contested in the dry since FP2 was disrupted by the rain. Complicated conditions which did not really bother championship leader Remy Gardner first in the last session but third overall.

The Moto2 riders indeed competed in the FP2 of the Styrian Grand Prix on a slightly oily track following a downpour which notably disrupted the MotoGP. He is the leader of the general classification Remy Gardnerr (Red Bull KTM Ajo) who was the fastest of the afternoon without beating the time achieved this morning by Marco Bezzecchi (SKY Racing Team VR46). Indeed with his lap in 1'29.115 the Italian is at the top of the combined ranking. He is followed by Augusto Fernandez (Elf Marc VDS Racing Team) and therefore Remy Gardner third.

The smaller company was interested in supporting Ms. Felix’s career and said it would not penalize her for losing races or choosing to have more children. (Nike changed its policy for pregnant athletes after the criticism by Ms. Felix whose contract with the company ended in 2017.) She said that she liked that Athleta was led by women and that it appreciated that she was a mother as well as an athlete.

“It’s a very pressured situation to be sponsored traditionally in track and field — it’s about numbers if you don’t perform reductions and all of these things” Ms. Felix who will compete in the Tokyo Games said in an interview. With Athleta she added “I felt like I had more value as a person and that was something I hadn’t experienced before.”

A growing number of top women athletes including Simone Biles and former Olympians have been choosing to strike new types of deals with smaller activewear brands instead of traditional sponsors like Nike. Several young female runners say that smaller brands are willing to work with them in different ways like bringing them on as employees giving them equity or involving them in new products and that they are paying more attention to their personal stories and Instagram accounts than their race performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The then-students at Saint Francis High School in Mountain View were just 14 when they took a photo during a sleepover in 2017 of them wearing the treatment in solidarity with a friend suffering from severe acne their lawsuit said.

The treatment bought by one of the boy’s moms was light green when applied and turned dark green once dry.

Their “innocent” selfie then went viral three years later when it was found and widely shared during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests following the 2020 murder of George Floyd.

A Santa Clara County jury agreed this week that the school breached an oral contract and did not give them due process before expelling them in 2020 according to the Los Angeles Times.

The students identified only as A.H. and H.H. in the lawsuit were awarded $500000 each and will have their $70000 tuition reimbursed.

“This case is significant not only for our clients but for its groundbreaking effect on all private high schools in California which are now legally required to provide fair procedure to students before punishing or expelling them” said Krista Baughman one of the attorneys for the students.

One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

Michael Jordan celebrated the opening of a new health clinic in his hometown of Wilmington North Carolina and PEOPLE has an exclusive photo of the basketball legend at the event.

Jordan 61 and Novant Health teamed up to open a third clinic the Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic on Greenfield St. in Wilmington to bring ""much-needed comprehensive primary care services"" according to a release.

The clinic will include medical opportunities for ""individuals who are uninsured or underinsured"" a cause close to the former NBA star's heart.

""Everyone is worthy of access to quality health care no matter where you live or if you have insurance"" Jordan said in a release adding that he is ""truly inspired by the many powerful stories of people who are now thriving thanks to the support of our Charlotte medical clinics.""

Jordan whose $10 million donation to Novant Health allowed for two additional Jordan Family Medicals Clinics to be built in Charlotte added ""I am confident Novant Health's new clinic will positively impact individuals and families throughout Wilmington"" and said he's ""profoundly grateful to help make this day happen for my hometown.""



In PEOPLE's exclusive photo the former NBA star was seen speaking with Dr. Michael Hoben inside the lobby of the clinic during the opening.

According to the release many of the patients visiting Jordan's clinics have ""never had a primary care provider before"" and have ""praised the clinic teams for helping restore health and a sense of hope"" to families in North Carolina where Jordan currently resides.

In a statement Ernie Bovio president of the Novant Health Coastal Region and Novant Health New Hanover Regional Medical Center said “Each Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic has been thoughtfully planned for the best location within the community.

Senior vice president of Novant Health Ann Caulkins said “We are tremendously grateful to Michael Jordan for his philanthropic support of our efforts to close health equity gaps. The Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Medicine Clinics in Charlotte provided more than 9000 patient visits last year and are delivering profound benefits in the community. We’re excited to expand this model in Wilmington where the clinic team will provide life-changing care.”

Jordan was born in Brooklyn New York but his family relocated to Wilmington when he was a toddler. Supporting his North Carolina hometown has always been a priority for the NBA great who owns a stake in Charlotte's NBA team the Hornets.

In August 2023 Jordan transitioned out of his majority stakeholder position to a minor ownership role after selling his stake to an ownership group led by Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin.

In a heartfelt message to Hornets fans at the time Jordan described the opportunity to own an NBA franchise in his home state as ""a dream come true.""



Jordan said he'll ""never forget the excitement"" in the city when the Hornets name returned to ""its rightful home in Charlotte"" in 2013 in his open letter to Charlotte. (The Hornets left Charlotte in 2002 and were replaced by the Bobcats. Under Jordan's leadership the team reclaimed the Hornets name in 2013 SI reported.)

Jordan looked back on the Hornets' return to Charlotte as a ""uniting"" moment for the city's Bobcats and Hornets fanbases. ""Our fans told us how important this was and the amazing level of support and enthusiasm proved their point"" he wrote.

The international money laundering ring operated by exploiting the flight crew’s “trusted positions” and airport security privileges according to a complaint filed by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

US officials said the investigation had “exposed critical vulnerabilities in the airline security industry” and shone a light on the methods employed by drug traffickers.

Charlie Hernandez 42 Sarah Valerio Pujols 42 Emmanuel Torres 34 and Jarol Fabio 35 were arrested by agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New York on Tuesday.

They are accused of taking a cut of each shipment they smuggled through airport security checkpoints and onto flights bound for the Dominican Republic.

Prosecutors said the flight attendants who worked on different international airlines that flew between the two destinations smuggled approximately $8m in cash from the sale of drugs such as fentanyl over several years.

Code word ‘lotions’

They allegedly used the code word “lotions” to mean drug proceeds and referred to the smuggling ring’s drug-dealing clients as “los tigres”.

The flight crew all had a special clearance with the US Transport Security Administration which permitted them to go through a designated security lane at John F Kennedy International Airport with less scrutiny than normal passengers.

All four flight attendants have been charged with one count each relating to unlicensed money transmission which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

They have also been charged with one count each of violating airport security requirements which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

Mr Hernandez of West New York in New Jersey and Ms Pujols from the Bronx in New York were additionally charged with a conspiracy count which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

Ms Pujols faces a further charge relating to bulk cash smuggling which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

Ivan J Arvelo the HSI special agent overseeing the case said: “This investigation has exposed critical vulnerabilities in the airline security industry and has illuminated methods that narcotics traffickers are utilising.”"

An affiliate of Twin Bridges Hospitality a locally based asset management firm that’s quickly building a portfolio of Marriott-branded properties across the country last month took over ownership and operation of a third hotel built by Newport Beach’s R.D. Olson Development.



The just-opened 110-room AC Hotel by Marriott Wailea Maui was bought by Dauntless Capital Partners which is a private equity affiliate of Twin Bridges for what hotel sources indicate was $83.6 million.



The deal is the third transaction in recent months between the upstart investment group and R.D. Olson which has been the most active developer of Marriott-branded hotels in the Western U.S. over the past decade.



It brings the new group’s investments in hotels built by R.D. Olson to nearly $290 million.



Dauntless earlier this year bought the 200-room Residence Inn by Marriott Maui Wailea another Olson property in Hawaii next to the AC Hotel and the 144-room Residence Inn Pasadena which opened in 2016.



The trio of deals as well as other acquisitions elsewhere around the U.S. place Dauntless among the most active hotel investors in the country this year.



“We are optimistic about the recovery of the hospitality industry” Twin Bridges Senior Vice President of Asset Management Adam Beer said about the company’s investment push after one of the more turbulent years in history for the hotel sectors. “We’ve seen a surge in activity in core leisure market this summer due to pent-up demand for travel and lack of international travel.”



“This summer has been the strongest summers in the history of several of our hotels exceeding 2019 levels which is generally the highwater mark for the industry” Beer said.



The three just-added R.D. Olson properties bring the new company’s portfolio up to over 1500 rooms. It also has properties in Atlanta Colorado and Washington D.C.



The group also has a minority stake in the Newport Beach Marriott in Newport Center. That property’s primary owners are locally based Eagle Four Partners and Lyon Living Development Co.; Twin Bridges officials said they are advising that group on the redesign and renovation of the property’s public spaces and guestrooms.



“Twin Bridges has ramped extensively this year” Beer said. “We started the year with one hotel on our platform added eight additional hotels to date anticipate adding several more before the end of the year and plan to continue to grow for years to come.”

Record-Makers



The Business Journal in April was first to report on R.D. Olson’s sale of Wailea Residence Inn a reported $148.5 million deal for the 5-year-old property. At $740000 a room the deal marked the highest price per key for any select service hotel in the country.



That record pricing was eclipsed by the recent purchase of the new AC Hotel which sold for nearly $760000 a key according to sources.



The Old Town Pasadena property a few blocks north of Colorado Boulevard sold for about $400000 a key according to property records.



CBRE Group’s Bob Webster represented R.D. Olson in the trio of sales.

Family Ties



The Twin Bridges name is a nod to Virginia’s Twin Bridges Motor Hotel the first hotel operated by what would become Marriott International. It opened in the late 1950s.



Twin Bridges’ executive team has several ties to Bob Olson’s local development company as well as the founding family of $45 billion-valued Marriott International (Nasdaq: MAR).



Chris Harrison the company’s co-founder and managing partner served as the first general manager of the 15-story Marriott Irvine Spectrum which opened near the end of 2017. It ranks No. 35 on this week list of hotel meeting rooms in Orange County (see list page 20).



Harrison a Ladera Ranch resident has also held a variety of roles at Marriott International prior to starting Twin Bridges and Dauntless.



He’s the great-grandson of the hospitality giant’s founder J.W. Marriott Sr. His brother-in-law Craig Ballard is also a co-founder of Twin Bridges and Dauntless. Regulatory filings indicate the duo has a two-thirds stake in both entities.



The Marriott family still counts a sizeable stake and multiple members on the board of the Bethesda Md.-based hotel giant filings indicate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2Rlc3RpbmF0aW9ucy8yMDIxLzA4LzA3L2NhbmFkYS1ib3JkZXItcmVvcGVuaW5nLXRyYXZlbC1sYWJvci1zaG9ydGFnZS1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4vNTQ4OTUzNjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US-Canada border: Businesses rush to hire ahead of Monday's reopening,"When Anna Pierce first heard the Canadian border would be reopening to fully vaccinated U.S. travelers she was nearly brought to happy tears.

The vice president and general manager of Niagara Helicopters an Ontario-based company that offers helicopter tours described operations amid the COVID-19 pandemic as a “terrible roller coaster” with travel restrictions for both domestic and international travelers curbing business dramatically.

""On a typical day (before the pandemic) we would do upwards of 80 flights with six passengers in each flight"" she said. ""It went down to as low as four flights a day last summer.""

Pierce hopes Monday's border reopening date will allow Niagara Helicopters to salvage reservations in September and October a popular time because the company can offer an aerial view of Niagara Falls' changing leaves but the company is lacking one key component: staffing.

The company has 18 employees less than half of what it normally has this time of year. Pierce said the company needs at least 24 but employees are so in-demand that she gets a handful of no-shows every time she sets up interviews.

“People are just being snapped up left right and center. I’ve never seen anything like that” Pierce said. “We’re not expecting business to surge to 2019 levels but we’re hoping for the best (when travel restrictions ease) and we hope we have enough employees to service them.”

Canadian businesses near the border have spent weeks preparing for Monday when Canada will start allowing fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents to cross the border. But the expected uptick in travel comes as businesses across North America face staffing shortages and supply chain issues.

That could mean travelers to Canada will have a harder time getting certain reservations or face longer wait times according to some business owners.

How busy will Canada businesses be?

Monday’s easing of travel restrictions is expected to boost traffic to Canada but businesses and local leaders say it will take time before tourism rates are comparable to 2019 levels.

Denis Vinette vice president of the Canada Border Services Agency’s travelers branch told USA TODAY the agency predicts a 10% to 25% increase in traffic toward Canada on Aug. 9 – a significant increase but still just about 20% of historical volumes.

But even a small boost is good news for cities like Toronto where Americans make up the majority of the nearly 30 million annual tourists it gets in a typical year. A 2020 report from Destination Toronto the marketing organization for Toronto's tourism industry found the city lost about $8.4 billion in economic activity after one year of the pandemic.

""It’s been devastating"" said Toronto Mayor John Tory. ""If you look at a lot of the major tourist destinations downtown … they’ve been vacant.""

Niagara Falls Ontario Mayor Jim Diodati said he doesn’t expect a “massive rush” come Monday especially knowing travelers trying to cross the land border will face longer wait times thanks to enhanced public health measures such as a requirement to show proof of vaccination.

“I think the first to come across won’t be your typical tourists” Diodati said adding that he expects to see more Americans crossing to visit family or property.

He doesn’t anticipate international travel to pick up until next year a long wait for a city that gets roughly half its tourism revenue from American visitors.

“The American tourists matter” Diodati said. “(Local businesses) are already planning for next (travel) season.”

Even if travel’s resurgence will take time businesses have already started to see an uptick in demand.

Ann Marie Nitso owner of the Old Stone Inn Boutique Hotel in Niagara Falls said the hotel doubled its bookings shortly after the Canadian government announced the border reopening date. She estimates about 65% of the hotel’s business comes from American visitors.

“There’s been a lot of pent-up demand” Nitso said. “I've been receiving reservations for the Christmas period. So people are definitely more confident now that the borders have reopened.”

Canada is easing travel restrictions for vaccinated Americans: Here are 10 things to know before a trip

Don Cleary president of Marriott Hotels of Canada said he has started to see “positive momentum” that he expects will continue through the remainder of the summer.

“With the announcement of the border reopening we saw a much more significant increase (in international bookings)” Cleary said. “We are starting to see a future mix closer to 2019 levels … (and) we are seeing booking windows slowly lengthen into August September and October.”

Staffing shortages and supply chain issues

Dan Lehmann owner of the Duck Bay Lodge near the Lake of the Woods said his limited staff is rushing to get the fishing resort ready for business after sitting empty two years.

“The tough part is ... the fact that the supply chain is really interrupted” he said. “Something as simple as getting some 2-inch nails at the hardware store it’s not available. ... All the different little parts we use with boats and motors and running the lodge aren’t necessarily available like they used to be.”

Crossing the border:Canada Border Services Agency worker strike ends promising a smoother flow to border traffic

Staffing is also a major issues for businesses. Nitso of the Old Stone Inn said her hotel has had to outsource housekeeping jobs for the first time due to a lack of workers.

“It’s something we never thought we’d have to do” she said.

Hanif Harji CEO of Scale Hospitality which owns a number of restaurants in Toronto said the company is already struggling to keep up with demand with its current staff size. Certain restaurants have had to close for lunches or one full day each week to make sure employees get time off.

“All (the lifting of restrictions) is going to do is add to the demand but demand is outpacing supply today” Harji said. “The tourism business is going to be great but it’s also going to be very challenging for people to find reservations. Restaurants are being booked up two three four weeks in advance right now.”

Harji said he’s trying to increase staffing levels 30% to meet current demand levels.

“Even though the border may be opening Aug. 9 I think it’s going to take a couple of weeks to staffed up and ready to manage that kind of volume” Harji said. But “in the long term I think (the border reopening) is going to be great for business.”

The effects are seen in Quebec as well where Michelle Doré runs three hotels: Hôtel Champlain Hôtel Jardin SteAnne and Auberge Place d’Armes. She estimated the business is short-staffed by about 20% after many of her former staff members left the hospitality industry.

“We will have the pleasure of having (American tourists) but it’ll be ... challenging to give the best service that we give” she said. “Maybe we’ll ask them when they come can you be just a little patient or give us a little break? … The service will be there but maybe a little bit longer.”

J P Menon General Manager Courtyard by Marriott Madurai has just moved to the temple town after a successful stint in the textile city – Coimbatore. In his current role Menon is also supporting the opening of the Courtyard by Marriott Trichy by the same ownership. Menon spoke to ETHospitality World about these markets and their dynamics and his current hotel at Courtyard by Marriott Madurai.“Coimbatore the second largest city in Tamil Nadu has always been progressive. Education Health and Manufacturing like cotton spinning mills automobile allied industries have driven the economy of this place. Given this positioning and running a select serve international hotel in this city with many brands and full-service hotels to compete with was certainly challenging to say the least. While it is a city with deep pockets the people are a little conservative when it comes to dining out. Given these challenges Fairfield Inn by Marriott Coimbatore has done fairly well” states Menon“Madurai on the other hand is a slightly easier market as there are not many branded hotels in this city. It is in fact the gateway to the south of Tamil Nadu. Temples arts and culture are a big draw for the leisure segment while the corporate segment is dominated by health and industries. Madurai also serves as the base for smaller places in Tamil Nadu like Sivakasi Rajapalayam Rameshwaram  the popular hill station - Kodaikanal which are all less than 200km away this also brings in traction to the business” adds Menon.“Trichy is a hub for international travelers who wish to visit south Tamil Nadu bypassing Chennai . Trichy has the maximum number of international flights coming into any tier two city in Tamil Nadu. This will be a key when our hotel opens in a few months there since that is another market bereft of any good branded hotels” says Menon.Speaking of Courtyard Madurai  his current baby Menon says “this is a beautiful property with over 30000 sq ft of banqueting space. This is perhaps the only hotel in this part to have such a big banqueting and this is a salient point that makes us stand out. Thanks to such big banqueting we cater to large conventions and destination weddings for people who would like to get married in the temple city.”“So far as the food goes we have decided to keep it extensively local as Madurai is famous for its delicacies. This has been very well received by the guests” adds Menon.About the pandemic situation Menon says “the occupancy soared post the first wave and the hotel was doing close to 65 percent occupancy. With the opening up after wave two things are slowly looking up July looked positive with close to 50 percent occupancy at a healthy average room rate.” He ends by saying that during these periods they have seen many repeat guests from cities at a driving distance who stayed with them on business earlier and decided to bring the family for a break since traveling elsewhere was not a possibility.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvd2l0aC1hdC1sZWFzdC0xMi1tZWdhLXByb2plY3RzLWhpbHRvbi1leWVzLXRoZS1iaWctYm94LWluLWluZGlhLTEyMTA4MDYwMTgwMF8xLmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbXBhbmllcy93aXRoLWF0LWxlYXN0LTEyLW1lZ2EtcHJvamVjdHMtaGlsdG9uLWV5ZXMtdGhlLWJpZy1ib3gtaW4taW5kaWEtMTIxMDgwNjAxODAwXzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With at least 12 mega-projects Hilton eyes the big box in India,Hilton Worldwide Hot­els the storied international hospitality chain that was founded over a century ago is on the lookout to set up a “big-box” hotel to augment and bolster its presence here its leadership in India said.Navjit Ahluwalia who is country head of Hilton India runs 21 hotels with around 3500 keys and has hotel brands such as the Hilton Hilton Garden Inn Doubletree and Conrad admits that the Hilton journey in India had been slow but it is on track to now focus on setting up a flagship hotel either in Mumbai or in New Delhi.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

If you're not ready to turn the page on summer just yet there are still a few weeks left to settle in with a good book to open your mind and broaden your horizons.

Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. has published its annual reading list of more than 100 titles collected from politicos business magnates and big names in corporate America.

Insider has combed through the list and identified five titles from Wall Street and business power players that you might want to dive into.

From Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman's taste for narrative nonfiction to United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby's love of literature about Winston Churchill we bet that you won't want to put this summer reading advice back on the shelf anytime soon.

James Gorman CEO of Morgan Stanley

His recommendation: ""Symphony for the City of the Dead: Dmitri Shostakovich and the Siege of Leningrad"" by M.T. Anderson

Synopsis: The nonfiction book takes place in 1941 during World War II. ""Trapped between the Nazi invading force and the Soviet government itself was composer Dmitri Shostakovich writing a symphony to rouse rally eulogize and commemorate his fellow citizens: the Leningrad symphony. This is the true story of a city under siege the triumph of bravery and defiance in the face of terrifying odds"" publisher Penguin Random House says.

Why Gorman loves this book: Wall Street's highest-paid CEO told McKinsey that the narrative nonfiction title ""captures the journey of a composer writing a symphony amidst the siege of Leningrad. Anderson tells a powerful story through the eyes of a musician of Russian resilience and the ability to withstand hardship.""

""In a time where so many have been suffering it is an impactful reminder to lean into the things that keep us mentally strong"" Gorman added.

Shamina Singh EVP for Sustainability and President Center for Inclusive Growth at Mastercard

Her recommendation: ""Travels with Charley: In Search of America"" by John Steinbeck

Synopsis: Steinbeck's last full-length novel ""is a journey in both a physical and a spiritual sense"" the National Steinbeck Center says. It takes readers on his 1960 cross-country road trip where he gets a taste of the ethos of Americana in the hopes of making up for the fact that he felt he wasn't truly in touch with the American way of life that he explored in his writing.

Why Singh suggested this book: ""I enjoyed the spontaneity and serendipity of traveling around the country in my early career and want to experience that again with Steinbeck"" she said.

Gretchen Howard COO of Robinhood Markets

Her recommendation: ""Two Sides of Glory: The 1986 Boston Red Sox in Their Own Words"" by Erik Sherman







Synopsis: Team members from the 1986 Boston Red Sox open up about their victory over the California Angels followed by their devastating losses to the New York Mets in Game Six followed by losing the entire series.

""Bill Bucker whose name became synonymous with a muffed grounder speaks openly about the cruel aftermath. Pitcher Bruce Hurst broke down three times while being interviewed"" says the University of Nebraska Press which published the book. ""In each player's retelling there is the excitement of history never told and old mysteries answered.""

Why Howard wants to read this book: ""I'm excited to read this book so I can discuss it with my son who knows more about baseball than anyone I've ever met.""

Scott Kirby CEO of United Airlines

His recommendation: ""The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill Family and Defiance During the Blitz"" by Erik Larson

Synopsis: This book explores the larger-than-life personality of British prime minister Winston Churchill who led the United Kingdom through World War II.

""Drawing on a wealth of untapped sources including recently declassified files intelligence reports and personal diaries only now available"" Larson brings to light various members of Churchill's family and how he pulled the country through ""London's darkest year"" the author's website says.

Why Kirby loves this book: ""Winston Churchill is one of my heroes and I've read hundreds of books on World War II"" Kirby told McKinsey. ""So to find a book that had new insights into who Churchill really was as a human being was a great find to start my summer.""

Jessica Herrera-Flanigan VP for Public Policy & Philanthropy Americas at Twitter

Her recommendation: ""The Ethical Algorithm: The Science of Socially Aware Algorithm Design"" by Michael Kearns and Aaron Roth

Synopsis: Much has been said about social media algorithms in recent years but this book ""presents cutting-edge research in the science of socially aware algorithm design"" drawing on case studies from business law and medicine to help make sense of it all says publisher Oxford University Press.

Why Herrera-Flanigan loves this book: It is ""one of several books on algorithms data and democracy on my reading list this summer to help me get smarter on the topic"" she said. ""I'm finding it to be a great primer into AI and ethics.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vcmFrdXRlbi1lYXJuLTUtNXgtaW4tc3RvcmUtYXQtc3RhcGxlcy13YWxtYXJ0LWJlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZC1vbGQtbmF2eS13aXRoLWxpbmtlZC1tYXN0ZXJjYXJkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(EXPIRED) Rakuten: Earn 5%/5x In-Store At Staples Walmart Bed Bath & Beyond & Old Navy With Linked Mastercard,"Sorry this deal is no longer available.

Rakuten has some interesting card-linked offers right now as they’re offering 5% (or 5x Membership Rewards) for purchases in-store at Staples Walmart Bed Bath & Beyond and Old Navy when paying with a Mastercard.

The Deal

Earn 5%/5x from Rakuten when paying with a linked Mastercard for in-store purchases at the following retailers: Walmart Staples Old Navy Bed Bath & Beyond

for in-store purchases at the following retailers: Direct link to offer.

Key Terms

Expires August 22 2021.

Offer valid at participating US stores only.

Purchases are subject to applicable store policies.

In-Store Cash Back offers are not valid for online orders.

To earn In-Store Cash Back you must link the In-Store Cash Back offer to your qualified Mastercard credit or debit card (if applicable) connected to your Rakuten account and pay with the linked card by 8/22/21 at 8:59pm PT.

Debit card purchases must be processed as signature i.e. credit transactions in order to be eligible for Cash Back.

In-Store Cash Back offers are valid for 1 transaction and must be relinked for each following transaction in order to earn Cash Back.

Only US-issued payment cards are eligible to earn Cash Back.

Offer not valid for gift card purchases.

Quick Thoughts

Earning 5% cashback or 5x Membership Rewards for in-store purchases at Staples Walmart Bed Bath & Beyond and Old Navy is a decent reward.

The terms exclude gift card purchases although I’m not sure whether Rakuten will be enforcing those terms or not. Sometimes they do sometimes they don’t so be aware that there’s some potential for clawbacks if you decide to take advantage of these offers by buying gift cards in-store. All four of these retailers have third party gift card racks so it’s certainly tempting.

Note that the Staples offer has a couple of additional terms – there’s a limit of one redemption and there’s a limit of $50 for that redemption. That means you’ll max out the Staples offer when spending $1000. The Mastercard requirement means it won’t stack with 5x on a Chase Ink Plus or Ink Cash card though.

The fact that there’s a specific limit for Staples but not the other three retailers suggests that you can earn 5%/5x at Walmart Old Navy and Bed Bath & Beyond more than once per retailer. After redeeming in-store offers at any given retailer though you have to re-link the offer to your card before using it again.

BPWCCUL’s members have now joined the ranks of international debit card holders to benefit from the experience of “more” as the new card boasts a number of new features ranging from enhanced security to more convenience.

The BPWCCUL Mastercard Debit Card is more secure with Chip & Pin technology to provide members with more protection against fraud with the added security

of a Personal Identification Number (PIN) more widely accepted under the global Mastercard brand which now gives members the ability to perform online and in-person transactions when they travel and is more convenient with Tap & Go contactless capabilities.

“These are milestone accomplishments for the local credit union movement and we are proud to be able to keep abreast of the technology advancements to continue to enrich the lives of our members” Sadie Austin Manager – Card and E-Services said.

BPWCCUL urges it members to activate PIN and sign the back of their new card as soon as it is received in the mail.

The first step is to call their Contact Centre at 622-9000 press 4 for Card Queries and listen and follow the instructions to successfully complete the process.

“It is very important that members play their part in keeping their new card and PIN safe so that it is protected against lost theft and fraud” Austin added.

She offered a few tips where members are advised to:

• Choose a PIN that is not easy to guess e.g. they should not use their birthday anniversary or phone number.

• Commit their PIN to memory and never write it down

• Review their transactions often with Co-Optima Online Banking or the Co-Optima Mobile app and report any unfamiliar transactions to the Credit Union within

30 days.

Members are encouraged to use their cards to make everyday purchases at points-of-sale be it to purchase their groceries get gas or when dining out to avoid fees and long lines.

As has been customary members will continue to be able to access funds saved on both their Primary Shares and Call Deposit accounts as long as the point-of-sale terminal has both options displayed.

If not the funds for the transaction will be taken from the Call Deposit account by default.

Members can perform a quick transfer between their credit union accounts via the Co-Optima Mobile app to get themselves sorted accordingly.

Members should note that transactions at ATMs other than Co-Optima ATMs will attract a higher fee than they did before so they should opt to use the free options

which are the credit union’s own Co-Optima ATMs conveniently located across the island or at points-of-sale wherever they see the Mastercard symbol.

For more information members may visit the Credit Union’s website at www.publicworkers.bb/mastercard.html or call their Contact Centre at 622- 9000. (PR)"

A spin-off is when a business unit of an existing public company is separated and becomes its own public company. For example PayPal Holdings used to be a part of eBay until it was spun off in 2015. Spin-offs can be an interesting place to look for investment ideas because unlike IPOs they don't tend to attract a lot of attention or excitement.

Last year IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC -2.27%) spun off its online dating app Match Group which went on to perform well in its first year as a public company. Last month IAC gave investors another spin-off to chew on with video publishing platform Vimeo (VMEO 0.51%).

Given the success of Match Group should investors pay attention to Vimeo?

What exactly is Vimeo?

Many people are familiar with Vimeo as a sort of little brother to Alphabet's YouTube. This was true five years ago but Vimeo pivoted its business model in 2017 from serving as a viewing platform to operating as a software company helping businesses and creators edit and publish high-quality ad-free videos.

Vimeo still operates its viewing platform which counts over 200 million users but it also allows creators to upload edit and publish videos that push to other websites including TikTok YouTube and Twitter. Vimeo's value proposition is two-fold. First it makes the process of editing and publishing videos online easy by providing tools that anyone can use. For example Vimeo recently acquired a company that harnesses artificial intelligence to help users create quality product videos in just a few clicks. Second Vimeo provides its tools and platform at a very low cost compared to other available options. The combination of cheap and easy-to-use is very powerful.

Vimeo also serves larger enterprises with features including live streaming video on demand subscription management viewer analytics and developer APIs that allow endless customization. During the COVID-19 pandemic Vimeo added many enterprise customers to enable ""town halls"" for communications between employees within organizations.

Vimeo has a compelling suite of products and has benefited from the increased need for powerful video solutions in recent years. The company appears to be in the right space at the right time.

Why did IAC spin off Vimeo?

If Vimeo is so promising then why did IAC decide to spin the company off? Well buying businesses building them up and spinning them off is a game IAC tends to play. IAC was founded by legendary media investor Barry Diller and has a storied track record of running this playbook. IAC has been the force behind many well-known media companies including Expedia Match Group and Angi formerly Angie's list to name a few examples.

This is exactly what IAC has done with Vimeo. IAC acquired Vimeo in 2006 as part of a package deal with a few other internet properties. In 2017 Anjali Sud was promoted as CEO to take the company in a new direction. Sud led the company on its journey from serving as a media viewing platform to selling its software and publishing solutions to creators and enterprises over the past four years.

Under IAC's stewardship Vimeo has bolstered its offering by acquiring several companies including Livestream (for its live stream capabilities) VHX (for its video distribution platforms) and Magistro (for its video editing capabilities).

The combination of putting new management in place funding acquisitions and providing the company the room to grow has resulted in a spin-off worth over $8 billion. This has been a home run investment for IAC and has initiated a new chapter for Vimeo to pursue its own destiny as an independent company.

A long-term growth opportunity in video

The video medium has become a more prominent staple for consuming entertainment advertising and communicating with friends and co-workers. And this trend has only strengthened in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vimeo has carved out an interesting and valuable niche in this new video communication ecosystem. The market for its services continues to grow at a rapid rate and the company is poised to capture that opportunity. This makes Vimeo an interesting technology stock to watch for the long run.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aW5nbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvc29jY2VyL25ld3Mvb2x5bXBpYy1zb2NjZXItcnVsZXMtbWVuLXdvbWVuLXRvdXJuYW1lbnQtdG9reW8vMTU0ZW1yYXV3cmd4YzFuYTVubXN6cnJxZGbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Olympic soccer rules explained: How men’s and women’s football tournaments work in Tokyo,"The men’s and women’s Olympic football tournaments are among the marquee events on the world soccer scene.

Both competitions operate similarly. Here’s how they work.

Qualifying: Participating nations need to qualify for the Olympic soccer tournament from their respective region. Each regional body determines for itself how qualifying happens.

The semifinal winners play a gold/silver medal match.

That’s all straightforward enough. But there are slight differences that make these Olympic tournaments different.

How many teams qualify to the Olympics?

As of 2021 the men’s and women’s soccer tournaments started with a different number of participating teams:

Men’s Olympic soccer: 16 teams

16 teams Women’s Olympic soccer: 12 teams

Men’s soccer has been played at every summer Olympics while women’s soccer was introduced for the first time in 1996.

The women’s competition started out with eight teams in 1996 increased to 10 participants in 2000 and expanded to 12 teams for the 2008 Games in Beijing. With the rapid growth in women’s soccer occurring around the world expansion to 16 teams seems inevitable.

What’s the difference between the Olympics and the World Cup?

Both men’s and women’s FIFA World Cups see the participation of the best teams with their best players after qualifying competitions that involve every national team on the planet. That’s not the case with the Olympics and this ensures that while still prestigious the Olympics never compete with the World Cup.

The FIFA World Cups for men and women feature an expanded field of teams which makes both the pinnacle of achievement in the sport: 32 participants for both the men's and women's World Cups. The reduced field at the Olympics gives it less of a world championship feel.

Furthermore in the case of men’s Olympic soccer only FIFA and the International Olympic Committee limit tournament participation to players who are 23 years of age and younger with only three over-23 selections permitted on each roster (given the pandemic delay that age cutoff was pushed to 24 for 2021). It’s also not mandatory that club teams release male players to their national teams for the men’s Olympic tournament. That's why you don’t see Lionel Messi playing for Argentina or Neymar playing for Brazil in Tokyo 2021 although both could have probably twisted a few arms if they really wanted to be there.

Meanwhile the women’s Olympic soccer tournament features full senior national teams. No age restrictions.

How does each nation qualify for Olympic soccer?

Each region has its own rules for determining how its qualifying slots are filled. The majority have Olympic qualifying tournaments with some of these branded as Under-23 championships in the case of the men.

They don’t complicate things in Europe: They just repurpose their regularly scheduled men’s Under-21 European Championship to determine the four European qualifying berths to the Olympics. They also take the top European finishers at the FIFA Women’s World Cup to fill the three berths to the women’s Olympic tournament (England's finish gave Great Britain a spot). That’s why the last women’s Olympic gold medal winner Germany is not at the 2021 Olympics.

Here’s the breakdown of berths around the globe for Tokyo 2021:

Region Men’s Olympic Berths Women’s Olympic Berths Africa 3 (Egypt Ivory Coast South Africa) 1.5 (Zambia) Asia 3 (Australia Saudi Arabia S. Korea) 2 (Australia China) Europe 4 (France Germany Romania Spain) 3 (Great Britain Netherlands Sweden) Oceania 1 (New Zealand) 1 (New Zealand) South America 2 (Brazil Argentina) 1.5 (Brazil) North America 2 (Honduras Mexico) 2 (USA Canada)

The reason that Africa and South America are listed as having 1.5 berths each? That half-berth refers to a playoff that’s played between both regions. Chile beat Cameroon over two matches to make the 2021 Olympics.

Lastly the host nation automatically qualifies for the men’s and women’s soccer tournaments. Japan has both a men’s and women’s soccer team competing at the 2021 Tokyo Games.

Are the rules different in Olympic soccer?

World soccer governing body FIFA actually runs both men’s and women’s competitions at the Olympics and so the Laws of the Game and tournament formats line up pretty similarly with the World Cup and other international competitions.

In the group stage teams earn three points for a win one for a draw and none for a loss. There are tiebreakers for teams that are even on points during the three-match round-robin group phase and they're used in this order:

Superior goal difference in all group matches (difference between goals scored and conceded); Most goals scored in all group matches; Most points obtained in group matches between the teams in question; Superior goal difference in group matches between the teams in question; Most goals scored in group matches between the teams in question; Best conduct score relating to yellow and red cards received in all group matches: Drawing of lots

Eight teams advance from the group stages to the single-elimination knockout stages which feature quarterfinal and semifinal matches that lead up to the gold/silver-medal match and the bronze-medal match.

If you really want to delve into all the nitty gritty of the rules all 78 pages of them are published.

What happens if Olympic soccer games end in ties?

During the group stage draws after 90 minutes result in a point for each team in their respective group standings.

During the single-elimination knockout rounds all matches in both the men’s and women’s tournaments that are tied after 90 minutes of regulation will head to 30 minutes of extra time (two periods of 15 minutes each). If the draw persists a penalty-kick shootout will be used to determine a winner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMjkvc3BvcnRzL29seW1waWNzL3VzLXJ1Z2J5LXNlbWlmaW5hbHMtd29tZW4uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Women's Rugby Sevens Team Into Quarterfinals,"The American women’s rugby sevens team opened the Olympic tournament with victories against China and Japan on Thursday assuring the United States a spot in the quarterfinals on Friday.

Unlike the men’s rugby sevens team which was lumped into a so-called group of death the women’s team started the tournament by playing two relatively weak foes.

Leicestershire 253 for 9 (Swindells 75 Lilley 41 Steel 4-33) beat Surrey 225 (Clarke 82 Patel 52 Mike 3-34) by one run (DLS method)

Leicestershire pulled off a dramatic one-run victory after Surrey lost three wickets in the final over of a rain-affected Royal London Cup match that had seemed to be theirs for the taking.

Veteran Rikki Clarke appeared to have steered an inexperienced Surrey into a share of the Group One lead with Glamorgan and Somerset when he hit a six off the final ball of the penultimate over as they chased a revised target of 227 from 39 overs leaving them four to win from the final six deliveries with three wickets in hand.

But in an extraordinary climax Clarke - who should have been run out twice in that last but one over - was leg before to Ben Mike for 82 with five balls left before Dan Moriarty was run out and Matthew Dunn bowled from consecutive deliveries giving Leicestershire the spoils with one ball to spare.

Earlier former Durham leg spinner Cameron Steel took 4 for 33 on his Surrey debut conceding no boundaries in his 10 overs as Leicestershire having been put in made 253 for 9 from 50 including a List A-best 75 by opener Harry Swindells  41 from Arron Lilley and 33 from Ed Barnes.

Already deprived of 11 players because of The Hundred and with three in the England Test squad Surrey were without two more experienced players in Hashim Amla who has a groin injury and Mark Stoneman left out after feeling ill.

But after Ryan Patel 's 52 off 33 balls had put them in the driving seat Leicestershire's bowlers bounced back with seven wickets in the last 11 overs Mike finishing with 3 for 34 16-year-old leg spinner Rehan Ahmed 2 for 25 and Barnes 2 for 34.

Swindells had done a fine job in the anchor role for the Foxes hitting five fours to go with an early six over midwicket off Dunn holding the innings together for 36 overs before top-edging Steel to short fine leg.

Rishi Patel fell into a trap when he was caught on the hook for 20 but apart from Lilley's 28-ball blitz as the second wicket put on 57 in 53 balls there was no substantial support for Swindells and it was only through the late industry of Barnes who made 33 from 36 balls largely in singles that the Foxes' total limped past 250 with two many batsmen giving their wickets away carelessly.

Steel - who dismissed Lewis Hill George Rhodes and Lewis Kimber as well as Swindells - should have had a maiden five-for but spilled a low return catch offered by Mike.

Ahmed bowled his leg spin beautifully quickly trapping Patel leg before after the opener had hit eight fours and two sixes in a 27-ball half-century that saw him dropped on the midwicket boundary by Lilley on 48. Steel had been caught at midwicket without scoring.

Ben Geddes was stumped going down the track to off-spinner Rhodes and Surrey began to wobble after Jamie Smith - captain in Amla's absence - was caught at deep midwicket for 34 and Nico Reifer and Tim David were both caught behind."
MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,"A super PAC supporting Republican David McCormick's Senate run in Pennsylvania is launching a $4 million TV ad buy today its first in one of the most-watched contests of the 2024 campaign.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why."

A woman is suing McDonald's after claiming a burger advert made her break her fast during Lent.

Ksenia Ovchinnikova said she hadn't eaten meat in a month when the adverts made her give in.

The Russian is suing the chain for $14 as compensation for sustained moral damage Fox News reported.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

A woman from Omsk Russia is reportedly suing McDonald's over an advert featuring cheeseburgers and chicken nuggets which she said caused her to break her fast during Lent.

Ksenia Ovchinnikova an Orthodox Christian said she was trying to stay away from meat and other animal products during the six-week period leading up to Easter in 2019 according to multiple reports.

Lent is a strict period in which many devout Christians are expected to sacrifice the eating of meat poultry eggs and dairy for the entire season.

The case was first reported by Russian state media and picked up by western outlets including Fox News which wrote that she abstained from eating meat for a month when the enticing McDonald's advert made her give in according to the lawsuit.

""When I saw an advertising banner – I could not help myself I visited McDonald's and bought a cheeseburger"" she said in her statement.

The outlet reported Ovchinnikov is accusing the fast-food franchise of breaking consumer protection law and insulting her religious feelings. She is suing McDonald's for $14 (1000 rubles) as compensation for sustained moral damage.

McDonald's did not immediately reply to Insider's request for comment.

According to Fox News Ovchinnikov said in the lawsuit: ""In the actions of McDonald's I see a violation of the consumer protection law. I ask the court to investigate and if a violation has taken place to oblige McDonald's LLC to compensate me for moral damage in the amount of one thousand rubles.""

This is not the first time McDonald's has been hit with an ad-related lawsuit. In May the fast-food chain was sued by two divisions of Allen Media Group over allegations of racial discrimination.

The complaint accused McDonald's of refusing to advertise on Entertainment Studios networks or The Weather Channel due to racial stereotyping.

As Roadside America notes one looks like it belongs in a big city the other would fit well in a suburban neighborhood. But these are no ordinary fast food restaurants. They comprise the McDonald's Production Center where silver screen scenarios of Big Macs and Happy Meals come to life under the unblinking gaze of a camera crew.

Within this 5000-square-foot space which the LA Times reports has been around since 1978 lies the energy of a Hollywood studio. These ""McStudios"" boast everything required to film a commercial in style: a soundstage dining rooms elaborate kitchen facsimiles and containers packed with uniforms of every size and color imaginable. The classic sign out front can be wheeled around and adjusted and a basement filled with all sorts of McDonald's furniture allows for easy customization of the set per Roadside America. Of course like any major studio Ronald and his friends turn to movie magic for a bit of assistance — any time you see a cup of steaming coffee in a McDonald's commercial you have a microwaved tampon to thank.

(NYSE: MCD) is advising restaurant owners to serve meals on trays to customers dining inside as the fast-food chain is facing a bag supply shortage.

What happened: McDonald’s told owners in a late-July message that limited bag supplies have been impacting the industry as a whole and encouraged workers to transition to the use of trays. Almost 81% of restaurant business in the 12 months ending June 30 was made up of take-out orders that's up 18% compared with the prior year’s period according to the NPD Group a consumer-research firm.

Many customers have been asking for Big Macs McNuggets and fries to be packaged in bags even when dining inside the restaurant. McDonald's noted that it has been difficult to return to the use of trays “because we haven’t done it in so long” according to report fom the Wall Street Journal.

The company says the limited supply of bags has had a minimal impact on its restaurants. McDonald’s has also told franchisees the chain will be limiting its purchases of straws after suppliers experienced a shortage due to a dropoff in labor and a limited supply of resin.

What’s next: McDonald’s says it is confident that customers will not experience a disruption of service as the company closely monitors the situation. Prices at its U.S. restaurants have risen by about 6% from the same period a year ago due to labor shortages and the increasing cost of food supplies.

(Reuters) - Merck said on Thursday its therapy being tested in certain patients with a type of cancer in the uterus lining failed a late-stage trial.

The drugmaker's Keytruda therapy in combination with chemotherapy was being evaluated in about 1095 patients with high-risk endometrial cancer after surgery.

The trial did not meet the main goal of disease-free survival which is the length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient survives without any signs or its symptoms.

The study's other main goal of overall survival was not formally tested since the trial failed in showing significant disease-free survival.

Endometrial cancer begins in the inner lining of the uterus or endometrium and is the most common type of the disease affecting the organ.

Merck's Keytruda belongs to a class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that work by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to detect and fight tumor cells.

Keytruda is currently approved in the United States for two indications in endometrial cancer one of which is treated using it as a combination therapy with partner Eisai's drug Lenvima.

Endometrial cancer leads to more than 13000 deaths in a year in the U.S. according to government data.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Facebook has many pressing problems from proposed antitrust legislation to accusations that the company is contributing to vaccine misinformation. But when CEO Mark Zuckerberg joined a recent conference call with analysts to discuss its latest quarterly results much of the focus was on something far removed from those issues: the metaverse. During the hour-long call the metaverse was mentioned nearly two dozen times.

The metaverse was originally conceived as the setting for dystopian science fiction novels where virtual universes provide an escape from crumbling societies. Now the idea has transformed into a moonshot goal for Silicon Valley and become a favorite talking point among startups venture capitalists and tech giants.

The idea is to create a space similar to the internet but one that users (via digital avatars) can walk around inside of and where they can interact with one another in real time. In theory you could for example sit around a virtual meeting table with colleagues from around the world — instead of staring at their 2D faces on Zoom — and then walk over to a virtual Starbucks to meet up with your mom who lives across the country.

Zuckerberg has in recent weeks been extolling his vision for turning Facebook (FB) into a “metaverse company” claiming that he began thinking about the concept in middle school. The company recently announced the creation of a new metaverse product group and Zuckerberg said he sees the technology as “the successor to the mobile internet.”

Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella said last week that his company is working on building the “enterprise metaverse.” Epic Games announced a $1 billion funding round in April to support its metaverse ambitions pushing the Fortnite maker’s valuation to nearly $30 billion. And in June venture capitalist Matthew Ball helped launch an exchange traded fund so people can invest in the metaverse space including companies like graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and gaming platform Roblox (RBLX).

Despite the current hype cycle the idea is still amorphous and a fully functioning metaverse is probably years and billions of dollars away — if it happens at all. Big companies joining the discussion now may simply want to reassure investors that they won’t miss out on what could be the next big thing or that their investments in VR which has yet to gain broad commercial appeal will eventually pay off. And especially in Facebook’s case playing up the long-term potential for the metaverse could be a useful way of distracting from growing scrutiny in the here and now.

Whatever the motivations big questions remain from how tech companies may handle safety and privacy issues in the metaverse to whether people really want to live much of their lives inside an immersive virtual simulation.

“My biggest concern about the metaverse is: Are we ready?” said Avi Bar-Zeev founder of AR and VR consultancy RealityPrime and a former employee at Apple Amazon and Microsoft where he worked on the HoloLens.

“Are we emotionally evolved enough yet to move beyond the safe division of having screens between us and typing words?” he said. “Are we safe to start interacting at a more person-to-person level or are the a**holes still going to ruin it for everybody?”

What is the “metaverse”?

The “metaverse” was coined in the 1992 cyberpunk novel “Snow Crash.” In the book main character Hiro Protagonist — a hacker and for a short time pizza deliverer — uses the metaverse as an escape from his life in which he lives with a roommate in a 20-by-30-foot storage container in a bleak world where the government has been replaced by corrupt corporations.

In that story the metaverse is a platform for virtual creation but it’s also rife with problems including technology addiction discrimination harassment and violence which occasionally spill over into the real world.

That’s a far cry from the optimistic potential that Zuckerberg and others have presented. But one sign that the metaverse is still far off: No one can quite agree on a clear definition of what it is or could be.

Experts working in the space tend to agree on a few key aspects of the metaverse including the idea that users will experience a sense of “embodiment” or “presence.” That is they’ll feel like they’re actually inside a virtual space with other people seeing things in first-person and probably 3D. It will also be able to host many users who can interact with one another in real time.

“You can kind of think about [the metaverse] as an embodied internet that you’re inside of rather than just looking at” Zuckerberg said on the call.

Much like the internet today the metaverse won’t be a single technology that gets switched on at once but rather an ecosystem built over time by many different companies using a variety of technologies. Ideally those various parts of the ecosystem will be interconnected and interoperable said Jesse Alton a leader at Open Metaverse a group developing open source standards for the metaverse.

“Someone who’s playing a video game could win a flaming sword in their favorite game on Xbox put it in their inventory and later in VR they can show it to their friend and their friend can hold it” said Alton who is also the founder of extended reality firm AngellXR. “It’s the ability to transport [information] from one world to another regardless of which platform it’s in.”

Some pieces of the metaverse already exist. Services like Fortnite an online game in which users can compete socialize and build virtual worlds with millions of other players can give users an early sense of how it will work. And some people have already spent thousands of dollars on virtual homes staking out their piece of metaverse real estate.

Why is everyone suddenly talking about it?

The metaverse is a relatively old idea that seems to gain momentum every few years only to fade from the conversation in lieu of more immediate opportunities. Perhaps predictably those working on this technology see signs that this time could be different.

“A lot of the folks that were working on it before … are still involved it’s just that we’ve been waiting for certain technological advancements” Alton said.

1992: the internet will be like Snow Crash

2021: the facebook will be like Snow Crash — jack (@jack) July 29 2021

Improvements in mobile device processors gaming systems internet infrastructure virtual reality headsets and cryptocurrency are all crucial building blocks for creating the metaverse and ensuring consumer adoption.

What’s more after the pandemic forced much of the world to work learn and socialize from home many people may feel more comfortable interacting virtually than they did two years ago something tech companies may be trying to capitalize on.

“[A change like] this is always a multi-decade iterative process … and yet despite that fact there is an unmistakable sense over the past few years that the foundational pieces are coming together in a way that feels very new and very different” Ball the venture capitalist said.

Will the metaverse have the same problems as the internet?

Proponents of the metaverse say there could eventually be huge business potential — a whole new platform on which to sell digital goods and services. It could also have benefits for how humans interact using technology.

“What we’re really doing is figuring out ways to add technology into our lives to make our lives better and to enhance our communication with other people” RealityPrime’s Bar-Zeev said. “It’s not just about conquering a whole new world.”

But there are also a host of concerns about how the metaverse could be used or exploited.

Zuckerberg said last week that advertisements will likely be a key source of revenue in the metaverse just as they are for the company today. But some in the space worry that an ad-based business model will create haves who can afford to pay for an ad-free headset or metaverse experience and have-nots who can’t replicating inequalities present in the real world.

“I don’t want to see a world in which we segregate people into those who can afford it get a better experience and those who can’t afford it have this crappy experience of being exploited for advertising” Bar-Zeev said. He added that online harassment could become more intense when users can assault each others’ virtual bodies rather than just trading ugly words on a screen.

Data privacy and security could also become greater concerns when “more of our lives our data our labor our investments now exist in purely virtual form” Ball said. And other issues such as misinformation and radicalization could worsen in the metaverse too.

“If you can now replace somebody’s entire reality with an alternate reality you can make them believe almost anything” Bar-Zeev said. “The responsibility of everybody in the field is to prevent the bad things as much as possible and foster the good things.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2JyYW5kZXF1aXR5LmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9kaWdpdGFsL21ldGF2ZXJzZS1tYXJrLXp1Y2tlcmJlZ3MtaGlnaC10ZWNoLXBsYW4tdG8tZmFjZWJvb2tpZnktdGhlLXdvcmxkLzg1MTQ2NjI20gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vYnJhbmRlcXVpdHkuZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9kaWdpdGFsL21ldGF2ZXJzZS1tYXJrLXp1Y2tlcmJlZ3MtaGlnaC10ZWNoLXBsYW4tdG8tZmFjZWJvb2tpZnktdGhlLXdvcmxkLzg1MTQ2NjI2?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metaverse: Mark Zuckerberg's high-tech plan to Facebookify the world,"Advt

By Nick Kelly Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg recently announced the tech giant will shift from being a social media company to becoming ""a metaverse company"" functioning in an ""embodied internet"" that blends real and virtual worlds more than ever before.So what is ""the metaverse""? It sounds like the kind of thing billionaires talk about to earn headlines like Tesla chief Elon Musk spruiking ""pizza joints"" on Mars. Yet given almost three billion people use Facebook each month Zuckerberg's suggestion of a change of direction is worth some attention.The term ""metaverse"" isn't new but it has recently seen a surge in popularity and speculation about what this all might mean in practice.The idea of the metaverse is useful and it's likely to be with us for some time. It's a concept worth understanding even if like me you are critical of the future its proponents suggest.Humans have developed many technologies to trick our senses from audio speakers and televisions to interactive video games and virtual reality and in future we may develop tools to trick our other senses such as touch and smell. We have many words for these technologies but as yet no popular word that refers to the totality of the mash-up of old-fashioned reality (the physical world) and our fabricated extensions to reality (the virtual world).Words like ""the internet"" and ""cyberspace"" have come to be associated with places we access through screens. They don't quite capture the steady interweaving of the internet with virtual realities (such as 3D game worlds or virtual cities) and augmented reality (such as navigation overlays or Pokemon GO).Just as important the old names don't capture the new social relationships sensory experiences and economic behaviours that are emerging along with these extensions to the virtual. For example Upland mashes together a virtual reflection of our world with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and property markets.Facebook's announcement speaks to its attempts to envision what social media within the metaverse might look like.It also helps that ""metaverse"" is a poetic term. Academics have been writing about a similar idea under the name of ""extended reality"" for years but it's a rather dull name.""Metaverse"" coined by science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snow Crash has a lot more romantic appeal. Writers have a habit of recognising trends in need of naming: ""cyberspace"" comes from a 1982 book by William Gibson; ""robot"" is from a 1920 play by Karel Čapek.Recent neologisms such as ""the cloud"" or the ""Internet of Things"" have stuck with us precisely because they are handy ways to refer to technologies that were becoming increasingly important. The metaverse sits in this same category.If you spend too long reading about big tech companies like Apple  Facebook Google and Microsoft  you might end up feeling advances in technology (like the rise of the metaverse) are inevitable. It's hard not to then start thinking about how these new technologies will shape our society politics and culture and how we might fit into that future.This idea is called ""technological determinism"": the sense that advances in technology shape our social relations power relations and culture with us as mere passengers. It leaves out the fact that in a democratic society we have a say in how all of this plays out.For Facebook and other large corporations determined to embrace the ""next big thing"" before their competitors the metaverse is exciting because it presents an opportunity for new markets new kinds of social network new consumer electronics and new patents.What's not so clear is why you or I would be excited by all this.In the mundane world most of us are grappling with things like a pandemic a climate emergency and mass human-induced species extinction. We are struggling to understand what a good life looks like with technology we've already adopted (mobile devices social media and global connectivity are linked to many unwanted effects such as anxiety and stress).So why would we get excited about tech companies investing untold billions in new ways to distract us from the everyday world that gives us air to breathe food to eat and water to drink?Metaverse-style ideas might help us organise our societies more productively. Shared standards and protocols that bring disparate virtual worlds and augmented realities into a single open metaverse could help people work together and cut down on duplication of effort.In South Korea for example a ""metaverse alliance"" is working to persuade companies and government to work together to develop an open national VR platform. A big part of this is finding ways to blend smartphones 5G networks augmented reality virtual currencies and social networks to solve problems for society (and more cynically make profits).Similar claims for sharing and collaboration were made in the early days of the internet. But over time the early promise was swept aside by the dominance of large platforms and surveillance capitalism.The internet has been wildly successful in connecting people all around the world to one another and functioning as a kind of modern Library of Alexandria to house vast stores of knowledge. Yet it has also increased the privatisation of public spaces invited advertising into every corner of our lives tethered us to a handful of giant companies more powerful than many countries and led to the virtual world consuming the physical world via environmental damage.The deeper problems with the metaverse are about the kind of worldview it would represent.In one worldview we we can think of ourselves as passengers inside a singular reality that is like a container for our lives. This view is probably familiar to most readers and it also describes what you see on something like Facebook: a ""platform"" that exists independently of any of its users.In another worldview which sociologists suggest is common in Indigenous cultures each of us creates the reality that we live in through what we do. Practices such as work and rituals connect people land life and spirituality and together create reality.A key problem with the former view is that it leads to a ""one-world world"": a reality that does not permit other realities. This is what we see already on existing platforms.The current version of Facebook may increase your ability to connect to other people and communities. But at the same time it limits how you connect to them: features such as six preset ""reactions"" to posts and content chosen by invisible algorithms shape the entire experience.Similarly a game like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (with more than 100 million active users) allows limitless possibilities for how a game might play out - but defines the rules by which the game can be played.The idea of a metaverse by shifting even more of our lives onto a universal platform extends this problem to a deeper level. It offers us limitless possibility to overcome the constraints of the physical world; yet in doing so only replaces them with constraints imposed by what the metaverse will allow.(The Conversation) NSA.

The No. 2 overall pick struggled in Saturday's Green and White scrimmage throwing two interceptions.

""Not great"" Wilson said to reporters Saturday night assessing his performance. ""I have high expectations for myself and for this offense and I got to lead those guys I got to make better decisions. But that's why this isn't Game 1. That's why we're doing this.""

Reporters at MetLife Stadium detailed Wilson's tough night as the 22-year-old was unable to move the football while throwing a pair of picks forcing passes into coverage.

In fact according to Connor Hughes of The Athletic Wilson completed just 11 of his 24 passes for 112 yards. Of the rookie's seven drives Saturday New York punted on four of them converting on one field goal.

As much as Wilson had trouble in the scrimmage head coach Robert Saleh believes the experience will benefit the franchise quarterback in the long run.

""It’s his first time in front of the fans. There was a good crowd out there"" Saleh explained. ""These moments are priceless for him. He had some good moments and obviously he had some rookie moments. So it’s going to be a lot of tape to learn off of for him.""

Wilson agreed assuring that jitters didn't play a role in his performance.

""It's just part of the process"" he said. ""We're all learning. I got to make some better decisions but I know I'm learning from all those. The reason we do this whole thing is to be able to get used to that kind of stuff. Now we can clean it up.""

New York still has over a month it opens the regular season with Week 1 in Carolina. Wilson won't take the field at MetLife in a game that actually counts until Gang Green's Week 2 matchup with the Patriots on September 19.

Until then Wilson the coaching staff and the rest of this young roster will look to build on this performance—and their work in training camp—leading into the preseason.

After all there were still some positives to takeaway from Saturday's scrimmage even if Wilson was unable to shine.

""Great for all of us just to feel out the atmosphere and get in front of some fans and stuff"" the quarterback said. ""It was good for our team to get out here for sure.""

Mosley Says 'It Felt Good' to Be Back on the Field at MetLife Stadium,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGplcnNleS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL25mbC9qZXRzLzIwMjEvMDgvMDgvbnktamV0cy16YWNoLXdpbHNvbi1ub3QtZ3JlYXQtZ3JlZW4td2hpdGUtcHJhY3RpY2Utbm93LXdoYXQvNTUxMTg5NTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NY Jets' Zach Wilson 'not great' in Green & White practice: Does it matter even a little?,"EAST RUTHERFORD — The first two Saturdays of training camp gave New York Jets fans their chance to finally see the rookie quarterback who has so many of them feeling hopeful again.

Last weekend No. 2 overall picks Zach Wilson used his unveiling at the team's facility to show a capacity crowd exactly what they have to look forward to: He zipped passes into tight windows with precision. He lofted touch throws over defenders and to spots only his intended target could reach. He made quick sensible decisions throughout the team's first public practice.

And so the second Saturday of training camp arrived with an unusual but understandable jolt of pre-preseason energy for the annual Green & White practice. Wilson walked onto the field for his MetLife Stadium debut in front of nearly 20000 Jets fans who were ready to revel in and roar about the possibility of a brighter future.

The only problem? This Saturday went a little bit differently for the quarterback than the first one.

Let's just go to Wilson himself for the initial analysis because he was both succinct and accurate in describing Saturday night's performance.

""Not great"" Wilson said.

Not great indeed. Wilson threw two interceptions and completed 11-of-24 passes in team drills for a total of 112 yards as he played in his new home stadium for the first time. Not ideal for the fans who never really had anything to cheer about. And even less enjoyable for Wilson who didn't try to hide his unhappiness about the way he played. .

""I have high expectations for myself and for this offense and I’ve got to lead those guys"" Wilson said. ""I’ve got to make better decisions. But that’s why this isn’t game one that’s why we’re doing this. And I understand that of course. I’m going to be frustrated at myself but I’m going to go back in the film room find out what I can learn and get better from.""

Subpar throwing accuracy and some poor decision-making seemed the biggest culprits for Wilson's worst practice of the training camp. But this was an all-around struggle.

""It’s his first time in front of the fans"" Jets coach Robert Saleh said. ""There was a good crowd out there. ... His coordinator is in the box his quarterback coach is on the sideline and there’s no one to turn to to talk to. So to have that first experience right here and to be able to go through it all these moments are priceless for him. He had some good moments and obviously he had some rookie moments. So it’s going to be a lot of tape to learn off of for him.""

Some fans will see these struggles as a massive blinking neon WARNING sign. Others seem to believe that the team's annual scrimmage/practice is actually some sort of time machine that has revealed to them the future of the Jets' rookie quarterback.

All joking aside I get the frustration. It has been a rough decade ... well five decades for Jets fans.

But no. This was more of a tiny ""proceed with caution"" sign. And it was definitely not a time machine. (I'm sorry I know it would have been cool.)

This was simply a bad day for a 22-year-old who is trying to learn the toughest job in sports. And guess what? He's going to have some more bad days because this is hard.

It should also serve as a reminder— and probably an unwelcome one if you are a Jets fan: No matter how this turns it it's going to require some serious patience.

Even if Wilson has a great rookie season and looks like one of the top 10 or 15 quarterbacks in the NFL he's going to have to do it again next year — and maybe even the year after that — before you'll know for sure.

Sam Darnold struggled for three years here and many still weren't sure if it was the right move to move on from him. This isn't likely to be quick or easy no matter how it goes.

So take a deep breath and try to remember that Wilson is less than 10 days into his first training camp and has bounced back from shaky performances a few times in the past week.

Try to remember that team scrimmages/practices/and preseason games do not count and do not define a player's legacy.

And even though no one has any idea what this means for Wilson it's probably not a bad sign that he's taking full accountability and not trying to downplay or shy away from his poor performance. That's what real confidence looks like.

When asked if there was a good play he could build on from the practice he came up empty.

""I don’t know if I could point to a particular one"" Wilson said. "" We’ll go back and watch the film and I wouldn’t say that we build off necessarily just the good plays I’d say we build off more of the bad plays than the good ones honestly.""

And there's a lot of growth potential from what we saw Saturday.

The offense didn't get past the 50-yard line on its first five drives. And after picking up one first down on their opening drive they followed it up with three straight three-and-outs followed by an interception.

He was on the field for seven possessions and failed to lead his group to a touchdown. Of the drives he quarterbacked three ended in three-and-outs two ended in interceptions one ended in a made field goal and one in a punt.

""I think it comes down to everything"" Wilson said. ""It’s my connection with the guys being able to throw the ball accurately us just getting on the same page because we had times tonight where we weren’t on the same page.""

But the interceptions clearly bothered Wilson the most. He was picked by Javelin Guidry and C.J. Mosley but there were at least three other passes that he forced into the heart of the defense and were nearly picked. Yes it could have been worse and he knows that's something he needs to improve immediately.

""I’ve just got to make good decisions"" Wilson said. ""That’s 95% of a quarterback’s job is just decision making.""

And his future will likely be defined by how he improves that part of his game.

It’s unlikely that lovable legend Biz Markie knew what a big hole he left in the hearts of fans when he passed away in mid-July of 2021.

The “Clown Prince of Hip Hop” died at 57 after multiple health struggles and since then recording artists from a variety of genres have given him shout-outs the most recent being Guns N’ Roses in their August 5 2021 concert at Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford New Jersey. Watch above.

Rose was about to perform his band’s 1992 epic “November Rain” when he began singing the song that was probably Biz’s greatest hit the sardonic “Just A Friend.” You can watch the original video for the song below.

There have been more than a few covers and tributes to Biz Markie since his death from musicians across many genres of pop music.

Like Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy:

NKOTB did a nice tribute to Biz and other recently-passed stars like DMX and Digital Underground rapper Shock G:

And uh DC-based “Americana” band Justin Trawick and The Common Good who teamed with some swing dancers doing the Lindy Hop for a full-on “Just a Friend” cover in their own style. For some reason.

If you need a palate cleanser after all that it’s worth noting that Biz Markie was no stranger to popping out unexpected cover songs.

From a 2009 live performance enjoy Biz Markie’s version of Elton John‘s 1973 hit “Bennie and the Jets” below. It might be the best performance in the bunch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZ21lbmhxLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzA3L255LWdpYW50cy1lbGktbWFubmluZy1oYWxsLW9mLWZhbWUvNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Reasons NY Giants' Eli Manning Belongs in the Hall of Fame,

MGM Resorts/M life is once again offering status matches from casino loyalty programs across the country including many in Las Vegas. This means the status-match-go-round is picking up speed.

The Deal

Match status from many casino loyalty programs to status with the MGM Resorts M life program.

Direct link to offer.

Key Terms

Visit the M life Rewards desk now through January 31 2022 to match your Tier.

Tier Match is available for select loyalty programs and tiers.

Subject to Promotion Rules (click here) and M life Rewards Program Rules (click here).

Management reserves the right to modify or cancel this promotion at any time.

Quick Thoughts

M life is matching status from casino programs across 26 different states as well as Canada. The location that’ll likely be of most interest will be Nevada due to the numerous casino programs there particularly Caesars Rewards.

This means that the status-match-go-round is getting going again. Wyndham Rewards still isn’t offering status matches from other hotel loyalty programs but that’s not as important now that the Wyndham Business Earner credit card offers top-tier Diamond status. Diamond status with Wyndham can be matched to Diamond status with Caesars Rewards which waives resort fees offers a $100 Celebration Dinner credit and more.

Caesars Diamond status can then be matched to Gold status with MGM Resorts M life thanks to this reintroduction of their status match program. Gold status with M life will in turn get you Explorist status with Hyatt the main benefits of which are a room upgrade and 2pm late checkout although the latter benefit is also available if you already have Discoverist status from the Hyatt credit card.

Although you can link your M life and Hyatt accounts online note that you can only status match from the casino programs by visiting the M life Rewards desk at an MGM Resorts location.

You won’t see their names on Las Vegas Boulevard marquees and you may not have even heard of them.

But two heavyweight firms Vici Properties and The Blackstone Group are emerging as two of the biggest players on the Strip.

Their role? Collecting rent.

Vici a Caesars Entertainment spinoff announced a $17.2 billion deal Wednesday to acquire MGM Resorts International spinoff MGM Growth Properties giving Vici real estate ownership of many of the biggest hotel-casinos on the Strip.

Blackstone has its own growing portfolio of hotels on Las Vegas Boulevard and overall the two companies are slated to own more than a dozen megaresorts combined along the famed casino corridor mostly as landlords.

All this wheeling and dealing probably has little if any effect on guests at the properties or any immediate impact on the employees other than changing where companies send their rent checks.

But the two New York firms are betting billions that tourism here will thrive — and that casino operators can pay a fortune in rent.

‘On time and in cash’

Vici a casino landlord and Blackstone a financial conglomerate are buying hotels as Las Vegas bounces back from the still-raging coronavirus outbreak which dealt a catastrophic economic blow to Southern Nevada.

The pandemic temporarily turned the Strip into a ghost town of shuttered resorts last year sparked huge job losses in the casino-heavy region and kept people home and away from crowds for fear of getting infected devastating the tourism industry.

The landlords’ line of business however seems to be fine.

Vici CEO Ed Pitoniak said on a conference call Wednesday that both MGM Growth and his company have collected “100 percent of our rent so far through COVID on time and in cash.”

Vici’s real estate holdings include Caesars Palace and Harrah’s Las Vegas. In early March it also announced a deal with Apollo Global Management to purchase The Venetian Palazzo and Sands Expo and Convention Center for about $6.25 billion from casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp. with Vici acquiring the real estate and Apollo buying the operations side. The deal is expected to close early next year.

With its purchase of MGM Growth Vici is buying several MGM Resorts-operated properties including The Mirage Park MGM Luxor New York-New York and Excalibur.

Betting billions

Blackstone not only dropped $1.73 billion in 2014 for The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas it also has a history of multibillion-dollar real estate deals with MGM Resorts.

As announced in early July Blackstone is buying the Aria and Vdara hotels for nearly $3.9 billion and leasing them back to MGM. Blackstone also partnered with MGM Growth on a $4.6 billion deal early last year to acquire the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay’s real estate and lease them back to MGM Resorts with Vici saying this week it will retain MGM Growth’s stake in the venture.

Moreover Blackstone bought the Bellagio in 2019 for about $4.2 billion from MGM Resorts and leased it back.

As you can imagine leasing a resort with thousands of rooms is not cheap. The Bellagio sale for instance called for an initial annual rent of $245 million.

Las Vegas’ tourism industry has by no means fully recovered from the pandemic and the public health crisis is far from over. But the local economy has come a long way since the early chaos of the outbreak and Las Vegas is still a place where people spend big on hotels — not to mention gambling and booze.

“As much as parents like to spend money on their kids whether in Orlando and other locations I don’t think anybody’s ever spent $10000 on a bottle of apple juice” Pitoniak said this week.

The Review-Journal is owned by the family of Dr. Miriam Adelson the majority shareholder of Las Vegas Sands Corp. Las Vegas Sands operates The Venetian Palazzo and Sands Expo and Convention Center.

Surprisingly they don’t match any tier from Wynn Rewards and Caesars Diamond only yields you Gold.

One can argue about the value of these different gaming program levels but at least now MGM has returned a status match option to Nevada as previously this was only possible in Atlantic City.

These are the benefits with the MLife program:

I’m Noir with MLife for several years now and based on my experience with the program even as a lower tier before the main advantage is the option to cut lines at the hotel and casino. Some of the lower grade hotels such as Luxor do offer the official hotel upgrade benefit but to get something nice at the more modern popular casinos in a better location rarely give out nice rooms.

There might be some of our readers who still have MLife Gold/Platinum through the MGM/Hyatt Partnership – see my old article here. Those who have done this in the past and whose status has expired could now get it back if they hold a casino tier at one of the other programs.

In reverse Gold/Platinum & NOIR members can also match their MLife Status to Hyatt Explorist per their mutual tier match agreement which is very decent and gives you good benefits at Hyatt.

Conclusion

It’s great that MGM has brought the status match back. But remember: Just because you hold a status level don’t expect to be treated like a king at the casino or property. Casino memberships rely to a very large extent on the ratings of the player (cardholder) accomplished through gaming and of course the VIP’s are those people who gamble (and potentially lose) the most. Casinos then give out status cards to their good customers.

The top of the line customers (high rollers or “whales”) often don’t even use such a card but are rated on a face basis and play in a different league altogether. You’ll often find that casino employees will swipe your card and be confused when they can’t see any gaming data after pulling up your profile yet you hold the high tier card.

So yes you will get the hard benefits as guaranteed by the program meaning waiver of some fees and discounts here and there maybe even an upgrade. But don’t expect free stuff being thrown at you or that you can trick casinos into thinking that you’re a high roller. These establishments are very good of keeping records and ‘comps’ as the complimentary items are called are reserved for real gamblers only."

Hear. Tell. A week with Microsoft's new Modern remote work accessories,"Nobody likes COVID-19 but unfortunately it looks like it's going to stick around for at least a little longer and for many that means working from home for the foreseeable future. To help remote workers Microsoft has released four new Modern devices: a USB Headset a Wireless Headset a USB-C Speaker and a Webcam.

Microsoft sent me these four devices to try out and after a week of constant use I'm sharing my experiences.

Modern USB Headset

The first device I tested was the Modern USB Headset. I already had a Logitech USB headset that I've been using during the pandemic so thought this would be similar and I wouldn't have much to say about the device but I was wrong.

Before I get to performance I'll point out that the headset has five buttons inline with the wire that connects to the USB-A port. The two largest are the mute and Teams button on either end of the console while the volume up/down and phone button are in the middle. Since all of these devices are integrated with Teams pushing the mute button will toggle the mute function within the Teams app letting everyone know whether you're muted or not. If using other services such as Zoom it's possible to be muted on the headphones and other meeting participants won't know you're muted. This is either a bug or a feature depending on how you look at it. The same is true for the wireless headset and the USB-C speaker.

As for performance the Microsoft Modern USB headset was leaps and bounds better than my Logitech headset. Although speaker quality was very similar people listening to me said that the voice quality was far and away better with one coworker even saying that ""it sounds like you're actually in the room with me."" In addition the headset itself is soft and feels good on your head even for hours at a time.

During all of my testing I was never able to get the Teams button to do anything other than bring the Teams application to the forefront. Although the documentation says it's supposed to blink and help you join a scheduled meeting I was never able to get that to work. We also don't use Teams calls so the phone button was wasted for me.

Despite not being able to get the Teams button to work the audio and microphone quality were top notch. If you're on calls a lot the Microsoft Modern USB Headset priced at $49.99 is a steal.

Modern Wireless Headset

The wireless headset is an interesting device. The package includes not only the headset itself but also a USB dongle for connectivity. The headset itself feels very similar to the wired version but instead of a wire that houses the various controls small buttons are put on the right and left earphone. On one side is the power button and the Bluetooth button and on the other side is the Teams mute and call button. Instead of dedicated buttons for volume control the non-microphone side is a dial that actually turns to adjust the volume. It's a clever design that makes it easier to adjust volume during a call. To help you identify the buttons Microsoft includes an insert that highlights the functions as you can see in the picture below.

As for call quality it was a mixed bag for me. When connecting with the laptop's built-in Bluetooth the sound quality was a little crackly and distorted bordering on unusuable. I found this strange because I've never had trouble with any other Bluetooth device on this laptop. However once I connected the included USB dongle audio quality was close to perfect only a half-step below what I was hearing with the wired headset. I'm not sure why the included dongle works better but it's something to consider if you were planning on buying one to free up a USB port.

Controlling the headset is much more difficult than the wired version as well. The buttons on the side are tiny and there's obviously no way to quickly look and see if the device is muted or not. When using Teams it's not an issue because you can look at the application itself but when you join meetings on other platforms you'll find this a minor annoyance.

The battery life is very good. When you first turn them on a voice tells you how much time you have left (""More than 15 hours left"") and they announce what they're connected to (""Connected to USB Link""). After using them for a few hours over the course of a day they still reported over 15 hours of battery left so you should be able to go a week or more before having to charge the device.

Considering these cost $99 double the price of the wired version I can't recommend them unless you're deadset on owning a wireless headset.

Modern USB-C Speaker

I went into the review thinking the speakerphone was my least favorite of the group but ended up loving it the most. I assumed that like most speakers it would pick up too much interference from my window that's a few feet from the device or from the fan that's blowing in the room but that turned out to be an incorrect assumption.

For whatever reason this is the only device that includes a carrying case of any sort but it's a welcome addition especially if you plan to toss it into your laptop bag. The Microsoft logo is front and center and the same buttons that are on the headphones are also here - Teams a phone volume up/down and mute. As with the headphones the mute button integrates with Teams but when using other tools such as Zoom or GoToMeeting there's the potential to ""double mute"" yourself. Whether this is a bug or a feature is up to you.

The cable management on the speaker is also top notch. The bottom of the speaker is made of rubber and has a small gap where the USB-C cable cleverly hides allowing you to make the cable as long (up to 26 inches / 66 cm) or short as you want.

The microphone on the speaker definitely doesn't sound as good as a set of headphones but according to my coworkers it wasn't far off. They were also able to hear me very well regardless of whether I was a foot away or several feet away from the device making placement very easy. It was the first time during the pandemic that I was able to be on conference calls without having to put headphones on and because of that it was my favorite device of the four.

In a pinch you can use the Modern USB-C Speaker to play music as well. It's not the best for this use case but it's better than integrated laptop speakers.

The only downside to the speaker is the price. Coming in at $99.99 it is fair for the market but twice the price of the Modern USB Headset which had slightly better voice quality. If you have multiple people that need to speak and listen or if you don't like wearing headphones in meetings this is a great solution.

Modern Webcam

My daily use laptop is a Dell Precision 5520 and while I love the form factor and the tiny bezel the downside is that the webcam is built into the lower-left hand corner of the screen presenting a rather unflattering view of the user. Even worse if you try typing on the keyboard while using the webcam all people on the other side see is a flurry of knuckles bouncing up and down in front of the camera.

The Microsoft Modern Webcam aims to solve that problem for people like me. Boasting a 1080p resolution a single microphone and a privacy shield the device connects to your machine with USB-A and attaches to the monitor by means of a hinge . There's a tiny bit of overlap on the screen itself but it isn't distracting at all.

In the first meeting I had with the camera on a coworker asked me if I moved to a different room. When I told her it was simply a new camera she was impressed and said that everything looked extremely clear so much so that she could easily see the posters in the back of my office. I also noticed that the built-in HDR greatly improved the picture quality; even when I left the lights in my office off my face was illuminated well while the rest of the room was very dim.

The Modern Webcam also has a built-in microphone but for some reason it's not part of the Microsoft Teams certification. When you attempt to activate it you're given a warning that you have to accept and then the camera has to reboot for it to take effect.

Overall the quality of the microphone is acceptable but nowhere near as good as the Modern USB-C speaker or either of the two headsets that I reviewed. It'll get you by if you're tight on funds and is better than the laptop's built-in mic but your coworkers will be happier if you use another solution which is probably why Microsoft disables it by default.

The Modern Webcam retails for $69.99 which is slightly under what the Logitech c920 a device that seems to be its main competitor costs. The image quality is great it's small and unobtrusive and it worked by simply plugging it into a USB-A port. If you need a webcam for your meetings the Microsoft Modern Webcam is a winner.

Microsoft Accessory Center

Along with the new Modern line of devices comes an app to manage them all: The Microsoft Accessory Center. This tool installs itself automatically after plugging in your first device and since I ignored it at first I had trouble finding it.

There's really not much to the application. It shows all of the devices that have ever been configured on your machine as well as highlights which ones are currently connected. From there you can click on one to make some minor modifications to each device. For the headsets and the speaker you can control the maximum volume level and whether you can hold the mute button to temporarily unmute and talk. For the wireless headset you're also shown how many hours of battery life are remaining. The camera lets you adjust things like brithness and contrast and also allows you to disable HDR but I found leaving all of the settings at default worked fine.

This is a tool you'll probably look at once or twice in the beginning and then never use again.

Conclusion

I went into this review thinking the products would be relatively unexciting but after using them for a week I was pleasantly surprised at how well they all worked even without being a heavy Teams user.

Unless you absolutely dislike having a wired headset I'd recommend saving $50 and buying the wired version. The sound quality is a little better you don't have to worry about battery life and the buttons are easier to access. Plus it's handy to be able to look down at the mute button to see if you're muted something you obviously can't do with the wireless headset.

As for the other accessories the Modern Webcam has great picture quality and the built-in microphone although not Teams certified is still good (but not great) and is definitely better than any built-in laptop webcam I've seen. The Modern USB-C Speaker also has great audio quality although slightly less than the USB Wired headset and works wonderfully for conference calls with multiple people.

The only downsides if you can even call them that are that the Teams button takes up a lot of space and is of limited use even when using Teams and the wireless headset required the dongle to work well for me.

The new lineup by Microsoft hits the ball out of the park and would be a welcome addition to any business user whether working from home or in the office.

A superyacht built for Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen has been sold to a secret buyer reports say.

The boat named Octopus had been listed for about $278 million Bloomberg News reported.

The 414-foot vessel's new owner plans to open the Octopus to charters SuperYacht Times reported.

A 414-foot luxury yacht once owned by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen and listed for $278 million was sold to a mystery buyer reports said.

The vessel named ""Octopus"" was purchased for an undisclosed price Bloomberg News reported. The mystery buyer was Scandinavian The Guardian reported.

SuperYacht Times first reported the sale saying: ""Her new owner intends to charter her for the first time since her launch offering guests the opportunity to join her on a two-year round the world tour beginning in January 2022 following a yard period this winter.""

Allen who died in October 2018 paid about $200 million for the Lürssen yacht. The boat was delivered in 2003. It had been listed at about $325 million in 2019.

The Octopus has 13 staterooms an observation lounge a movie theater and a recording studio according to Fraser Yachts which listed it for sale. Along with a diving dock and beach club it has a spa pool and gym.

The yacht became well known for both its amenities – it has two submarines – and for the parties thrown aboard. At the Cannes Film Festival Allen hosted yacht parties attended by rock legends and movies stars reportedly including Mick Jagger and Chloe Sevigny.

In 2015 the yacht's Cannes party guests included Leonardo DiCaprio Karlie Kloss and Natalie Portman The New York Post reported at the time. (Allen also partied at Cannes with his smaller 303-foot yacht Tatoosh.)

Yacht ownership was about more than pleasure-boating for Allen however. He also used Octopus as a research vessel often hunting wreckage of ships sunk during World War II.

Allen and a team of researchers in 2015 led an operation in the North Atlantic to recover the HMS Hood a battle-cruiser sunk in 1941. It was one of several such expeditions Allen led.

Bloomberg reported that 219 superyachts were sold in Q1 more than doubling from a year earlier.

According to a report published by Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) 80% of remaining on-premises workloads across the globe will be cloud candidates over the next five years. As companies continue to move these critical applications to the cloud they face the decision to continue using their existing vendor licenses or use cloud instances that include the third-party license in the cost. Customers who have significant investments in Microsoft licenses in their data centers can leverage those licenses on AWS to save costs if they choose the right license types.

The decision to migrate to cloud is often the beginning of a paradigm shift in a company’s cost and operations. As you are planning a cloud migration it is important to understand the value of License Mobility. The decision to purchase perpetual licenses as opposed to subscription licenses can have a significant impact on short-term and long-term costs and your ability to avoid lock-in from a single cloud provider. Take the time to understand your legacy software providers license options whether renewing for on premises or cloud usage and don’t assume a provider’s cloud is the best place to run their software.

In this blog we will share insights from AWS and ESG highlighting how the decision to choose perpetual Windows Server licenses over subscription licenses can impact your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) when you migrate to the cloud.

Perpetual vs. Subscription licenses?

Definitions:

Perpetual licenses – owned by you and cover the use of a license/version indefinitely

Subscription licenses – rented and the right to use the license expires if not renewed

The ability to bring and use existing licenses provides customers with the flexibility to rehost their applications in the cloud without making changes in code. It also reduces Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by eliminating the need to purchase license-included instances from cloud providers. We have seen that customers who bring their existing Windows Server and SQL Server licenses to AWS save up to 50% by re-using their licenses in AWS.

A great example is a leading financial services firm that decided to bring existing Windows Server licenses to AWS in November 2020 and saved $180000 per year in licensing costs reducing their TCO by 30%.

Licensing Considerations

Customers who purchase Windows Server licenses after October 1 2019 are unable to deploy those licenses in AWS (unless the license was purchased as a true-up to an Enterprise Agreement effective before October 1 2019). SQL Server licenses with active Software Assurance do not have such restrictions because the Microsoft licensing changes are applicable only for licenses without License Mobility.

The impact of Microsoft’s licensing changes differs between perpetual and subscription Windows Server licenses as follows.

Perpetual Windows Server licenses remain eligible for deployment on AWS if these licenses were purchased before the cut-off date of October 1 2019 (or purchased as a true-up under an Enterprise Agreement effective before the cut-off date) as long as the version deployed was released before the cut-off date.

Subscription Windows Server licenses lose eligibility for deployment on AWS at subscription renewal or when customer signs an amendment with Microsoft stating they are giving up perpetual license rights to move to a discounted subscription model.

A recent thought leadership paper by Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) in May 2021 highlights the importance of having flexible licensing options in the cloud. According to ESG customers can convert Windows Server subscription licenses purchased before October 1 2019 to perpetual licenses if they “buy-out” those licenses prior to subscription renewal date. “Buy-out” will allow customers to maintain their right to continue bringing Windows Server licenses on AWS. ESG suggests that customers who run Windows Server or SQL Server on AWS can also take advantage of a modernization path in the long run and move to AWS-native services. This can help you enjoy all benefits of AWS and further optimize your TCO.

In 2021 SeatGeek chose to containerize its Windows-based environments on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Dedicated Hosts enabled them to use eligible software licenses from Microsoft; as a result they get the flexibility and cost effectiveness of using their own licenses but the resiliency simplicity and elasticity of AWS. SeatGeek’s licensing use case is around Microsoft SQL Server and by using Dedicated Hosts the company avoided paying for both installations.

There is “nothing definitive” at present on bringing an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine to India says Kedar Upadhye  chief financial officer at Cipla  the nation’s top drug company. Moderna and the Indian government are working on sorting out indemnity issues around the supply of the US company’s mRNA vaccine but a commercial deal will take time Upadhye tells Teena Thacker . Edited Excerpts:It did well. During the pandemic it was the responsibility of the industry to do what one can to service. Parallelly all life-saving medicines for cardiology rheumatology oncology dermatology and urology were available. The whole industry came together during this time in terms of addressing the needs of the ecosystem. Many industry players have facilitated donations.There is an impact that we have seen. That’s good if the cases are low from the public health standpoint. We had seen that in the month of January February also when the demand and supplies had reached one-tenth of what we had supplied in September October November and it picked up again in March April May. Now it’s a downward trend. I think some of this is not predictable. One can assume that sales for the entire industry will be less than one-fourth. The cases were 400000 per day for the large part of the April and May months and now it’s also spread out to interiors where the hospital infrastructure may not be adequate. So I don’t know whether people are getting that.The existing arrangement is that we are a preferred partner. That’s why we have been selected to facilitate import of donated vaccine to India. Once we have that arrangement in place that will clear a lot of issues with respect to indemnity (vaccine donation) how the government is going to distribute. So that will be with respect to import of donated mRNA vaccines into India. Once that happens things open up for us to start any exploratory conversations either with them or with anybody else. As we keep saying there is nothing definitive that we have on mRNA vaccines. Let’s allow the arrangement to conclude and once that concludes we can think about the commercial part. There is nothing commercial even if we hypothetically file for a commercial pact either with Moderna or any other company they need to have capacity they need to have stocks etc. to bring it to India. It looks like it’s several weeks away. It is not clear whether it is going to happen or not but even if it happens it’s not like tomorrow morning we can have an mRNA vaccine into India.It is more with respect between both of them. We are not into it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NtaXJyb3IuY29tLnBoLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvYWxtb3N0LTQwMDAtc2VhZmFyZXJzLWdvdC1tb2Rlcm5hLWFuZC1qYW5zc2VuLXZhY2NpbmVzLWluLXZpbGxhci10ZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Almost 4000 seafarers got Moderna and Janssen vaccines in Villar Tent | BMPlus,"The partnership of MARINA or Maritime Industry Authority and the Office of Sen. Cynthia Villar has inoculated with Moderna and Janssen Covid-19 vaccines almost 4000 seafarers so they can go back to their work in the ship.

While ensuring their protection against Covid-19 and its many variants Villar said they can return to their ships to earn a living for their families.

Villar noted that Filipino seafarers belong to the hard-hit maritime industry by the coronavirus pandemic that crippled the world economy.

“The impact of this global health crisis resulted to the shutdown of ship operations and our seafarers losing their income” said Villar who related that based on the Department of Transportation data Filipino seafarers comprise 25% of the 1.5 million seafarers in the world.

But with vaccination this has given our Filipino seafarers whose lives have always been ‘one of sacrifice and hard work’ the hope that soon they can give anew their families a comfortable life by being back on board.

“We believe and hope that this vaccination will be their passport to restore their jobs” further stated Villar.

To date the Villar’s partnership with MARINA has givdn Moderna and Janssen vaccines as follows: 738 seamen last July 28 and 1202 last July 29. Also 1360 and 1689 seamen received their jabs respectively last August 2 and August 3.

The vaccinations of Filipino seafarers were done at the Villar Family-owned The Tent in Global City Las Pinas City.

Last June 1086 seafarers also got their Pfizer jabs during the MARINA vaccine rollout at The Tent.

Being a staunch advocate of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) Villar acceded to a partnership with MARINA who sought the assistance of the senator for the vaccination rollout of their seafarers.

MARINA Administrator retired VADM Robert Empedrad of the AFP thanked the senator and her daughter Las Pinas Rep. Camille Villar for championing the cause of Filipino seafarers.

Empedrad also noted they are a step closer towards ensuring the safety and health of our modern-day heroes as well as their families and co-workers through this collaboration effort with the Villars.

The senator guaranteed that she and her family are always ready to provide all forms of assistance to cushion the adverse effects of Covid-19 and ease the burdens of the-already suffering Filipinos.

She emphasized that Filipino seafarers who help powered the world’s shipping industry and keep the world moving should be recognized for their significant contributions to keep the country’s economy afloat through their remittances.

The senator has also been involved in the repatriation of our distressed OFWs who suffered abuses in the hands of their employers. Once in the country she provides them help to rebuild their lives",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjMxNDQxMC9tb3JlLWRvc2VzLWZseS1pbi10by1ib29zdC12YWNjaW5lLWNvZmZlcnPSAVVodHRwczovL3RyaWJ1bmUuY29tLnBrL3N0b3J5LzIzMTQ0MTAvbW9yZS1kb3Nlcy1mbHktaW4tdG8tYm9vc3QtdmFjY2luZS1jb2ZmZXJzP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More doses fly in to boost vaccine coffers,"64000 doses of Pfizer vaccine reach Islamabad; 16-year-old students to get Moderna shots

Pakistan received another batch of 64000 doses of Pfizer vaccine while the authorities allowed Moderna doses donated by the US government under the COVAX arrangements to be administered to the students up to 16 years of age seeking to go abroad for studies.

The government is boosting the national vaccine coffers as the country battled the fourth wave of coronavirus fuelled by a deadlier and fast spreading Delta variant of the virus which emerged in India earlier this year.

According to the health ministry officials 64000 doses of Pfizer vaccines reached Islamabad on Friday.

They added that the vaccine was purchased by the government. They added that the ministry had also allowed the Russian-made Sputnik vaccine at vaccine centres in Islamabad.

The officials said that Pakistani citizens over the age of 18 years could receive the Sputnik-V shot by visiting the three vaccination centres in the federal capital from Saturday (today). They added that the second shot of Sputnik would be administered after 21 days.

The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) which supervises the government’s unified effort against the Covid pandemic said on Friday that the students who wanted to go abroad for the studies would be administered Moderna vaccine.

Pakistan has received millions of doses of Moderna which were donated by the US government in recent weeks. The NCOC said in a Tweet that the vaccination would be administered to all the people above the 18 years of age.

“However the students aged 16-18 years who need to go abroad for study to universities requiring mandatory vaccination will be administered Moderna vaccine. The vaccination to such students would be administered after checking valid visa/university documents” the NCOC added.

Dr Faisal Sultan the special assistant to the prime minister on health also confirmed that children between the ages of 16 to 18 years were eligible to get the vaccine if they had to go overseas for education or other reasons.

The national vaccination campaign which kicked off in February is open to all citizens over the age of 18 years. In recent weeks the authorities have stepped the campaign administering more than 1 million jabs every day.

Dr Sultan said in a tweet that so far more than 30 million people have received the Covid jabs. He added that 10 million jabs had been administered in just 16 days which is eight times faster rate than the first 10 million jabs were administered.

“Over 1 Million COVID vaccine doses administered in Pakistan yesterday - highest nmbr so far. We’ve also crossed 30 million (cumulative) doses. Last 10 million doses took 16 days - 8x faster than what it took to administer first 10 million. Kudos to all who hv made this happn” he tweeted.

The government planned to vaccinate 70 million people by the end of this year. However out of 30 million people who had received the vaccines only 7 million were those having both shots. The number is 10% of the total vaccination target.

The vaccination campaign has been stepped up after the Covid fourth wave spread across the country. The NCOC said in its daily update of the disease that national tally of active cases reached close to 80000 for the first time since May 12.

The forum said that the national tally of active Covid-19 cases rose to 79992 on Friday as 4745 more people tested positive for the infection while 2095 people recovered from the disease during the last 24 hours. it added that the national positivity rate was 8.18%.

Among the active cases more than 4000 patients were admitted to 639 Covid-dedicated health facilities across the country.

The NCOC said that 4157 patients were in critical condition including 409 on ventilators. It added that 107 patients were brought to hospitals during the last 24 hours.

The update said that 67 patients of them 60 whom were under treatment in the hospitals including 27 on ventilators died on Thursday taking the national death toll to 23702. Most of the deaths 28 occurred in Sindh followed by 19 in Punjab.

The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) said on Friday that the fatalities in Sindh included 73 medics who died after contracting Covid. It confirmed that two doctors – one of them fully vaccinated against Covid-19 – succumbed to the disease in Karachi on Friday.

Dr Nisar Ali Shah former senior medico-legal officer at Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital and Dr Farzana Memon a gynecologist both from Naushehroferoze district had contracted the virus a few days ago according to Dr Qaiser Sajjad of the PMA.

According to the NCOC the national caseload of the disease rose to 1058405 since pandemic broke out in the country in February 2020. Since then the NCOC update said 954711 people have recovered from the disease so far.

Easy Cheese. The delicious — but not at all nutritious — snack of every party. The cheese spread might taste good piled on top of Ritz crackers pretzels or chips and crisps but is spray cheese actually made with real cheese and should there be a disclaimer on the bottle?

What Is It?

This snack is a highly processed product from Mondelez International. It was first sold by Nabisco and is also called aerosol cheese.

You can get flavors like Easy Cheese Cheddar Cheese snack Sharp Cheddar Cheddar 'n Bacon and American. Other varieties that no longer exist include Pimento French Onion Cheddar Blue Cheez Shrimp Cocktail Nacho and Pizza.

What's in It?

The Cheddar flavor includes whey canola oil milk protein concentrate cheddar cheese and milk making it actually an excellent source of calcium and protein with the whey protein concentrate. It also has less than 2 percent of sodium citrate sodium phosphate calcium phosphate salt lactic acid milkfat sodium alginate sorbic acid as a preservative sodium caseinate acetic acid color (annatto extract apocarotenal) enzymes and cheese culture.

Did you catch the possibly surprising inclusion on that list? Yes technically this snack has cheese in it! But it's obviously not the type you'd expect and you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who thinks this spreadable snack is real.

In fact Spoon University once broke down the ingredient list and came to a similar conclusion.

""What I realized from my search however isn't that the ingredients are super dangerous. Instead the concoction is just filled with a huge amount of unnatural processed and completely unfamiliar ingredients"" the author found.

So yes If you want to spread a bunch on tortilla chips and aren't worried about things like the total fat dietary fiber or carbohydrates involved or whether or not you're actually eating something real go nuts! Cholesterol and trans fat aren't really something to worry about when you want to snack on something tasty but don't be surprised if it doesn't exactly taste completely real.

Aermont's Léon Bressler

A private equity firm run by some of European real estate’s best-known investors has won the auction to buy a UK housebuilder for more than £700M.

Aermont Capital which was set up by veteran investor Léon Bressler is buying Keepmoat Britain’s seventh-largest housebuilder from Sun Capital and TDR Capital Sky News reported.

Traditional real estate investors are hot for residential developers right now. Aermont beat competition from other big names in property private equity to buy the company including Patron Capital Apollo Global Management and Terra Firma.

Last year Lone Star took private retirement home developer McCarty & Stone in a £600M deal.

Keepmoat specialises in affordable housing a particular niche of residential development that is in vogue among real estate investors: Blackstone has backed affordable housing provider Sage to the tune of more than £300M over the past few years.

Keepmoat took on too much debt in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis and ended up being owned by its main lender Lloyds Banking Group before being sold to Sun and TDR in 2014.

Aermont is best known for its investment in Pinewood Studios the famous film studio company on whose west London lots the James Bond franchise is filmed.

It took the company private for around £325M in 2016. Since then the value has increased to more than £1B. The company signed long leases with Disney and Netflix which will rent space at Pinewood Studios.

Bressler is the French executive who grew Unibail-Rodamco into Europe’s biggest property company before leaving in 2007 to set up Aermont. The senior management team also comprises former Norges Bank director Paul Golding and former Morgan Stanley director Vincent Rouget.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZW5kbGVhc2UuY29tL3VzL21lZGlhLWNlbnRlci9tZWRpYS1yZWxlYXNlcy9sZW5kbGVhc2UtZ3Jvd3MtaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1mdW5kLXRocm91Z2gtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tb2YtaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1wb3J0Zm9saW8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lendlease grows industrial fund through acquisition of industrial portfolio,"1 Johnson Road Campbelltown NSW – APPF Industrial’s first acquisition in South West Sydney.

Where you earn your MBA matters. However the prestige of a business school isn’t necessarily a one-size-fits-all approach especially when it comes to starting salary and landing jobs in top industry employers.

In a new study GradReports combed through Linkedin profiles to calculate which business schools had the highest total number of alumni working in the top firms for Consulting Finance and Technology.

Here is GradReports’ findings…

CONSULTING

The Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College ranked first for number of MBA alumni who landed jobs at leading consulting firms which GradReports defines as McKinsey & Company Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Bain & Company Deloitte PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) EY Booz Allen Hamilton and Accenture. Nearly 5% of Tuck alumni were employed in these top consulting firms. Overall Bain & Company and McKinsey & Company were the top employers for Tuck MBA grads.

The Goizueta Business School at Emory University ranked second best for consulting. 4.8% of Emory MBA alumni went on to work at leading consulting firms. EY Deloitte and PwC ranked among the top consulting employers for Goizueta alumni.

INVESTMENT BANKING

If you’re hoping to land a job at Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan it helps to get an MBA from either New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business or Columbia Business School.

New York University's Stern School had the highest number of alumni working at these top investment banks at 2.49%. In total a whopping 434 Stern MBA grads landed jobs at Morgan Stanley which stands as the number one investment banking employer for the top five MBA feeder programs.

Columbia Business School came in second with 1.99% of MBA grads working at top investment banking firms with 312 alumni at Morgan Stanley.

TECHNOLOGY

The Michael G. Foster School of Business at the University of Washington holds the highest number of alumni employed at top tech companies. These companies are defined as Google Amazon Microsoft Apple and Facebook by GradReports and account for 17.3% of Tech hires from Foster. Despite having fewer grads landing jobs in consulting or banking the Foster School of Business is a popular choice for tech recruiters. Top tech employers for Foster MBA grads include Amazon and Microsoft both of which are headquartered in Washington.

Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business came in second for Tech with 7.28% of Leavey MBA grads landing jobs at top tech companies. Google is the top employer for Leavey MBAs with 111 alumni employed. The Leavey School of Business despite ranking lower in prestige had more alumni employed at top tech companies than the nearby Haas School of Business at the University of California-Berkeley where 6.85% of alumni landed jobs at top tech companies.

Overall these findings highlight a few important insights. For one having a specific career goal prior to attending a B-school may help exponentially. MBA programs such as the Foster School of Business and the Leavey School of Business are top recruiting spots for tech companies. Not surprisingly New York-based schools such as Stern and Columbia still perform the best for careers in investment banking.

Mural Affirming “Black is Beautiful”,"Last Updated on August 8 2021 by BVN

Breanna Reeves |

In November 2019 Rochelle Kanatzar posted on Facebook expressing sadness for her nine-year-old daughter who experienced a jarring racial encounter at school that brought her daughter to tears.

“I shared my daughter’s experience because I wanted to show everyone that yeah in fact we do have [racism] here. And my nine-year-old daughter has experienced it. And she went to school one way and came back a little bit different because of that experience” Rochelle said.

After sharing her daughter’s encounter Erin Maroufkhani reached out to Rochelle to discuss how they could take action and show Edison Rose Rochelle’s daughter and the community of Riverside that “Black is beautiful.”

Together Rochelle Erin and Shea Ellis organized the idea for the RISE! mural a mosaic depiction of thirty plus African American portraits who have contributed to the Black community throughout history. The mural was unveiled in Riverside on July 21 and is one of the largest public art installations in the city.

The mural’s name is inspired by Maya Angelou’s celebrated and widely respected “Still I Rise” poem Edison Rose’s favorite poem. The death of George Floyd Edison’s experience and the poem served as the focal points for the mural’s design and inspiration. During the ceremony Edison Rose read the poem before the mural was revealed.

“Tonight we’re here to unveil a magnificent piece of art that both honors and supports another step of diversity inclusion and education for our community” Shea said in her welcome speech during the ceremony.

For Shea her contribution to the mural was done “as a personal acknowledgement of what was happening in the world.” The mural includes portraits of Breonna Taylor George Floyd Ahmaud Arbery and Elijah McCain in recognition of the Black lives taken in 2020.

“And for us our focal point was George Floyd because we felt that in his tragic death it was the catalyst for the world to kind of open their eyes to the injustices that African American people face and that Black lives do in fact matter” Rochelle said.

The mosaic mural is the artistic production of 14 artists and took a little over a year to plan design and complete. Due to the pandemic artists were unable to collaborate in person so instead they received a box of mosaic materials and relied on Youtube tutorials to complete their portraits. The mural was supported by the city of Riverside who provided funding for the mural and by a local tile company who donated mosaic materials.

One of the contributing artists is Adeola Davies-Aiyeloja who created mosaic portraits of Maya Angelou Rosa Parks and Amanda Gorman. Adeola’s first portrait was Maya Angelou because a lot of Angelou’s poems resonate with her.

“[I’m)] also so proud to have something that represents so many of the African Americans in the city of Riverside. I can’t describe the feeling. It’s overwhelming just the feeling” Adeola said. “What I hope that they will take away from it is the openness and really to look at the different portraits and look at the contributions.”

Adeola was surprised and excited to see her own family in the crowd during the unveiling. Her nephew came and brought his children to see the mural and the different figures portrayed in the art. She hopes that parents of all ethnicities will bring their children to see the mural and teach them that Black history is American history.

“It’s really a springboard for them to be able to open their kids’ eyes and say ‘These are people that made history these are people that contributed to history and the African American community but also in the American community because they are Americans. And we should look at everybody’s contributions’” Adeola explained.

Alongside the mural a plaque will be placed which will contain a QR code that will allow passersby to scan the code and learn more information about the people in the mural by providing resources videos and reading materials. Rochelle also hopes that teachers will be able to use the mural as a way to develop curriculum around Black history.

“We’re excited about the aspect of the mural being interactive. We encourage and want people who pass by to touch and feel the mural in its uniqueness. Each of us are unique tiles in of itself” Rochelle said. “And when we’re put together and we come together look how much more beautiful we are and so we hope that be the takeaway from individuals who engage in the mural that they see just how amazing and beautiful Black is.”

The mural can be viewed on the corner of Market Street and 9th Street in Downtown Riverside.

July 28 to August 1

Review by Robin Strapp

Community Theatre is alive and thriving with the return of the Boxford Masques production of Bellerophon.

It’s been 21 years since the Masques were first revived on Hoar Hill.

Boxford Masques Jane Minchin terrifies as Medussa pic Kit Morris

Award winning writer Geraldine McCaughrean’s epic tale follows the discovery of a Roman Mosaic at Mud Hole near the now recreation ground in Boxford where a tented “village” has been constructed surrounding the large covered performance stage. This ambitious production has brought together the small community of local actors from the very young to the more senior residents. The talented company have embraced this community theatre project with enthusiasm and relish.

The versatile cast have the opportunity to unveil their personal skills with the on stage actor/musicians playing a variety of instruments. Mia Pitts as Athena skilfully plays the accordion. The play begins with Hera (Annabel Bailey) and a family picnic with the attentive butler Tails (Steve Wilson) and Charlotte Peake (Katy Sigrist) and her husband Harold (Dave Stephens) who has also written the vibrant music discover a mosaic fragment.

Worlds and time begin to collide as the mystical oracle Delphi an exuberant performance by Lizzie Lewis offers the Peake’s a guided tour. We are transported to ancient Greece and the palace of Iobates (Jane Minchin) who also plays Medusa with brio.

The characters from the mosaic come to life including the flesh loving Furies - Tizzie (Sarah Godwin) Meg (Nicky Pitts) and Alice (Lucy Simpson). The robotic Telemons - Emily Beck Rose Godwin and Evie Beck - were convincing and the house spirits the Lares were a delightful chorus of little ones.

Our hero Bellerophon an imposing performance from Dylan Morris is tasked to kill the horrific monster Chimera. He meets Sander the horse master strongly played by Louie Morris and his fiancée the Princess Philonoe (Ella Hickman) who also cleverly choreographed the show. So the quest begins and our adventure takes us to battles with the Chimera with the winged horse Pegasus with Bellerophon aboard and a visit to the underworld via the river Styx. It’s a whirlwind journey of suspense magic and total commitment from all the large ensemble cast – too many to mention individually. Thankfully Delphi ensures that the time travellers all return home safely.

Musical director Trevor Defford leads the small band with confidence and the cast sing with gusto and the dance routines are inventive. Special mention to Polly Thomson and Emma Moscow’s design and Ian Fleming’s dramatic lighting and sound. Ade Morris assuredly directs and should be exceedingly proud of his company who obviously enjoyed the whole storytelling experience as did the audience.

This is community theatre at its very best and we were even gifted by a rainbow so perhaps the gods where also approving. Bravo!

There was no surprise associated with L3Harris being named as the contractor to build the P25 SLERS which is known as SLERS-2—the Florida Legislature made the award to L3Harris as part of budget process and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the budget into law. But L3Harris CEO Chris Kubasik was the first to publicly state the terms of the 15-year $450 million deal which was announced during the company’s quarterly earnings call on Tuesday.

Florida’s elected leaders took the unusual step of preempting on ongoing second SLERS-2 procurement with the budgetary award just weeks before the existing SLERS contract with L3Harris was about to expire. A second SLERS-2 procurement was initiated after the vendor selected in the initial SLERS-2 procurement—Motorola Solutions—could not reach a contract agreement with the state after submitting a winning bid of $687.8 million which was more than $300 million less than the bid from L3Harris at the time.

Many within the public-safety-communications arena have been monitoring Florida SLERS developments closely. In addition to the size of the contract sources throughout the industry have been intrigued to learn how the state of Florida would seek to realize its plans for a “next-generation system” that is designed to provide first responders interoperable access to both P25 LMR and LTE-based FirstNet technologies.

According to the new agreement with the Florida Department of Management Services (DMS) L3Harris will operate and maintain the statewide system and will be paid $19 million annually—a figure similar to the payments it has received for years as the SLERS incumbent—for 15 years for a total of $285 million. L3Harris also will be paid $111 million to upgrade the 197 SLERS sites from aging EDACS-EA to P25 technology.

In addition to the $396 million contract for the LMR network the state of Florida will pay L3Harris $54 million for new portable and mobile radios that state officials intend to be operational in the field by June 30 next year.

These new devices will be capable of operating on both the EDACS-EA and P25 networks—as well as on the FirstNet system—as part of the interoperability vision for SLERS-2.

“SLERS-2 shall support interoperability between SLERS-2 and other radio systems used throughout the state for mutual-aid and interoperable communications” according to the contract. “SLERS-2 shall be a standards-based communications system allowing for interoperability between P25 Compliance Assessment Program (CAP) compliant radios.

“SLERS-2 shall be equipped and licensed with Inter-RF Subsystem Interface (ISSI) equipment providing interoperability with other P25 systems that meets P-25 (ISSI) standards. SLERS-2 shall support equipment and services for the Interoperability Subsystem.”

One unique aspect of SLERS-2 is the requirement that it support interoperable communications with FirstNet the nationwide public-safety broadband network being built by AT&T. To make this vision a reality the L3Harris contract stipulates that SLERS-2 will have a Smartphone/Broadband Device Integration (SPBBI) Subsystem that will “integrate voice and data between SLERS-2 broadband devices and/or smartphone applications and SLERS-2 systems and subsystems.”

The contract outlines the push-to-talk capabilities that the SPBBI must enable.

“The SPBBI Subsystem shall provide Push-to-Talk (PTT) communications operating over private and public Wi-Fi networks 3G/4G/5G carrier networks including but not limited to FirstNet’s LTE network. The SPBBI Subsystem must support the following:

“1. Carrier integrated PTT over cellular (PTToC)

“2. Over-the-top PTToC operation on carrier networks

“3. PTT communications on private and public Wi-Fi and other broadband networks (PTToBB)

“4. Contractor [L3Harris] will not be held responsible for performance of the cellular network.”

L3Harris also must supply a computer-aided-dispatch (CAD) interface service that will support communications with a new CAD system that is expected to be deployed beginning in 2023 according to the contract.

Signed on June 30—the final day of the initial SLERS contract between the state of Florida and L3Harris—and effective on July 1 the new SLERS-2 contract ensured that Florida first responders maintained mission-critical voice communications without disruption a DMS spokesperson confirmed.

Looking ahead the contract outlines that L3Harris will begin by installing VIDA Premier Cores in the Orlandoo and Jacksonville areas upgrading existing P25 Aircraft and Public Safety Interoperable Communications (PSIC) locations from P25 Phase 1 to P25 Phase 2 and replacing microwave links in the southeastern and east-central parts of the state.

After that L3 Harris is expected to implement phased upgrades from the aging EDACS-EA technology—SLERS is the last network in the world to use the proprietary protocol—to P25 Phase 2 on a region-by-region basis.

“The goal of the P25 upgrade plan is to keep the EDACS-EA system operational while users in each region are transitioned to the upgraded P25 system within that region” the contract states. “During the transition a link will be established via the VIDA IP Gateway to allow communications between users of both SLERS-2 and the EDACS-EA system.

“At the completion of each region cutover to the upgraded P25 system will take place. Existing SLERS EDACS-EA equipment will remain in place and offline during this period for fallback capability.”

P25 equipment first will be “installed commissioned and P25 Verification Test Procedures performed at all sites” in the Miami and Lake Worth regions according to the contract. This process will be repeated sequentially in the Orlando and Jacksonville region the Tampa and Ft. Myers region and then the Tallahassee and Pensacola region.

New equipment—notably Symphony consoles from L3Harris—also will be deployed in regional dispatch centers according to the contract.

“Work in the dispatch centers located in each region is essential for a successful cutover” the contract states. “Consoles will be replaced on a one-for-one basis. Connectivity between the new console and the legacy EDACS-EA SLERS equipment will be maintained through the VIDA IP Gateway. Contractor and the State will have a dispatch workshop to review the capabilities of the new Symphony console and develop a standard/default Symphony console screen layout.

“Once the above upgrade work is completed users can be successfully cutover to the upgraded SLERS-2 radio system on a region-by-region basis.”

After the transition to P25 Phase 2 technology is completed use of the EDACS-EA technology will be discontinued according to the contract.

Scheduled target dates for completing each phase of the P25 Phase 2 rollout are not publicly available yet as the publicly available contract is heavily redacted in sections where that information likely exists.

However contract language associated with the conveyance of SLERS towers from L3Harris to the state of Florida may provide some indication about the scheduled timing for completion of the overall project. According to the contract the towers would be conveyed within 60 days of July 1 2026 or of the final acceptance of the SLER-2 upgrade whichever is earlier.

This conveyance language in the contract should address a longtime concern about access to the towers which was cited as one of the reasons that Motorola Solutions was unable to reach a contract agreement with the DMS in late 2019.

“The Contractor [L3Harris] shall convey all Conveyed Towers along with the Communications System and SLERS-2 to the Department in their “as is” condition free and clear of all liens and encumbrances at no cost to the Department” the new contract states.

In addition contract language indicates potential changes in the makeup of the SLERS tower portfolio noting that DMS and L3Harris “will evaluate ways to reduce the number of third-party leased towers used in the Communications System including without limitation opportunities to use towers owned by state agencies as well as opportunities to construct new towers on state-owned real property.

“The objective will be to develop a mutually agreed upon amendment to this contract for the construction or use of a new tower(s) (and end a third-party tower lease) including without limitation the project requirements project schedule and potential compensation for the contractor [L3Harris].”

This new contract with L3Harris was established under a budget framework approved by the Florida Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Budget language called for DMS to sign a 15-year contract with L3Harris to maintain the existing EDACS EA network—the last one in the world to use this technology—and build a new P25 system as well as earmarking $55 million to be spent on the new EDAC/P25 radios.

The reason the legislative action for a P25 upgrade to SLERS was deemed necessary by many is that Motorola Solutions did not agree to a contract with the state after being selected in the procurement phase and surviving a lengthy protest from L3Harris. In January 2020 DMS announced that it ended talks with Motorola Solutions after the LMR giant declined to sign a contract based on the terms of its bid according to a state official.

Florida lawmakers awarded the no-bid contract to L3Harris—referenced as “the entity that was operating the statewide radio communications system”—at the end of April during the final week of this year’s legislative session. Legislators took the unusual measure while citing the need for “emergency action” as the existing SLERS contract with L3Harris was due to expire on June 30.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But what may feel like a lifetime in one’s career has turned out to be a diversified journey in real estate for Eileen.

At the time of studying towards her Human Geography and Maths degree there were no recognized real estate or property-related qualifications and her studies led her down the path to an exciting career as a property professional.

Having initially worked in various roles within the IPD Group in London the company was later bought out by MSCI which went from being a UK-owned company to a US investment company and with the management change new ownership broadened the brand from real estate to investment.

However most women are often unrepresented in the corporate environment and particularly so in real estate where top tier management and exco tends to be male dominated.

Eileen believes that women can overcome this but they often sell themselves short with the belief that they are not capable to take on senior roles.

“I do not believe that women do not have equal opportunity – opportunities are available through education and all the other resources we require but we do not take those opportunities because we tend to stand back believing that we cannot manage it all.”

“The reality is that we can – it is just difficult sometimes when we have to split ourselves into one million pieces at times but these come in ebbs and flows – and they are manageable if we have the support surrounding us”.

Eileen and her team work with local partners in South Africa like the Women’s Property Network to assist and support women into more senior roles through MSCI’s global ‘Women’s Leadership Forum’ initiative.

“I believe that women tend to work very hard and if they can build the relationships from early on they can leverage off these throughout their careers – something that I underestimated when I was younger. I did not know how important relationship building was within the industry not only within my own company but across other companies too”.

‘Do not underestimate this and do not be shy to leverage off these relationships because becoming a successful property professional is not just about hard work or what you are doing – you also need to move forward with other people and leverage off what they are doing. Trying to do it on your own will not work. Take these opportunities and use them”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vbW9kZWwtcG9ydGZvbGlvLWNoYW5uZWwvZXRoZXJldW0tYS1kZWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1vZi1jcnlwdG8tc3VwcGx5L9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vbW9kZWwtcG9ydGZvbGlvLWNoYW5uZWwvZXRoZXJldW0tYS1kZWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1vZi1jcnlwdG8tc3VwcGx5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ethereum: A Deconstruction of Crypto Supply,"By Blake Heimann

One of the well-known differences between bitcoin and ether is the fact that ether does not have an explicit cap on supply while the number of bitcoins in circulation will never exceed 21 million. This supply limit attributes bitcoin its current primary investment case due to its perceived store of value. This is one of the few conclusions that has reached some level of consensus in the investment community given the nascence of crypto assets. So what does this mean for those that do not have a supply cap? In this blog post we will dive into the issuance of ether the second-largest crypto asset by market cap and why some upcoming changes to its issuance mechanism may support the case for it as not only a store of value but also a deflationary asset.

Reminder: Bitcoin’s Issuance Mechanism

The issuance mechanism for bitcoin follows a process of minting brand-new bitcoin as incentive for miners to verify transactions and secure the blockchain. This freshly minted bitcoin is referred to as the block subsidy and declines over time halving in value roughly every four years1. The total outstanding supply will eventually reach 21 million and stop growing.

Once the full supply is in circulation the incentives for securing the blockchain are fully supported by transaction fees paid to the miners by those transacting on the network rather than newly minted bitcoin. These transaction fees exist today serving as an incentive paid by the transactor to the miner for higher priority in writing the transaction to the block.2 In traditional finance speak these fees serve as a means for faster execution. As the network matures these fees should reach an equilibrium between serving as the sole incentive for miners to secure the network and network participants paying fees to transact on the network efficiently.

Ether’s Issuance Mechanism: An Evolving System

Currently the issuance mechanism for ether loosely imitates that of bitcoin but does not follow the halving schedule. Right now every time a block on the Ethereum network is mined two ethers are minted and gifted to the miner creating new supply of ether. Like bitcoin these subsidies have been reduced over time based upon the total number of blocks mined on the blockchain first starting at five ethers for the first 4.4 million blocks then three for the following 2.9 million and now two ethers3. These changes in block subsidy as well as other improvements to the network protocol are implemented via Ethereum Improvement Proposals or EIPs.

EIPs are proposed changes to the Ethereum code that are reviewed by the community of users developers and validators via a lifecycle of technical reviews research and discussion.4 With a focus on maintaining the sanctity of the network EIPs are approved and implemented alongside current versions of the code in network upgrades. Network participants may operate on different versions of the network but may be forced to choose between two versions when upgrades are incompatible across versions. These events are well broadcasted and documented prior to implementation and network participants may choose to operate on either version but are expected to gravitate toward the “better” of the two which will presumably have more users and serve the majority of network participants. In this way the “best” version of Ethereum prevails.

In addition to the block subsidy the miner receives a fee paid by the party making the transaction called gas5. This gas serves the same purpose as the fee described for bitcoin but it will come to play a greater role in the coming months. Approximately 6500 blocks are mined per day on the Ethereum network6 which would therefore result in an additional supply of 13000 ethers per day or an annual issuance rate of approximately 4%. With no explicit supply cap and issuance rates as such those who are skeptics of ether’s store of value are rightly justified. But with newly proposed changes to the issuance mechanism for the near future the narrative around the supply-side economics may change drastically.

Ether Issuance and Supply

Upcoming Changes: EIP 1559 and Proof of Stake

Now that we’ve touched on the current supply mechanism we need to address changes to the supply mechanism that are scheduled to occur in Ethereum upgrades in the near future. The first of these is an update called the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 15597 or EIP 1559 and the second of these is the transition to proof of stake8 from proof of work9. These changes in the Ethereum protocol arguably have reductive effects on the circulating supply of ether in the network2.

The first major change EIP 1559 is scheduled to be effective later this week; it has been in the works since April 2019 first proposed by the creator of Ethereum himself Vitalik Buterin. It consists of a change to the protocol regarding the gas that we mentioned above. After the update this gas will no longer be paid in full to the miners. Rather a portion of this gas will be “burned”—i.e. destroyed. This burned gas will be predetermined as the “market rate” of the transaction fee based on current congestion in the network among those transacting seeking to write changes in ownership to the ledger. This base rate will be burned and any additional fees on top (the tip) will be passed on directly to the miner10. From the transactor’s purview this “tip” will be for the purpose of receiving expedited transactions. The miner will still receive their freshly minted two ethers in addition to this “tip.”

The second major change replaces the proof of work consensus mechanism with proof of stake which is currently live in ETH 2.011 and is expected to replace the legacy ETH blockchain in late 2021 or early 202212. The proof of work mechanism is currently in place for ETH 1.0 and many competing crypto assets including bitcoin. This consensus mechanism is what maintains the integrity of the blockchain (and its transactions) via miners solving cryptographic hash functions to “seal” the block after validating the constituent transactions.9 Solving these hash functions requires significant computing power and electricity which is the source of debate around the overall sustainability of the mining required to secure a crypto asset network.

Proof of stake would take the place of this as the consensus mechanism requiring miners (henceforth called validators) to stake (or lock up) 32 ethers to begin processing transactions on the network.8 Rather than requiring the solving of a puzzle the validators can secure the network free of these computation-intensive efforts. The 32 ethers staked serve as a form of collateral that the validator loses if they validate a “bad” or fraudulent block2. It is burned and this results in a reduction of supply just like the base rate for gas referred to earlier. In return for performing validation to secure the network the validator still receives their freshly minted ether and transaction fees (any gas greater than the base rate) but the amount of ether issued to the validator changes based upon the aggregate amount of ether staked13. This reward is determined programmatically to entice more validators when staking is low and to refrain from doing so when there is a lot of ether staked and plenty of validators. The implications of this are that the network’s issuance fluctuates to yield an optimal level of security while issuing the least amount of new ether an equilibrium that is forecasted to result in a fraction of the current annual rate of issuance.

Validator Economics and Issuance

Putting It All Together: A Potential Deflationary Asset

So what does this mean for overall ether supply? We know that burning gas will reduce supply by destroying ether staking will reduce the amount of circulating supply by locking up ether as a form of collateral and the annual issuance of new ether rewarded to validators is forecasted to decrease significantly below current rates. Therefore combining these three factors the logical expectation would be a reduced rate of supply growth compared to the current Ethereum protocol. This has been referred to as Ethereum’s triple halving. Barring any turn of events that would prevent these updates from taking place some argue the combination of these changes will have such a strong effect that it will net out the minting of any new ether2—reaching a state at which supply is continually decreasing attributing to ether deflationary asset status.

London CNN Business —

When investors purchase a stock what they’re doing is buying a percentage of the company. Right?

Wrong! At least when it comes to many of the Chinese companies listed on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.

That’s because Chinese companies use a structure called a variable interest entity or VIE in order to raise money from foreign investors.

What’s a VIE? The structure uses two entities. The first is a shell company based somewhere outside China usually the Cayman Islands. The second is a Chinese company that holds the licenses needed to do business in the country. The two entities are connected via a series of contracts.

When foreign investors buy shares in a company that uses a VIE they’re purchasing stock in the foreign shell company — not the business in China.

For example when US investors buy shares in Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi which went public in June on the New York Stock Exchange what they’re actually doing is buying stock in a Cayman Islands company called Didi Global.

Didi Global doesn’t own the business in China that connects riders to drivers. But it does have contracts in place that entitle its shareholders to the economic benefits produced by that business.

The upshot: When Americans fire up their trading app and buy shares in Didi they are not getting a direct equity stake in the Chinese company. This arrangement is explained in Didi’s prospectus but not everyone is aware. Alibaba Pinduoduo and JD.com also use VIEs to name a few.

Why use a VIE?

Chinese firms have been using the structure for decades because foreign investors are not really allowed to own stakes in local firms in industries including tech. Still Chinese companies want to raise money abroad.

Creating an offshore holding company that goes public helps Chinese companies get around those rules. Wall Street and US regulators have long been cool with the arrangement which gives American investors easy exposure to dynamic companies that are powering the world’s second largest economy.

But there are huge risks. First it’s not clear that the contracts that entitle foreign investors to the economic benefits produced by Chinese companies are enforceable. It’s also not clear whether VIEs are legal under Chinese law.

Here’s what Didi says about the arrangement: Didi says in its prospectus that its legal counsel believes that its VIE “is not in violation of mandatory provisions of applicable PRC [Chinese] laws” and that its contracts are “valid and binding.”

But it also included a warning to potential investors.

“We have been further advised by our PRC legal counsel that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future PRC laws and regulations” Didi cautioned. “The PRC government may ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel.”

Think about the problem this way: Chinese companies are essentially telling Beijing that they are 100% owned by Chinese citizens. Meanwhile the same companies are telling foreign shareholders that they’re the real owners.

After decades of both Chinese and US regulators taking a relaxed approach there are signs that both are becoming uncomfortable with VIEs.

Hello regulators: US Securities and Exchange Commission boss Gary Gensler announced new disclosure rules on July 30 targeting VIEs saying Chinese companies need to be clearer with US investors about the risks.

“I worry that average investors may not realize that they hold stock in a shell company rather than a China-based operating company” he said.

One of the new SEC provisions will require Chinese companies to disclose “whether the operating company and the issuer when applicable received or were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on US exchanges.”

That provision appears to be aimed at Didi. Just days after its massive IPO Chinese regulators targeted the company with a cybersecurity investigation after it reportedly went ahead with the listing despite Beijing’s objections.

“I believe these changes will enhance the overall quality of disclosure in registration statements of offshore issuers that have affiliations with China-based operating companies” Gensler said.

China is also taking a closer look at foreign listings. The powerful Cyberspace Administration of China proposed in July that any company with data on more than 1 million users must seek the agency’s approval before listing its shares overseas.

Investors beware.

Biden’s electric vehicle sales goal won’t be too hard to reach

President Joe Biden announced an agreement last week that aims to push the US auto industry to sell more electric vehicles. The goals include a “shared aspiration” that 40% to 50% of vehicles sold in the US will be electric plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered.

This will be a challenge some experts say — but it isn’t really as hard as it might seem reports my colleague Peter Valdes-Dapena.

Battery-powered vehicle sales including both all-electric and plug-in hybrids are expected to make up just 4.3% of all vehicles sold in the US this year according to IHS Markit.

General Motors (GM) said months ago it hopes to sell only zero-emission vehicles including electric and hydrogen-powered by 2035. It could be expected then that at least 40% of its vehicle sales should be emissions-free by 2030. Stellantis the company that owns the Dodge Chrysler and Jeep brands also recently said it planned for 40% of its US sales to be either electric or plug-in hybrid by the end of 2025 well ahead of the goal set by the Biden administration. Ford has also already announced that 40% of the vehicles it sells globally will be electric by 2030.

Automakers have been setting these goals for a number of reasons. Regulations are already changing in other parts of the world such as in Europe where there are plans to ban internal combustion vehicles by 2035. Consumer tastes are also changing – as the increasing popularity of Tesla (TSLA) has shown said Jessica Caldwell an industry analyst with Edmunds.

“No one really wants to be seen as the holdout or the dinosaur the one that’s fighting this progress” she said.

The traditionally conservative legal industry is undergoing changes.

Insider surveyed dozens of industry experts about people making changes in the industry.

From AI-fueled legal-research companies to legal-ops veterans here are ten innovators in law.

Lawyers can be cynical when it comes to innovation.

But things are changing. Between the pandemic regulatory changes intense competition for talented lawyers and client pressure on law firms to cut costs speed up work and diversify their ranks everything is being rethought.

Law firms in recent years have developed new products in-house to help clients revise thousands of contracts in one go complete nondisclosure agreements faster and conduct routine corporate transactions with the assistance of automation.

And legal tech has had a surge of investor interest. Private-equity firms pumped more than $3.6 billion into legal-technology companies in the first quarter of 2021 according to the market-intelligence platform Bodhala. LegalZoom and Intapp together raised nearly $1 billion in initial public offerings this year.

Insider interviewed dozens of legal-industry consultants investors lawyers and law-firm staff about people they thought were making real changes in the industry. These are some of the names that came up most often but this isn't an exhaustive list.

Subscribers can read the full list here:

Brenton is an early figure in the rise of ""legal operations"" or legal ops a growing area of the industry in which lawyers apply business practices to their work to enable them to deliver legal services more efficiently.

""She put legal ops on the map"" Killer Whale Strategies' Abramowitz said.

A former litigator Brenton went in-house at Sun Microsystems and Oracle before joining NetApp a cloud-data-management company in 2010. During her 11-year tenure Brenton helped automate the way NetApp handled contracts saving the company's legal team thousands of hours a year Brenton told Insider.

In 2016 Brenton also founded the Corporate Legal Operations Consortium which has since grown into one of the largest networks of legal-ops professionals across the industry. Bobbi Basile who runs the legal-transformation and -innovation practice at HBR Consulting said CLOC has been one of the main ways corporate law departments influence the legal industry.

Three and a half stars

A former tennis player who was once ranked No. 1 in America talks about being so overwhelmed by anxiety that minutes before a 2012 U.S. Open match against Roger Federer he withdrew.

We follow the journey of a legendary American athlete who shattered a world record in winning Olympic gold — but always felt like a fraud.

An NBA champion speaks of his role in the most infamous brawl in league history and how he struggled with mental health issues including severe depression throughout his career.

The five-part sports documentary series “Untold” premieres Tuesday on Netflix. Given the international headlines about Simone Biles’ brave and admirable decision to withdraw from a number of events at the Tokyo Olympic Games citing mental health issues the timing couldn’t be better. This is a collection of five stand-alone 80-minute documentaries — and in four of those films we see world-class athletes demonstrating remarkable strength and character as they speak about their various off-court off-field challenges from depression and anxiety to surviving a horrifically abusive relationship.

Like the best of ESPN’s “30 for 30” docs the “Untold” series is framed in the world of sports but goes far beyond that to tell the stories of some greatly talented and widely celebrated athletes who are also as flawed and vulnerable as the rest of us. The first indication of that is the opening title sequence an elegantly staged passage set to the tune of “Your Sweet Love” by Lee Hazlewood with the lyrics: “Stranger’s arms reach out to me cause they know I’m so lonely . . . ” Yep we’re not going to be hearing “Chelsea Dagger” or “Sweet Caroline” in this series.

The premiere episode is titled “Malice at the Palace” and takes us back to the dark night of Friday Nov. 19 2004 when the Pacers and Pistons squared off at The Palace in Auburn Hills Michigan and all hell broke loose when a tussle on the court led to Ron Artest laying on the scorer’s table — at which point a fan threw a plastic cup filled with a drink at Artest who responded by going into the stands where he was eventually joined by a number of other players. It was pure madness and there was plenty of blame to go around — but “Malice at the Palace” does a journalistically sound job of putting events in perspective with the help of never-before-seen security footage. And whereas Artest (later known as Metta World Peace) Jermaine O’Neal Reggie Miller Stephen Jackson and Ben Wallace all lament how things turned out some of the idiot fans who were the true instigators of the melee never seem to take any kind of responsibility.

Arguably the most compelling entry in the series is “Breaking Point” (premiering Sept. 7) which tells the story of Mardy Fish who was close friends with Andy Roddick when they were rising through the tennis ranks as teenagers (Fish even lived with Roddick’s family for a year). But while Roddick was ascending to the No. 1 ranking in the world Fish labored on the fringes of the pro circuit usually ranked somewhere in the 100s.

Some 10 years into his career Fish reinvented himself losing more than 20 pounds changing his diet habits and suddenly becoming McEnroe-intense on the court. But at the 2012 U.S. Open in the middle of a match Fish had a major panic/anxiety attack. “All of a sudden out of nowhere just boom” recounts Fish. “This is the first time it had happened on the court. The whole weight of the stress flooding in . . . I was all of a sudden all alone.” Fish managed to finish the match. But just moments before Fish’s quarterfinal matchup against Federer he bowed out. The good news is with the help of a support system including his family and mental health professionals and his good friend Roddick Fish is in a better place these days — though he acknowledges his issues are with him for life.

We all know Caitlyn Jenner’s story but the “Untold” entry on Jenner’s life and career (on Aug. 24) is still a valuable and insightful biopic with a treasure trove of highlight-reel and home video footage of a young unknown Bruce Jenner training for the 1976 Olympic Games followed by an extensive look at Jenner’s journey to transition. Another chapter titled “Deal With the Devil” (Aug. 17) tells the story of boxer Christy Martin who in the 1990s became the most famous female fighter in the world appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated and even getting a spot on the undercard of a Mike Tyson bout. All that time though Martin was in an abusive relationship with her husband and trainer Jim Martin a loathsome monster who is serving extensive prison time for stabbing and shooting Christy in 2010. While Jim Martin rots in a Florida correctional facility Christy now has a wife and trains fighters. She talks about having had the same dream of Jim chasing her for nine years but says “I’m getting better . . . I’m gonna be OK. I AM OK.”

The most entertaining chapter in the series is “Crimes and Penalties” (Aug. 31) which tells the story of the Danbury Trashers a minor-league expansion franchise owned by one Jimmy Galante who was in the waste management business and was connected to the Genovese crime family. When Galante paid the $500000 franchise fee to the United Hockey League he named his 17-year-old son A.J. as president and general manager. (Yes Jimmy’s son is named A.J. just like Tony’s son in “The Sopranos.”) Even though A.J. would be the first to admit he was a punk the kid actually had a talent for assembling a collection of bruisers and brawlers straight out of “Slap Shot” — guys such as Brad “Wingnut” Wingfield David “One Eye Willy” Beauregard and Rumun “The Nigerian Nightmare” Ndur. These guys would start fights three seconds into games much to the delight of the Trashers’ rabid fan base — and with the approval of the team owner who often paid the team with thick wads of cash stuffed into envelopes.

As you might suspect things did not end well for the Trashers but they live on in the hearts of the fans in Danbury Connecticut and their story just begs to told someday in a full-length feature film.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlZW5hc2NvdHQvMjAyMS8wOC8wNy90aGUtc3dhcm0tYS1ncmVhdC1uZXctZnJlbmNoLWhvcnJvci1vbi1uZXRmbGl4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Swarm': A Great New French Horror On Netflix,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sheenascott/2021/08/07/the-swarm-a-great-new-french-horror-on-netflix/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlZW5hc2NvdHQvMjAyMS8wOC8wNy90aGUtc3dhcm0tYS1ncmVhdC1uZXctZnJlbmNoLWhvcnJvci1vbi1uZXRmbGl4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vRW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudF9OZXdzL1RWLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvbHVpcy1ndXptYW4td2VkbmVzZGF5LWFkZGFtcy84OTkxNjI4MzUxNzIwL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vYW1wL0VudGVydGFpbm1lbnRfTmV3cy9UVi8yMDIxLzA4LzA3L2x1aXMtZ3V6bWFuLXdlZG5lc2RheS1hZGRhbXMvODk5MTYyODM1MTcyMC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Luis Guzman to play Gomez in Netflix's Wednesday Addams series,"1 of 3 | Luis Guzman is set to play Gomez Addams in the new live-action Netflix series ""Wednesday.""

Aug. 7 (UPI) -- Godfather of Harlem and Shameless alum Luis Guzman has landed the role of Gomez Addams in Netflix's upcoming live-action series Wednesday. Deadline reported the casting news Friday. Advertisement

Guzman retweeted several posts containing the link to the story.

""Gracias Thrilled!!!!"" he commented on one of the posts.

Scream and The Fallout actress Jenna Ortega was announced in May as the titular heroine in the streaming service's eight-episode coming-of-age series.

Gomez is Wednesday's father.

The kooky clan has appeared in television films video games and stage musicals.

""The series is a sleuthing supernaturally infused mystery charting Wednesday Addams' years as a student at Nevermore Academy. Wednesday's attempts to master her emerging psychic ability thwart a monstrous killing spree that has terrorized the local town and solve the supernatural mystery that embroiled her parents 25 years ago -- all while navigating her new and very tangled relationships at Nevermore"" Netflix said in a synopsis for Wednesday.

Tim Burton who helmed two Addams Family movies (with Christina Ricci playing Wednesday and Raul Julia as Gomez) is directing and producing the Netflix project.

ARS TECHNICA This story originally appeared on Ars Technica a trusted source for technology news tech policy analysis reviews and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company Condé Nast.

The streaming service seems to be casting about for a female version of the hugely successful John Wick franchise but it's harder to pull off than it looks. First there was 2020's The Old Guard in which Charlize Theron leads an immortal group of mercenaries on a mission of revenge. Theron was terrific but the film itself was uneven. Just last month Netflix served up the disappointing Gunpowder Milkshake which had a stellar cast and all the right elements including some impressive fight choreography. But as with The Old Guard nothing really jelled and as much as I love Karen Gillan she seemed ill-suited to the role. Gunpowder Milkshake ended up feeling flat predictable and like an exercise in style over substance.

The basic premise of Kate is a familiar one; it's essentially a twist on the classic 1950 film noir D.O.A. in which a man—a seemingly ordinary accountant and notary public—walks into a police station and says he has been poisoned with only a few days left to live and discover who murdered him. (Due to someone not renewing the copyright on time the film is in the public domain.) It has inspired three direct remakes: 1969's Color Me Dead 1988's D.O.A. (starring Dennis Quaid) and the 2017 film Dead on Arrival. And the film has influenced countless more such as the 2006 film Crank in which Jason Statham plays a British assassin who has to keep his adrenaline levels spiking to counteract being given a deadly poison.

Kate seems like a combination of D.O.A. Crank and Gunpowder Milkshake. Per the official premise: “Meticulous and preternaturally skilled Kate is the perfect specimen of a finely tuned assassin at the height of her game. But when she uncharacteristically blows an assignment targeting a member of the yakuza in Tokyo she quickly discovers she’s been poisoned a brutally slow execution that gives her less than 24 hours to exact revenge on her killers. As her body swiftly deteriorates Kate forms an unlikely bond with the teenage daughter of one of her past victims.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL3Nob3dzLWxpa2Utb3V0ZXItYmFua3MtdG8td2F0Y2gtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Shows Like Netflix's Outer Banks to Watch Next,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL3Nob3dzLWxpa2Utb3V0ZXItYmFua3MtdG8td2F0Y2gtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Just 10 wealthy people account for a quarter of all donations made by individuals to the Conservative Party since Boris Johnson became prime minister according to new analysis by The Independent.

The 10 super-rich donors – nine of whom are men – have given a combined sum of just over £10m to the Tories since Mr Johnson entered Downing Street equalling more than 25 per cent of the £38.6m received from all individuals in the past two years.

Fears have been raised about the power held by the very wealthiest Tory donors after it emerged last week that a group known as the “advisory board” had been developed to connect the party’s biggest financial backers with ministers.

Campaign groups said The Independent’s analysis – based on the latest data from the Electoral Commission – showed the “concentrated power” of a small number of big donors.

Darren Hughes chief executive of Electoral Reform Society said: “These figures show just how concentrated donor power is in UK politics. Political debate shouldn’t be something bought by a few very wealthy individuals.

“The fact that a small group have provided such a large amount of political funding and gained the potential influence that comes with it is of great concern.”

Calling for strict new limits on the amount donors can give Mr Hughes added: “It’s time to fix the rot and restore faith in politics. We need to explore a cap on donations [and] greater public funding to bring us into line with most advanced democracies.”

Alex Runswick senior advocacy manager at the Transparency International UK campaign group added: “These revelations underline concerns that great wealth can secure a privileged audience in UK politics.

“This dependence on a small number of wealthy donors risks shaping policy and decisions in their favour rather than national interest so the government should legislate to take big money out of politics.”

The data shows most of the 10 biggest individual Tory backers since Mr Johnson became prime minister in July 2019 made their fortune in finance or property.

One of the 10 most generous donors is Jamie Reuben co-owner of the Reuben Brothers property empire who has given almost £700000 to the Tory party thus far during the Johnson era.

His ties with the Tories came under scrutiny earlier this year when it emerged his company was a co-investor with the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) in last year’s failed bid to buy Newcastle United.

Leaked messages from September 2020 revealed that the prime minister had asked his adviser Sir Edward Lister to look into the chances of the deal being revived. When Sir Edward said that he was hopeful the deal could be done Mr Johnson reportedly replied: “Brilliant.”

Other wealthy Tory donors on the top 10 list include online trading tycoon Peter Cruddas who has given the party just over £870000 in the past two years. Mr Cruddas was handed a peerage last year – sparking accusations of “cronyism” from Labour.

In June the anti-corruption campaign the Good Law Project launched legal action over the peerage claiming that Mr Johnson ignored the advice of the House of Lords Appointments Committee against making the businessman a Lord.

The single biggest individual donor since Mr Johnson came to power is Malcolm Healey – the retail tycoon whose company owns Wren Kitchens. He has handed the Tory Party £2m in the past two years.

Labour MP Anneliese Dodds the party’s chair said the Conservatives had “serious questions to answer” about their dependence on big donors.

The frontbencher told The Independent: “We need to know why the Tories have become so reliant on huge donations from a select group of super-wealthy individuals – and what it is that these elite donors are being given in return.

“Boris Johnson has created a cash for access culture in the Conservative Party ... He needs to break his silence and explain what he plans to do to ensure there isn’t one rule for senior Conservatives and their cronies and another rule for everyone else.”

Last week the Financial Times reported that an “advisory board” donor club featuring members who donated at least £250000 was developed to connect Tory supporters with senior figures claiming meetings have been held with Mr Johnson and chancellor Rishi Sunak.

The Tories have since refused to reveal which donors have paid to be members of the group or which ministers have attended meetings after Labour called for transparency.

Leading donor Mohamed Amersi told the FT the group is “like the very elite Quintessentially clients membership: one needs to cough up £250000 per annum or be a friend of Ben”.

The name was a reference to the Conservatives’ co-chairman Ben Elliot founder of the luxury concierge service Quintessentially who also reportedly helped set up the donor network.

Mr Amersi sits just outside the list of top 10 donors in the past two years having given £189000 in the Johnson era. Most of the money – £99500 – was paid for a breakfast date with Mr Johnson after he won an “auction” at a party dinner event.

Conservative Party co-chair Amanda Milling claimed that government policy “is in no way influenced by the donations the party receives – they are entirely separate”.

She said: “All political parties raise money and accept donations in order to pay their staff and campaign in elections.”

Earlier this week cabinet minister Grant Shapps said large donations to the Tory Party from wealthy people should not be “painted as some sort of immoral act”.

The transport secretary also said the British public would not welcome any new limits on the amount donors could give – since he claimed it could mean more money coming from the public purse to fund political parties.

In 2011 the Committee on Standards on Public Life recommended that political donations were capped at £10000 per donor per party per year – but the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government passed up the chance to reform the system.

Campaign groups said it was time for clear limits on the size of donations urging MPs from all parties to consider new rules to limit the potential for corruption.

“Without limits on the size of political donations political parties will continue to fail to build broader more democratic bases of financial support” said Ms Runswick of Transparency International UK.

“Clearly money does buy access and the perception that this secures undue influence corrodes trust in our political system.”

Just 10 wealthy people account for a quarter of all donations made by individuals to the Conservative Party since Boris Johnson became prime minister according to new analysis by The Independent.

The 10 super-rich donors – nine of whom are men – have given a combined sum of just over £10m to the Tories since Mr Johnson entered Downing Street equalling more than 25 per cent of the £38.6m received from all individuals in the past two years.

Fears have been raised about the power held by the very wealthiest Tory donors after it emerged last week that a group known as the “advisory board” had been developed to connect the party’s biggest financial backers with ministers.

Campaign groups said The Independent’s analysis – based on the latest data from the Electoral Commission – showed the “concentrated power” of a small number of big donors.

Darren Hughes chief executive of Electoral Reform Society said: “These figures show just how concentrated donor power is in UK politics. Political debate shouldn’t be something bought by a few very wealthy individuals.

“The fact that a small group have provided such a large amount of political funding and gained the potential influence that comes with it is of great concern.”

Calling for strict new limits on the amount donors can give Mr Hughes added: “It’s time to fix the rot and restore faith in politics. We need to explore a cap on donations [and] greater public funding to bring us into line with most advanced democracies.”

Alex Runswick senior advocacy manager at the Transparency International UK campaign group added: “These revelations underline concerns that great wealth can secure a privileged audience in UK politics.

“This dependence on a small number of wealthy donors risks shaping policy and decisions in their favour rather than national interest so the government should legislate to take big money out of politics.”

The data shows most of the 10 biggest individual Tory backers since Mr Johnson became prime minister in July 2019 made their fortune in finance or property.

One of the 10 most generous donors is Jamie Reuben co-owner of the Reuben Brothers property empire who has given almost £700000 to the Tory party thus far during the Johnson era.

His ties with the Tories came under scrutiny earlier this year when it emerged his company was a co-investor with the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) in last year’s failed bid to buy Newcastle United.

As drivers approach bundles of metal fencing are prepped to soon become 10 miles of temporary desert tortoise exclusion fencing.

A team of biologists relocated 139 tortoises from their habitat to make way for the solar panels in the Yellow Pine Solar Project one of four large solar energy developments initiated in Southern Nevada.

The tortoises were moved across state Route 160 to Stump Springs in May.

In a span of a few weeks 30 tortoises were killed possibly by badgers. Conservationists believe relocation stress made the reptiles vulnerable and drought caused badgers to look for new sources of prey.

Wildlife experts are still looking into the exact cause.

The loss of the tortoises a threatened species in Nevada since 1990 illustrates the challenges of bringing alternative energy sources to the Mojave Desert while still protecting its biodiversity.

Conservationists say the state should modify desert relocation protocols under the current drought. Laura Cunningham biologist and co-founder of Basin and Range Watch said the tortoises get lost and confused when moved from their home range.

""We're not even surprised that badgers discovered these tortoises"" Cunningham told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ""When you move them to a different area they tend to start wandering around and try to get back to their home range and that's when they're taken by predators.""

Cunningham founded the nonprofit Basin and Range Watch with partner Kevin Emmerich 12 years ago. They were field biologists for state and federal wildlife agencies before shifting their work to help conserve the deserts of Nevada and California while advocating for sustainable renewable energy alternatives.

Both are concerned about the large solar project and its impact on the desert landscape.

""During the drought there are less rodents less lizards and so they (predators) are going after everything. And so we think this was predictable enough that it shouldn't have been done especially during a drought"" said Cunningham.

Steven Stengel a representative of NextEra Energy Resources declined immediate comment.

THE SOLAR PROJECT

Through the Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act the federal government is incentivizing wind solar and geothermal energy developments on public lands.

In November 2020 the Bureau of Land Management accepted the Yellow Pine Solar Project application developed by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources. The project is expected to generate 500 megawatts of electricity using photovoltaic solar panels enough for up to 100000 households by the end of 2022.

The solar arrays absorb energy from the sun and generate electricity which is stored in a lithium-ion-based battery gathered by an internal electrical collection system and transformed to transmission voltage before reaching homes.

The developers say the solar farm will provide 300 construction jobs and approximately $23 million in additional tax revenue for Clark County within a decade.

Before development the company first surveyed wildlife vegetation cultural and tribal resources and endangered species. The Bureau of Land Management then issued a right-of-way in January 2021 granting the developers approval to begin clearing the area of tortoises and putting up fencing to keep the tortoises from reentering the project site.

TORTOISE MIGRATION

There are strict guidelines and standardized protocols in place set by the Fish and Wildlife Service for each phase of handling the tortoises to mitigate risks and prevent further endangering the species.

The desert tortoise has been listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act because of population decline due to predation collection by humans off-highway vehicles and upper respiratory tract disease.

In addition urban developments agriculture road construction and military activities have fragmented tortoise habitats reducing the tortoise population below the level necessary to maintain a minimum viable population.

After 30 years of study Todd Esque a U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist said data shows the populations are ""not quite stable.""

""We knew when they got listed that it would take decades to get them turned around"" he said. ""But we have to be able to do all the things that that requires to turn them around; you can't just wish they would start repopulating.""

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service monitors tortoise populations in designated conservation areas throughout a range including Southern Nevada Southern California southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona.

However tortoises outside designated conservation areas are not monitored and mostly inhabit land renewable energy developers are interested in.

During the survey the number of adults juveniles and hatchlings is counted in three areas by qualified consultants: the project area the relocation area and a reference site in a conservation area.

Consultants check the health status of the tortoises in the project and relocation site to prevent disease spread and finally the relocated tortoises are paired with a tracking device. The developers report back to both the Bureau of Land Management and state wildlife officials throughout the process.

Despite mitigation measures within weeks of relocating the tortoises from the project site to their new home in Stump Springs dozens died.

""I think most of those were thought to be from or had signs of badger predation"" said Roy Averill-Murray Fish and Wildlife Service desert tortoise recovery coordinator. ""Others could have also included a small handful of other natural causes but it seemed to be mostly this kind of localized focus badger attention on the translocated tortoises.""

The tortoise deaths from badgers accounted for roughly one-third of the relocated adults. No more deaths have been reported since mid-July.

Badgers aren't typically known to prey on desert tortoises. Instead their main prey is desert rodents but they are also known to eat ground-nesting birds lizards and insects.

They also aren't the only desert animals with a history of switching prey.

OTHER TORTOISE RELOCATION

Esque and Averill-Murray were part of a 2008 study that looked into the relocation of 2000 tortoises from Fort Irwin in Southern California where hundreds of square kilometers of habitat were cleared for Army tank training.

In their research 600 tortoises were radioed from three subpopulations: one group nowhere near any of the animals that got moved one group living in the area where the tortoises got moved and the group that got moved.

Coyotes attacked all three tortoise populations near the area. According to Esque it's difficult for a coyote to eat tortoises because they require more energy to eat than the rabbits that coyotes typically prey on. But during drought if rabbits die out coyotes will resort to eating tortoises which is what happened in Fort Irwin.

""So the story was not that there's one thing happened and they moved tortoises and they all got whacked"" said Esque. ""It's that the whole desert ... there are patches where it's a higher risk to be a tortoise when you're near a town. And that's the bad news. For tortoises it was much bigger (risk) than just an incident of moving the tortoises in one time.""

For their Fort Irwin study it was not the act of translocating tortoises that led to their death but how much more residential areas are blending into wildlife where many predators reside. It was difficult to compare badgers and coyotes changing their prey toward tortoises.

""If it was related to the drought why aren't coyotes eating tortoises in Stump Springs?"" said Averill-Murray. ""It's just very strange and it's not quite as simple as 'Oh it's drought and the predators automatically eat translocated tortoises. Or translocated tortoises are more susceptible to being eaten by predators in a drought.' It's just that has not been the case over the last 10-15 years.""

TORTOISE vs SOLAR

Cunningham and Emmerich propose that developers instead build solar arrays on the tops of parking garages or push back the development of solar projects when there isn't an extreme drought.

""We're asking the tortoise to make a sacrifice here for climate change. Maybe we the people in the city and towns should really try to conserve more and make our structures more energy-efficient and less wasteful"" said Cunningham.

Developers of the Yellow Pine Solar Project need to finish setting up the tortoise exclusion fence before moving on to the next stage of development later this year.

For now they are responsible for keeping track of all three populations of the desert tortoise for a year. After that according to Averill-Murray the developers will hand off the project to the Fish and Wildlife Service which will most likely contract out the U.S. Geological Survey to continue monitoring the tortoises.

""[The Bureau of Land Management] is having them (developers) pay a fee to support monitoring into the future. I think it's a $1 amount per acre that they're ... putting into a bank account that will support the future monitoring down the line"" he said.

The Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service partnering with the U.S. Geological Survey allows for the long-term monitoring of translocated desert tortoises to inform future mitigation protocols.

""Judging by the number of applications we have for solar plants basically the next area will be between Las Vegas and Beatty Nevada -- a giant flat valley up there that's all perfect for solar"" said Esque.

""But that's also one of the few north-south corridors for desert tortoises to respond to climate change if they need to if we can think in those terms which is really long terms"" he said. ""So what should the strategy be for that? Not just for our backyard here but the whole range of desert tortoises.""

Laura Cunningham shows the Review-Journal a desert tortoise burrow across the street from the future Yellow Pine solar project in the desert west of Las Vegas and southeast of Pahrump Nev. in Clark County Wednesday July 14 2021. Cunningham and her husband who together founded the nonprofit Basin and Range Watch say the solar panels will destroy the pristine ecosystem of the desert and harm the desert tortoises and that there are alternative places to put the solar panels.

The smaller company was interested in supporting Ms. Felix’s career and said it would not penalize her for losing races or choosing to have more children. (Nike changed its policy for pregnant athletes after the criticism by Ms. Felix whose contract with the company ended in 2017.) She said that she liked that Athleta was led by women and that it appreciated that she was a mother as well as an athlete.

“It’s a very pressured situation to be sponsored traditionally in track and field — it’s about numbers if you don’t perform reductions and all of these things” Ms. Felix who will compete in the Tokyo Games said in an interview. With Athleta she added “I felt like I had more value as a person and that was something I hadn’t experienced before.”

A growing number of top women athletes including Simone Biles and former Olympians have been choosing to strike new types of deals with smaller activewear brands instead of traditional sponsors like Nike. Several young female runners say that smaller brands are willing to work with them in different ways like bringing them on as employees giving them equity or involving them in new products and that they are paying more attention to their personal stories and Instagram accounts than their race performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGVydG93bm1hbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8wNy9uaWtlLW9wZW5pbmctbmV3LXN0b3JlLWluLWhpc3RvcmljLWJ1aWxkaW5nLWF0LWFyc2VuYWwteWFyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Opening New Store in Historic Building at Arsenal Yards,"Nike Inside the new Nike Unite store at Arsenal Yards.

There may be no big-brand stock executing better than Nike. The sportswear giant’s flawless fourth-quarter earnings report featured revenue jumping 21% over pre-pandemic (2019) levels. Profit also surged thanks to the shift to higher-profit-margin direct sales as Nike’s earnings per share of 93 cents easily topped analyst expectations of 51 cents. Meanwhile management projects revenue growth in the low double digits this fiscal year and rising profit margins.

Nike’s strength in direct-to-consumer and digital sales the strategy it calls Consumer Direct Acceleration is set to power that growth. Through apps like Nike Training Club and Nike Run Club Nike has built out an audience of 300 million members that drove $3 billion in revenue in the latest quarter. Also Nike’s women’s sportswear has become a major growth driver for Nike with fiscal 2021 revenue up 22% year over year.

It’s no accident that Nike is poised for another decade of domination. The stock has been a juggernaut since it went public in 1980 rising nearly 100000%. In other words $1000 invested in the stock then would be worth nearly $1 million now.

Ask the Fool

From D.R. in Tacoma Wash.: What are “fintech” companies?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: The moniker “fintech” is a combination of the words “finance” and “technology.” Fintech businesses develop and/or use technology for financial operations. That’s a wide arena encompassing companies involved in contactless payments robo-advising mobile banking peer-to-peer lending blockchain technology cryptocurrencies brokerage services and more.

For example PayPal is a fintech company processing credit card payments; its subsidiary Venmo is one as well facilitating person-to-person payments on mobile platforms. Square is another: You may know it for the little credit card processing gadgets that many small businesses attach to smartphones in order to accept credit card payments but it has grown to offer more than that including a small business lending platform.

Fintechs are disrupting traditional financial businesses with newer faster and better financial services. Many have already rewarded shareholders handsomely but more than a few are trading with high valuations now — so tread carefully.

From G.S. in Pocahontas Ark.: Can you explain what a company’s “capital allocation” is?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: A company’s capital allocation is how it spends its money often with the goal of making the company bigger and healthier. A company can for example use its money to build more factories hire more workers pay down its debt pay its shareholders a dividend buy back some of its shares buy another company invest save for a future opportunity and so on. Companies will generally do multiple things with available funds.

Ideally companies should spend their money in the most productive ways. That means not overspending on an acquisition and not buying back shares when they’re overvalued. When a company’s capital is not allocated effectively shareholders suffer.

The Fool’s School

Relatively few people have pensions to look forward to in retirement these days so if you’re fortunate enough to have a 401(k) plan available to you through your job aim to make the most of it. And avoid these costly blunders:

Advertisement

Failing to participate: The worst 401(k) mistake is not having one. You might amass hundreds of thousands of dollars for retirement via a 401(k) plan but not if you don’t sign up for one or contribute to it regularly.

Not maxing out the match: At a minimum contribute enough to get all available matching dollars that your employer may offer.

Not contributing aggressively: To build a hefty account you should be making sizable contributions each year. For many people even 10% of income may not be enough. Crunch your own numbers to see how much you need to sock away regularly to reach your goals.

Borrowing from your account: Any money you take out for a few years will not be working to grow for you shrinking your account’s future value.

Advertisement

Cashing out early: Letting money grow for many years in a 401(k) can build a valuable nest egg for retirement. Don’t short-change your future by cashing out when you leave a job. Roll that money into your new employer’s 401(k) plan — or into an IRA.

Investing too conservatively: Typically 401(k) plans offer a limited number of investment options most rather conservative. Read up on your choices and choose the ones that should serve you best. If you’re still many years from retirement for example you might stick entirely or mostly with stocks as they tend to offer higher returns over the long run. An S&P 500 index fund is a great choice for stocks.

Not designating beneficiaries: Prevent future headaches by specifying who gets your 401(k) assets when you die. Update your beneficiaries as necessary too.

My Dumbest Investment

From E.F. online: My dumbest investment was selling my shares of Roku too early. I would’ve gotten thousands of dollars more if I’d waited five months longer.

Advertisement

The Fool responds: Selling out of a great company’s stock prematurely is a common investing mistake. The importance of patience to successful investing is underappreciated. Impatience has made people exit stocks such as Apple and Amazon after just a few months or years for perhaps a double-digit gain or even a modest loss — when they might have increased their investment tenfold twentyfold or more by hanging on.

Before selling a stock think about how much more you believe the company can grow in the coming five or 10 years (or even longer) and about how much faith you have in management. You wish you’d held on to your Roku shares for five months more but think about where the stock might be in five years!

While Roku started with small devices for TVs several manufacturers now sell smart TVs running Roku TV software and Roku is reportedly spending more than $1 billion on streaming content. It’s not guaranteed to become a dominant powerhouse but it has been performing well lately.

If you research the company and think it’s attractively valued relative to its growth potential you might undo this move you regret and buy more shares now. (The Motley Fool owns shares of and has recommended Roku.)

Norfolk Southern has received 500 of the locomotives since contracting with Wabtec to take 1990s-vintage 4000-hp D.C. traction GE Dash 9 locomotives and rebuild them into 4400-hp A.C. traction units with a new designation of AC44C6M. That includes the 1000th unit No. 4463 unveiled Friday at the Fort Worth plant and posed next to an unrebuilt unit about to enter the program.

“This achievement is a testament to the value that our locomotive modernization service provides to customers” says Pascal Schweitzer president of Wabtec Freight Services. “Our modernization program breathes new life and technological advancements into customers’ aging locomotives while also reducing a railroad’s operating costs and carbon footprint.” Finished units increase tractive effort by 50% with the switch from D.C. to A.C. traction improvements in truck design an 11-ton weight increase and new standardized control systems sacross all units. This allows Norfolk Southern to assign two rebuilt units to trains that would have required three older units to achieve the same performance.

The units’ 25% increase in fuel efficiency means these 1000 locomotives have reduced carbon emissions by 1.4 million tons since 2015. All this is important to Norfolk Southern’s long-term goals says Tom Schnautz vice presiden advanced train control. “As a leading transportation provider it is our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact” Schnautz says. “Our partnership with Wabtec is one way we plan to achieve our target of a 42% reduction in emissions intensity by 2034. Wabtec’s program is maximizing the value of our locomotives lowering operating costs and reducing emissions.”

Another environmental benefit is that 50% of the steel in each locomotive is reused in one form or another during the remanufacturing process. Over the life of the program the three Wabtec plants have reused more than 100000 tons of steel in the remanufacturing process.

“The modernization program has been a tremendous success and has created a new segment in the market” Schweitzer says. “It is now a key pillar of fleet management strategies for many railroads. That is a tribute to our employees suppliers and customers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvbWFya2llLXBvc3Qta25vd24tZm9yLXJvbGVzLW9uLW5pZ2h0LWNvdXJ0LXNjcnVicy1kZWFkLWF0LTcwL2FydGljbGVfNWRlNmQzYTItNzVmNS01M2ZmLWFjN2ItMGVlMDg0ZDcxOWM3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Markie Post known for roles on 'Night Court' 'Scrubs' dead at 70,"Memphis TN (38111)

For now though Carlisle borough officials are asking the public what they want to see in the facilities.

Carlisle Auto Industries conveyed two lots on the former Masland/IAC site along Fairground Avenue to the borough to develop for public recreation.

Residents can provide input on the plans for the lots by visiting Engage Carlisle at carlislepa.org/engage. Andrea Crouse the borough’s director of Parks and Recreation said there will be additional ways to provide input and the parks and rec board will reach out to the community near the proposed parks for their thoughts.

“We’ve gotten a lot of public feedback on Facebook too” Crouse said. “There were quite a number of comments.”

The comment period will continue through Sept. 15. After that the borough will consolidate the input from residents into the designs that will be presented to the public.

The borough plans to start construction on the parks in March 2022. The parks must be completed by June 30 2022 due to requirements associated with the grant from the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources that the borough received for the parks.

Borough Manager Susan Armstrong said DCNR has already extended the three-year grant twice and this is the third and final extension it can give.

“That puts us on a pretty fast timeline for lots A and D” Crouse said.

The skate spot is proposed for a 55-foot by 85-foot site near the Norfolk Southern railroad tracks at the southern end of the lot. Skate spots are usually between 1500 and 3500 square feet and are the smallest type of skateboarding facility.

A more traditional park is proposed for a 100-foot by 100-foot area between B and C streets. Ideas proposed in the concept plan for the park include play equipment a walking path basketball courts adult fitness equipment and youth playground equipment.

Crouse said it is anticipated that the two lots will eventually be connected with lots B and C that fall between the two ends.

Frederick Seibert and Associates was hired to do initial concept designs that were required in order for the borough to get extensions on the grant.

At its workshop meeting Wednesday the borough council voted to table a motion that would have awarded a $39000 contract to FSA for overseeing design construction drawings and bidding for the project because the council wanted more information on the subcontracting process that FSA plans to use for the skate spot portion of the plans.

The council is expected to take up the contract at its meeting at 7 p.m. Thursday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvcG9jby1ndWl0YXJpc3QtcGF1bC1jb3R0b24tZGVhZC1hdC03OC9hcnRpY2xlXzJkYjUwYTJjLThjOTctNTcyNy1iZjdkLTBiZGM1OWZkOTE1NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Poco guitarist Paul Cotton dead at 78 | Trending | fox13memphis.com,"Memphis TN (38111)

It will go down in history as the year a global pandemic shut down nearly everything and inadvertently cleared the way for a narrower focus on racial inequities and the system that’s accused of perpetuating them.

Against that backdrop the efforts of Shundrawn Thomas might seem almost subtle but they are not. In fact little about Thomas the president of Northern Trust Asset Management is subdued although his demeanor and general presentation suggest otherwise. Without preaching or even getting agitated Thomas talks about “the unfortunate deaths of people of color not being a new thing” even though it drew a lot of attention in 2020.

“I can track the story of my own life in the years leading up to that point” he said. “The difference last year is it was occurring in the midst of a pandemic that created an environment where you have everybody’s attention.”

When Thomas was promoted to president of the $1.2 trillion asset management division in 2017 he became the first person of color elevated to the top tier of management at Northern Trust Corp.

Thomas 47 has worked in financial services since 1994. He joined the Chicago-based asset manager 18 years ago and moved up through the ranks by doing exactly what he would suggest to anyone trying to find success at any endeavor.

“You have to really focus on the discipline of being a consummate professional and provide more service than you get paid for” said Thomas sounding pretty understated for a man who doesn’t seem to have many gaps in his schedule for what most of us might describe as down time.

In addition to his demanding day job he is a husband and father of two boys and he’s involved in his church and active in alumni affairs at his alma mater Florida A&M as well as the Toigo Foundation which fosters career development for underrepresented talent.

He’s also written four books the most recent of which is “Discover Joy in Work” (IVP Books 2019).

The 2021 winner of the InvestmentNews Excellence in Diversity Equity & Inclusion Lifetime Achievement Award is not the kind of person who seeks recognition for his success nor status as an African American in an industry where women and minorities in leadership are still rare. But Thomas appreciates and enthusiastically shoulders the opportunity to challenge the status quo and to help make success stories like his more common.

That side of Thomas was on full display in the fall of 2020 when he penned what has been described as a letter to corporate America reflecting on the state of race relations in the workplace and in his heart.

The essay which was published in September by InvestmentNews launches into the topic with the example of a 29-year-old Black man in Kenosha Wisconsin who was shot seven times by police after appearing to ignore their orders. In his classic style the essay offers a direct message and call to action through masterful writing that is personal and informative and simultaneously deadly serious and nonthreatening.

“Race racism and racist ideas have impacted me in tangible ways through my life and career” he writes. “What is remarkable however is the current shift in the dialogue about race and the increased acknowledgement of the unique experience and experiences of Black people in America.”

In addition to heartfelt anecdotes perhaps the most touching part of Thomas’ message is the empathy for others.

Reflecting on a lesson he learned from his mother who pursued a career in social work in a troubled inner-city neighborhood Thomas wrote that he came to realize how much those lives mattered to his mother.

“I fully understood her sense of calling and care for the human community” he wrote.

When asked today about the events of 2020 as an inflection point for race relations in the U.S. Thomas is quick to clarify in a way that comes well short of celebrating success.

“We are at an inflection point as it pertains to our dialogue and discourse” he said. “If we’re having this conversation two years ago there are still third rails that nobody touches and race was one of those things.”

If 2020 represented a tipping point in the collective consciousness regarding racial equality it only went that far according to Thomas.

“I feel like in terms of the dialogue we definitely went through a pivotal point but we have not reached a tipping point in terms of changing the underlying trends outcomes or results” he said.

That message about society in general is at least as pertinent when it comes to the industry where Thomas has spent his entire career.

“Leadership representation has not changed materially in my three decades in financial services” he said. “I can’t point to material positive progress; if anything we’ve regressed. Just think of the business I’m in. How much money is managed by women- and minority-owned firms? And think about the unique situation of my role.”

[More: Three principles for inclusive leadership]

Those who know and work with Thomas describe him as a man of strong conviction but also incredibly enlightened thoughtful and intelligent.

“Shundrawn is a thoughtful friend someone you can connect with on big issues and he also has a remarkable blend of gifts as a leader” said Steve Preston president and chief executive officer of Goodwill Industries.

Preston a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development first met Thomas more than a decade ago when they both served on the board of directors at Wheaton College.

“I’ve seen a lot of leaders in a lot of places and when I’ve heard Shundrawn speak about issues of race he brings incredible perspective to everyone in the room” Preston said. “Everyone leaves smarter and with a deeper understanding.”

Connie Lindsey executive vice president of corporate social responsibility and global diversity equity and inclusion at Northern Trust works closely with Thomas on the company’s ESG executive council.

“He leads from a very authentic place because he understands what is good for business and the kind of talent we need” she said.

In terms of his leadership style Lindsey said Thomas “takes the kinds of risks that are also good business decisions because he leads with a deep level of ethical behavior.”

“When it comes to discussing how we want to shift or change things there’s not always unanimity but Shundrawn is that leader who will articulate why it makes sense” she added. “We are both people of deep faith and he’s able to live his faith in a way that is not proselytizing.”

Thomas’ profile at the top of a company managing $1.2 trillion is not in any way lost on him.

Even though he expects anyone trying to succeed to put forth significant effort Thomas said a lot of success can still come down to “grace and timing” and that people should be open to that idea.

“Yes I have to put in the work and be effective at what I do but even when that happens say I come to Northern Trust two years later than I did” he adds giving a nod to a bit of luck that could strike anyone at any time.

The other crucial component to success according to Thomas is “allies mentors and sponsors along the way.”

“For those who might not be cut out of central casting so to speak it starts with a sense of belief” he said. “I’m a person of deep abiding faith beyond that my belief is that of people. The system is not equitable. But there are many wonderful people who are willing to be allies. You have to believe that those people exist and that you can find them. And you have to put yourself in a position to be a recipient of the grace and timing.”

He said that the forum established in 2009 identified with well-meaning Nigerians that were playing leading role in the lives of the masses especially the vulnerable.

He said that the organisation had branches in 19 states across the country.

In his response Meshioye expressed appreciations for the award and promised to continue to do his best for the betterment of the people.

“The reward for hard work is more work. I will double up to do more in impacting lives positively” he said.

Meshioye said that Nigeria has a rich culture and tradition to be reckoned with it.

“Other foreign countries eye the unique cultural values of Nigeria. Therefore Nigeria government should leverage on this quality to develop the nation ” he said.

He said that Nigerian culture and traditions were capable of generating huge revenues for the country if properly utilised.

On top of the Antares booster the Cygnus spacecraft will carry more than 8200 pounds of science and research crew supplies and vehicle hardware to the International Space Station (ISS).

The 139 foot tall Antares 230+ launch vehicle is a two stage system capable of lifting up to 17636 pounds (8000 kilograms) to low Earth orbit. This will be the fifth flight of the 230+ version of Antares. The first stage is powered by two NPO Energomash RD-181 engines burning Rocket Grade Kerosene and Oxygen. Each of the main engines reaching a maximum thrust of 432106 pounds (196000 KGF) at full throttle. The second stage is Northrup Grumman’s own Castor 30XL which is a solid fueled stage producing approximately 125000 pounds of thrust (56803 KGF).

Assuming an on time launch on August 10th the Cygnus spacecraft named the S.S. Ellison Onizuka after the fallen Space Shuttle Challenger astronaut will arrive at the ISS on Thursday August 12th. It will be berthed to the station using the Candarm2 with astronaut Megan McArthur at the controls. It will spend about three months docked to the station allowing the crew plenty of time to transfer the supplies and science from the spacecraft to the station and then to fill it with items no longer needed. The spacecraft is not designed to be reusable and at the end of its mission the Cygnus spacecraft will burn up while reentering the Earth’s atmosphere.

So what’s on board ?

Aside from crew consumables such as food water clothing and so on there are science experiments technology demonstrations and new hardware packed into the Cygnus spacecraft.

One of the major items being hauled up to the ISS is the 4-Bed Carbon Dioxide Scrubber a next-generation Environmental Control and Life Support System technology that will be tested on the ISS for the next year. Unlike the small scrubbers you may have seen the Apollo 13 crew changing out in the movie this unit is quite large about the size of a small refrigerator and weighing in the neighborhood of 450 pounds. The unit is based on the current on the current scrubber on the ISS that has been in use for 20 years. The unit’s purpose is to remove Carbon Dioxide from the atmosphere inside of the station and collect water vapor. The new unit has been redesigned to be easier to maintain and for improved reliability features needed if the same technology is to be used aboard a lunar outpost or a journey to Mars. Donnie McCaghren project manager for the system stated “We reduced the scrubber’s power consumption improved the thermal stability and lifespan of the adsorbent materials and added replaceable filters more durable valves and protective covers for the valve motors.”

After completing the initial year of testing the unit will be incorporated into the station’s closed-loop recycling system for at least three years.

The Redwire Regolith Print (RRP) study will use a simulated regolith as material used the Made In Space Manufacturing Device currently aboard the International Space Station. Regolith is the loose rock and soil found on the surfaces of planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mars. The experiment is to study if it’s possible to use regolith as a material that could be 3D printed into building materials that could be used for habitats or other structures on another celestial body. If structures can be built using materials that are already on the Moon Mars or another destination that would drastically cut down the amount of material required to be launched from Earth for missions to those destinations.

Another technology demonstration payload flying on NG-16 but not staying on the ISS or burning up inside Cygnus at the end of the mission will test a new affordable thermal protection system (TPS) or heat shield. The new TPS if tests go well can be used on spacecraft returning to Earth from the moon or other destinations where the heat shield must endure temperature of upwards of 3600 degrees Fahrenheit. To test these new materials Cygnus will deploy numerous cubesats after departing the space station but prior to reentering the Earth’s atmosphere. Those cubesats will transmit data back from the Thermal Protection System tests.

Last but certainly not least the Cygnus spacecraft will carry a new mounting bracket for the space station that will be used to enable the installation of more new solar arrays like the one’s installed a few weeks ago. The new bracket will be attached the space station during a spacewalk planned for late August.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS91cy1kZWZlbnNlLWdpYW50cy1sb2NraGVlZC1ub3J0aHJvcC1sb2NrZWQtaW4tYmF0dGxlLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtYXVzdHJhbGlhcy1pbnRlZ3JhdGVkLW1pc3NpbGUtZGVmZW5zZS1zeXN0ZW0v0gGLAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3VzLWRlZmVuc2UtZ2lhbnRzLWxvY2toZWVkLW5vcnRocm9wLWxvY2tlZC1pbi1iYXR0bGUtdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC1hdXN0cmFsaWFzLWludGVncmF0ZWQtbWlzc2lsZS1kZWZlbnNlLXN5c3RlbS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Defense Giants Lockheed Northrop ‘Locked In Battle’ To Develop Australia’s Integrated Missile Defense System,"Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman have been shortlisted by the Australian government to compete in the next round of its fifth-generation Joint Air Battle Management System (JBAMS) which will be delivered under the $1.99 billion Air-6500 Phase 1 project.

AIR-6500 is a joint “system-of-systems” that will completely revolutionize the way the Australian Defence Force operates. It synchronizes air and missile defense operations thus forming the core architecture of the ADF’s future Integrated Missile and Air Defence (IAMD) capability.

The AIR 6500/1 will improve situational awareness and enhance the speed of decision-making as it connects disparate ADF systems and platforms across all domains into a cohesive 21st-century operational environment.

JBAMS will also connect assets across air land sea cyber and space for improved defense against primary threats to national security.

It will enable ADF to maintain high interoperability levels with coalition partners. Australian Defence Minister Peter Dutton and Minister of Defence Industry Melissa Price made the announcement together on August 5 and marked the official inauguration of the second phase of the Competitive Evaluation Process (CEPS2) in order to choose the company which will oversee design development and delivery of the JBAMS.

“Defence found the down-selected companies demonstrated the best understanding of its capability requirements as well as a strong commitment to developing Australian industry capability” Price said in a statement.

“I look forward to seeing the advanced technical solutions and prototypes that will be developed as these companies refine their final offering for the Joint Air Battle Management System” she added.

These two successful companies as well as Boeing Defence Australia and Raytheon Australia were shortlisted at a preliminary stage of the CEPS program in 2016. According to the two ministers Boeing and Raytheon are still going to be involved in the development of the JBAMs and will help in boosting the Australian Defence Force’s future.

Another program Air 6502 Phase 1 (Medium Range Ground-Based Air Defence Capability) is reported to provide command-and-control systems radars and missile launchers.

According to reports both of these projects are going to be closely integrated with the Australian Army’s Land 19 Phase 7B (Short Range Ground Based Air Defence) program. Raytheon Australia had been selected to be the prime contractor for this in March 2019.

“Today’s announcement marks the next step of Air 6500/1 to work in partnership with the Australian Defence Force and industry partners to support the Royal Australian Air Force’s vision to transform into a next-generation force through delivering a sovereign highly-advanced JABMS system to protect Australia’s security” said Joe North chief executive Lockheed Martin (Australia and New Zealand).

“We look forward to collaborating with Australian industry and the RAAF to progress the solution as part of CEPS2”.

Christine Zeitz Asia Pacific managing director for Northrop Grumman also underlined the significance of growing an Australian Industrial Capability (AIC) in the development of a sovereign IAMD system.

“We will employ a highly collaborative ‘JABMS Enterprise’ approach that will bring together capabilities developed by Australia’s defense industry including active and passive sensors intelligent agents data fusion and processing through a solution architecture that is flexible open modular secure and adaptable by design” Zeitz said.

The selected strategic partner for the JBAMS system will be announced by the Australian government in late 2023.

The completion of the next-gen OPIR subsystems and payload CDR will allow Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace team to manufacture integrate and test the flight mission payload. Delivery to Lockheed Martin who is responsible for delivering the satellites for the geosynchronous orbit is scheduled for 2023.

In addition to developing a payload design for the Next-Gen GEO program Northrop Grumman was selected by the Space Force to design and develop two polar-orbiting Next-Gen OPIR space vehicles under a $2.37 billion contract from May 2020.

The first block of the new constellation will include five satellites three of which will be in geosynchronous orbit and two will be in polar orbit. Lockheed Martin will deliver the satellites for the geosynchronous orbit while Northrop Grumman will deliver polar orbit satellites.

“The Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace team brings deep mission expertise in missile warning and tracking to this program” said Scott Lee vice president and general manager payload and ground systems Northrop Grumman. “Together we’re delivering another generation of unblinking eyes in space as part of our nation’s strategic deterrence.”

As the successor to the space based infrared system (SBIRS) Next-Gen OPIR will provide an improved more resilient missile warning system to counter current and emerging threats.

The Next-Gen OPIR GEO satellites are being designed and built by Lockheed Martin. Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace are one of two teams selected by Lockheed Martin in 2018 to develop a competitive payload design for the program. Raytheon is the other competitor.

“Decades of mission experience with modern agile infrared sensor development are the hallmarks of the Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace team” said Deirdre Walsh vice president Strategic Operations Ball Aerospace. “This collaborative effort has enabled us to successfully execute the critical design review of the Next-Gen OPIR GEO Block 0 mission payload – a mission critical to our nation’s security.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvc3lyaWFuLWFybXktc2hvdC1kb3duLW1xLTRjLXRyaXRvbi11YXYtaXJhbi1jbGFpbXMtdmlkZW8v0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly9idWxnYXJpYW5taWxpdGFyeS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8wNy9zeXJpYW4tYXJteS1zaG90LWRvd24tbXEtNGMtdHJpdG9uLXVhdi1pcmFuLWNsYWltcy12aWRlby8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Syrian army shot down MQ-4C Triton UAV Iran claims [video],"DAMASCUS BM ($1= 1257.86 Syrian Pounds) – The Syrian military backed by Iranian experts shot down one of the most expensive US drones the MQ-4C Triton according to Middle East news accounts on Twitter.

🚨🇸🇾#Urgent#BREAKING :

Iran-backed Syrian Military shot down one of the most expensive US drones – MQ-4C Triton – worth about USD 200 Million using a Russian BUK-M2E battery. https://t.co/D0QEXaveIA pic.twitter.com/dZHdx2h9rl — Rangeload (@harvardfacter) August 4 2021

The plane was shot down probably from the Buk-M2 complex Rangeload news channel reported on Twitter. The Iranian agency U-news in its Twitter clarified that the drone was shot down in the province of Aleppo.

The MQ-4C Triton is operated by four operators on the ground with a length of 14.5 meters a wingspan of 39.9 meters and a height of 4.6 meters. The weight of the unmanned vehicle is 6 tons 781 kg the normal take-off weight is 14 tons 630 kg. The power plant is a turbojet engine Rolls-Royce AE 3007.

The maximum speed of the vehicle is 610 km / h the cruising speed is 575 km / h the practical range is a little over 15 thousand km.

This UAV was designed and manufactured by Northrop Grumman Corporation. It is an American military-industrial company focused on electronics and information technology space and shipbuilding.

In late July 2021 the MQ-4C Triton received a hardware and software update according to The Defensepost. According to this information a successful test flight of the renewed drone was completed on July 29. An Integrated Functional Capability-4 multifunction sensor installs on it.

In June 2019 the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) shot down an RQ-4A drone over the Strait of Hormuz. According to Tehran the device was in its airspace.

The MQ-4C Triton was initially reported to have been taken down but this has been denied in the United States. The American media reported that a prototype has been downloaded based on which they can develop technologies for using the MQ-4C Triton. BulgarianMilitary.com cannot confirm the information disseminated on social networks as our field source still does not guarantee its reliability.

The civil war in Syria

The Syrian civil war has been going on for almost a decade. Attempts by movements such as the Syrian Democratic Forces to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have failed.

The Syrian democratic forces are armed by allies and the United States while the Syrian army is armed mainly by Russia. Russia is the only country officially invited to Syria by President Bashar al-Assad.

In 2017 the United States launched a massive missile strike on Bashar al-Assad’s forces after a report emerged that the Syrian president had used chemical weapons to attack his people in the country. Syria and Russia deny such actions.

During his tenure US President Donald Trump decided to withdraw much of US troops from Syria leaving several troops to guard Syria’s oil fields on the pretext of “falling into the hands of Islamic State.”

With the withdrawal of the United States Turkey comes to the fore declaring it necessary to deal with the Kurds and the PKK movement in the northern part of the country which borders Turkey. That is why Erdogan is sending troops in an attempt to build a stable and secure 30km zone between Syria and Turkey which will prevent future terrorist attacks on Turkish territory as it is.

Ceasefire

In February 2020 Turkey lost at least 62 troops killed in Syria. Nearly 100 soldiers were wounded Syrian-backed forces destroyed dozens of Turkish armored vehicles and more than ten drones including drones were shot down. Washington has repeatedly accused Moscow of involvement in the deaths of Turkish soldiers Russia rejects these allegations.

In early March 2020 the presidents of Russia and Turkey Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed that a ceasefire came into force in the Idlib de-escalation zone. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad later said that if the US and Turkish military did not leave the country Damascus would use military power.

The reason for the Russian-Turkish negotiations was a sharp aggravation of the situation in Idlib where in January a large-scale offensive by the Syrian army against the positions of the armed opposition and terrorists began.

Government forces recaptured nearly half of the Idlib de-escalation zone and left behind several Turkish observation posts. After that Ankara sharply increased its military contingent in the region and launched the operation “Spring Shield” to push the Syrian troops. Militants are loyal to Ankara and support Turkey.

NCLH,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzA5L25vcndlZ2lhbi1jcnVpc2UtbGluZS1mbG9yaWRhLXZhY2NpbmUtcGFzc3BvcnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida vaccine passport ban: Judge backs Norwegian Cruise Line,"The Norwegian Gem a Jewel-class cruise ship of Norwegian Cruise Line docked at the Port of Miami Miami Beach Florida in April 14. Photo: Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images

A federal judge in Miami granted Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings a preliminary injunction on Sunday night in its lawsuit challenging Florida's vaccine passports ban. Why it matters: Per a statement from Norwegian U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams' order will allow the cruise line giant to ""operate in the safest way possible with 100% vaccination of all guests and crew when sailing from Florida ports.""

Its Norwegian Gem ship is due to depart Miami on Aug. 15 — marking the company's first trip from Florida since the pandemic halted cruise industry operations last year.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams' decision is a blow for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) — who signed a bill in May prohibiting businesses from requiring customers show proof that they've received COVID-19 vaccines saying getting inoculated should be a ""personal choice.""

Florida's ban came into effect on July 1 and Norwegian faced a fine of up to $5000 for every violation.

What they're saying: Williams wrote in her order that she reached the decision because Florida had failed to ""provide a valid evidentiary factual or legal predicate"" for the ban.

Williams also noted ""scientific research shows that cruise lines are hotbeds for COVID-19 transmission"" and that Norwegian ""has demonstrated that public health will be jeopardized if it is required to suspend its vaccination requirement.""

The big picture: Coronavirus hospitalizations and cases are surging across Florida. DeSantis has blamed the spike on a ""seasonal pattern"" and ""media hysteria.""

In a separate case Florida's attorney general has asked the Supreme Court to block the CDC's protocols requiring cruise lines to meet specific conditions before setting sail again.

What to watch: Peter Patterson representing Florida and state Surgeon General Scott Rivkees at a court hearing on Friday indicated that the state may take the Norwegian case to the U.S. Supreme Court Politico notes.

The Florida Department of Health and the Florida governor's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Here we go then with just another busy week of cruise news! We’ve got updates from all three major cruise lines including Carnival Cruise Line updating its requirements Norwegian Cruise Line restarting U.S. operations and a big update from Royal Caribbean on the next batch of ships that are restarting. MSC Cruises has kicked off cruises from Florida and we will end with some sad news coming from Alaska which we all need to spare a thought on. So let’s get started.

Norwegian Cruise Line Resumes in the U.S.

Today is a huge day for Norwegian Cruise Line with the restart of its operations in the U.S. for the first time in over 500 days! Norwegian Encore is departing out of the Port of Seattle Washington which also restarts NCL’s Alaska season.

So the newest ship in the fleet will begin sailing seven-day voyages including stops at Icy Strait Point Skagway Juneau and Ketchikan. Sailings will continue through October 16 and when Norwegian Encore does call at Icy Strait Point it will be at the new second pier which has been developed by parent company Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings.

Norwegian Jade became the first NCL ship to restart operations when she departed out of Piraeus Greece on July 25. The vessel is also the first in the fleet to homeport in Piraeus the port for Athens and currently sailing the Greek Isles. Norwegian Gem will be the next to restart cruises on August 15 out of Miami Florida.

Norwegian Cruise Line is keeping things straightforward and simple by having all crew members and all guests fully vaccinated. There are no exemptions or people on board that will not be vaccinated like on other cruise lines.

Carnival Cruise Line Updates Protocols

Cruise lines are adapting to the developing health concern to make sure guests can remain safe during a cruise vacation. This also includes Carnival Cruise Line which has already restarted operations with five vessels including the new Mardi Gras.

The cruise line has made changes to its protocols across all cruise ships. From August 7 all guests will be required to wear a face mask in specific indoor areas especially in busy areas. When outdoors guests can continue to not wear a mask just as before. The new mask-wearing policy will continue through October 31 2021.

Carnival Cruise Line is also implementing a new pre-testing requirement effective from August 14 2021 through October 31. With this new requirement guests who are fully vaccinated will also have to show proof of a negative PCR or antigen test result taken within three days before embarkation. The cruise line will not be offering a test in the terminal something which some other cruise lines are doing.

The new changes are all detailed on the cruise line’s Have Fun Be Safe health measures and details could change in the future as the situation remains fluid. Carnival has already made several itinerary changes due to ports of call having different restrictions such as the Cayman Islands which is not allowing cruise ships to visit until early 2022.

More Royal Caribbean Ships to Restart

Royal Caribbean has released when each remaining ship will resume cruise operations. The entire fleet will be back in service by Spring 2022 including from the U.S. Australia Europe and Asia. So far seven vessels have already resumed operations and the cruise line has already announced restart dates for August.

MSC Cruises Restarts Sailings in the U.S.

Even though MSC Cruises has already been back in service in Europe for many months it’s now able to also focus on its return from the U.S. MSC Merviglia became the first in the fleet to resume sailings from the U.S. on August 2.

The vessel is sailing three- and four-night cruises to the Bahamas including a call to MSC’s own private island of Ocean Cay. The ship will also sail seven-night eastern and western Caribbean cruises from September 18 2021. The week-long sailings include two separate calls at the cruise line’s private island and Nassau in the Bahamas and Ocho Rios in Jamaica.

Cruises from the U.S. will be for vaccinated and unvaccinated guests who will have more restrictions during voyages to ensure everyone on board remains protected. There is also testing at embarkation and periodic testing of the crew. There is a range of protocols in place as part of MSC’s health and safety program.

Norwegian Cruise Line Update

It’s that time of year when cruise lines are releasing their business updates including Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and its three cruise brands of Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.

The good news is that the situation is on the up especially now that Norwegian Jade became the first in the fleet to resume operations in late July! The ship departed Piraeus in Greece on July 25 with guests onboard. It marks NCL’s great comeback something the company has been covering with its EMBARK video series.

All 28 cruise ships across the three brands are expected to be back sailing by April 1 2022. 75% of the fleet is to be operating by the end of this year. The restart will really begin to increase through August with Norwegian Encore becoming the first in the fleet to restart in the U.S. as we mentioned earlier.

On the booking front the situation is looking more positive. Despite reduced marketing 2022 bookings are looking stronger than in 2019. This even includes bookings using Future Cruise Credits due to previous cancellations. Ticket sales were $1.4 billion as of June 30 2021.

The strong bookings come in good time with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings having a monthly average cash burn of $200 million in the second quarter. This is higher than the $190 million in the first quarter. It comes as cruise lines are having to prepare for the restart of operations globally. This includes several things such as bringing ships back up to full crew capacity provisions maintenance and repositioning to homeports.

You can read the full business update from the cruise company over on the website along with the latest situation with the State of Florida on its vaccine passport ban.

Floatplane Crash in Alaska

We end with some very sad news indeed as a floatplane crashed on Thursday and the U.S. Coast Guard confirmed that all six people on board died. Five of those were cruise passengers from the Nieuw Amsterdam cruise ship which was docked in Ketchikan for the day. One person was the pilot of the sightseeing plane.

The passengers were on a tour not booked through the cruise line and the wreckage of the plane was found at approximately 2:37 PM on a ridgeline near the Misty Fjords area in Alaska. We have the full coverage over on cruisehive.com and our thoughts are with the families and friends during this difficult time and while cruise lines are celebrating their return to Alaska in recent days just spare a thought to those who lost their lives.

The benchmarks were posted over at Zhihu & show how well the latest RDNA 2 GPU competes against high-end laptop offerings from NVIDIA.

AMD Radeon RX 6700M Gaming Performance Benchmarks Revealed Faster Than The NVIDIA RTX 3070

The AMD Radeon RX 6700M is one of the two graphics chips to make use of the Navi 22 GPU SKU the other being the RX 6800M. This particular configuration of the Navi 22 GPU is only available on the mobile platform.

The RX 6700M was featured on an MSI DELTA 15 which is a certified AMD Advantage gaming laptop that packs the Ryzen 9 5900HX CPU & 16 GB of DDR4-3200 (Single Rank x8) memory. A Razer Blade 14 laptop featuring the Ryzen 9 5900HX & NVIDIA RTX 3070MQ GPU was used as a comparison to see how well RDNA 2 performs against NVIDIA's mobility offerings. But do note that both laptops feature different cooling designs and different TDPs for CPUs/GPUs so comparisons aren't always fair.

The AMD Radeon RX 6700M is also based on the Navi 22 GP but rocks a cut-down 2304 core chip. It comes with the same 2.3 GHz clock speeds but features a cut-down 160-bit memory bus interface for a total of 10 GB GDDR6 memory capacity and also only 80MB of Infinity Cache. The chip has a TGP range of up to 135W and will be targeted at 1440p & 1080p gaming.

In terms of performance AMD hasn't shown much for the Radeon RX 6700M so this is actually the first time that we get to see its actual gaming horsepower. The specifications do make it come close to the RX 6800M so we are looking at around RTX 3070 performance while the RX 6800M should be competing against the RTX 3080.

So coming to the benchmarks we first have to point out that the AMD Radeon RX 6700M comes in three TDP flavors a 135W 110W and 80W SKU. It looks like this particular variant that's featured in MSI's DELTA 15 Gaming notebook is a 110W variant given its power consumption that averages at 130W in a GPU-bound scenario. So this 110W variant is being compared to the 80W GeForce RTX 3070MQ within the Razer Blade 14 laptop.

Another downside of the Razer Blade 14 is that it has its memory soldered to the motherboard which is definitely going to perform worse than SO-DIMM modules featured on the MSI DELTA 15 variant. This implementation can adversely affect gaming performance for the RTX 3070 variant.

In terms of performance the graphics card is around 9% faster on average and up to 30% faster (in Hitman 2 DX12) than the NVIDIA RTX 3070. You also have to take into account the 37.5% increased power rating over the NVIDIA RTX 3070 which makes the RTX 3070 stand out slightly more efficient in terms of overall performance numbers. If you were to compare both the 80W RTX 3070 and the RX 6700M then I'd doubt that both of those would have any major differences in terms of gaming performance.

The first results of an independent performance test of the AMD Radeon RX 6700M have been posted.

MSI Delta 15 Source: MSI

Zhihu offers a first look at the just-released Radeon RX 6700M laptop GPU which was installed in MSI Delta 15 laptop. This gaming laptop is equipped with AMD Ryzen 5000H series CPUs exclusively. The Delta 15 supports AMD SmartShift technology which allows for the transition of unused power from the GPU to CPU and vice versa depending on the workload.

AMD RX 6700M is based on a cut-down Navi 22 GPU with 2304 Stream Processors. This mobile graphics card is equipped with 10GB GDDR6 memory across a 160-bit bus a somewhat unique configuration for this GPU that is not even available for desktop variants of Navi 22.

The first thing that was tested was the 3DMark Time Spy synthetic benchmark. It’s a quick comparison between an old unspecified version of the driver and a newer Adrenalin 21.7.2 which was the first to officially support this graphics card. The card scored 9282 points with the pre-launch driver and 9837 points with 21.7.2 (6% difference).

Officially Radeon RX 6700M graphics card is designed for 1080p up to 1440p gaming. A large capacity of 10GB GDDR6 memory may be enough to store high-fidelity textures. The tests that have been posted are focusing on 1080p gaming in unspecified settings.

AMD Radeon RX 6700M Gaming Performance Source: Zhihu

On average the graphics card offers 109.1% performance of GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU in Max-Q settings (80W). What is important to note is that the SKU that was tested (R21M-E110-70) is offered with a TGP of 80W 110W and 135W. Neither the person testing nor MSI offers clear information on which variant is installed in Delta 15. However as noted by the author of the test it is definitely not the 135W version as the GPU power peaks at 115W including SmartShift. That said it should be a 110W version.

AMD Radeon RX 6700M TGP estimation Source: Zhihu

In other words the Radeon RX 6700M 110W appears to be 9.1% faster than GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU 80W. A higher TGP is definitely the dominant factor why the AMD card is faster. However these are just the first tests that were shared and we expected much more detailed comparisons including the same TGP variants soon.

It is also worth noting that the official product page for Delta 15 also offers a preview of RX6700M gaming performance however this data is not compared to any other known MSI laptop.

A shortage of semiconductors has helped pump up the valuations of firms such as Nvidia whose chips power everything from video-gaming to machine learning and data centres. But boom time for sellers means misery for buyers. Carmakers whose products have become computers on wheels are among the victims. Profits at Ford America’s second-biggest carmaker by volume fell by half in the most recent quarter amid a global shortage of chips. Analysts say the industry might build around 5m fewer cars this year all for want of their tiniest components.

Carmakers are not the only firms feeling the pinch. Apple and Microsoft have also warned that they will be affected. Politicians are being drawn in too. Chips will be on the agenda later this month when America’s vice-president Kamala Harris visits Vietnam which has a flourishing electronics industry. Angela Merkel the outgoing German chancellor has lamented Europe’s small share of global chip production.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2V2Z2EtdG8tZml4LWl0cy1icm9rZW4tZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA5MC1mdHczLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRzLXRocm91Z2gtYS1iaW9zLXVwZGF0ZS_SAWtodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9ldmdhLXRvLWZpeC1pdHMtYnJva2VuLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwOTAtZnR3My1ncmFwaGljcy1jYXJkcy10aHJvdWdoLWEtYmlvcy11cGRhdGUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVGA To Fix Its Broken GeForce RTX 3090 FTW3 Graphics Cards Through A BIOS Update,"Over the last several weeks we have followed the controversy with company EVGA's RTX 3090 series graphics card becoming bricked while playing Amazon's New World game. Here is a recap of the journey of these two companies.

EVGA To Fix RPM Sensor Spikes on GeForce RTX 3090 FTW3 Series Graphics Cards Through BIOS Firmware Update

First it was reported that NVIDIA GPUs were becoming bricked during the gameplay of Amazon's brand new game New World currently in beta. As more developments came to light Igor Wallossek of Igor's Lab made a breakthrough and through trial and error mixed with a little speculation he discovered that EVGA's RTX 3090 FTW3 card was the specific model that was malfunctioning while playing the game.

His thoughts behind his answer were due to design flaws with the specific card a correction that NVIDIA made several years ago in the original design that other manufacturers have made workarounds to fix. The EVGA RTX 3090 FTW3 has a faulty design in the fan controller. During the process the framerate in the game becomes locked via the menus in-game. Because of the extremely high framerates that were being produced other experts were suspecting that not only EVGA's GPU was the problem but so were other graphics cards such as the Radeon RX 6800 to 6900 XT GPUs by AMD and the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti series by NVIDIA as well.

EVGA quickly started to allow for standard and Advanced RMAs to be created to alleviate the issues happening during gameplay because of their design. It was discovered that when placing an Advanced RMA for the replacement EVGA RTX 3090 series GPU the deposit that was required was not the same MSRP cost of the card (around $920) but a deposit of almost $1800. The price is similar to what was found with GPUs being purchased from scalpers. EVGA did not comment on the issue but website Tom's Hardware speculated that the reason for the high cost was to deter someone from paying the deposit for normal MSRP receiving the replacement unit and turning around and selling the card themselves for a high dollar amount and not returning the faulty product.

Now Jacob Freeman PM of EVGA took to Twitter and assured that there would be an update to the firmware of the EVGA RTX 3090 FTW3 that would fix the RPM issue. Keep in mind that EVGA has never stated that they were responsible for any issues. Amazon did release a statement denying that the game was not an issue but did release an update to halt any overclocking during gameplay that would initiate an issue with any GPU manufacturer's cards.

Update: Will have new firmware for cards soon to improve this. This may occur if there happens to be noise in the i2c bus from where RPM is read. Precision already filters out erroneous readings but other apps may not. This is strictly a RPM reporting issue. https://t.co/xnMpWq86NX — Jacob Freeman (@EVGA_JacobF) August 6 2021

Freeman explains that the fault is in the noise of the I2C bus where the data from the RPM is read. He continues to state that any users utilizing EVGA's Precision software will be covered due to the filtration of the bus when reading the data.

Is there any official info yet on what caused the failure of some cards in New World? Some saw the problem in a faulty PWM controller and justified this with the high RPM signal which they read out. As I understand you now it is simply a faulty I2C signal and not related. — Andreas Schilling (@aschilling) August 6 2021

We will continue to follow this story as more information develops."

(GS Stanek Racing Photography)

WHEATLAND Mo. – Dereck Ramirez scored a successful repeat of the 12th annual Slick Mist Show-Me Shootout Presented by Foley Equipment leading wire to wire Saturday night at Lucas Oil Speedway.

The USMTS points leader from Woodward Okla. dominated the 40-lap feature to take home $10000. Ramirez beat Dustin Sorensen by 1.8 seconds for his third series victory of the season.

In victory lane Ramirez thanked his crew for talking him into recently breaking out a new car. He also expressed his affinity for Lucas Oil Speedway after another winning drive at the facility.

“I love this place. It’s probably the greatest facility we go to” Ramirez said. “Everybody that works here and all the fans that come out and support us … plus I have to thank these guys here. We wrecked the car at Ogilvie (Minnesota). They worked their butts off at the shop to put this (car) together.

“It’s been a dream to drive. I’m glad we made that decision. It’s good.”

Ramirez became the first repeat Show-Me Shootout winner and the first three-time USMTS winner at Lucas Oil Speedway.

Ramirez was making it a runaway cruising to the lead from his front-row starting position and widening the gap as green-flag after green-flag lap went by.

Ramirez had a four-second lead over Sorensen after 32 laps when the race’s first caution came out as Dillon McCowan spun between turns one and two. McCowan the Cedar Creek Beef Jerky USRA Modified track points leader ran as high as third earlier in the race and was eighth when he spun after finding fluid from a car experiencing mechanical issues right in front of him.

Sorensen started seventh and worked his way into second by lap 25 but was making little headway in closing the gap on Ramirez as the duo worked their way through lapped traffic.

The caution wiped out Ramirez’s comfortable margin and set the stage for an eight-lap sprint to the finish as Ramirez led Sorensen Tyler Wolff Carlos Ahumada Jr. and Terry Phillips.

As the race returned to green Wolff and Sorensen had a tight squeeze coming off turn two and Wolff rolled to a stop in turn three bringing out another yellow flag.

Ramirez took care of business as the race resumed and remained green over the final seven laps. He pulled away to beat Sorensen by about a dozen car lengths. Rodney Sanders rallied from eighth to finish third with Jake O’Neil going from 14th to fourth. Ahumada finished fifth.

“I don’t like the yellows there at the end especially running the bottom there” Ramirez said. “I kind of judge myself off the lapped cars and none of them were making a move up top. But I knew Rodney or TP (Phillips) or any of them guys could get up there and get it done.

“Dustin he’s a high-side guy and kind of scared me on the restart. But I saw he picked the bottom and that made it a little easier on me.”

Also picking up feature wins on Saturday night were Ryan Gillmore (Ozark Golf Cars USRA B-Mods) and Derek Brown (O’Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Cars).

I took my first flight in 15 months in late May traveling from Milwaukee to Atlanta for my nephew’s high school graduation.

While some things had changed since I last boarded a plane in the “before times” of 2019 flying is weirdly exactly the same and also wildly different at the same time.

Here’s how air travel in 2021 feels:

Same: The guy in front of me in the TSA security line has several individually packaged bags of his personal snack mix blend which he must carefully (and slowly) place into the TSA bins.

Different: Everyone’s wearing masks. Don’t argue about it; just do it.

Same: Once you’ve cleared the long security line you discover your flight’s gate is the farthest one from where you’re standing. Of course it is!

Different: People in the airport chat casually about being “shot.” Mercifully it has nothing to do with our epidemic of gun violence and everything to do with staying safe by getting the COVID-19 vaccine.

Same: I don’t have to use the restroom. Really I don’t. Until I’m seated on the plane. Now I have to calculate what will last longer: My bladder or a flight to Atlanta.

Different: People are gladly paying outrageous airport prices — $8 for a small black coffee! — because they’re so happy to be traveling again.

Same: All the other planes seem to be going to better destinations — Orlando home of Disney World and Los Angeles home of Hollywood stars. But it could have been worse; while I was heading to Atlanta the folks one gate over were flying to Toledo. (Which I’m sure is a lovely city.)

Different: On the plane you hold up one two or three fingers to order your beverage of choice instead of talking through a mask. Coming soon: Improv theater at 18000 feet in the air!

Same: My bag will be the last one to show up on the luggage carousel. And before you ask why I check luggage at all: Bags fly free on Southwest Airline and the bargain hunter in me just can’t ignore that offer.

Different: Tearful airport greetings start with “I haven’t seen you in two years!” as family and friends hug each other.

Most importantly the same: Pandemic or not the best flight is an uneventful flight. Everyone gets on and off the ground safely. And that’s much more important than getting stuck in the middle seat or getting hung up in the TSA lines.

Now fasten that seatbelt and prepare for takeoff.",,,,,,,,,

The company introduced new service centers in Benicia Calif.; Phoenixville Pa.; and Kenosha Wis.; bringing its total count to 248 service centers and relocated and/or expanded three more facilities in Colorado Springs Colo.; Milford Conn.; and Warren Ohio.

In the past 10 years the company says it has spent $1.7 billion in expanding its service center network equating to a 50% increase in door count during that period.

Old Dominion opened the 20-door Benicia facility to expand coverage in-between its San Francisco and Sacramento service centers. The new facility will allow Old Dominion to better service its wine country customers in Napa Sonoma and the surrounding area the company says eliminating three major daily bridge crossings for trucks coming from the San Francisco area.

The 55-door Phoenixville facility opened in response to rapidly-growing freight volume across Pennsylvania. The service center covers an area between its Philadelphia facility and other Old Dominion service centers in the middle of the state simplifying a region that was previously serviced out of four different centers across Pennsylvania New Jersey and Delaware the company says.

Old Dominion opened the 103-door Kenosha facility as southeastern Wisconsin–Kenosha and Racine counties in particular–saw major business growth the company says. The company once serviced the area out of its Milwaukee service center but needed a facility closer to its growing number of distribution manufacturing packing and pharmaceutical customers. The service center’s location is just two miles from I-94 and its available space for an additional 51 doors will allow it to grow alongside the burgeoning business community.

Benicia Phoenixville and Kenosha are not Old Dominion’s only capacity additions.

He was born in Providence Rhode Island to his parents Meyer (Mickey) and Bella (Barbara) Bazar both of blessed memory. At the age of 3 his parents moved the family to Norfolk. They lived in the Ghent area and he attended Taylor Elementary School. The family later moved to Wards Corner area where he graduated from Granby High School. Jerry continued his education at Old Dominion University and graduated with a degree in business from Bryant College in Providence.

During his last two years at Bryant Jerry married Ronda Goldberg of Norfolk. They started their life together completing their education skiing and spending time with the extremely close knit Bazar family in Providence. After graduation they moved back to Norfolk where Jerry joined the family business Bazar Inc. a company representing manufacturers to the U.S. military exchanges. He later started his company World Wide Sales Inc. where he worked until retirement at age 58.

Shortly after moving back to Norfolk with Ronda Jerry started a hobby that would last his entire life — showing and breeding Afghan hounds. While traveling around the world for business and pleasure he met people with Afghans. He began breeding and showing his dogs all over the U.S. gaining much recognition for his knowledge of the breed and showing multiple champion dogs. His greatest joy was showing his champion Casbar Sugar-N-Spice at the Westminster Kennel Club Show in New York. Jerry belonged to many organizations involving his dogs. He was a member of the American Kennel Club Tidewater Afghan Hound Club and the Tidewater Kennel Club.

Jerry and Ronda were blessed with two wonderful sons Jason Samuel Bazar and Darin Jacob Bazar. He loved teaching them to ski and traveling with them sharing with them exciting places and experiences. Such joy filled his heart when the boys each got married and when Jason and his wife Dee Ann Dorsey gave him his grandson Evan Dorsey Bazar. They could not have enriched his life more.

Family and friends were important to Jerry and he always looked for an opportunity to entertain and enjoy the home he and Ronda lived in together for 48 years. Jerry leaves behind his wife of 55 years Ronda his son Darin his son Jason and his wife Dee Ann and grandson Evan. Jerry also leaves behind his dear sister Ellen Harris and her husband Jonathan and nieces and nephews that all gave him much joy.

Many thanks to all his friends and family who helped him deal with cancer this last year and a half. Words cannot be expressed to our dear and treasured friend Tracee Elwess for always being there for Jerry. They have spent many years not only as friends but as partners in showing and owning Afghans. Mark Evans and Jennifer Watson of Sentara Home Care were wonderful and provided physical therapy that kept Jerry walking until the end. Special thanks also to Freda H. Gordon Hospice & Palliative Care of Tidewater for their great assistance.

In lieu of flowers donations may be made to the American Cancer Society or another charity of choice.

A graveside service will be held at 12 noon on Tuesday August 10 2021 at Forest Lawn Cemetery 8100 Granby St. Norfolk VA 23505 with Rabbi Roz Mandelberg and Cantor Jen Rueben. A live stream of this service can be viewed in the frame below.

The Dominion Post is helping the community reduce reuse and recycle.

There are a number of ways to recycle around Morgantown. The Monongalia County Commission provides drop-off recycling at the Westover City Building. Every year MUB holds an annual Household Hazardous Waste Collection Day; the city’s Recycle Right Morgantown campaign; and The Monongalia Solid Waste Authority provides information and resources related to recycling and solid waste.

However The Dominion Post is a great resource for recycling newspapers and other corrugated products such as those Amazon boxes.

“Our ‘Project Green’ recycling initiative has been in place for over a decade” said Chris Halterman production director at The Dominion Post. “We offer all types of newspaper recycling and for corrugated products.”

All newsprint from The Dominion Post is made of 100% recycled paper. “We want to make sure that we are continuing to offer an avenue for our customers to re-recycle the products that we sell” said Halterman.

“Recycling is important because we are all stewards of the environment” said Andrew Stacy communications director of the City of Morgantown. “It’s up to everyone to preserve and protect our resources so that we can enjoy them now and our children can enjoy them in the future.”

Recycling can help save energy and conserve natural resources. It can also help create and maintain jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industries.

Anyone can drop off any newsprint and corrugated products at The Dominion Post’s warehouse which is adjacent to the building at 1251 Earl L. Core Road in Sabraton. Drop-off hours are from 7:30 a.m.-3 p.m. Monday through Friday.

South Korea thus began pushing to become self-sufficient in high-tech chip materials.

But so far South Korea's efforts to cut its reliance on Japan-made materials have not progressed as much as the government says they have and trade statistics show the economies' interdependency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlbC10by1zcGVuZC11cC10by0xMjAtYmlsbGlvbi1vbi1uZXctdXMtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1odWLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel: Upcoming US Fab Will Be a Small City to Cost $60 to $120 Billion,"Intel has revealed some additional details about its upcoming brand-new fab complex in the U.S. Patrick Gelsinger chief executive of Intel said that the new fab campus will cost between $60 billion and $120 billion will include multiple modules capable of processing wafers using Intel’s advanced process technologies and chip packaging facilities. In addition the company aims to build it adjacent to a university to simplify the hiring of new personnel.

As part of its IDM 2.0 strategy Intel is set to decide on the exact location of its next major semiconductor manufacturing hub in the U.S by the end of this year. The fab will include between six and eight modules that will produce chips using the company’s leading-edge fabrication processes will be able to package chips using Intel’s proprietary techniques like EMIB and Foveros and will also run a dedicated power plant Pat Gelsinger said in an interview with the Washington Post.

Each semiconductor fabrication module will cost between $10 billion and $15 billion so Intel’s investments into the hub over the next decade could be as ‘low’ as $60 billion and could top $120 billion.

“We are looking broadly across the U.S.” Gelsinger told the Washington Post. “This would be a very large site so six to eight fab modules and at each of those fab modules between 10- and $15 billion. It's a project over the next decade on the order of $100 billion of capital 10000 direct jobs. 100000 jobs are created as a result of those 10000 by our experience. So essentially we want to build a little city.”

At this point Intel does not disclose which nodes the first module of the fab will support. Yet since it will start operations sometime in 2024 at the earliest the new facility will probably produce chips using the Intel 4 and the Intel 3 manufacturing technologies. Eventually the fab complex will adopt more advanced fabrication technologies. The production capacity of the upcoming fab is unknown so is its location. Intel needs to build its next manufacturing in a location with well-developed infrastructure adequate supply of water and energy. Also the company plans to build it near big cities with universities in a bid to higher qualified personnel.

“We're engaging with a number of states across the United States today who are giving us proposals for site locations energy water environmentals near universities skill capacity and I expect to make an announcement about that location before the end of this year” Gelsinger said.

Earlier this year Intel outlined plans to spend $20 billion on advancing its manufacturing operations in Arizona.

We are looking at what we have in our inventory and the balancing act that needs to be done” said M&M executive director Rajesh Jejurikar M&M’s comment comes after Maruti Suzuki announced plans of cutting down production due to the chip crisis.Already the chip shortage has begun to impact M&M’s product delivery plans. “We will make delivery announcements about the XUV700 when we have more confidence regarding the semiconductor situation” Jejurikar said. “Right now The situation is very dynamic.” What has hit companies like M&M is the resurgence of the pandemic in Asian countries like Malaysia which are semiconductor sourcing hubs. “Malaysia is going through a serious wave of the pandemic and since a lot of semiconductors come from the Asian side it is affecting supplies” said M&M CEO Anish Shah Meanwhile M&M reported a profit of Rs 424 crore in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 on the back of improved demand for its models. On a comparative basis it made a loss of Rs 49 crore a year earlier. Revenue zoomed 60% to Rs 19172 crore. Though demand improved compared to last year when Covid induced a countrywide lockdown M&M remains under pressure as “commodity inflation and semiconductor supply issues continue to be of concern”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3NjaXRlY2hkYWlseS5jb20vZGVjYWRlcy1vZi1yZXNlYXJjaC1icmluZ3MtcXVhbnR1bS1kb3RzLXRvLWJyaW5rLW9mLXdpZGVzcHJlYWQtdXNlLWluLWEtcmFuZ2Utb2YtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decades of Research Brings Quantum Dots to Brink of Widespread Use in a Range of Technology Applications,"Review article in Science covers a wide range of breakthroughs including Los Alamos’ role in key advances.

A new article in Science magazine gives an overview of almost three decades of research into colloidal quantum dots assesses the technological progress for these nanometer-sized specs of semiconductor matter and weighs the remaining challenges on the path to widespread commercialization for this promising technology with applications in everything from TVs to highly efficient sunlight collectors.

“Thirty years ago these structures were just a subject of scientific curiosity studied by a small group of enthusiasts. Over the years quantum dots have become industrial-grade materials exploited in a range of traditional and emerging technologies some of which have already found their way into commercial markets” said Victor I. Klimov a coauthor of the paper and leader of the team conducting quantum dot research at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Many advances described in the Science article originated at Los Alamos including the first demonstration of colloidal quantum dot lasing the discovery of carrier multiplication pioneering research into quantum dot light emitting diodes (LEDs) and luminescent solar concentrators and recent studies of single-dot quantum emitters.

Using modern colloidal chemistry the dimensions and internal structure of quantum dots can be manipulated with near-atomic precision which allows for highly accurate control of their physical properties and thereby behaviors in practical devices.

A number of ongoing efforts on practical applications of colloidal quantum dots have exploited size-controlled tunability of their emission color and high-emission quantum yields near the ideal 100 percent limit. These properties are attractive for screen displays and lighting the technologies where quantum dots are used as color-converting phosphors. Due to their narrowband spectrally tunable emission quantum dots allow for improved color purity and more complete coverage of the entire color space compared to the existing phosphor materials. Some of these devices such as quantum dot TVs have already reached technological maturity and are available in commercial markets.

The next frontier is creating technologically viable LEDs powered by electrically driven quantum dots. The Science review describes various approaches to implement these devices and discusses the existing challenges. Quantum LEDs have already reached impressive brightness and almost ideal efficiencies near the theoretically defined limits. Much of this progress has been driven by continuing advances in understanding the performance-limiting factors such as nonradiative Auger recombination.

The article also discusses the status and challenges of solution-processable quantum dot lasers.

“Making these lasers available would benefit a range of technologies including integrated photonic circuits optical communication lab-on-a-chip platforms wearable devices and medical diagnostics” Klimov said.

Los Alamos researchers have contributed key advances in this area including the elucidation of mechanisms for light amplification in colloidal nanostructures and the first demonstration of a lasing effect using these materials.

“The primary current challenge is demonstrating lasing with electrical pumping” Klimov said. “Los Alamos has been responsible for several important milestones on the path to this objective including the realization of optical gain with electrical excitation and the development of dual-function devices that operate as an optically pumped laser and a standard electrically driven LED.”

Quantum dots are also of great potential utility in solar harvesting and light sensing technologies. Due to their tunable bandgap they can be engineered to target a particular range of wavelengths which is especially attractive for realizing inexpensive photodetectors for the infrared spectral range. In the realm of solar energy technologies colloidal quantum dots have been exploited as active elements of both solar cells and luminescent sunlight collectors.

In the case of photovoltaics (PV) the quantum dot approach could be used to realize a new generation of inexpensive thin-film PV devices prepared by scalable solution-based techniques such as roll-by-roll processing. In addition they could enable conceptionally new photoconversion schemes derived from physical processes unique to ultrasmall “quantum-confined” colloidal particles. One such process carrier multiplication generates multiple electron-hole pairs by a single absorbed photon. This process first reported by Los Alamos researchers in 2004 has been the subject of intense research in the context of its applications in both PVs and solar photochemistry.

“Another highly promising area is quantum dot luminescent solar concentrators or LSCs” Klimov said. “Using the LSC approach one can in principle convert standard windows or wall sidings into power-generating devices. Along with roof-top solar modules this could help supply an entire building with clean energy. While the LSC concept was introduced back in 1970s it truly flourished only recently due to the introduction of specially engineered quantum dots.”

Los Alamos researchers have contributed many important advances to the LSC field including the development of practical approaches for tackling the problem of light self-absorption and developing high-efficiency bi-layer (tandem) devices. Several start-ups including a Laboratory spin-off UbiQD Inc. have been actively pursuing commercialization of a quantum dot LSC technology.

Baleno is one of the models being built at this plant which crossed its 1 million unit milestone in October 2020. (representational image)

Maruti Suzuki’s production in August 2021 will partially be impacted at its contract manufacturing plant in Gujarat due to a global shortage of semiconductor chips. Production will be stopped on August 7 14 and 21 and some of the production lines may see cut to one shift instead of two temporarily.

Semiconductor shortage still affecting automotive industry

Passenger vehicles use around 1000 semiconductors

Automotive sector not biggest market for semiconductors

Global semiconductor shortage

As per a regulatory filing on the exchanges “As the situation is dynamic and uncertain the company will monitor and take a day-to-day decision on models lines or shifts to optimise resources for maximum efficiency.""

Globally the semiconductor shortage is leading to headwinds across the automotive industry well into the second half of 2021. The problem stemmed from increased demand for personal computers tablets and smartphones at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic which largely diverted supply away from the automotive sector.

A passenger vehicle typically uses around 1000 semiconductors and any slowdown in the supply chain results in manufacturing coming to a grinding halt.

Suzuki Motor Gujarat (SMG) a subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corporation supplies fully-built cars to Maruti Suzuki for its domestic and export market needs. In October 2020 SMG became the fastest production site for the passenger vehicle major to achieve an accumulated automobile production capacity of 1 million units. The total production capacity at SMG’s plant A B and C is over 750000 units.

Maruti Suzuki India sales

As far as sales are concerned with 133732 units of vehicles sold in July 21 Maruti Suzuki inched closer to its July 2018 sales level of 152427 units. On a month-on-month basis too MSIL registered an uptick of 7.60 percent over the 124280 units sold in June 2021.

Meanwhile speaking of upcoming launches Maruti Suzuki is lining up a slew of model updates apart from the all-new Celerio’s market launch slated to take place in the coming months.

Nasty put some soap on!

Jake Gyllenhaal is the latest celebrity to brag about his hygiene habits or lack thereof. “More and more I find bathing to be less necessary at times” he told Vanity Fair. “I do believe because Elvis Costello is wonderful that good manners and bad breath get you nowhere. So I do [brush my teeth].” It’s better than nothing but don’t good manners apply to neck down too?

Ironically he volunteered this information in an interview about becoming the face of Prada’s Luna Rossa Ocean fragrance which was inspired the Italian sailing team. Was the skipped shower talk a testament to how well the cologne works? The Academy Award-nominated actor stars as a lone sailor battling the sea in the fragrance’s campaign film which in hindsight feels like a metaphor for Prada’s funk-fighting abilities. “It’s about interacting with the forces of nature and how they’re overpowering” Gyllenhaal said about the ad’s concept. ” When discussing his own aquatic experiences Gyllenhaal is the one to mysteriously mention hygiene.

“Well mostly it’s through showering. It’s mostly a bathing interaction” he shared. “This is not actual water like the Hudson but there was that great spa Aire that has water underground.”

Nothing screams “dust in the tub” like describing it as a “bathing interaction.”

When asked about his shower ritual he dismissed the necessity and said “there’s a whole world of not bathing that is also really helpful for skin maintenance and we naturally clean ourselves.”

Of course Twitter had plenty to say about the Spider-Man: Far From Home star’s unprovoked and unwashed confession.

Now this courtside candid picture with Jay and Bey takes on a whole new meaning.

While opposing sides of the anti-soap debate usually fall along racial and cultural divides stars like Andy Richter and Chris Evans don’t want to be lumped in with their putrid pale peers.

Gyllenhaal also mentioned a fascination with loofah sponges since childhood so maybe there’s still hope for him to use them regularly. It’s not always a bad thing to be washed up Jake!",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jack Sullivan was the 3rd of 9 siblings. Even at a young age Jack was a dependable and honorable man. At 12 years old he built his first car from the ground up using his own hard earned money.

After his father's passing at 13 Jack took up the mantle to care for his family always taking pride in the work he did. Through this hard work he was able to open his own garage while working full time at a rubber factory. His work ethic only grew eventually closing his garage to take up the role of a foreman at Newberry Rubber while he went to night school to become a future machinist at Parker-Hannifin until he retired in 2008 at 65. Jack spent his life dedicated to the future of his family and his legacy. Every day he endeavored to pass his lifetime of experience on to his children and grandchildren.

One of his favorite stories to tell was that when he first saw Virginia leaving the Church of God he said ""I'm gonna marry that girl someday"" and he did. When the wife he loved so much fell gravely ill he dedicated everything he had to become her around the clock in-home care. After 58 years of blissful marriage God called her home to him in 2018. Though Jack was never alone with plenty of family nearby life was not quite the same since. Teresa continued her dedication to her father assisting with daily chores care and company over the last 3 years. With loved ones beside him Jack Sullivan was called home on August 8th of 2021. Forever after Jack and Virginia are now reunited in Heaven.

Jack was preceded in death by his loving wife of 58 years Virginia Sullivan. His siblings Ronald Joyce and Meryl and his great-granddaughter Scarlet.

He is survived in life by his siblings Bobby Larry Pete Paul Jerry. His daughters Teresa and Pamela. His grandchildren Tim Mark JT and Richard. He is also survived by his sister-in-law Shirley.

Friends will be received at the Wood-Kortright-Borkoski Funeral Home 703 E. Main St. Ravenna on Saturday August 14 2021 from 10:00am until 11:00am. Funeral services officiated by Pastor Roy Harman will begin at 11:00am. Interment will follow at Drakesburg Cemetery.

He was a physician who was based in Michigan and he founded the Michigan based Stryker Corporation. Fast forward to today Kevin Lobo is propelling it to supply over 100 countries with medical devices. Kevin Lobo has been a phenomenal figure at the corporation. He has led the corporation into overwhelming success and has made it a pioneer in many aspects of improving global healthcare. His success has made him a person of interest and the following are 10 things you didn't know about Stryker CEO Kevin Lobo.

1. He led Stryker’s first mega Chinese acquisition

This 48-year-old led Stryker into buying a company that makes pelvic reconstruction plates. The Chinese company was the largest in the country and it was bought at $764 million. The funny thing is that the purchase was Kevin’s first acquisition as a Chief Executive officer and it served as a glimpse of his bold and daring demeanor. He personally acknowledges that it was the first time he did something so robust and he asserts that he values the lessons he learned from the move immensely.

2. He didn’t anticipate his ascent to Stryker’s top position

Lobo became the CEO of Stryker after the unprecedented resignation of the then Stryker President and Chairman. After MacMillan resigned suddenly due to family reasons the corporation had to restructure its leadership after eight years of stability. The medical devices giant relied on the then VC and Vice President to act as its acting CEO. Kevin was finally entrusted with the responsibility due to his phenomenal experience and outstanding performance at other institutions and as Group President of Stryker Orthopedics.

3. He is a French Speaking Canadian native

Kevin Lobo can speak impeccable English and fluent French. He always has to expend all his charismatic grasp of all the languages that he can speak to address the global community of 24000 professionals that Stryker employees.

4. He is the only managing member of the board

Kevin sits on the Stryker board of directors and he participates in most of the important decision making that propels this pharmaceutical giant into delivering better products. He is the only member of the board that also performs active management duties and day to day running of the corporation.

5. He sits on other major boards

Kevin Lobo’s influence spans from way back before he joined Stryker. He uses his influence at other boards to advance his agenda of improving healthcare and the pharmaceutical business for the benefit of the boards in which he sits including:

Business Leaders for Michigan

Parker Hannifin Corporation

United Way

Advanced Medical Technology Association

6. Kevin Lobo is a thematic leader

After becoming the head of Stryker and moving to Southwest Michigan where the base of Stryker’s operations lie he set out to familiarize the corporation with four themes that he intends to use throughout his tenure. They included:

Globalization

Innovation

Collaboration

Cost-optimization

He owes the four themes to Stryker’s expansion into over 100 countries and impressive growth.

7. Kevin didn’t relocate his family

Kevin is a family man and he certainly didn’t want to disrupt his son’s High School education. He says that he spends as much time in Kalamazoo as if he lived there. According to him his job description involves very frequent traveling and therefore it didn’t matter where his family was based. It would be simpler if he did the moving because he was the one required to move all the time.

8. Lobo once lived in the United Kingdom

CEO Kevin claims that he learned his most important lesson in leadership when he was supervising Rhone-Poulenc’s Phosphate Division. He says that he had to learn the hard way that he didn’t know everything there was to about the industry. His realization from the job was that he had to align himself with people who were great at what they were doing.

9. Lobo is a great listener

Lobo’s most valuable advice to industry leaders is to always listen before anything. He argues that when one listens they learn and understand.

10. CEO Kevin Lobo is a pretty experienced corporate executive

He was previously the president of the internationally revered Johnson & Johnson Medical Products.",,,,,,,,,

As highlighted in a post by anti-phishing solutions provider Cofense automated scripts on the alleged live chat will ask PayPal users a series of questions that get increasingly more intrusive.

Android unveils new security and privacy features for users

READ MORE Android users warned about new phone threat - DON'T click these links It will begin by asking for an email and address then a phone number and finally - which is of most concern - credit card information. An alleged verification code is then sent to the mobile number the PayPal user provided and the threat actor may even attempt to call the targeted victim. But this is all part of a complex phishing attempt designed to steal sensitive information from a victim. Speaking about the threat Cofense said: ""This attack demonstrates the complexity of phishing attacks that go beyond the typical 'Forms' page or spoofed login. In this case a carefully crafted email appears to be legitimate until a recipient dives into the headers and links which is something your average user will most likely not do."" Thankfully though there are a number of red flags that PayPal users need to look out for when trying to see if a message or website they're looking at is authentic.

Convincing PayPal scam email revealed by phishing experts

Firstly while this latest phishing scam adopts some complex methods to steal user info - there is one tell-tale sign all is not what it seems. That's because the email address the message was sent from is not associated with legitimate PayPal emails. Not only that but if anyone misses this and heads to the alleged live chat site then the URL is a big giveaway. Not only does the alleged live chat site not a real PayPal URL but the web page address is not even remotely linked to the PayPal name. Speaking to Express.co.uk about the threat PayPal offered advice on how users can keep themselves safe. A PayPal spokesperson said: ""At PayPal we go to great lengths to protect our customers but there are still a few simple precautions we should all take to avoid falling victim to scams. ""All communications from PayPal to account holders would be sent to the secure message centre within their PayPal account. You will have a secure message waiting if PayPal does need you to take any action. ""A genuine PayPal email will only ever address you by your full name – anything that starts differently should immediately raise your suspicions. Look out for spelling mistakes which are a common tell-tale sign of a fraudulent message.""

Aziz Diagne gives young artists a gallery to showcase their work. Photos by Jason Lewis

By Blake Carter

Local artist Aziz Diagne has showcased his work around the world over the last few decades with Leimert Park Village being his home base for years.

“I’ve never left Leimert Park” he said. “I’ve been here since 5th Street Dicks Billy Higgins (founder of The World Stage). I used to be a part of an art gallery where Fernando Pullum (Performing Arts Center) is. My work has been inside Regency West for the last 25 years.”

After years of displaying his artwork in various venues in Leimert Park Village Diagne has opened his own art gallery. He opened Aziz Gallerie in the late film director John Singleton’s former office on 43rd Street about half of a block east of Degnan Boulevard. The gallery not only showcases Diagne’s work but it is also a co-op for local artists.

“We cater to younger artists; new artists who do not have an opportunity to have their work in a gallery and who never have the opportunity to have their work shown anywhere” he said. “Because I have that experience I opened the gallery just for that. To give them the first leg in the business.”

Many young artists have a difficult time getting their artwork in mainstream galleries so Diagne created a space to give them an opportunity and a venue to showcase and sell their work.

“Usually when a young artist goes to a gallery the first thing that they ask is if you’ve ever exhibited anywhere. If you haven’t they’ll tell you to ‘go and get a job before we give you one.’”

Young artists can use the experience that they gain at Aziz Gallerie to get their work in other galleries. Diagne also has partnerships with several galleries in which he helps young artists get their work in.

Aziz Gallerie features Afrocentric paintings so locals do not have to leave their community to purchase high-end artwork. Diagne also hosts art classes and artist panel discussions at the gallery.

Aziz Gallerie is located at 3343 W. 43rd Street. They are open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.

A spin-off is when a business unit of an existing public company is separated and becomes its own public company. For example PayPal Holdings used to be a part of eBay until it was spun off in 2015. Spin-offs can be an interesting place to look for investment ideas because unlike IPOs they don't tend to attract a lot of attention or excitement.

Last year IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC -2.27%) spun off its online dating app Match Group which went on to perform well in its first year as a public company. Last month IAC gave investors another spin-off to chew on with video publishing platform Vimeo (VMEO 0.51%).

Given the success of Match Group should investors pay attention to Vimeo?

What exactly is Vimeo?

Many people are familiar with Vimeo as a sort of little brother to Alphabet's YouTube. This was true five years ago but Vimeo pivoted its business model in 2017 from serving as a viewing platform to operating as a software company helping businesses and creators edit and publish high-quality ad-free videos.

Vimeo still operates its viewing platform which counts over 200 million users but it also allows creators to upload edit and publish videos that push to other websites including TikTok YouTube and Twitter. Vimeo's value proposition is two-fold. First it makes the process of editing and publishing videos online easy by providing tools that anyone can use. For example Vimeo recently acquired a company that harnesses artificial intelligence to help users create quality product videos in just a few clicks. Second Vimeo provides its tools and platform at a very low cost compared to other available options. The combination of cheap and easy-to-use is very powerful.

Vimeo also serves larger enterprises with features including live streaming video on demand subscription management viewer analytics and developer APIs that allow endless customization. During the COVID-19 pandemic Vimeo added many enterprise customers to enable ""town halls"" for communications between employees within organizations.

Vimeo has a compelling suite of products and has benefited from the increased need for powerful video solutions in recent years. The company appears to be in the right space at the right time.

Why did IAC spin off Vimeo?

If Vimeo is so promising then why did IAC decide to spin the company off? Well buying businesses building them up and spinning them off is a game IAC tends to play. IAC was founded by legendary media investor Barry Diller and has a storied track record of running this playbook. IAC has been the force behind many well-known media companies including Expedia Match Group and Angi formerly Angie's list to name a few examples.

This is exactly what IAC has done with Vimeo. IAC acquired Vimeo in 2006 as part of a package deal with a few other internet properties. In 2017 Anjali Sud was promoted as CEO to take the company in a new direction. Sud led the company on its journey from serving as a media viewing platform to selling its software and publishing solutions to creators and enterprises over the past four years.

Under IAC's stewardship Vimeo has bolstered its offering by acquiring several companies including Livestream (for its live stream capabilities) VHX (for its video distribution platforms) and Magistro (for its video editing capabilities).

The combination of putting new management in place funding acquisitions and providing the company the room to grow has resulted in a spin-off worth over $8 billion. This has been a home run investment for IAC and has initiated a new chapter for Vimeo to pursue its own destiny as an independent company.

A long-term growth opportunity in video

The video medium has become a more prominent staple for consuming entertainment advertising and communicating with friends and co-workers. And this trend has only strengthened in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vimeo has carved out an interesting and valuable niche in this new video communication ecosystem. The market for its services continues to grow at a rapid rate and the company is poised to capture that opportunity. This makes Vimeo an interesting technology stock to watch for the long run.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20vbmV3czI0L2JpLWFyY2hpdmUvcGVlci10by1wZWVyLXBheW1lbnRzLWluLXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYS0yMDIxLTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The cheapest and easiest way to send money to a friend via app in SA - with one standout option,"This article forms part of the archives of Business Insider South Africa which was published as a partnership between News24 and Insider Inc between 2018 and 2023.

App-based peer-to-peer payment solutions have taken off around the world.

But South Africa still lacks a go-to app like Venmo for casual payments.

Although most banks offer ways for clients to send cash or transfers via apps or USSD codes they're still clunky and far from ubiquitous.

Newer standalone payment apps are likely to win this battle with lower fees and more widespread use.

Here's how various peer-to-peer payment apps compare in South Africa.

App-based peer-to-peer payment solutions have taken off around the world. But third-party apps like Venmo PayPal Google Pay Send and Apple Cash have failed - or been slow - to roll out all of their features to customers in South Africa. This means paying a friend back for small purchases like a few beers or a concert ticket remains a frustrating process in the fractured peer-to-peer market in this country.

The country's big banks have maintained something of a stranglehold on instant app-based peer-to-peer payments. Most offer their own ""wallets"" and ""send cash"" features - but even these lack the efficiency and ubiquity of international third-party apps and come with fees for accounts withdrawals and deposits.

Although some banks are opening these options up for even those who aren't clients - most offer payments to cell phone numbers for example - none appears to have cornered the market across all institutions.

Because of this most South Africans still make instant peer-to-peer payments with cash or via a costly instant EFT. Slower EFTs are also common but these come with their risks of scams and fraud. The result is that in 2020 roughly 80% of people interviewed in a study said they still transfer money via their banks when making such payments.

As using cash becomes less prevalent in South Africa and EFTs increasingly slow and cumbersome app-based peer-to-peer payments have become more common. And there are now more options with similar functionality to apps like Venmo appearing on the market.

These apps act as a type of bank account lite without any interest accruing benefits and transactions limited to deposit withdraw and pay. Users deposit cash via EFT or link bank cards to the app ""wallets"" often for a fee. They can then use this money to pay other users spend it at merchants or withdraw it. In most cases this money sits in the wallet without earning the user any interest.

These apps still come with lengthy terms and conditions like withdrawal limits and maximum transaction values. But some like SnapScan and Spot are breaking down the barriers associated with brand-specific e-wallets. Although converting payments received through these apps into hard cash comes at an added hassle and expense (users will have to transfer to a bank account and then withdraw it) the money can digitally remain in ecosystems for future payments at participating merchants or against items like airtime and electricity.

Here's how several leading peer-to-peer payment solutions in South Africa compare"

Taxpayer dollars are primarily why we have successful vaccines for fighting COVID-19.

The government assumed the financial risk of development which allowed us to get the vaccines so quickly. But the public is paying a huge chunk for research development and manufacturing. Congress appropriated nearly 10 billion tax dollars to support development and manufacturing of COVID-19 diagnostics treatments and vaccines.

The industry directly builds on knowledge funded by the taxpayer.

Moderna was heavily funded by the U.S. government and private donations.The company was given $2.5 billion for development of its vaccine and to pay for doses once approved.

Pfizer says it didn’t take any money to develop the vaccine but its partner BioNtech received $446 million from the German government. Both Pfizer and Moderna used the National Institutes of Health patented messenger RNA technology to create their vaccines. The U.S. committed to buying hundreds of millions of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in advance with a price tag of $1.9 billion. Pfizer is being paid handsomely to produce the vaccine and it’s been estimated to have earned more than $900 million in profit in just the first quarter of 2021 – and even greater profits in the second quarter.

The U.S. invested $20 billion in pharmaceutical companies to quickly move forward on clinical trials development and production capabilities. Moderna had never before produced an approved drug so the government paid for its production capability and virtually “de-risked” the enterprise for making the vaccines by committing to buy them when brought to market.

The National Institutes of Health’s investment contributed to every drug that was developed in the U.S. from 2010 to 2019. By investing in basic science and drug development NIH encourages innovation by private pharmaceutical companies. The NIH is the single largest medical research agency in the world. Once a drug has been developed and is ready for commercialization the NIH turns the intellectual property over to the drug companies with seemingly no strings attached. The pharmaceutical company can determine its prices. Corporations price to maximize revenue not according to R&D costs.

NIH research is extremely productive and should be expanded so that health rather than profit guides our medical research priorities.

Americans got the vaccine for free initially because the government not only paid for development but also for the vaccine doses.

Our government negotiated the price of vaccines with Pfizer and Moderna. The first two doses of Pfizer vaccine cost $19.50 each Moderna’s $15 each. Both were considered to be “pandemic pricing.” Post-pandemic prices will go up – and many of us may need a “booster” shot in the future. Pfizer recently told shareholders that they want to raise the price of a dose from $19.50 to $150 to $175 per dose. Without the government negotiating prices the sky’s the limit.

Our government has given pharmaceutical companies unilateral ability to charge whatever they want for drugs. They can do the same thing for vaccines.

That’s how our laws work. Our current policies benefit drug makers not the people who need those medications to remain healthy – and whose tax dollars make their development possible.

The governments of every industrialized country in the world negotiate prices with drug companies using national review boards. These boards negotiate prices and analyze whether a new drug is more effective than its predecessors. Germany Canada and other Western nations only allow new drugs if they can show that they’re better than existing ones. Outside of the Veterans Administration the U.S. doesn’t negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies. The pandemic was a temporary exception.

The drug industry has been involved in over three decades of writing and creating national policy and laws (e.g. the Affordable Care Act) that are designed to benefit them not you and me. It’s time to reform those laws.

House Bill 3 passed by the House of Representatives in 2019 and ignored by the Senate would have allowed Medicare to negotiate for all drug prices allowed those prices to be extended to the private sector and put a cap on drug price increases annually at no more than the rate of inflation (about 2% versus the current 9% over inflation). And it would have directed some of the savings to NIH to ensure new and innovative drug development. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that HR 3 would have accounted for about $456 billion in savings over a 10-year period.

It’s an uphill battle because the pharmaceutical industry is one of the wealthiest and most powerful lobbies in the country. This has afforded it almost unlimited resources to fight policy change. When pharmaceutical companies need more money for campaign contributions and lobbyists they can simply raise the prices of their drugs to pay for them.

President Joe Biden recently said “Capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism; it’s exploitation.” The pharmaceutical industry has been exploiting Americans for too many decades with the price of drugs including life-saving drugs.

Pharmaceutical development is high risk it’s true but why should we socialize the risk while privatizing the profits? Ask your senator to start hearings on HR 3 in the Senate. That’s how we negotiate for drugs prices we can afford and still maintain fair capitalism and true competitiveness.

Surfing’s grand Olympic debut is now very much behind us but the impact of the historic day is still reverberating through hearts and minds. Italo Ferreira plucky Brazilian all-star won gold in the men’s division and Carissa Moore Hawaiian-American won gold in the women’s.

The Associated Press had made news ahead of the games by laying bare to our Sport of Kings declaring it was culturally appropriated by California whites and deeply unchill. Bill Maher days later blasted the AP for pushing its “woke Olympics” while singling the surfing coverage out as deeply unsettling going so far as to doubt that it had been appropriated from Hawaiians because Hawaiians likely did not even invent surfing saying “How do we know that they were the first to stand on a board on water? It seems like its something that any person near any ocean would eventually do.”

Rude no?

The AP undaunted is now reporting that surfing has officially been re-appropriated from the appropriators by Hawaii due Moore’s win.

Moore has now become a realization of Kahanamoku’s dream at once the symbol of the sport’s very best and a validating force for an Indigenous community that still struggles with its complex history.

“It’s a reclaiming of that sport for our native community” said Kūhiō Lewis president of the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement which convenes the largest annual gathering of Native Hawaiians.

Lewis said all the locals he knew were texting each other during the competition glued to the TV and elated even relieved by Moore’s “surreal” win. He called it a “come to home moment” for a community that may never reconcile its dispossession.

After centuries of colonization by various European settlers Hawaii was annexed by the United States in 1898 after the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy by U.S.-backed forces in 1893.

“At times we’re an invisible people. We’re lumped in to other ethnic groups. Our sport is being defined by other groups. This puts it into perspective” Lewis said. “It feels like an emerging of a people of a native community that has been invisible to many.”

Beautiful no?

Is cranky ol’ Bill Maher going to take another swing?

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld will return to a federal courtroom Thursday as they try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

FOX19 NOW will be in the courtroom and will update this developing story throughout the day.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

(Reuters) -Philip Morris has raised its bid for British drugmaker Vectura to 165 pence ($2.29) per share the tobacco company said on Sunday.

""The PMI (Philip Morris International) increased offer values the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Vectura at approximately 1.02 billion pounds ($1.41 billion)"" it said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

The latest offer represents a premium of approximately 10 pence per share to a rival offer of 155 pence a share by U.S.-based Carlyle Group announced on Friday.

Carlyle offered to buy Vectura for about 958 million pounds ($1.3 billion).

Vectura which makes respiratory treatments had said on Friday that it was backing Carlyle's offer and withdrawing its recommendation for Philip Morris' proposal adding that it might be better positioned under Carlyle's ownership.

Vectura did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Sunday.

""PMI intends to operate Vectura as an autonomous business unit that will form the backbone of its inhaled therapeutics business"" Philip Morris said in the statement.

The previously agreed deal with Philip Morris came as big tobacco companies are trying to alter their image after years of negative press and lawsuits for marketing and selling health-harming cigarettes which health advocates and experts say continues to be a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide.

The maker of Marlboro cigarettes raised its 150p per share bid to 165p equivalent to just over £1billion. The offer is a 10p or 6.5 per cent premium on the 155p bid or £958m made by US buyout firm Carlyle on Friday.

Philip Morris International (PMI) also challenged its bidding rival by claiming it was a better long-term investor than a private equity firm which typically sells a company after three or five years.

Raising the stakes: The maker of Marlboro cigarettes increased its 150p per share bid for Vectura to 165p equivalent to just over £1billion

It said: 'PMI's business model and strategy is driven by a long-term commitment to the transformation of its business not a search for short-term gains and efficiency.' The bidding war threatens to further embarrass the board of the Wiltshire-based respiratory drug company which has switched its allegiance twice.

It initially backed Carlyle's first offer of 136p per share in May. It then flipped to Philip Morris in July when the tobacco titan offered 150p before returning to support Carlyle's 155p bid on Friday.

Carlyle it said was 'well aligned with Vectura's wider stakeholder objectives' adding the firm may be 'better positioned' under its ownership.

The fresh bid may force the board led by chairman Bruno Angelici to reconsider its support once again.

Vectura's share price was expected to rise this morning beyond last week's closing price of 163.9p as Carlyle was forced to weigh a higher bid. The US investment company has sought to play up its '30 years' of experience in the healthcare sector and has also received backing from 11.2 per cent of Vectura's investors.

PMI said it will invest heavily in research and development and use Vectura to develop technologies for non-smoking cigarettes as it rebranded as a 'wellness company'.

Its interest has sparked outrage from MPs and charities who said they were 'horrified'. They pointed out that if its bid is successful a company whose products cause lung diseases could profit from development therapies to treat them.

The BMW M5’s competence is no secret: In its first generation it took the notion of a sport sedan and turned it into the type of vehicle that could wipe the smile off a Ferrari 308 owner’s face—with three passengers and golf bags in the trunk.

Car enthusiasts began to respect that first E28 M5 with its M1-born straight-six M88 engine and understated visuals. And as the notion of a super sedan became more commonplace the M5 evolved too representing the pinnacle of four-door supercars in each era that followed. We all know that story of course but the synopsis gets murky in regard to the U.S. because following lackluster sales of the U.S.-spec E34 M5 and the E30 M3 the home of the Big Mac and right-on-red intersections didn’t get the 3.8-liter European M5. In fact for a while in the ’90s we were nearly cut out of the BMW M portfolio entirely.

What we did get was the 540i M Sport an E34 5 Series that featured a four-liter V8 a six-speed manual a limited-slip differential an M-adjustable suspension setup and plenty of M badges—except for the formal M5 on the trunk lid of course. This was a different car than Europe’s high-revving Autobahn-slaying M5; it was a muscle car for one with ample torque and a throaty V8 growl. While the chassis excelled with the high-revving straight-six the V8 was admittedly better suited for daily use.

In many ways however the 540i was a precursor to the iconic E39 M5 that officially brought the nameplate back to the United States for the 2000 model year. If the E28 introduced the M5 to 1200 of the most discerning American enthusiasts the E39 brought it to the masses. From the YouTube videos of the late (and unmatched) Sabine Schmitz wheeling an M5 Ring Taxi around the Nürburgring to Alex Roy running the Gumball 3000 and breaking Cannonball records to Madonna’s M5 chauffeured ride in The Hire the E39 platform became synonymous with M5 in popular culture—to say nothing of the car’s spectacular sound driving feel visuals and world-beating performance.

Given that M5 heritage it’s no wonder that the E60 M5 received something of a cool reception. BMW fans who are old enough probably remember its controversial introduction: In addition to the new Bangle-era styling the E60 introduced an SMG transmission to the M5 nameplate eliminating the hurdle of driving a manual from M5 ownership. It was also larger heavier and softer than the outgoing E39—and it introduced a first (and last) for BMW: the S85 V10 engine.

By this point in BMW history it was all but assumed that when a new M5 is released it will become the king of the now-populated super-sedan hill. Cars like the E55 AMG or Audi RS6 potent as they were had nothing on the 500-horsepower Nürburgring-ready E60 M5. This was expected. This was mundane.

Despite its clear performance dominance however the E60 was judged harshly—simply for differing in character from the outgoing E39 M5. It is maligned today for its intense maintenance demands.

Regardless I want to revisit the E60 M5 because recently I had an epiphany.

Last weekend my partner and I flew out west to buy a car (no one asked but if there are any fans here it was a 79000-mile 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited). The car was in eastern Oregon a region notable for being nowhere near anyone that we knew. But it was five hours from Seattle and in a moment of quick thinking we called my friend Petar Vrcelj Nikolic. Some of you may recognize him as a BMW aficionado who has saved a large number of E34s in the Pacific Northwest and from the photos of his wide-ranging BMW collection that he shares online. The rotating fleet ranges from an E46 M3 to a Navarra Violet-on-Lavender E38 to an E53 X5 4.6iS.

But one of his keeper cars is an E60 M5—specifically a 2008 six-speed-manual black-on-Oyster example with custom-built BBS E88 wheels and enough spent on preventative maintenance to buy a pretty decent E34 M5.

When I asked for a ride from Seattle to the middle of Oregon with two passengers and 300 pounds of luggage the M5 was the last thing I expected to be picked up in but Nikolic insisted and about two hours in I understood why.

The first thing you notice about the E60 is how new it feels even with the single-knob iDrive and wide-spoke steering wheel. Like the exterior styling the interior has worn its thirteen years with remarkable ease: Even the instrument cluster revolutionary at the time for eliminating the coolant-temperature gauge is clear and informative with an actual oil-temperature gauge and digital displays.

The second thing you notice is that the car feels incalculably lighter than it really is. The only clue to its 4000-poundheft is how planted and comfortable the car feels even with suspension on the stiffest setting.

The engine though: my God.

It’s clear to see why the engineers at BMW M locked away the top 100 horsepower. The only clue to the S85’s full capability is the unwieldy nature of the MDM button: Hit it when you’re on light throttle and the car lunges forward. Five hundred horsepower was no joke then and it isn’t any less potent today.

Still under 6000 rpm this car could be mistaken for a lackluster replacement for the E39: fast and sonorous with a more spacious interior but with complexity that might seem unnecessary to the casual driver. But from 6000 to the 8250-rpm redline this car as Jeremy Clarkson said in his 2006 Top Gear review becomes an M5.

Starting a rev-matched downshift at 6000 rpm is an absurd experience only outmatched by the exhilaration of effortless acceleration into light speed while the car asks “Is that all?” I’ve been informed by friends in Europe that the E60 M5 pulls just as confidently to 175 and beyond.

But again it’s easy to see why this car was ignored. Even in Seattle you can use this car properly only for a second maybe two before it becomes dangerous. A journalist in Los Angeles or Ann Arbor who got this car dropped off for three days in 2006 wouldn’t have a road to even begin to appreciate the car on without spending an extended weekend in the county jail. It’s easy to see why you might prefer an E39 M5 or even the previous 540i M Sport in the suburbs of California or on the back roads of Michigan.

But in Oregon’s High Desert regions with miles to the horizon it’s more usable than any supercar. There’s nothing—no Lamborghini or Ferrari no exotic supercar on Earth—from this era better suited to powering across the plains than this 118000-mile E60 M5. It’s not even about outright speed: the ability to actually use the gears and wring out the V10 is a pure legendary joy and cruising across the state with comfortable suspension and plenty of passing power is magnificent. For driver or passenger it is a superb continental cruiser. The Germans in their effort to create an Autobahn legend created this perfect six-speed byproduct: the ideal supercar for the American West.

When it comes to replacing the E39 M5 however Nikolic—who has owned both—has a take on that: He says that the E60 is not a replacement in spirit for the E39. Instead spiritually and in construction it’s a continuation of the E28 and E34; it’s a supercar with four doors and a supercar’s engine no qualifications necessary. And it’s built in BMW’s most traditional style with an unapologetically rev-happy engine port injection a lightweight flywheel and a near-9000-rpm redline.

Of course the S85 V10 requires maintenance—and yes that includes rod bearings and expensive camshaft sensors to make sure that its high redline is sustainable. But when you see it for what it is—a supercar period—dropping $7000 on maintenance from time to time feels like a bargain.

Sunflag Iron and Steel Limited a company from the city got Bhivkund block in Chandrapur district for an offer of 9% over and above the reserve price.Another Adani Group company — CG Natural Resources Private Limited — has got two coal blocks in Chhattisgarh for a bid of 6%.CG Natural Resources has been set up for operations in Chhattisgarh. Adani Power Maharashtra has power plant in Tiroda in Gondia district.The bids are invited on the basis of percentage hike offered on reserve price. The reserve price is fixed at 4% of the representative price of the coal block and the latter is calculated on the basis of numerous factors like volume of coal notified price and imported price channel etc.Interested parties have to bid at a rate over and above 4% of the reference price explained a source in the sector.There is a major difference in offers received for other mines and those in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. For example Rauta mine in Jharkhand went for an offer of 75% over the reserve rate. The mine was bagged by Shreesatya Mines Private Limited. Prakash Industries got Bhaskarpara mine also in Chhattisgarh for a bid of 55.75% over the reserve price. Two other mines in Jharkhand got an offer of 54.50% and 24.25%. The blocks went to Shreesatya Mines and South West Pinnacle Exploration Limited respectively.The offer in percentage terms received for the mines in Maharashtra was also substantially less as compared to those located in the state auctioned in the first tranche last year. The Takli Jena Belora and Marki Mangli-II blocks in Chandrapur went to Aurobindo Reality and Yazdani International Private Limited respectively. Both the companies had bid at 30.75% above of the reserve rate.The blocks in Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh may have fetched lower rates due to lack of enough competition said professionals observing the development. For example there were two bidders for the Gondkhairi block which went to Adani. The other bidder was Sunflag Iron and Steel. Sunflag which emerged as the successful bidder for the Bhivkund block had competition only from Aurobindo Realty.There were no bidders for three more blocks located in the region and a single bid was received for one.The offers could have been higher if the number of bidders were more said a source in the sector.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuaW4vcHJvamVjdHMtdGVuZGVycy8xODk4OS1jZy1uYXR1cmFsLXJlc291cmNlcy1oaWdoZXN0LWJpZGRlci1mb3Ita2hhcmdhb24tY29hbC1ibG9ja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CG Natural Resources highest bidder for Khargaon coal block,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.constructionweekonline.in/projects-tenders/18989-cg-natural-resources-highest-bidder-for-khargaon-coal-block on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuaW4vcHJvamVjdHMtdGVuZGVycy8xODk4OS1jZy1uYXR1cmFsLXJlc291cmNlcy1oaWdoZXN0LWJpZGRlci1mb3Ita2hhcmdhb24tY29hbC1ibG9ja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Look for another charge toward the front today from Graham Rahal in the Big Machine Music City Grand Prix if the results of the warmup are any indication.

Rahal was the surprise leader of the final practice session for the inaugural NTT INDYCAR SERIES street-course race in Nashville Tennessee topping the time charts with a lap of one minute 15.8489 seconds in the No. 15 United Rentals Honda.

The 80-lap race starts at 5:30 p.m. (ET) today with live coverage on NBCSN and the INDYCAR Radio Network.

Rahal is starting 13th and he was 14th- and 16th-quickest in the two practice sessions that preceded NTT P1 Award qualifying Saturday. This strong performance in the warmup appears to continue a trend for Rahal who has finished higher than his starting position in eight of the 10 races so far this season.

“The guys did a great job to come up with a setup that was a lot different than yesterday just to try to learn” Rahal said. “It was better a lot more compliant. A little better in the slow-speed (corners) which was our biggest loss to (Colton) Herta yesterday. So overall there still are challenges for sure but a good step forward in competitiveness.”

Six-time and reigning series champion Scott Dixon was second at 1:15.8794 in the No. 9 PNC Bank Grow Up Great Honda. He will start second in the race on the 11-turn 2.17-mile street circuit that includes two trips per lap over the Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge.

Fellow championship contender Pato O’Ward was third at 1:16.2012 in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet. He will start eighth.

NTT P1 Award winner Colton Herta was fourth at 1:16.3758 in the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda. It was the first session this weekend that Herta didn’t lead as he posted the quickest times in practice Friday and practice and qualifying Saturday.

Championship leader Alex Palou rounded out the top five at 1:16.4870. He will start ninth in the No. 10 NTT DATA Honda.

Three incidents triggered red flags and reduced track time in the 30-minute session.

The most significant came with two minutes remaining when Jimmie Johnson spun and hit the barrier in Turn 4 inflicting significant damage to the No. 48 Carvana Honda. Johnson was unhurt.

Felix Rosenqvist spun in Turn 1 in the No. 7 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet with eight minutes remaining but made no contact and resumed. Rinus VeeKay nudged the tire barrier with his rear wing after spinning in Turn 4 in the No. 21 Sonax/Autogeek Chevrolet almost at the halfway point of the session but he was able to continue after his engine was refired.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWh5cGVtYWdhemluZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC9hLWxvb2stYXQtamFzb24tYWxkZWFucy1wb3B1bGFyLXdvbGYtbW9vbi1ib3VyYm9uLWhpcy0yMDIxLWJhY2stb24tdGhlLXNhZGRsZS10b3VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"A Look At Jason Aldean's Popular Wolf Moon Bourbon & His 2021 ""Back In The Saddle"" Tour The Hype Magazine ...","A Look At Jason Aldean’s Popular Wolf Moon Bourbon & His 2021 “Back In The Saddle” Tour

Wolf Moon Bourbon is billed as a “brotherly collaboration” between friends and top-selling country artists Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia’s Line’s Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley. It was crafted with the intent of helping others “celebrate the feel-good kick-back moments in life with old friends.” It has been aged in oak casks for 4 years to achieve a alate of caramel honey and hints of oak spice. In turn Wolf Moon Bourbon carries both a sweet and smooth flavor profile and the bourbon — carrying a low suggested retail price of $24.99 per bottle — can be enjoyed straight-up or on the rocks.

Earlier this week Jason Aldean kicked off his Back In The Saddle tour in Virginia Beach Virginia with support from HARDY Lainey Wilson and Dee Jay Silver.

Mouths were agape and heads were being scratched on pit lane after Colton Herta won the NTT P1 Award on Saturday for the Big Machine Music City Grand Prix on the streets of Nashville Tennessee.

Herta also earned the Bryan Clauson Pole Trophy for his second pole of the season in the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda pacing the field by nearly six-tenths of a second with his top lap of 1 minute 13.6835 seconds. Herta led both practices on the 11-turn 2.17-mile street circuit before qualifying.

California native Herta set the table for his sizzling lap in the Firestone Fast Six during the first segment of qualifying when he didn’t use a set of the Firestone alternate “red” tires to advance into the second segment with the second-quickest time in his group just behind Scott Dixon. That allowed Herta to save an extra set of alternate tires for the Firestone Fast Six and he used them to devastating effect.

“It was a good lap but what we did in Q1 really helped us there with being able to transfer on the black tires” Herta said. “That was the biggest thing. Being fast on the blacks made it just a lot easier for the rest of the way. Great job by everybody.

“The car is fantastic as you can see what we were able to do on the black (primary tire) laps compared to everybody. We were really in a league of our own. It felt amazing. Good car to take into the race tomorrow too. Nice and stable.”

The 80-lap race starts at 5:30 p.m. (ET) Sunday live on NBCSN and the INDYCAR Radio Network.

Herta earned his sixth career NTT INDYCAR SERIES pole and second this season. And this statistic should send chills down his rivals’ spines: Herta has converted his last three NTT P1 Awards into victories including a win April 25 in the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg.

Six-time and defending series champion Dixon qualified second at 1:14.2327 in the No. 9 PNC Bank Grow Up Great Honda joining Herta on the front row. That was a solid comeback for Dixon who admitted he was a bit spooked early in qualifying after spinning twice in the morning practice on the challenging street circuit.

“It kind of sits in the back of your head” Dixon said. “In the first two rounds of qualifying I was taking it a little bit cautious and made sure we converted. I knew the PNC Bank No. 9 was super fast.

“We knew Herta was going to be fast (in the Fast Six) because he was the only guy with new tires. But he’s been quick all weekend so he definitely deserved that. So kudos to their group and we’ll see how tomorrow plays out. Starting on the front row is fantastic.”

The gap of .5492 of a second between Herta and Dixon was the largest between the top two qualifiers in an NTT INDYCAR SERIES road or street course race this season easily besting the margin of .3206 between pole winner Josef Newgarden and Herta for the second race at Belle Isle in Detroit.

Series leader Alex Palou qualified third at 1:14.6316 at Nashville in the No. 10 NTT DATA Honda but he will start ninth due to a six-spot starting grid penalty for an unapproved engine change after testing last month. 2016 Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge winner Alexander Rossi qualified fourth at 1:14.6646 as one of two Andretti Autosport cars in the top four in a resurgent weekend for the team.

Felix Rosenqvist also continued a strong weekend by qualifying fifth at 1:15.0045 in the No. 7 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet while rookie Romain Grosjean rounded out the top six in qualifying at 1:15.3980 in the No. 51 Nurtec ODT Honda.

The complex nature of this new circuit which includes two crossings of the Cumberland River per lap over the Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge will force nearly every team into pondering various strategies and tire choices this evening. Dixon though already has simplified his approach to the race.

“Go fast take chances” Dixon said.

That also probably may be the mantra for championship contender Pato O’Ward who is second in the series standings 39 points behind Palou. He qualified ninth in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet.

The first two segments of qualifying featured plenty of drama.

Two-time series champion Newgarden a Nashville native and resident appeared to be poised to advance to the Firestone Fast Six when he clouted the Turn 11 wall with his No. 2 Hitachi Team Penske Chevrolet with moments left in the second segment.

The wreck caused heavy damage to the right front and moderate damage to the right side and right rear of Newgarden’s car and he lost his quickest lap due to causing a local yellow that affected another competitor and dropped out of the Fast Six elevating Grosjean into the Fast Six. Newgarden will start 12th.

“I was just trying to make up the deficit from yesterday and today” Newgarden said. “Pretty pumped for tomorrow. Just wish we were a little higher up. Trying to claw some performance there and just overpushed. You can’t wreck and not get penalized. That’s on me. That’s how it works.”

Drivers in the first group of the first segment were forced to hustle to put in a qualifying lap after Jimmie Johnson crashed heavily in Turn 10 in the No. 48 Carvana Honda. The other 12 drivers in the group had just three minutes 20 seconds to put in a qualifying lap.

A 30-minute warmup at 1 p.m. (ET) Sunday (live Peacock) will precede the race.",,,

""We are actively recruiting for approximately 60 officer and 50 other key positions"" said Mark Collins BC Ferries president and CEO in a statement. ""Unfortunately the global shortage means qualified mariners are very difficult to find.""

Two sailings between Victoria and Vancouver were cancelled Wednesday evening because of staffing shortages and Collins said BC Ferries was challenged to find replacement personnel on short notice.

Worldwide problem

The ripple effect of staffing issues is being felt around the world as demand for skilled seafarers outpaces supply. Shortages of captains first mates chief engineers and even entry-level seafarers has become acute.

In large part the qualified pool is diminishing due to aging and retirements. A report by the Seafarers' International Union in 2019 said 20 per cent of its membership was set to retire in five years.

The Seafarers' most recent report estimates that by 2026 an additional 89510 officers will be needed to operate the world merchant fleet and there currently exists a shortfall of 26240 certified officers.

BC Ferries CEO says qualified mariners are hard to find due to a global shortage affecting shipping worldwide. (BC Ferries)

Capt. Philip McCarter associate dean of BCIT's marine department says the school actively promotes and markets its seafaring programs but it can be an uphill battle attracting students to a field that doesn't tend to get much limelight.

""It's a tough competitive marketplace to try and hook these young people to at least enter the profession and then stick with it"" McCarter said.

Poaching employees

Students graduating from marine programs at BCIT are immediately snapped up McCarter says. But once an employee is firmly planted in the industry others in the sector will be actively trying to poach them from their employers.

""Shipping companies are hungry for them"" McCarter said. ""Incentives become important not just salaries but work-life incentives.""

BC Ferries is right in the midst of that tough competitive environment as it moves to hire more than 100 staff. McCarter says the company is aggressive in making sure staff are well looked after with the added bonus that they aren't out at sea for months on end.

But it may all be for naught — as travel restrictions ease and the cruise industry gets back on its feet — employee poaching will intensify.

""It's just going to mushroom"" McCarter said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A Black principal opened up about his experiences with racism while serving in several administrative capacities at Colleyville District in the Dallas Fort-Worth area.

Dr. James Whitfield who was previously the principal of Colleyville Middle School from 2019-2020 and the assistant principal for the high school from 2018-2019 opened up on Facebook in late July about racially motivated attacks he encountered after being called out in a school board meeting.

In late July a former school board member called for Whitfield to resign and accused him of teaching critical race theory to the students — which was banned by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in mid-June. Whitfield said this is not true and is just another baseless attack.

Other instances include having to hide photos of him and his white wife embracing being chastised for supporting anti-racism organizations and for speaking up about the death of George Floyd.

“I am the first African American to assume the role of Principal at my current school in its 25-year history” he stated in the post. “And I am keenly aware of how much fear this strikes in the hearts of a small minority who would much rather things go back to the way they used to be. But here’s the deal – I’m here so let’s dive into their claims about me.”

Whitfield says the reason for his post was being publicly named during the school board meeting which is against the district rules.

In the lengthy Facebook post Whitfield describes that although the majority of his experience at the school has been positive there have been distinct events that he believes have racial undertones.

He said it all began when he was about to be appointed principal of the middle school in 2019 and received a call in the evening from a central level administrator asking him to check his email. When he opened the forwarded message he was bewildered to find that it was a photo of him and his wife kissing on the beach with a statement that read “Is this the Dr. Whitfield we want as an example for our students?”

“I showed my wife and I could tell she was already getting upset – tears were welling up” he wrote in the post. “But I was still awaiting the callback.”

Whitfield said that he took the high road and hid the photo from his profile but knew this would be the start of more anti-Black aggressions from members of the district and the community.

He then recalled an instance where he was accused of using an existing program the Advancement Via Individual Determination to weave critical race theory into the middle school’s curriculum.

Critical race theory (CRT) which was first posited by a group of legal scholars like Derrick Bell and Kimberlé Crenshaw is a framework for understanding social cultural and political issues as they relate to race and racism. This pivotal ideological frame has been central to the works of some of the most prolific writers and academics of our time as well as the basis for anti-racist activism movements like Black Lives Matter.

However CRT has become a Republican political hot button as former President Donald Trump denounced it and falsely deemed it as “racist” back in 2020. Since then governors in states like Florida and Texas have banned educators from teaching it in the school.

Whitfield said he has never taught CRT in school or encouraged others to stating in the post “I am not the CRT (Critical Race Theory) Boogeyman.”

But what he will do he said is continue to fight against hatred and bigotry and be an example for all the students in the district.

“I’m here today because they consistently chose to stand up in the face of hate intolerance racism and extreme violence to pave a path forward for me” he ends his post with. “Without them there is no me and I will not let a small group of hateful people deter me from continuing to walk in my purpose.”

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

It’s sometimes said that Turkey Mountain has been loved to death.

Translation: So many people use it — hikers bicyclists and runners — that it’s not what it once was or what it could be. Trails meander trail conditions vary and signage is spotty.

So how do you improve something that has been loved to death? Love it more — and more intentionally.

That is the goal set out in the Turkey Mountain Master Plan a comprehensive document that is guiding River Parks Authority’s effort to turn the 646-acre urban wilderness area into a world-class destination.

Thanks to private donations work has already begun. Progressive Trail Design of Bentonville Arkansas is scheduled to begin construction in October of 13 miles of new natural surface multi-use trails spanning 475 acres of what River Parks has designated as Area 1.

The job should take about six to eight months to complete.

Jason Stouder planning director for Progressive Trail Design said his team looks at Turkey Mountain as a blank slate.

“We are considering ‘new trail’ either utilizing the current corridor and just rebuilding it or realigning completely or adding just a new section” Stouder said. “It will be a varying degree of difficulty — green beginning blue intermediate black advanced.

“We will have a majority of green and blue trails. There will be some areas that will be advanced but most of those areas will be the alternate lines so they will be a trail off of a trail.”

Stouder said the work on the new trails will be done incrementally so as not to require large segments of the existing trail system to be closed.

“The plan is to only close off areas that we are working in” Stouder said. “So what is currently out there will still be open.”

That’s the short-term plan. Over the next two to three years River Parks intends to add new multi-use trails to the remainder of the mountain — Areas 2-5 — in a public-private partnership that is estimated to cost $6 million.

Fundraising is still underway but it’s an investment officials believe will be worth every penny — and then some.

“Number one we are preserving an asset the preservation of Turkey Mountain” said River Parks Authority board member Torre Waldo. “There are not too many communities that have the advantage of having a wilderness right in the heart of their city.”

Enthusiasm for Turkey Mountain has never been stronger Waldo said with visitation up 43% last year.

“I think capitalizing on that enthusiasm for Turkey Mountain and then providing people with something to be even more excited about and giving them reason to come back time and time again I think it is just such a fantastic moment” Waldo said.

Enhancing Turkey Mountain’s trail system is the first step in the master plan’s vision for ensuring that all Tulsans — whether they be families out for a hike hard-core bicyclists or Sunday strollers — can enjoy an accessible well-maintained urban wilderness environment.

“I think a lot of the benefits that we have seen in other cities that have invested in the outdoors are amazing — economic benefits health and wellness benefits talent acquisition” Waldo said.

That’s certainly been the story in Bentonville. The city of approximately 57000 claims the title of Mountain Biking Capital of the World.

“If you drive into town right now the population signs say about 35000” said James Bell vice president of economic development for the Greater Bentonville Area Chamber of Commerce. “That was 2010 and we’ll double again by 2040.”

Bell acknowledges that there is a lot more going on in Bentonville than mountain biking. The city is home to Walmart and other major businesses and it gets more than a few visitors who make a beeline to Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.

But the numbers make clear mountain biking’s many benefits to the city.

Bicycling generated $137 million annually for the Northwest Arkansas economy according to a 2018 BBC Research & Consulting study done for the Walton Family Foundation.

Tourists who make the trip to Northwest Arkansas for bicycling-related activities also help spur the economy spending more than $25 million a year at local businesses the study found.

“You want those bikers to come into your community and not just hit the trails” Bell said. “You want them to come into your restaurants you want them to come into your hotels or Airbnbs or whatever.”

River Parks officials are quick to stress that mountain bikers won’t be the only user group to benefit from the trail enhancements. That’s why work on the new trail system has begun in Area 1 which comprises about 80% of the mountain and offers the widest variety of trails.

“This was purposeful in starting with this area because of the space the mileage the access and the skill levels that were built into this” said Tonja Carrigg director of community relations for River Parks.

River Parks officials say anyone interested in contributing financially to the trail enhancement project is welcome to attend the Wild Turkey fundraiser in September. Information is available at www.riverparks.org.

Osi Progressive Union (OPU) has condoled with all Osi – Ekiti indigenes at home and abroad over the death of their monarch His Royal Highness Oba Oladiran Adewoye Agunbiade 111 who joined his ancestors on August 4 2021.

In a statement the President of OPU (retd) ACM Oludare Fadogba said the Holy Book admonishes us “‘there is a time for everything under the sun. A time to be born and a time to die.'”

According to Fadogba “Here we talk of a King a super hero who bestrode the firmament of Osi-Ekiti Kingdom and reigned for 30 great and awesome years accompanied by legion of and diverse developments.

“His Royal Majesty Oba Oladiran Adewoye Agunbiade 111 the Olosi of Osi-Ekiti Kingdom took over the seat of his forefathers at a time Osi Kingdom was in search of peace. His ascension to the throne immediately set on us and brought every element together to foster a new beginning in the town”.

“Kabiyesi loved peace lived peace shared peace and encouraged peace in his domain. It is therefore of little wonder that his reign experienced peace all through.

Fadogba said “as the curtains draw on his lifetime I hope we are able to pick on the imperatives of a good life which is a service to all.

May the sweet angels of God carry the Kabiyesi home in glory as he joined his ancestors. Adieu Kabiyesi.”",,,,,,

We try to decipher this with two of the best telecom experts in the country former Airtel CEO Sanjay Kapoor and former telecom secretary R Chandrashekhar.

Airtel Reliance Jio not equipped to absorb 270 million subscribers

Saving Vodafone Idea – the impossible the pragmatic and the Frankenstein’s monster

The impossible

The pragmatic – keeping continuity for 270 million subscribers will need help from Airtel and Jio

The Frankenstein’s monster – BSNL + Vodafone Idea or BSNL over Vodafone Idea?

Vodafone Idea’s dire situation continues to haunt the company its subscribers and to an extent the government.Between Kumar Mangalam Birla stepping down as the non-executive chairman of the company and offering 27% stake to the government  and the British parent Vodafone Plc. refusing the infusion of additional equity in Vodafone Idea things are looking dire for the third largest telco in the country.Simply put it seems like a problem no one wants to solve – not the company’s promoters not the government and certainly not the courts . This has the potential to put over 270 million subscribers and the company’s employees in jeopardy.The telco has already lost over 51 million subscribers since the beginning of 2020 while its rivals Airtel and Jio have together gained 83 million subscribers.A government intervention seems to be in everyone’s interests. But since that seems far-fetched at the moment Business Insider spoke to experts to understand what could happen if Vodafone Idea goes out of business.This is one question that can have different answers depending on who you ask. The answers range from a duopoly to tariff hikes for subscribers loss of revenue for the government and collateral damage to ancillary service providers.The death of Vodafone Idea will immediately lead to the Indian telecom market falling back to a duopoly with Airtel and Reliance Jio sharing the subscriber market share amongst themselves.A duopoly is a situation where two companies together own all or most of the market share. It can have the same impact as a monopoly if the two players collude on prices or output.“We started with a duopoly. We introduced more people because we were not happy with what the two guys were doing and we are back to that” explained Sanjay Kapoor the former chief executive officer (CEO) of Bharti Airtel in an exclusive interview with Business Insider.To recap the Indian telecom market went from being a monopoly run by the Department of Telecommunications to one with several players like Reliance Communications Airtel the erstwhile Hutch (which was later acquired by Vodafone) Idea Tata Docomo Virgin Mobile Aircel among others.Today the Indian telecom market is majorly divided amongst Reliance Jio Airtel and Vodafone Idea with government run BSNL and MTNL and others being marginal players.In case Vodafone Idea dies the cost of maintaining the telecom infrastructure will be divided between two companies instead of three thereby leading to an increase in cost of operations.This Kapoor says will be passed on to the customers.“Having a duopoly means the consumers will end up paying a lot more and that is not good for the kind of technological advancements that even the government wants to see in the country” Kapoor explained alluding to the forthcoming 5G spectrum auctions which could be hampered in case there are only two operators left in the country.Vodafone Idea currently has an outstanding debt of ₹1.75 lakh crore. If its assets are not enough to repay the creditors they will have to write down their loans to the company.In case Vodafone Idea dies the bankers and service providers will have to take a huge haircut too as opposed to a scenario where the telco is operational and manages to repay its debt.Some of the banks with large exposure to Vodafone Idea include the likes of IDFC First Bank Yes Bank and State Bank of India among others.Banks’ exposure to Vodafone Idea:Source: NomuraIDFC First has the highest risk given that its exposure to Vodafone Idea is the highest as a percentage of the bank’s loan book. However some media reports suggest that the bank has already marked the debt to Vodafone Idea as ‘stressed’ and created a provision for 15% of the current outstanding debt.However even in the best case scenario it might be reasonable to expect the banks will have to take a material haircut.Ancillary service providers include telecom equipment manufacturers tower infrastructure companies companies providing infrastructure rollout and maintenance services among others.For instance the fortunes of one of India’s largest mobile tower installation companies hinge greatly on the survival and operational capabilities of Vodafone Idea apart from Airtel.“Any deterioration in their [Vodafone Idea and Airtel] financial health due to increased competition or inability to raise further funds can affect their ability to pay for infrastructure services which could adversely affect Indus’ revenues cash flows and overall financial condition” Indus said in its annual report for the financial year 2020-21.The immediate fallout of a Vodafone Idea demise will be the subscriber exodus – at rates which could be magnitudes higher than the current one.Vodafone Idea currently has over 270 million subscribers. Its death could overburden Airtel and Jio.“It’s not possible. The infrastructure of Bharti Airtel is not equipped to take on another 270 million people overnight. And Jio cannot do that either because they are not even equipped to take on 2G and 3G customers” explained R Chandrashekhar former secretary Telecom and information technology (IT) in an exclusive interview with Business Insider.In his SOS message to the government Kumar Mangalam Birla highlighted three issues that need to be addressed in order to save the failing telco – clarity on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues moratorium on spectrum payments and a floor pricing regime above the cost of service.Chandrashekhar explains that these requests are not viable. In the case of AGR dues the Supreme Court order leaves the government with no flexibility. The moratorium on spectrum payments would require changing the terms agreed to by the operators and offering support only to one telco is impossible.Lastly the floor pricing regime will require defining the cost of service which could be different from one telco to the other.Floor price refers to a minimum price for voice and data services which means telecom operators will not be able to offer rates lower than the floor price.This Chandrashekhar says makes it difficult for the government.Which brings us to the last option – coming up with a creative solution that minimises the risk for all the stakeholders.While Airtel and Jio may not be equipped to take on 270 million subscribers of Vodafone Idea the two telcos could come together as the interim caretakers for the subscribers on Vodafone Idea’s existing infrastructure.This will not only help maintain continuity of service for the 270 million users it will also give Airtel and Jio the time to scale up their network infrastructure to take in the inevitable influx of subscribers.There are two other possibilities to consider namely – the merger of the state-run BSNL with Vodafone Idea or choosing BSNL over Vodafone Idea.In the first case merging BSNL and Vodafone Idea might make it easy for subscribers in the short term but the long-term implications might make the situation worse for both BSNL and Vodafone Idea.“Converting Vodafone Idea into a government company or merging it with a government company might probably be a remedy worse than the disease” added Chandrashekhar.While BSNL is a much leaner organisation now it is still lagging behind private telecom players in terms of technology adoption capabilities and quality of service. It is being held back by a very limited rollout of 4G services. The stressed balance sheets of both Vodafone Idea and BSNL might also be another factor to avoid this marriage.Then there’s the soft challenge of culture clash.“Bringing together an Indian company a global company culture and a public sector company’s culture together and managing the fate of those 1 lakh public sector employees – who in the private sector has the wherewithal to do it?” asked Kapoor.Ultimately solving the problems of Vodafone Idea requires more than just a good plan.“It's a difficult problem at the outset but the solution requires not only a brilliant plan or a design but it requires a taker” said Chandrashekhar.SEE ALSO:",,,,,,,,,,,,

The oval-shaped insect more commonly known as a ladybug is so good at destroying creepy crawly nuisances that each one can devour 5000 aphids in its lifetime.

That’s why Grace a Girl Scout Junior with Troop 2399 of East Northport and about 60 other Suffolk County Girl Scouts helped spread 100000 ladybugs across the Pinelawn Memorial Park and Arboretum grounds in Pinelawn on Sunday.

""They kind of hang on"" Grace said as the insect crawled across her hand. ""Then you kind of shake them off on the bush.""

The 500-acre cemetery and garden routinely hosts free public education events including four previous ladybug releases beginning in 2018. The events almost always reach maximum capacity soon after they are announced said Kristyn Hovanec Pinelawn’s marketing manager.

Using a natural form of pest control like beneficial insects allows Pinelawn to avoid using commercial pesticides said Pinelawn grounds supervisor Fred Hoffman.

""They prevent us from having to spray the garden with any kind of chemical"" Hoffman told the Scouts who gathered at a bed of hydrangeas hostas and catmint to release the bugs. ""We just have the ladybugs run around and eat the aphids.""

Aphids are small usually green insects that can damage plants by sucking the sap out of stems and leaves according to Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County.

The Scouts who ranged from 5 to 14 years old had questions including one curious girl who asked why it looked like some ladybugs were giving each other piggyback rides. Another wanted to know where Pinelawn got so many ladybugs.

Hoffman told them that while Pinelawn typically orders ladybugs directly from laboratories West Coast wildfires this year have led to shortages. Instead a limited number of insects were ordered from an Amazon vendor he said.

""We got as many as we could"" Hoffman said.

The Scouts took in some more ladybug facts including descriptions of its life cycle stages (egg larva pupa and adult ladybug) and how its dots can mimic eyes to fend off predators. And while some think those spots can tell a ladybug’s age Hoffman told the group that is not true.

""That was a myth"" said 6-year-old Victoria Galli of Daisy Troop 32 which is affiliated with South Huntington School District.

The Scouts could use what they learned toward patches like the Brownie Bugs Badge or the Junior Incredible Insect Badge leaders said.

""Girls Scouts are all about community service and the environment and this is the perfect way to get involved"" said Diane Friedel of East Northport Grace’s mom and troop leader.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vbGVhbnRpbWVzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL29sZWFuLWJhc2VkLWZpcm0taGFzLXBsYW5zLWZvci1vbGQta21hcnQtc2l0ZS1pbi1hbGxlZ2FueS9hcnRpY2xlXzVmZjZiN2I5LTQ4NTktNTNjZC04ZWQ1LTYyNzUwZGU0NGY4My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Olean-based firm has plans for old Kmart site in Allegany,"Olean NY (14760)

All the major manufacturers have released or announced 5G phones.

Apple was the last of the major players to get involved with a 5G handset. The iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max are all 5G capable using Qualcomm 5G modems alongside Apple's fast A14 Bionic hardware that means the new devices are powerhouse performers as well as being fully 5G capable (the US models are compatible with mmWave).

As you may know you need to have a 5G-enabled phone to use 5G technology and you'll also need to make sure your network supports it before jumping in. If you're in the UK or US all major networks are now offering 5G in limited areas. And with second or even third-generation 5G devices now coming onto the market meaning still-excellent models are being sold off at cheaper prices.

What other 5G phones are on the way?

There are stacks of 5G phones debuting over the coming months. That's because every major handset launched will be 5G-capable.

Samsung is up next with new foldable phones that we believe will be called the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3. Apple OnePlus Nokia and Xiaomi are also all expected to have new devices.

The new iPhone series should be called the iPhone 13 logically but we wonder if it will make the move to the number 14 or even 12 S.

Huawei's current US trade ban prevents it from using Google services and apps. As such we aren't currently recommending its handsets as a viable option.

As it does with many things Apple took its time to get into 5G phones but has struck a fine note right away. While the iPhone 12 Pro doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from the standard iPhone 12 the Pro Max certainly does with its huge display and sheer desirability. It's a super performer too while the cameras are among the best we've seen especially in low light. It's eye-wateringly expensive though.

It's a 6.9-inch phone with a 3200 x 1440 AMOLED display. There are two headline facts about the camera - firstly there's a 100x zoom. Now we think this is more of a gimmick rather than being something truly practical.

Our pick for the best Android 5G phone out there currently the Note 20 Ultra is very similar to the S20 Ultra but features the desirable S Pen stylus and bang-up to-date Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ platform on US models (other models with Samsung's own Exynos hardware aren't so lucky). It also has probably the best display out there. It has a more pronounced (ugly) camera housing than the predecessor Note 10 but the lenses are well-balanced and a fine package.

Apple iPhone 12 More than enough reasons not to go Pro Specifications Release date: October 2020 Weight: 228g Dimensions: 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.4 mm OS: iOS 14 Screen size: 6.1-inch Resolution: 1170 x 2532 CPU: Apple A14 Bionic RAM: 4GB Storage: 64/128/256GB Battery: 2815 mAh Reasons to buy + Excellent dual camera + Almost as powerful as iPhone 12 Pro Reasons to avoid - Expensive - iPhone 12 mini better for some

The standard iPhone 12 is in many ways the pick of the new iPhone 12 range with plenty of reasons not to go for the same-sized iPhone 12 Pro - though we love the Pro Max as you can see above. The whole iPhone 12 range comes with the latest A14 Bionic platform so there's no performance limitation either (Pro has more RAM though). Available in Black White Red Green Blue there's also the iPhone 12 mini to consider too.

Samsung Galaxy S20 5G The new S20 is early 2020's key 5G phone in the UK and US Specifications Release date: March 2020 Weight: 163g Dimensions: 151.7 x 69.1 x 7.9mm OS: Android 10/One UI Screen size: 6.2-inch Resolution: 3200x1440 CPU: Exynos 990 or Snapdragon 865 RAM: 12GB Storage: 128GB Battery: 4000 mAh Reasons to buy + Several colour options + Some decent pricing around + A very powerful 5G phone Reasons to avoid - Only available in 128GB

This is 2020's key 5G phone - or rather it is until we get a 5G iPhone. The Samsung Galaxy S20 absolutely sings with flagship power under the hood in the form of Samsung's own Exynos 990 platform in Europe and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 in the US.

It's not small with a super bright 6.2-inch AMOLED display. While the more upmarket S20's have a quad camera there are three lenses here led by a very powerful 64 megapixel sensor. It's also capable of a 30x digital zoom.

It's competitively priced versus other handsets - the same can't be said for others in the S20 range - and is available on some good contract deals too.

It's only available in a 128GB version which is a bit of a shame but if you want bigger you can always plump for the S20+ instead.

The S20 comes in cloud pink cloud blue and cosmic grey.

Chinese phone maker Oppo has come up with something no other 5G phone has; a motorised selfie camera. Essential stuff? Absolutely not but it does mean that the Reno 5G has a notch-free display and is great value too. As well as that pop-up 16-megapixel front-facer for selfies and video calls this phone – the world’s first commercially available 5G handset when it was launched in 2019 – has a 48-megapixel primary camera alongside a sensor for 10x zoom.

Also inside this 6.6-inch phone are two nano SIM card slots to make global travel easier.

Samsung Galaxy A90 5G An affordable 5G phone at last Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Release date: October 2019 Weight: 206g Dimensions: 164.8x76.4x8.4 mm OS: Android 9 Screen size: 6.7-inch Resolution: 1080x2400 CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB Battery: 4500 mAh Colours: White Black Reasons to buy + Long battery life + Great-looking screen Reasons to avoid - No telephoto lens - No 3.5mm headphones jack

Happily Samsung’s attempt at cutting costs isn’t immediately noticeable on the Galaxy A90 5G. Its AMOLED display has a novel 20:9 aspect ratio which makes it a very tall phone. It’s there for watching widescreen video of course but it could also push productivity.

Unusually its three-camera array drops the telephoto lens so forget about optical close-ups. It’s also not quite as slim as or as lightweight as Samsung’s flagship phones and it’s a little plasticky to hold but the Galaxy A90 5G is nevertheless a great way to enter the 5G era.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzA4L3hpYW9taS1taS1taXgtNC1zdGFydHMtcHJlLXNhbGUtb24tdGhpcmQtcGFydHktc3RvcmVzL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzA4L3hpYW9taS1taS1taXgtNC1zdGFydHMtcHJlLXNhbGUtb24tdGhpcmQtcGFydHktc3RvcmVzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 starts pre-sale on third-party stores,"Xiaomi will finally release another regular MIX smartphone after three years.

While the excellent screen is one of the selling points the MIX 4 also uses good hardware.

This flagship smartphone comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus flagship processor. It will also be one of the first models globally to use this chip. This chip comes with Qualcomm’s sixth-generation AI Engine engine and its AI computing power hits 32 TOPS. This is better than Snapdragon 888’s 26TOPS. According to GeekBench the Mi MIX 4 has a single-core score of 863 while the multi-core score is 3181. The multi-core score is comfortably higher than its predecessor.

Under the hood the Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 will have a built-in 4500 mAh or 5000 mAh large battery that supports 120W fast charging. According to reports the wireless charging capacity is between 70W and 80W. If Xiaomi succeeds in using this wireless fast charging it will be the fastest in the industry. However if a recent proposal in China pulls through the company will not be able to use wireless charging above 50W.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdW5pc29jLWFubm91bmNlcy13b3JsZC1maXJzdC01Zy0xMDE2MDcxMzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UNISOC Announces World's First 5G NR Rel-16 Ready,"UNISOC together with China Unicom successfully completed end-to-end service validation of the world's first eMBB+uRLLC+IIoT (enhanced mobile broadband + ultra-reliable and low latency communications + industrial Internet of things) based on the 3GPP R16 standard laying a foundation for the commercial use of 5G R16.

But the exact megapixel numbers are unknown.

Nonetheless the series is launching next week and until then we expect to see some more rumors about the smartphones.

DGX,Quest Diagnostics,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzA3LzMtbWVkaWNhbC1kaWFnbm9zdGljLXN0b2Nrcy10aGF0LWxvb2stbGlrZS1ncmVhdC1iL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Medical Diagnostic Stocks That Look Like Great Buys Right Now,"They are coming off strong quarters yet appear to be underpriced based on their fundamentals. Is now a good time to buy?

Everyone loves a bargain and investors certainly aren't immune to that desire. However there's a difference between cheap and underpriced stocks. ""Cheap"" is in the eye of the beholder. An underpriced stock though is one that has a lower share price than its fundamentals say it should.

Three such stocks that fit in the latter category all of which are connected in some way to diagnostic testing are Quest Diagnostics (DGX -0.58%) Hologic (HOLX -0.32%) and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO -4.16%).

Try Quest Diagnostics if you're seeking a deal

Quest Diagnostics is the world's largest provider of medical diagnostic services. Basically if your physician requests bloodwork on you the chances are pretty good (one in three according to Quest) that the company will analyze the test.

The stock us up more than 23% for the year yet its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a miserly 8.7. This is for a company that has three years of revenue growth including last year when a lot of medical tests were deferred.

Quest just reported its second-quarter earnings and through the first six months of the year it had revenue of $5.3 billion up 44% year over year. Net income jumped a reported 284% to $1.1 billion through six months. The company said in its outlook that it expects to have yearly revenue this year between $9.54 billion and $9.79 billion compared to $9.4 billion in 2020.

The reason Quest's stock isn't higher -- along with its P/E ratio -- is investors are concerned that once the pandemic ebbs the need for COVID-19 testing will subside. That has been a revenue driver for more than a year for Quest. However the delta variant's spread shows that the need for COVID-19 testing may likely remain steady or even increase at least through the end of the year as businesses and schools increase testing requirements for employees and students to return.

Looking past that as the pandemic eases more typical medical procedures and testing will likely pick up. Quest has been a consistent stock whose total return has outperformed the S&P 500 Healthcare and Equipment Services Index three of the past five years including last year.

Hologic keeps growing revenue

Hologic focuses on women's health through the early detection of cervical sexual and vaginal issues. The company operates in four segments: breast health diagnostics GYN surgical and skeletal health and makes a variety of diagnostic detection and surgical products from assays to mammography systems and radiographs. The company's stock is up over 4% for the year but despite that it has a P/E ratio of only 9.7.

Hologic's stock hasn't fully rebounded yet from a second-quarter earnings miss despite reporting very strong third-quarter numbers.

Like Quest Hologic is active in COVID-19 testing but according to Hologic CEO Steve MacMillan it has seen an upswing in more traditional healthcare procedures.

In the third quarter the company reported revenue of $1.17 billion up 42% year over year and earnings per share of $1.04 up 96.2% compared to the third quarter in 2020. While diagnostics the segment that includes revenue from Hologic's COVID-19 assays was up 25% the growth in the other segments was more pronounced. GYN surgical was up 148.4% skeletal health grew 70.4% and breast health was up 55.8%. All three of those groups are bouncing back after being slowed by the pandemic last year.

Through nine months the company reported revenue of $3.8 billion already surpassing last year's total for the year of $3.78 billion and making it the 11th consecutive year Hologic has grown revenue. Through nine months the company also lists net income of $1.5 billion more than double the $616 million it reported last year through nine months.

Bio-Rad Laboratories keeps trending upward

Bio-Rad stock is up more than 29% for the year but even with that growth its P/E ratio is a tiny 5.6. The life science research and clinical diagnostics company's stock has grown annual revenue for five consecutive years giving investors a total return of 410.6% over that period.

Bio-Rad has diagnostic tests for nearly everything from veterinary care to food-borne pathogens and CRISPR gene-editing kits.

The company reported second-quarter revenue of $715.9 million up 33.4% year over year with gross margin increasing to 56.1% compared to 54.6 in the same period in 2020.

Bio-Rad's revenue streams are diverse. Chief Financial Officer Ilan Daskal on the company's second-quarter earnings call said that it made $68 million from COVID-19 testing in the quarter which represented about 9.5% of its total revenue.

The one downside in the quarterly report was that net income of $914.1 million was down from $966.4 million in the same period in 2020. That drop was related to changes in the company's Sartorius holdings management said. Taking a further look back at the company's comparative six-month numbers the company reported $1.89 billion in net income compared to $1.65 billion the year before.

A difficult decision

Of the three healthcare stocks Bio-Rad's low valuation diversity beyond COVID-19 testing and history of total return growth make it the most enticing stock for me. But in reality all three stocks should do well as things reopen as none of them are too dependent on COVID-19 testing. Quest's sheer size gives it some advantages of scale and its lower multiple gives it the edge to me over Hologic though that company has the longest track record of revenue increases.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Grace Elizabeth a Victoria’s Secret model who has sashayed the runways of Diane von Fürstenberg Michael Kors Ralph Lauren and Oscar de la Renta claims in court papers that cosmetic titan Revlon posted an image of her to the company’s Instagram and Facebook pages last year to promote its Skinlights Prismatic Bronzer according to her Manhattan Federal Court filing against the company.

In fact the 24-year-old Brooklynite was wearing make up from Marc Jacobs in the shot taken in January 2017 by Michael Schwartz for Vogue Mexico the model said in court papers.

“The shot was totally unrelated to advertising for Estee Lauder or Revlon. She is not wearing Revlon make-up” her attorney Edward Greenberg told The Post.

The model whose given name is Grace Elizabeth Harry Cabe had rejected an earlier offer to work for Revlon the lawyer said.

“No means no” Greenberg told The Post.

“Revlon used her image anyway” she charged in the litigation which says Revlon posted the Schwartz pic in April 2020 to “promote market and brand Revlon products.”

Elizabeth was not wearing Revlon makeup in the picture that the company used.

Cabe who boasts 1.3 million followers on Instagram has a bigger audience on the social media platform than Kate Moss former Revlon models Christy Turlington and Iman and 2018 Revlon catwalkers Imaan Hammam and Adwoa Aboah she said in the lawsuit.

Cabe has been featured on at least 38 magazine covers including Vogue in Brazil China Spain Germany Italy Japan Korea Mexico Paris Russia and Turkey according to the suit against Revlon which seeks unspecified damages.

A Revlon spokesperson downplayed the situation telling The Post: “Revlon mistakenly posted a single image of Ms. Elizabeth on social media. When we became aware of the mistake we quickly removed the image and we have sought to resolve this issue amicably and fairly with Ms. Elizabeth.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Brady who first honored military personnel in his Instagram called it “a humbling reminder for how lucky I am to play football for a living.” He then added a twist.

Brady wrote “and I also learned how I’d like to arrive to the stadium each week moving forward.”

Bucs center Ryan Jensen likewise got excited seeing the paratroopers. Jensen received the Bucs’ Salute to Service nomination last season for his volunteer work with military veterans.

“They deserve it” Jensen said in Thursday’s press conference. “Military is huge for me. I do a lot of work with the military. For me seeing the military members out here with the paratroopers flying in is just awesome. They do so much for us and for the organization to do a lot in return for the military is big in my mind.”

Brady has shown support of the military over the course of his 22-year NFL career. He gave a video message for the funeral of a Navy SEAL killed in Somalia in 2017 according to the New York Daily News. He also visited military personnel in Qatar in 2018 which he shared on social media.

In addition to Military Day at training camp the Bucs host multiple opportunities for military recognition throughout the season per Buccaneers.com.

Brady’s First Line of Defense

Bucs offensive linemen kept Brady in good shape last season despite an MCL tear as he put up 4633 yards passing for 40 touchdowns with a 65.7 completion percentage. The Bucs didn’t finish in the top 10 for any major rushing category but running back Leonard Fournette gave the team a big lift in the postseason.

“Everything just kind of clicked” Jensen said on Thursday. “Not having a traditional training camp not having the traditional OTA preseason games stuff like that and having a new quarterback I think everything just started to click for us. As you can see when it started to click we went to the moon and I think that’s just something with any offense every year. Eventually you have to get that jell in and you have to start clicking. For us last year we clicked at the right time and for us this year we want to consistently play that way.”

Consistency helps the Bucs up front amid the team returning all 22 starters from the Super Bowl season.

“Every day we’re stacking days getting better and better” Jensen said. “We’ve been together now for four years as a unit. There are still little things that every unit needs to work on and get better at. I feel through training camp we’re climbing that mountain and getting there.”

Bucs Rookie a Big Boost to the Offensive Line

Rookie offensive lineman Robert Hainsey has turned heads with his versatility at training camp thus far. The Bucs have him practicing at center which will give the team depth behind Jensen who slid over to guard to fill in for an injured Ali Marpet in November 2020.

“One thing is I’m a pretty good size for all three (positions)” Hainsey said per WFLA’s Karen Loftus. “I can kick out to tackle. I know I can play tackle if I need to. Moving inside is obviously something I’ve done just starting this past year and I’m enjoying that. Just physically I know I can do all three. Especially playing center I’m learning all the positions. I have to know everyone’s jobs. That’s been something I’ve been trying to learn a lot and focus on a lot. So now if I did have to play any guard or tackle then I know exactly what I need to do.”

The Bucs selected Hainsey in the third round at pick 95 of the NFL Draft in April.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaGFybG90dGUvbmFtZS9wYXQtYnV0bGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEzODQzOTIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pat Butler Obituary (1938 - 2021) - Homer GA - Charlotte Observer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/charlotte/name/pat-butler-obituary?id=13843923 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaGFybG90dGUvbmFtZS9wYXQtYnV0bGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEzODQzOTIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZ21lbmhxLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzA3L255LWdpYW50cy1lbGktbWFubmluZy1oYWxsLW9mLWZhbWUvOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Reasons NY Giants' Eli Manning Belongs in the Hall of Fame,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaWxsdW1pbmVyZGkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvYXVndXN0LTIwMjEtbW92aWVzLXRvLXdhdGNoLzIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,August 2021: Exciting New Movies You Don't Want To Miss,"The Night House

The latest says that Raymond Reddington and Katarina Rostova are the same person via split personality disorder.

Since the 2013 pilot episode The Blacklist has managed to keep viewers on the edge of their seats in hopes of discovering Raymond “Red” Reddington’s (James Spader) true identity. With season 8 revelations detailing Katarina Rostova’s (Lotte Verbeek) origin story — and how it relates to Reddington — some fans think there’s a simpler explanation that’s been there all along.

‘The Blacklist’ fan theories about Reddington’s identity aren’t lacking

In eight seasons NBC’s The Blacklist has kept the series’ biggest secret close to the vest: who is Raymond Reddington? Over the years many theories have surfaced. Some are credible and others are just as wild as the show itself.

Among those include whether Spader’s iconic character was Elizabeth Keen’s (Megan Boone) father a long-lost uncle an unrelated spy the real Raymond Reddington and Katarina Rostova. The possibilities for the answer are seemingly endless. With season 9 set to premiere in October new theories surrounding the mystery have emerged.

The latest fan theory is a doozy

Regardless of where your beliefs stand on Reddington’s identity it’s worth looking into the validity of the theories. New-ish information was revealed in the final three episodes of season 8 which means earlier theories could be a moot point. One thing fans do seem to agree on is that The Blacklist writers have at times contradicted their own mythology which is why we can’t take anything at face value.

The latest idea circulating combines a popular “Rederina” theory with a twist.

“Maybe Red is a split personality that emerged in Katarina at some point. Or maybe her brain created the ‘Red’ personality amid the trauma upon the death of RRR. Maybe Red became the dominant personality and ‘killed’ the Katarina personality by transitioning to male. Or maybe the Cape May episode is an acute psychotic break causing the Katarina personality to re-emerge temporarily. Maybe Red and Katarina are different people even though they’re physically the same person. It would explain why Dom forgave Katarina but not Red even if Red was also Kat” one Reddit fan wrote.

Others seem to agree as a lot of the “evidence” lines up with what we already know about the characters.

“A logical way to see it. I actually had similar thoughts about it before Nachalo and especially Konets. To me they all including himself behaved like Red was an incarnation of Katarina with all the memory preserved and having the same feelings toward the others but with other characteristics” another said.

“This makes so much sense. I had been thinking about it kind of in the opposite way: that Katarina’s personality was currently being repressed inside Red. But what you are describing seems more true to life” another added.”

At this point we can’t put anything past the writers.

‘The Blacklist’ bosses previously promised answers but did they deliver?

Season 9 isn’t too far off but many are still thinking about everything uncovered in season 8. Before the season finale series creator Jon Bokenkamp previously told Entertainment Tonight they planned to give viewers “meaty reveals.”

“The show has always been so much about identity. Who people are presenting themselves to be who they are how they’re changing and how that identity fits into the landscape of the show and the different characters. If anything this season because of Katarina and Liz and their quest it’s ultimately about truth” he said.

“It’s about answers and getting to the kinds of big meaty reveals that we haven’t really ever been able to do before. If there’s an overarching theme it’s truth.”

Seeing as the season 8 finale “Konets” was left to viewer interpretation we’re not sure how to feel about those sentiments. Hopefully by season 9 all will be revealed (seriously — please)."

Here is a recap of the journey of these two companies.

EVGA To Fix RPM Sensor Spikes on GeForce RTX 3090 FTW3 Series Graphics Cards Through BIOS Firmware Update

First it was reported that NVIDIA GPUs were becoming bricked during the gameplay of Amazon's brand new game New World currently in beta. As more developments came to light Igor Wallossek of Igor's Lab made a breakthrough and through trial and error mixed with a little speculation he discovered that EVGA's RTX 3090 FTW3 card was the specific model that was malfunctioning while playing the game.

His thoughts behind his answer were due to design flaws with the specific card a correction that NVIDIA made several years ago in the original design that other manufacturers have made workarounds to fix. The EVGA RTX 3090 FTW3 has a faulty design in the fan controller. During the process the framerate in the game becomes locked via the menus in-game. Because of the extremely high framerates that were being produced other experts were suspecting that not only EVGA's GPU was the problem but so were other graphics cards such as the Radeon RX 6800 to 6900 XT GPUs by AMD and the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti series by NVIDIA as well.

EVGA quickly started to allow for standard and Advanced RMAs to be created to alleviate the issues happening during gameplay because of their design. It was discovered that when placing an Advanced RMA for the replacement EVGA RTX 3090 series GPU the deposit that was required was not the same MSRP cost of the card (around $920) but a deposit of almost $1800. The price is similar to what was found with GPUs being purchased from scalpers. EVGA did not comment on the issue but website Tom's Hardware speculated that the reason for the high cost was to deter someone from paying the deposit for normal MSRP receiving the replacement unit and turning around and selling the card themselves for a high dollar amount and not returning the faulty product.

Now Jacob Freeman PM of EVGA took to Twitter and assured that there would be an update to the firmware of the EVGA RTX 3090 FTW3 that would fix the RPM issue. Keep in mind that EVGA has never stated that they were responsible for any issues. Amazon did release a statement denying that the game was not an issue but did release an update to halt any overclocking during gameplay that would initiate an issue with any GPU manufacturer's cards.

Update: Will have new firmware for cards soon to improve this. This may occur if there happens to be noise in the i2c bus from where RPM is read. Precision already filters out erroneous readings but other apps may not. This is strictly a RPM reporting issue. https://t.co/xnMpWq86NX — Jacob Freeman (@EVGA_JacobF) August 6 2021

Freeman explains that the fault is in the noise of the I2C bus where the data from the RPM is read. He continues to state that any users utilizing EVGA's Precision software will be covered due to the filtration of the bus when reading the data.

Is there any official info yet on what caused the failure of some cards in New World? Some saw the problem in a faulty PWM controller and justified this with the high RPM signal which they read out. As I understand you now it is simply a faulty I2C signal and not related. — Andreas Schilling (@aschilling) August 6 2021

The most popular graphics card tool now offers support for Radeon RX 6600 XT GPU.

Among many changes the new TechPowerUP GPU-Z mainly focuses on recent AMD and NVIDIA GPU launches. The tool now supports a full range of NVIDIA CMP HX mining cards RTX Ampere workstation cards and recently launched RTX 3050 Laptop GPU. The soon-to-release Radeon RX 6600 XT is now also supported by the tool alongside Radeon PRO W6800 and W6600 workstation cards.

GPU-Z will now recognize Windows 11 operating system and verify if the graphics card driver conforms to the WDDM 3.0 standard. Additionally the tool received an update for Navi GPUs which will now show GPU clocks in the Advanced tab regardless if clocks are reported as 0.

A very interesting update has also been introduced to the Texture Mapping Unit calculation algorithm. Many leaks featuring the unreleased graphics cards and GPU-Z software often showed a wrong TMU count. The 2.41.0 version will solve this issue by introducing a new estimation algorithm for upcoming NVIDIA GPUs (including unreleased Ampere and upcoming Ada Lovelace). Finally a small but important update is the new tooltip translation for Chinese users.

The software is now available for download from the link below.

But the manufacturer doesn't use standard components here. On the contrary a custom-developed platform is used which is tailored to the needs of a workstation. In our test sample the well-designed and modular case is equipped with no less than the most powerful AMD processor at the moment and AMD's latest workstation graphics card.

The AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3995WX meets the AMD Radeon Pro W6800

The AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3995WX is a 64-core CPU with a total of 128 threads. The graphics card is the AMD Radeon Pro W6800 which succeeds the AMD Radeon Pro W5700 and is now based on RDNA2 like the current desktop gaming graphics cards. This means that the AMD Radeon Pro W6800 also offers hardware support for real-time ray tracing and can access 32 GB of VRAM. With a whopping 256 GB of DDR4 RAM even very memory-intensive applications can be mastered without issues because thanks to the AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3995WX there's octa-channel support which leads to very good RAM data transfer rates. At 256 GB the SSD installed in our test model of the P620 is very small in comparison. It would probably be better to choose the next larger model when selecting a configuration.

Speaking of the chosen configuration: You can customize the Lenovo ThinkStation P620 to your heart's content in Lenovo's online store. The manufacturer offers a variety of options here. However users who want to buy the device in the version that we're reviewing will have to dig deep into their pockets. The base price (3179 Euros (~$3739)) is very far away from the Ultimate configuration: The system used in our review costs around 13000 Euros (~$15292).

Note: This review was first published on 4 August 2021.

Exceptional performance and a price to match

The MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Suprim X is the company's top-of-the-line GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. Every aspect of it oozes extravagance down to the price. If the S$2799 price tag of the ASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3080 Ti was sky high the MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti knocks it absolutely out of this world. At S$3288 the MSI card is incredibly expensive almost ridiculously so. The question now is – is it worth it?

For starters the card spans some gargantuan proportions measuring a good 336mm long and 140mm across. It'll take up the full three slots in your chassis so you should really check beforehand if you have space for it. At just under 2kg it's super heavy as well so a certain amount of sag is to be expected. Fortunately MSI has included an adjustable GPU bracket to take some of the strain off your PCIe slot. A metal bracket helps reinforce the card and protect the PCB from flexing but the included GPU bracket should really come in handy and give you a peace of mind.

The premium construction of the card shows itself in the brushed aluminium shroud which confers a really solid feel. The TriFrozr 2S cooler keeps things chilly featuring three Torx 4.0 fans. Each double-ball bearing fan has a unique design where individual pairs of blades are linked with a ring of sorts. This is supposed to help focus airflow toward the heatsink and increase static pressure. This cooling system itself is identical to what was featured in the earlier RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio but the new brushed metal shroud is the visual highlight that elevates the graphics card to another level.

Elsewhere MSI has taken care to give the memory modules their own heatsink and heat pipe to help whisk heat away. This is a nice touch as they're sometimes neglected even on custom cards. To keep the GPU die cool MSI has gone with a nickel-plated copper base plate and an array of seven heat pipes to channel heat to the sprawling heatsink. The heat pipes run the full length of the heatsink for more efficient heat dissipation and they've also been machined flat to maximize the surface area that comes in contact with the copper base plate. Well-placed thermal pads provide additional heat dissipation for other components on the PCB.

When it comes to the heatsink itself MSI's attention to detail really shows. The fin edges have been shaped like waves which supposedly disrupt unwanted airflow noise for quieter operation. Disruptors also provide additional surface area and guide air to where it's needed for better cooling. Finally the fans themselves will stop spinning when the GPU isn't working hard further reducing noise when you're not actually gaming.

Flip the card over and you'll see the brushed metal backplate with the MSI dragon logo inlaid on the right. It's a really luxe look that I love and everything about the card screams quality. The backplate itself even doubles as a passive heatsink with still more thermal pads located beneath for improved cooling.

At the edge of the card you'll notice a dedicated BIOS switch that lets you switch between Gaming and Silent modes without the need for any software. The PCB itself has gotten some special treatment too with a thickened copper layer for increased conductivity for better heat dissipation and reliability according to MSI. Additional fuses were also built into the PCB for stronger safeguards against electrical damage.

The card requires three 8-pin connectors for power making for one extra cable to wrangle with. MSI also recommends having at least an 850W power supply to work with a rather high bar to clear if you're not already running a high-end system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvZGVsbC14cHMtMTUtOTUxMC1iaW9zLXVwZGF0ZS1maXhlcy1nYW1pbmctcGVyZm9ybWFuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dell XPS 15 (9510) Owners Download This BIOS Update ASAP For Max Gaming Performance,"



Laptops are complicated beasts. There's a whole PC jammed into the base of a foldable computer and as such thermal management is a huge challenge. To get the best performance out of a CPU or GPU requires giving it as much power as possible without overheating the innards or making the outside of the system too hot to handle. Sometimes things go awry within the power management routines of a notebook however and performance tanks for no apparent reason. Such is the case with the Dell XPS 15 9510 but the good news is that a fix is just a BIOS update away.Dell's XPS notebooks are some of our favorites around here and one of the reasons is that the company stands behind its products and fixes issues when they arise. In this case the more upscale versions of the company's XPS 15 9510 come equipped with a GeForce RTX 3050 Ti . The GPU has a 45 Watt Total Graphics Power (TGP) specification. However under a sustained load the performance can drop off considerably as the notebook unnecessarily throttles performance and power.Fortunately for XPS 15 9510 owners BIOS update version 1.4 has already been posted to Dell's support website with a fix and is ready for download. Most users will probably find out about the update through a notification in Dell's update software or the My Dell application. Dell's BIOS updates are traditionally simple to install -- just run an executable and the system takes care of flashing and rebooting. In this case after a reboot GPU performance should return to normal.We're glad to see Dell stand behind the XPS 15 9510 and get this issue resolved in a timely manner. The folks at Notebook Check noticed the issue right away and got a chance to test out the BIOS update to confirm that gaming performance has returned to normal.While we haven't gotten a chance to take the XPS 15 9510 for a spin we recently took a look at the XPS 17 9710  its sibling with a beefier GeForce RTX 3060 and Intel's latest Tiger Lake-H notebook CPUs. We didn't experience any gaming funny business on that machine and bestowed up on it our Editor's Choice award for its performance and light weight design. Folks who need to step down in size from the XPS 17 would likely find the XPS 15 to be a nice fit."

""We have to go find it"" said Emanuele Azzaretto. ""So you always have a little knot until you find [it] and we know we can bring it back home.""

Azzaretto is both an experienced diver and as a native of Italy also an experienced wine drinker. ""I married all the things I like and tried to turn it into a job!"" he said.

Azzaretto then disappeared into the water and about 20 minutes later a massive metal cage broke the surface. Inside the cage: a bounty of nearly 1500 bottles of red wine.

This find was not dumb luck; Azzaretto knew what he was looking for because he sank it in the ocean a year ago. He is the co-founder of Ocean Fathoms a company experimenting with using the ocean floor as a wine cellar.

The bottles come out dripping with sea water and shellacked with sea shells. ""Each bottle I mean it's an art piece"" he said.

""It does look like something you'd find on a pirate ship"" said correspondent Ben Tracy.

After just one year in the murky depths the bottles have bonded with the ocean bottom attracting plenty of curious (and perhaps thirsty) sea creatures. But Ocean Fathoms is more interested in the ocean's influence on the inside of the bottle. It calls this section of the Santa Barbara Channel ""nature's perfect cellar"" because there is little oxygen and light; the temperature remains a constant 54 degrees; and ocean currents gently rock the bottles.

Tracy asked ""So the motion of the ocean really is just kind of cradling these things?""

""Absolutely"" Azzaretto said. ""And then we are in the Santa Barbara Channel there's all the whales here. So imagine what the bottles hear from here: the whales are singing to them!""

""So they get cradled by the ocean and lullabies from the whales? That's a good life as a bottle of wine' Tracy said.

""Yeah it is. For us too when we drink it!""

""Better than you're gonna get in somebody's closet.""

Azzaretto was inspired by stories he read a few years ago about a treasure trove of champagne from a shipwreck found on the bottom of the Baltic Sea. The 168 bottles including some very vintage Veuve Clicquot were still highly drinkable after 170 years underwater.

The famed champagne house has since created its own ""cellar in the sea"" program storing various bottles of bubbles 130 feet down in a Baltic Sea wine vault.

Rajat Parr was a sommelier for 18 years and now makes his own wine near California's Central Coast where the cool ocean breeze provides ideal conditions for making world class wine – the perfect temperature to grow grapes.

But when Ocean Fathoms approached Parr about dropping some of his best vintages into the Pacific he was ""intrigued and super-curious"" but not convinced.

Tracy asked ""At first you thought this might be kind of a gimmick?""

""Oh 100%"" Parr replied. ""In the beginning I was like could be interesting but I just don't know. I wasn't sure.""

He ultimately decided to sacrifice a few bottles to see what happens. The result? ""Mind was blown!"" he said. ""I realized it was definitely not a gimmick!""

Tracy asked ""What does the ocean do to the wine?""

""The wine evolves in texture"" Parr said. ""Wine tannin becomes softer tannins. Wines which are kind of rustic become more round but the nose is identical. It does not age in aromas. It only ages in texture.""

Tracy asked ""And how long would it typically take you to get that kind of texture in a cellar?""

""I don't know – five-plus years?""

The bottles sell for a premium starting around $350. But not everyone is a true believer. The California Coastal Commission is reviewing Ocean Fathoms' permit application and has expressed concerns about the wine cages' impact on marine life and fishing grounds.

Meanwhile Azzaretto popped open a bottle from his sea cellar from which Tracy got to sample: ""Nice! Yeah it's silky. Well you found your treasure.""

""I did finally"" Azzaretto said. ""And now we get to enjoy it!""

During Council’s Aug. 2 work session multiple Council members expressed frustration with Republic citing calls from constituents due to delayed pickup.

Mayor Bryan Jensen reported to Council that Republic Services regional representative Dave Kidder had informed him that the company had invoked a clause in its memorandum of understanding enabling it to invoke a one-time three percent rate increase.

“I told him that I thought it was poor timing for this and I asked him if he (Kidder) would come to next week’s meeting so we could have some discussions in terms of how we’re going to move forward with the yard waste” Jensen said.

The mayor added he had floated a couple of ideas to Republic in working to mitigate the city’s concerns and alleviate the frustration from residents on delayed pickup times for their yard waste.

Republic Services has advised the city that staffing shortages are responsible for the delays.

“I think everybody knows even within the county that Republic has been struggling and so is every other hauler struggling to get help” Jensen said. “He’s (Kidder) telling me most of it is because of the physical labor part not so much other than mechanical picking up of our garbage cans or even recycling.”

Kidder will bring forward an idea at Council’s regular session set for Aug. 9 where both sides will aim to work out a solution.

The city signed a five-year memorandum of understanding with Republic on Feb. 18 2019 passing on joining the Lorain County Solid Waste Consortium which comprises of multiple Lorain County communities.

The memorandum of understanding according to Avon Law Director John Gasior operates the same as a contract.

But Council-at-Large member Tammy Holtzmeier wants to take the opportunity to review the terms of the agreement in preparation for the Aug. 9 meeting.

Avon Ward 2 Councilman Dennis McBride didn’t pull any punches and said Republic should throw some money at the problem and honor its commitment to Avon.

“If they’re now saying it’s because of physical labor you can get physical labor you just have to pay more money” McBride said.

He added it’s time for Republic to do what it takes to address the staffing shortages noting it is a publicly traded company with profits in the billions.

McBride said while returning from a trip to Cedar Point on Aug. 2 before Council’s work session he received no fewer than 12 calls from residents concerned about the delays in picking up their yard waste.

According to previous reporting by The Morning Journal city officials expected the city and ratepayers to save $1.1 million over the life of the agreement which runs through 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvc2NlcnJpdG9zbmV3cy5uZXQvMjAyMS8wOC8wNy93aGl0dGllci1jb3VuY2lsbWFuLWRlZmFtZXMtY2Vycml0b3MtbmV3c3BhcGVyLWFuZC1wdWJsaXNoZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Whittier Councilman Defames Cerritos Newspaper and Publisher,"Whittier Councilman Defames Cerritos Newspaper and Publisher

August 7 2021

STAFF REPORT

Whittier City Councilman Henry Bouchot is not a dumb guy graduating from Loyola Marymount and Boston University and then getting elected to the Whittier City Council in 2018.

But something happened in the years after his graduation. In 2018 he spent a massive $100000 to win his current Whittier Council seat; many people called that “very dumb” even though he won.

Now he is running for the 32nd State Senate seat against incumbent Bob Archuleta and plowed in another $100000 into his campaign coffers while splitting his loyalties between the State Senate seat and his Whittier Council seat.

He is leaving Whittier residents hanging refusing to comment on his council seat race until he learns his Senate race outcome.

Some call that very dumb too including many Whittier residents who saw him run in 2018 only to try and leave in 2022.

Whittier Mayor Joe Vinatieri told the WDN that he was surprised to hear that Bouchot was running for state Senate with $100000 of his own money.

Vinatieri said it could be difficult for Bouchot should he run for both Council and Senate “It always raises issues when you run for two seats as to where your loyalties are and what your ambitions are” he said. “It’s a distraction for voters. They like to know where your heart lies.”

Los Cerritos Community Newspaper (LCCN) Publisher/Owner Brian Hews has never heard of the Bouchot.

“I have not met Bouchot nor have I attended any Whittier Council meetings. I am old school unlike the younger reporters the Council is the Daily News’ domain; you don’t play in another newspaper’s sandbox.

The first time I heard about Bouchot was when I was told by reliable sources about his reckless and defamatory statements against myself and my newspaper.”

Hews’ sources two local elected officials said that Bouchot was telling people he “gave a bunch of money” to Hews and “invested money” into LCCN.

“I was shocked since he is not a newspaper executive he is unaware how damaging his false statements could be to my paper’s standing in Los Angeles communities.”

Immediately after hearing about Bouchot’s statements Hews fired off an email demanding a public retraction.

“I have it from good sources that you are running around the city telling people you “invested in my newspaper that you gave me a bunch of money. That is a bald-faced lie. You are using my hard-earned goodwill to advance your political career by lying and defaming this newspaper my ethics are in question because of your reckless statements. I demand a retraction and quote ASAP I will not hesitate to take you to court for your reckless statements.”

Hews copied his attorney Scott Talkov of Riverside-based Talkov Law.

Bouchot never answered. The next email Hews got was from his attorney informing Hews that Bouchot had hired an attorney.

“Pretty much sealed the deal” Hews said “why would Bouchot lawyer up? He is confirming he made those statements. And he has not answered my initial email or my texts demanding a retraction. If he did not say it he would have denied it already.

“I bought this paper (LCCN) 20 years ago after running my family-owned Wave Newspapers for over 13 years. I get attacked all the time by people and politicians who I expose for corruption. As Mayor Cerritos Councilman Naresh Solanki dissolved the Cerritos’ five-person Economic Development Commission when I was a commissioner after I ran a story about his questionable City Council campaign finances.

“Current appointed Councilman Bruce Barrows on the dais during a meeting demanded that city advertising be taken from the newspaper after a similar article was published about him.

“Abuse of office certainly. But in my over 33 years in this business no one has ever said what Bouchot said; that is really stupid. It can be very damaging to myself and the newspaper’s standing in the community in so many other ways and he still has not retracted.”

Sources have told Hews that Bouchot has been unsuccessful in securing crucial endorsements for his Senate campaign from area politicians so he lies about the money he gave LCCN in an attempt to coerce the politicians into an endorsement.

Asked if Hews will file a defamation complaint against Bouchot he said “I will wait to see if he issues a public retraction but not long.”

He was 80.

Ringwald known to friends and fans as Bob died Aug. 3 Molly Ringwald wrote in an obituary Saturday for the Sacramento Bee. No cause was given.

Born in Roseville California. with vision problems Ringwald went blind at an early age. He began taking piano lessons at 5 and started his first band at 13.

“Four years later at the age of 17 he was able to grow enough of a beard to be able to pass for an adult to play in nightclubs as a professional musician an occupation he held for the next six decades” his daughter wrote.

At first drawn to modern jazz the music of Louis Armstrong instilled in Ringwald a lifelong passion for the performance and preservation of traditional New Orleans jazz.

By the 1970s Ringwald was playing piano at clubs seven nights a week.

He co-organized the first Sacramento Jazz Festival in 1974 and his band headlined the event which became an annual city tradition. In 2012 Ringwald was honored by the festival as “The Emperor of Jazz.”

In addition to music Ringwald’s passions included ham radio and the Los Angeles Dodgers for whom he once served as a guest announcer reading the lineup in Braille.

“Anyone who knew Bob also knew his mischievous streak and his ever-present slightly ribald sense of humor. If you didn’t sufficiently beg to get off of his email joke list you would have received one just a couple of days before he died” Molly Ringwald wrote.

Besides his daughter Molly Robert Ringwald is survived by Adele his wife of 60 years; a sister Renée Angus; another daughter Beth Ringwald Carnes; a son Kelly Ringwald; two grandsons; two granddaughters; two step-granddaughters; one great-grandson; and one step-great-grandson.

Several members of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said the mainstream sentiment on the body is still extremely cautious about expanding the programme to 12- to 15-year-olds even though a deputy chief medical officer has suggested that outcome is high probable and politicians have said they would like the issue to remain under review.

The JCVI recommended on Wednesday that all over-16s be offered jabs just two weeks after saying children should not routinely be given Covid vaccinations. The U-turn provoked alarm at what was described as a “shambolic” vaccine rollout for older teenagers with doctors saying they were being “left in the dark” about the details of the rollout to younger people.

The JCVI has moved to “refresh” the membership of its Covid subcommittee in recent weeks with one prominent critic of Covid jabs for children Prof Robert Dingwall leaving the body.

Dingwall and others on the committee said his views were not the reason for the shake-up and that sentiment on the body is still that the risks outweigh the benefits for 12- to 15-year-olds. Three other members – Prof Lucy Yardley Prof Liz Miller and Prof Bryan Charleston – also left at a similar time.

Jonathan Van-Tam a deputy chief medical officer has said it was “more likely than less likely” that the list of eligible children would be broadened.

However one expert who remains a member of the JCVI said the overriding opinion of the body was still against expanding vaccinations to 12- to 15-year-olds and argued that the committee was more likely to recommend removing categories of vulnerable children who are currently offered vaccines.

Committee members said they had not felt political pressure to change their views when it came to changing its advice on 16- and 17-year-olds. However two members on the committee said there had been a fear that Scotland could go its own way on vaccinating older teenagers even though the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has consistently said her government will follow JCVI advice.

Dingwall professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University told the Guardian that his leaving the JCVI subcommittee on Covid was nothing to do with his views about vaccinating teenagers. “People are seeing a conspiracy where none exists. This is something that has been prefigured for several weeks and it’s entirely coincidental that it happens to be at the same time as the review on vaccination for 16- and 17-year-olds.

“I am being portrayed as some kind of lone voice critic of vaccination for [teenagers] but at no point have my views been any different from the broad consensus on JCVI. This idea I’ve been a single roadblock is just nonsense” he said. “I don’t feel that my absence is a great loss to JCVI and I have every respect for the integrity of colleagues.”

His departure was reported by the Spectator on Thursday and sparked outrage in some quarters of social media but Dingwall said his departure was to do with pulling more work back into the main JCVI committee.

Dingwall was co-opted to the JCVI’s Covid-19 committee from the chief medical officer’s Moral and Ethical Advisory Group of which he remains a member.

He has previously expressed scepticism about vaccinating children saying they were at “low risk for Covid” and suggested they might have been better protected by simply catching the virus. He has also written previously in favour of lifting Covid restrictions once the population is mostly vaccinated.

A JCVI spokesperson said: ‘The JCVI is a group of independent experts who discuss the latest available evidence to reach decisions on how to best use Covid-19 vaccines to protect the public. The main JCVI committee has provided all advice and recommendations to ministers on Covid-19 vaccines. The committee is united in its efforts to reach a consensus in order to provide robust advice to ministers on how best to continue preventing hospitalisation and deaths from Covid-19.”

Asked about Scotland’s role in the process a Scottish government spokesman said: “The CMO [chief medical officer] wrote to the JCVI last week noting they faced ‘challenging decisions often based on newly emerging or limited clinical data’ and thanked them for their endeavours to date. He outlined that he understood that the JCVI was this week set to consider further data on the issue. Dr [Gregor] Smith outlined that there was an urgency to these considerations ‘given the early return of schools in Scotland in mid-August’.”

The spokesperson said Smith hoped the JCVI would say more about their consideration of the impact of Covid on the long-term health of young people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcmVhbC1yZWFzb24tbmljb2xlLWJyb3duLXNpbXBzb25zLXNpc3Rlci1jYW5ub3Qtc3RhbmQta3Jpcy1qZW5uZXIuaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Real Reason Nicole Brown Simpson's Sister Cannot Stand Kris Jenner,"Find out why Nicole Brown Simpson's sister is not fond of Kris Jenner. The reason may not be what you think.

Back in 2007 when the Kardashian-Jenner family was first featured on TV we learned very quickly that Kris Jenner was good friends with the late Nicole Brown Simpson. The momager made it known countless times just how tight the two women had been before Nicole’s murder in 1994. They were so close that Kris even named her daughter who was born the following year Kendall Nicole Jenner.

These days Kris and her family are household names with millions of fans around the world but one person who isn’t a fan of the family matriarch is Nicole’s sister Denise Brown. Read on to find out the exact reason why she cannot stand Kris.

Kris’ ex husband represented O.J. Simpson in the ‘Trial of the Century’

Many Americans first heard the name Kardashian during the criminal trial of O.J. Simpson. That’s because Robert Kardashian who Kris was married to from1978 to 1991 was representing the former NFL running back when he was accused of murdering Nicole and restaurant worker Ronald Goldman.

Robert and O.J. had been good friends for a long time which is how their wives got to know each other. Some had thought that Nicole’s sister was upset with Kris because Robert was defending the person she was convinced murdered Nicole. But that’s not the case.

During the trial Kris sat on the same side of the courtroom as Nicole’s family leaving no doubt about what she believed.

This is what Kris did that made Denise Brown so angry

The real reason Denise became upset with Kris has to do with what the momager did post-fame. In 2011 Kris wrote a memoir titled Kris Jenner … And All Things Kardashian. In it she spoke at length about Nicole’s murder and claimed that her dear pal once told her O.J. was going to kill her and get away with it.

To some including Denise it looked like Kris was trying to profit off Nicole’s death.

Denise was not pleased and in an interview with the National Enquirer she didn’t hold back her feelings about Kris’ choice to discuss what happened to her sister. “Kris Jenner is pathetic! I think most people will question her intentions of writing about my sister’s murder. I am really disappointed in Kris” Denise told the publication. “For the past two and a half years my family has had some relative peace regarding all of this stuff. Now that Kris has brought it up again she’s split open the healing wounds. For her to write about it is like reliving it all over again. My poor mother is really taking it hard. Haven’t [the Kardashian-Jenners] made enough?!”

Nicole’s murder remains unsolved

Nicole and waiter Ron Goldman were found brutally murdered outside of Nicole’s home in Brentwood California on June 12 1994.

O.J. who was Nicole’s ex-husband was the only person ever charged with the murders. However in the murder trial where Robert Kardashian was on his legal team the former football star was acquitted.

Today the murders remain unsolved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL2ZhbnRhc3RpYy1sb25kb24taG90ZWwtbGFuZG1hcmtzLWhhbGYtbWFyYXRob24tc29maXRlbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Fantastic London Landmarks Half Marathon Hotel Stay!,"A week ago we had one of our better hotel stays in London. Sure part of it was just the joy of being back in a major city and seeing people enjoying life again but another part was total satisfaction of plotting travel to perfection and having a hotel live up to expectation.

My partner was running the London Landmarks Half Marathon and noted casually that the event starts somewhere near London’s Pall Mall alongside St. James Park Buckingham Palace No. 10 and a variety of iconic London Landmarks.

My mind instantly jogged to the Sofitel St. James an Accor ALL hotel. We’d stayed at the hotel in 2019 and had a great time with easy walking access to great food and spaces to stroll and I figured it was probably a decent location for the race.

The Night Before

I couldn’t help but laugh as we made our way into the hotel. Signage was already being placed for “race start” just around the corner from the hotel entrance on the afternoon before the race so I was already joyed with the location pick. Rooms start in the mid to high £200’s and I think we paid about £300 given the peak timing.

Wait though it gets better.

On arrival the hotel staff were friendlier than ever. Marion who checked us in was exceptionally kind and good with detail ensuring that we had the right bedding setup for our little one and hopefully to get my partner a good night’s sleep.

I was handed a voucher for welcome drinks as part of the Accor ALL program and before I could say “thanks anyway” Marion noted that they could actually be used for ordering a drink up to the room.

With many people still hesitant to mingle in social spaces I thought this was a fantastic touch. Making things even more enjoyable. Any wine offered “by the glass” on the bar menu was eligible so I was able to enjoy a glass of wine I’d actually drink at home in this instance a nice 2014 Tuscan blend.

A short walk to Cafe Murano a lovely dinner and off to bed. It all felt good but nothing could compare to the next morning.

Race Day Festivities

Marion unsurprisingly was in the lobby the next morning welcoming guests. She was also wearing one of those big rubber “#1” hands for encouragement. The hotel had a sweet setup for any racers staying at the hotel with complimentary water and snacks too.

Any smugness about clever planning I had the day before was totally outdone by the morning of! Directly outside the hotel people were forming queues to get ready for the starting line. You could also see H-U-G-E queues for the loos. If you’ve ever run a 5K 10K Half or Marathon – you’ll know that this is a significant part of the morning.

Not for us though! We were able to assess the appropriate time for the group start enjoy the full environment of the music the crowd support and the well wishings to runners but also to jump back into the room for quiet peace… and a private loo.

The hotel offers a generally stellar room service menu allowing for maximum sleep and rest ahead of race time. Basically it was just a really fun and easy going morning whereas most race mornings are manic and full of nerves ( as well as transportation).

The hotel generously granted a late checkout so Laura was able to shower stretch and unwind after the race while Olive (our daughter) and I checked out the hotel bar. This was an experience we’ll absolutely reproduce for next year’s London Landmarks.

Bottom Line: London Is Back

Walking along St. James Park you can’t help but smile. London is back people are slowly making their way back in and restaurants and cafes have a buzz about them.

In a city like London there’s absolutely no shortage of excellent hotels – Rosewood Renaissance St. Pancras Andaz Liverpool Street to name a few but for this occasion we couldn’t have been happier anywhere else.

I love the Sofitel St James because it created a great new lifelong travel memory for us in a time when people need good new travel memories."

The “Blackish” star posted a video on Instagram today of her working out with a friend. For the ensemble Ross sported a beige piece of athleisure wear that featured a mesh top with an open back and leggings with mesh cutouts.

As it pertains to footwear the star trudged in a pair of green and pink sneakers that were effervescent and eye-catching. They feature a semi-thick sole which emphasizes comfort and security.

The star’s personal style lives on the crux of chic on-trend and edgy. With her gravitating toward more avant-garde luxury labels like Loewe J.W. Anderson and Bottega Veneta she proves that she has an eye and affinity for pushing the envelope when it comes to fashion. On the footwear front Ross typically fancies statement-making pumps intricate boots and striking heeled sandals from brands like Christian Louboutin Le Silla and Giuseppe Zanotti just to name a few. When she’s not gracing magazine covers or sashaying down red carpets she dabbles in sneaker silhouettes and clothing that’s comfortable yet stylish.

Ross is no stranger to being in the limelight of the fashion industry — in fact she welcomes it. She’s shown that she can model with the best of them by posing in ad campaigns for the French luxury fashion house Kenzo and walking in fashion shows for a principled luxury fashion house like Thierry Mugler back in the ’90s.

The 417th episode of the Royal Caribbean Blog Podcast is now available where Matt interviews Royal Caribbean Group Chief Product Innovation Officer Jay Schneider.

Mr. Schneider shares a peek behind the proverbial curtain to talk about what his group has been doing during the cruise industry shutdown.

When do you have to take a Covid test before your Royal Caribbean cruise?

If you have a cruise coming up you are going to need to get a Covid test result so when should you actually make an appointment for a test?

Many cruisers are confused as to when they should plan to get a test to ensure the results come back in time but not take the test too early either.

The logistics of when and where to get a test before your cruise is somewhat confusing so here is what you need to know about getting a Covid-19 test before your cruise so you can get onboard without any issues.

How Royal Caribbean invested in new port projects and tech during the cruise industry shutdown

Royal Caribbean may have been shutdown for 15 months but that does not mean there has not been any progress made behind the scenes.

Royal Caribbean Group Chief Product Innovation Officer Jay Schneider shared a look at the product development and private destination innovations his group has been busy working on since the shutdown began.

Mr. Schneider talks about updates to Royal Caribbean's app its private beach destinations and even new ship upgrades.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8wNy9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tZmx5aW5nLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtaG9tZS1wcml2YXRlLWpldC1pZi10aGV5LWhhdmUtY292aWQtMTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean is flying passengers home on a private jet if they have Covid-19,"Cruise ship passengers that test positive for Covid-19 are not just left behind at the nearest port. In fact Royal Caribbean takes the health and safety of passengers crew members and the communities their ships visit seriously enough to hire private transportation home.

Unlike other industries that have had little to no government regulations regarding their Covid-19 response and protocols the cruise industry has been held to a much higher standard with requirements and oversight.

Exemplifying the cruise industry's commitment to the welfare of its guests is the fact anyone that has tested positive for Covid during the course of a cruise has been flown home in a private jet.

Considering the expense and logistics involved in flying anyone home at the last minute on private transportation the fact Royal Caribbean is using private jets and limousines for those afflicted with Covid is rather impressive.

Royal Caribbean says vaccinated guests and children not yet eligible to be vaccinated who book a cruise sailing on or before October 31 2021 will have the following Covid-19 Assistance at no extra charge.

100% cruise fare refund for you and your Travelling Party if any of you tests positive for Covid-19 within 14 days prior to the cruise or at the boarding terminal.

Pro-rated cruise fare refund if your cruise is cut short for reasons related to Covid-19.

If you test positive for Covid-19 during the cruise Royal Caribbean will cover the costs of Covid-19 related medical treatment onboard any required land-based quarantine and travel home for you and your Traveling Party.

Unvaccinated guests age 12 and older sailing from Florida homeports who booked prior to March 19 2021 or after June 28 2021 will not be subject to this Covid-19 Assistance and must provide proof of travel insurance as outlined in prior to boarding.

Two RoyalCaribbeanBlog readers recently had the unfortunate opportunity to be flown home during their cruise due to Covid.

Daniel was on Adventure of the Seas in June when towards the end of his cruise he tested positive for Covid during a routine Covid test for all passengers. Everyone else in his traveling party tested negative.

Daniel was fully vaccinated and followed protocols but unfortunately had to end his cruise early when he tested positive.

Daniel said a half hour or so after taking the test crew members approached him on the pool deck and informed him he needed to quarantine in his room due to the positive test.

After the second test came back positive he put on a hazmat suit and was brought to the ship's medical center to get bloodwork urinalysis and chest x-ray.

""The care was lovely and touching since I was scared anxious etc"" he recalls.

After that he was quarantined in an oceanview stateroom and supplied with water cleaning supplies and unlimited room service.

He and his family were disembarked in Cozumel where Royal Caribbean arranged for an ambulance to the airport a private jet ambulance home and a limo van waiting for him in Tampa International Airport.

""Wonderful care and service from the flight crew"" David said of getting home. ""Royal Caribbean was amazing how they handled this nerve wracking experience.""

Another RoyalCaribbeanBlog reader smokeybandit was on Adventure of the Seas more recently and through contact tracing his son was identified as a close contact of someone who tested positive on the ship.

He shared the experience on the RoyalCaribbeanBlog message boards.

""We never really asked for details on when or what they defined as a close contact since I figured we'd never get that detail as I'm sure they'd cite privacy.

Like Daniel smokeybandit and his family were quarantined initially while another PCR test was administered. Just like Daniel they were given complimentary room service wifi movies etc.

Smokeybandit's family was taken off the ship in Nassau and boarded a limo van where they were driven to the plane and flew directly home.

His family boarded a 6 passenger Learjet that can convert to an air ambulance.

Once they arrived home a town car was waiting for his family to take them home.

Smokeybandit indicated that the transportation home was covered by Royal Caribbean although he did have his own travel insurance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc29jYW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWxsLWFib2FyZC1zaGlwLWFob3ktcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWNydWlzZXMtdG8tdHJpbmlkYWQtY2Fybml2YWwtMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All aboard – ship ahoy! Royal Caribbean cruises to Trinidad Carnival 2023,"Pin Flip Email 0 Shares

Tour company Island Sea Fest has joined forces with cruise line Royal Caribbean to deliver an 11-night cruise that takes in Trinidad Carnival 2023.

Royal Caribbean’s Voyager of the Seas will begin this “first of its kind” cruise from San Juan Puerto Rico on Wednesday 15 February 2023. From there passengers will head to Trinidad spending five nights on board their floating hotel in between all that Carnival revelry.

In time-honoured Carnival style there’s a las lap as the ship calls at Tobago Barbados and Saint Lucia to allow passengers some essential post-bacchanal recovery and relaxation. The cruise ends back at San Juan on Sunday 26 February.

The all-in-one charge includes cruise fare taxes fees gratuities beverages meals onboard parties wi-fi and basic travel insurance. It’s the ultimate all-inclusive party package in fact!

Last month Island Sea Fest introduced its ‘Hold Your Spot’ (HYS) offer which runs until 21 August 2021. For a reservation fee of US$350 per person (which can be split into two payments of $175) customers gain priority access for stateroom options. From 2 September the fee is credited against the cost of the deposit you need for the cruise but if you change your mind by 1 September the HYS fee is partially refundable.

Using one of the payment plans it looks like the cost of the cruise will be between $3250 and $4500 per person but it doesn’t include flights carnival fetes and shows or other extras and exact fees will depend on the accommodation you select.

Guests can pay for their cruise in instalments and can purchase an upgrade to the basic insurance to one that covers cancellation “for any reason”.

Royal Caribbean International exceeds Bahamian job projections more Bahamians in management

Marsha Lightbourne heads Coco Cay HR calls it ‘the most amazing job’



When Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley announced in late 2018 that the cruise line aimed to hire 200 more Bahamians for positions onboard its ships management acted fast. They arranged job fairs signed a contract with the National Training Agency to assist with screening and conducting soft skills training. They hoped to appeal to those with a sense of adventure and a craving for a different kind of hospitality profession with room to travel grow and rise through the ranks.



Less than a year later Royal Caribbean had exceeded its own goal with more than 300 Bahamians hired for onboard positions. And on CocoCay the cruise line’s private island destination in the Berry Islands Bahamians are filling increasing numbers of management posts. Among the most recent to earn the distinction – Marsha Lightbourne a 10-year veteran of the hotel industry who is now responsible for human resources (HR) for a staff complement that accounts for more than 600 team members and even in the height of the COVID pandemic stood at more than 200.



“This is the most amazing job” says Lightbourne. “Working on CocoCay is a very different experience from working all day enclosed in a hotel. I have an incredible team in HR that works to the highest standards and where we live on the cay no matter how hard you work you wake up every morning with the most amazing view in a beautiful pristine environment with lots of nature around you.”



Lightbourne joined Royal Caribbean as an HR manager leaving her family for weeks at a time in Nassau and moving to CocoCay in October 2020. Less than three months later in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic she got the surprise call – “Would she take over as head of HR?”



Despite suspension of cruising some 200 staff members remained on the cay doing maintenance landscaping upgrades providing security and more. Even without cruise guests the work was endless. For kitchen crew that was still preparing 600 meals a day. COVID restrictions were rigid and strictly enforced. Anyone traveling to the cay even with a negative PCR test result had to quarantine in a hotel at nearby Great Harbour Cay and be re-tested when quarantine ended. Nearly 100% of staff members were vaccinated as vaccines became available greeting the opportunity to travel more easily with eagerness. Being on an island in the midst of a pandemic incurred a different kind of stress and Lightbourne found herself and her department creating team-building exercises encouraged staff to talk more to open up share and befriend one another.



“We realized we would forever be changed by this pandemic crisis which we could either allow to drive us apart or choose to let it bring us together through the collective spirit of endurance. We chose the latter” she said.



With the re-opening of the cay and cruise guests again making PerfectDay@CocoCay their favourite destination experience staff complement is up to 442 and Lightbourne who is calling it a “dream job” will soon be responsible for 600 more than half of whom will be Bahamian.



“Guests love our Bahamian culture which is what we sell” she says “and we Bahamians are able to make guests’ experiences more culturally relevant with our warmth music and food right down to the way we talk.”



Royal Caribbean’s Adventure of the Seas has been calling on CocoCay once a week since it started homeporting in Nassau in June and is the number one ranked destination out of more than 125 ports of call in Royal Caribbean’s itinerary.

The CFPWA’s Executive is headed by Vincentian national Devon Bute. A statement from the Association says it is never a good sight to see such hate enacted against any individual and in particular a head of state.

It says while it understands the cause of the protest and supports a peaceful protest it reminds persons that all rights come with responsibilities.

The CFPWA states that whilst not opposed to vaccination it cannot support mandatory vaccination as it goes against the fabric of its long-established constitutional rights.

The Association believes everyone has the right to make a conscious decision as to what goes inside their body.

The CFPWA highlights Article 7 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights which states: “No one shall be subjected to torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation.”

The Association further states: “We are now in phase 3 of clinical trials of the vaccine that were approved for emergency use.”

The CFPWA unequivocally condemns the assault on the Prime Minister and any citizen of St Vincent and the Grenadines and look forward to the culprit being brought to justice.

It also wishes Gonsalves a speedy recovery.

Meawhile the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Patricia Scotland has strongly condemned the violent assault which took place on August 5 on the duly elected Prime Minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines during a protest in the capital Kingstown.

In a statement she says there is no place for violence in 'our democracies.'

She states: ""Freedom of association and peaceful assembly are cherished fundamental values and I encourage all stakeholders in St Vincent and the Grenadines to recommit to peaceful dialogue including through parliamentary debate.""

The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth states anyone responsible for the heinous assault on Prime Minister Gonsalves should be expeditiously brought to justice.

The Commonwealth family has wished Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves a strong and speedy recovery."

Kennedy Jr.'s claim that a worm ate his brain is most likely not accurate a parasite expert told BI. Mario Tama/Getty Images

Did a worm eat Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s brain?

The third-party presidential candidate said in a 2012 deposition that a doctor suggested a parasite hurt him.

We spoke to an expert who said a brain-eating tapeworm larvae would be impossible.

Brain-eating worms? Not likely.

A shocking report in The New York Times on Wednesday revealed that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested in a 2012 deposition that doctors had found a dead worm in his brain.

In the court proceeding — part of his divorce from his second wife — Kennedy said that he had short-term and long-term memory loss according to The Times.

Kennedy said he had visited doctors in 2010 who thought he had a brain tumor but another doctor suggested that a dark spot on Kennedy's brain scan was ""caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died"" The Times reported.

Kennedy argued in the deposition that he couldn't make as much money due to his health and also revealed that he had mercury poisoning around the same time.

Kennedy has portrayed himself as the younger more healthy alternative to the other two men running for president Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

His campaign's press secretary confirmed that Kennedy was infected with a parasite 10 years ago and said it was resolved. His campaign told Business Insider that Kennedy is in ""robust physical and mental health"" and said questioning his fitness is a ""hilarious suggestion given his competition.""

But could a parasitic worm even cause that kind of damage? One medical expert told Business Insider that Kennedy's version of events doesn't quite add up.

Dr. Janina Caira a University of Connecticut professor and tapeworm specialist told BI that Kennedy's parasite sounds more like the larvae of a pork tapeworm.

That would be rare Caira said in an email. Humans can be infected with the adult worm by eating undercooked pork but can only be infected with the larvae after eating food or drinking water contaminated by the feces of someone with an adult tapeworm infection.

""This typically happens in areas with poor sanitation"" Caira said. ""So it is possible that he could have contracted the infection in South Asia if he came into contact with food or water contaminated with eggs of the tapeworm.""

But there's no way the larvae could have consumed Kennedy's brain tissue.







""Absolutely not"" Caira wrote.

She said the larvae don't have mouths or digestive systems. Instead they absorb nutrients through the surface of their bodies. While Caira said it is possible that a worm could do some ""mechanical damage"" to nearby brain tissue the larvae are very small and a single one ""would not cause much damage.""

That lines up with what experts who were skeptical of the details told The New York Times.

However Dr. Peter Hotez a pediatrician and global health advocate who is a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology & microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine wrote on X that ""neuroparasitic diseases"" and ""parasitic worms have a huge impact on the human brain.""

Hotez said the diseases are seen in poor populations with a ""surprising amount of illness"" in southern states and Texas. He said his team at the National School of Tropical Medicine is working on low-cost vaccines to prevent the conditions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvYXJ0cy90ZWxldmlzaW9uL2xhdGUtbmlnaHQtcmZrLWpyLXdvcm0uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Late Night Reacts to the Worm in R.F.K.

Kennedy Jr. was told the memory loss and mental fogginess he was experiencing might have been the result of a brain tumor according to a report by the New York Times.

The author and trial lawyer had consulted neurologists who found a dark spot in his brain scans. Ultimately a doctor from New York-Presbyterian Hospital suggested his condition “was caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died” Kennedy said in a 2012 deposition reviewed by the Times.

Kennedy 70 has marketed himself as a younger fitter choice for president  as he runs against President Joe Biden 81 and former President Donald Trump 77. Tweets of Kennedy doing push-ups shirtless in jeans went viral last summer.



The Kennedy campaign confirmed to U.S. News Wednesday that Kennedy did have a parasite but said it no longer impacts his health. “The issue was resolved more than 10 years ago and he is in robust physical and mental health” says press secretary Stefanie Spear. “Questioning Mr. Kennedy’s health is a hilarious suggestion given his competition.”

U.S. News caught up with Dr. Peter Hotez  professor of pediatrics and molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine to learn more about brain parasites including how they get into their human hosts and the symptoms they cause.

While Kennedy’s press secretary suggested the presidential candidate picked up the worm during his travels outside the United States Hotez who is also dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor says there are two brain parasites that are “quite common” in America as well. “These diseases are not rare” he tells U.S. News.

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity:

How does someone end up with a parasite or worm in their brain?

One of the two diseases is called toxocariasis and the other one is called neurocysticercosis and they're transmitted slightly differently.



The Week in Cartoons May 6-10 View All 12 Images

In the case of toxocariasis these are diseases contracted ultimately from stray dogs and cats. What happens is those stray dogs and cats are infected with an intestinal roundworm called toxocara and that roundworm is producing thousands and thousands of eggs that contaminate the soil. The eggs are ubiquitous in the soil and around sandboxes or playgrounds or just in the dirt and kids – or adults – get contaminated with the dirt containing eggs swallow those eggs. And then the eggs hatch in the gut and they give rise to larvae worm larvae that migrate through the lungs. They can cause wheezing and asthma and they migrate through the brain to cause cognitive disturbances developmental delays and seizures. And it’s actually quite common in the United States and people don’t know about it.

Now the other one is called neurocysticercosis. It's typically a household member who's got a tapeworm that is in the gastrointestinal tract and segments of the worm are dropping off that contain the eggs and then the eggs are released into the environment. Then the eggs get dispersed you swallow the eggs and the same kind of thing happens.

Once that larval tapeworm is in the brain while it's alive it's actually almost not even recognized by our immune system or inflammatory system. It's living but it's silent. And it's not really feeding on brain tissue … but it's living there. And as that worm exceeds this natural lifespan in the brain then it dies and as it’s dying it loses its ability to camouflage itself from the host immune system. And you start seeing inflammation around it. And that's what triggers the seizures. So neurocysticercosis basically produces a seizure disorder.

How do parasites migrate to the brain?

The [toxocara] larvae that hatch out of the eggs in the gastrointestinal tract penetrate the intestinal lining and eventually get swept through the blood circulation and probably get carried to the brain through the blood. And the larvae are just a few millimeters in length but they can cause mechanical damage and they also elicit inflammation. And that's been shown to lead to kids’ developmental delays and seizures as well as in adults can cause cognitive disturbances.



The [tapeworm] larvae again can go through the gut lining and then make their way through the blood circulation to the brain.

What are the symptoms of having a parasite in your brain?

Neurocysticercosis can be clinically silent for years. And then oftentimes the first presentation is having a seizure. With toxocara it's oftentimes more subtle: developmental delays cognitive disturbances sometimes seizures. And there you have to have a high index of suspicion to think about doing the blood test for it.

Can you take steps to avoid these two parasites?

One is to be cognizant of your surroundings and know if you're living in an area that's known to be endemic. Clearly handwashing is going to be very important as a preventative step. In the case of toxocariasis it's controlling the stray dog and cat problem and/or deworming stray dogs and cats.

What areas are endemic?

(For toxocara) Brazil is a big big-time problem. It’s more in the Southern United States. Although we even found it in the Bronx as well.



Neurocysticercosis we see it in the Southern United States and Texas Southern California even. And typically it's (tied to) having another person in the home with this adult tapeworm.

What is the treatment for brain parasites?

Toxocariasis is treated through several days of a specific drug that kills the worm called albendazole. For just neurocysticercosis you need a much longer course of albendazole.

(With neurocysticercosis) eventually that worm dies and it becomes calcified. But the problem is it can still continue to trigger seizures. So oftentimes people who have neurocysticercosis have to not only go on anticonvulsants but they sometimes require going on treatment for anticonvulsants for years afterwards even though it's a dead worm.

Can these infections impair cognitive function?

Both toxocariasis and neurocysticercosis cause cognitive impairments. The evidence for neurocysticercosis is not as clear-cut.

And how long would cognitive impairment last?

You know it's not as well-studied. There's so much focus on the seizures that people only started recently looking at cognitive impairment with neurocysticercosis. (With toxocariasis) it could be for years. And then the next question is could it produce permanent deficits? And the answer is potentially.

What else do I need to know?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3N0ZXBoZW4tY29sYmVydC1tYXJ2ZWxzLWF0LXJvYmVydC1mLWtlbm5lZHktanJzLWJyYWluLXdvcm0tZGlhZ25vc2lz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stephen Colbert Marvels at RFK Jr.'s 'Brain Worm' Diagnosis,"“Let’s dig in” said The Late Show host Stephen Colbert at the start of his monologue “just like that worm did to RFK Jr.’s delicious frontal lobe.”

Colbert was responding to the news on Wednesday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once had a parasitic worm squirming around in his brain.

“Today The New York Times published some newly discovered health records for the independent presidential candidate” Colbert explained. “Turns out back in 2010 RFK Jr. went to a doctor because he was experiencing some cognitive symptoms like ‘memory loss and mental fogginess’ as well as a tiny voice in his head going ‘Let’s see what wine pairs best with cerebellum?”

For his impression of the worm Colbert chose the voice of Lowly from the ’90s cartoon The Busy World of Richard Scarry which received cheers of recognition from the audience.

It was a fitting reference given how the monologue was preceded by a cartoon clip called “The Amazing Adventures of Worm in Brain-Man” which parodied the Spider-Man theme song. “He’s got a worm in brain” the song goes “Insanity now explained!”

Colbert’s jokes at RFK Jr’s expense come after multiple monologues throughout the past year where he’s warned viewers not to trust (or vote for) the candidate. Colbert has criticized RFK Jr. for being a vaccine conspiracy theorist and for not even having the support of his own family.

Colbert summarized more of the Times’ reporting on the story explaining how “Bobby Jr. got a brain scan which showed an abnormality” which turned out to be the result of “a worm that got into RFK Jr.’s brain and ate a portion of it and then died.”

Colbert concluded “Cause of death? Starvation.”"

They Don't Want Colleagues to Know. (Published 2021),"Vincent Taranto has felt like less of a pariah at work in the last few days.

For more than two months Mr. Taranto 31 was among the only employees required to wear a mask at his job because he was unvaccinated. Though he was wary of the vaccine and skeptical that he was at risk of getting seriously sick he was concerned that his decision to avoid the shot had left him exposed to judgment from colleagues.

“I don’t want to look like the crazy anti-vaxxer to my co-workers” he said.

But after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended last week that Americans in high-risk areas should wear masks indoors Mr. Taranto who works at a large company in the outdoor industry no longer worried that he was sticking out like a sore thumb.

“Everyone complained about it” he said about the new masking guidelines. “And I’m like ‘It’s not that big of a deal; I’ve been doing it the whole time.’”

Whether or not to receive a coronavirus vaccine has for the most part been a private medical decision. But as some workplaces have begun determining how to safely bring employees back to the office — drawing them from behind dissociated Zoom screens into interactive meeting rooms — that choice is becoming increasingly public.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This article was published 06/08/2021 (1006 days ago) so information in it may no longer be current.

Sound the bells drop the gate — the restoration of my cherished caboose is rolling full speed ahead.

There is still work to be done painting to be finished and rotting wood to be replaced and I’m totally up for it but it is definitely a challenge.

The biggest issue with the rot occurs when you remove the obviously disintegrated stuff there’s usually another layer of either totally or partially rotten wood underneath it. So you have nothing to screw the new stuff to.

Photos by Laurie Mustard / Winnipeg Free Press Last weekend Mustard’s caboose received a fresh coat of ketchup red and mustard yellow paint.

Or if there’s yet another layer of wood underneath the second layer — and I’m finding with these old wooden cabooses there often is — you just buy longer screws thereby hiding the second rotting layer and forgetting you ever saw it.

Not the best solution of course. Never have I found a building held together by more nails. These cabooses were built to hang together through hundreds of thousands of miles in their lifetime so they had to be as solid as a rock to keep them from vibrating apart.

Obviously with my baby Bertha still here and upright it worked.

So what I’ve accomplished here via the skills of Stacey Bugsdrucker — Chick With A Brush owner manager chief painter and everything else — is to put a stop to the solid wood remaining from disintegrating further… or at least slowing it down by a couple of decades and protecting the rotten and semi-rotten stuff from just dissolving and disappearing.

So now I will keep on hand a healthy supply of primer ketchup-red and mustard-yellow paint and one section at a time dig deep to remove all the rot I can gain access to rebuild my way back out replace with pressure-treated wood prime and repaint the appropriate colour.

I also have to rebuild some of the windows both interior and exterior and the screens used when the storm windows are replaced for summer. You don’t just go out and find healthy 116-year-old caboose windows sitting around waiting to be put to use. Not hard to replicate the pieces that need replacing just fussy.

And although I’m very serious when I say these old babies were built to last I found out shortly after Bertha arrived here that she almost didn’t make it.

When they decommissioned her they removed the rolling stock underneath leaving basically the perimeter rectangular steel frame the caboose is built on and two lighter angle iron supports that run end to end for the wooden floor to sit on. The steel crossmembers holding the walls together have been removed.

So after it arrived home and I crawled under to have a look I noticed that at mid caboose the walls had moved out far enough to allow the floor to begin to drop through. A few more miles jiggling down the highway the floor would have fallen out the walls caved in and that would have been one costly mess to clean up. The floor has been supported ever since but I am going to jack it up put rods through the perimeter frame that connect at the middle underneath suck the walls back in and set the floor back down on its lip never to be at risk of the big drop again. Man I love this caboose.

Mustard bought this caboose at an auction in the 1990s — it has been in his Headingley yard ever since.

I’m also going to finally put electricity into this old dear for convenience sake. I decided originally to leave it powerless so the kids would have to light kerosene lamps and build a fire in the cookstove if they wanted to use it so they’d learn a little about the old pioneer ways. I can teach the grandkids with “that dern modern ‘lectricity in reserve.”

There’s another big surprise involved with this renewal that I’ll tell you about when the time comes.

Thanks to both Stacey Bugsdrucker and Sherwin Williams for a job well done!

SPG,Simon Property Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8va3ZpYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA4LzA4L21hbGxzLWFyZS1iYWNrLWJ1dC1mb3ItaG93LWxvbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Malls are back. But for how long?,"By Chris Isidore CNN Business

Few retail sectors were hit harder than malls during the height of the pandemic. But things bounced back far quicker than almost anyone expected.

Simon Property Group the nation’s largest mall operator just reported earnings that easily beat Wall Street forecasts. More importantly the numbers were not just better than the disastrous period last year but actually topped second quarter of 2019 earnings. The firm announced its second dividend increase of the this year and even CEO David Simon seemed surprised by the speed of the recovery.

“The strategy we adopted in the height of the pandemic is playing out better than we could have expected” he told investors last week. “We kept our properties functioning. We bet on the rebound. And we’re seeing the benefits of that.”

Another mall operator Retail Properties of American also just reported earnings per share that topped both forecasts and the amount it earned on that basis in 2019.

It’s an amazing rebound from the dire conditions just more than a year ago.

Many especially the traditional indoor malls were closed by stay-at-home orders and rent collections from tenants came to a halt. Anchor tenants such as JCPenney and Nieman Marcus filed for bankruptcy and closed many stores permanently. Others such as Lord & Taylor went out of business altogether. There were also bankruptcies by major mall operators including Washington Prime Group and CBL Properties each of which operate more than 100 malls.

Experts in the field are also impressed with how well malls have rebounded.

“Malls have certainly recovered from for the pandemic” said Neil Saunders managing director of GlobalData Retail a consulting firm. “Consumer spending right now is robust. People haven’t spent all of the stimulus money yet. There’s pent-up demand. That’s why retailers are reporting stellar numbers.”

“Unfortunately where we are at now is marked by favorable circumstances that won’t last” Saunders cautioned.

The recovery has been somewhat uneven said Ana Lai credit analyst with Standard & Poor’s who covers the mall operators. Although Simon runs higher end malls other operators are not nearly as well positioned in terms of tenants or locations.

“There’s a lot of malls out there and a wide range of quality. If you look at all the weaker quality malls I’m not sure we’re seeing the recovery” Lai said.

And then there are the long-term trends that have been working against malls for years and those challenges increased during the pandemic.

There’s a shift in shopping habits away from malls not just to online retailers such as Amazon but also to big box rivals that are typically not in malls like Walmart and Target. Both of those retailers kept most of their stores open during the shutdowns because they sell groceries in addition to other goods and were thus considered essential. Both stepped up their online ordering same-day delivery and curbside pickup options. All of which allowed them to capture market share that traditionally went to malls.

“The retailers who made gains during the pandemic are not giving them back” said Saunders.

There were new problems that cropped up during the pandemic most notably the shift away from blockbuster movies being released first in theaters — including at the malls’ multiplexes before they were available at home. Movie theaters are only seeing a fraction of their pre-pandemic traffic which will only hurt malls’ outlooks longer term.

Then there’s the threat posed by the recent surge in Covid cases due to the rise of the Delta variant. There are some early signs that mall foot traffic has fallen in the month since the mall operators and retailers closed their books on the second quarter.

Real time foot traffic data from research firm InMarket which uses cell phone tracking information to come up with data on visits to different locations did analysis of mall traffic for CNN Business. It found that overall foot traffic at malls was 4% higher the week of July 4 to July 10 than it was the same week of 2019. But by the last week of July traffic had fallen to 75% of where it stood during the same week two years earlier. And while malls in 80% of markets had rebounded above the traffic levels of two years ago at the start of July only 7% were still above that earlier traffic level by the end of the month.

The country had been doing fairly well with handling COVID in 2020. Vietnam had managed to tame the spread of the virus. Its economy had grown and gotten new foreign investments.

But the cases have now hit record highs; FT writes that they’ve been trending between 7000 and 8000 per day. The country has recorded almost 200000 cases since the beginning of July. The hardest-hit has been Ho Chi Minh the largest city which has since implemented rules about worker transport and housing and the way staff is deployed on factory floors.

Taiwanese footwear supplier Pou Chen which makes shoes for Adidas and Nike was among the companies to suspend production because of the new surge. Production stopped at the Ho Chi Minh facility as of July 14 and leaders said it would stay that way at least until Aug. 9 and the company’s other Vietnamese plants was scaled back.

And Feng Tay which is another Taiwanese sports footwear maker closed numerous factories last month.

The Vietname Textile and Apparel Association said over 30 percent of the country’s garment and textile facilities had been closed. Reports say vaccination rates among workers in the industry was “still very low.”

The Vietnam vaccination program was described by FT as “stuttering” and the government has been slow to get vaccines overall. FT writes that only around 1 percent of the country’s population has been fully vaccinated.

Earlier in the year PYMNTS wrote about the way the new COVID outbreaks were threatening the production system. There was an outbreak in the Chinese city of Shenzhen at one of the world’s busiest ports and there were COVID outbreaks in Taiwan and Malaysia as well. That came in early June just after both China and the U.S. had recorded their largest annual jumps in factory-gate and consumer prices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzdGF0ZWFnZW50dG9kYXkuY28udWsvZmVhdHVyZXMvMjAyMS84L2Nhbi1sYW5kbG9yZHMtYW5kLWFnZW50cy10YWtlLXBob3RvZ3JhcGhzLWR1cmluZy1wcm9wZXJ0eS1pbnNwZWN0aW9uc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can landlords and agents take photographs during property inspections?,"Furthermore when a property is being marketed photographs and video may be shared online causing potential security and privacy issues. Renters have the right not to be identified by the material. So how can agents and property managers strike the right balance help renters feel comfortable with photographs being taken and ensure the appropriate level of privacy is maintained?

Taking photographs or video footage during a routine property inspection can be a contentious subject. While landlords have every right to know how the property they own is being maintained and there is an expectation of physical evidence to prove that it’s being kept in good condition for the renter having an agent or landlord come into your home and take pictures can feel intrusive.

It’s important to remember that while landlords and agents are well within their rights to take photographs and videos of a property those images should be focused on the condition the property is in not the renter’s possessions. As such the photos you take should not be excessive. Try to steer clear of personal possessions and advise renters to point out or move away any belongings that they would like to be omitted from photographs before the inspection.

Additional care should be taken to ensure that no identifying details such as family photographs addresses financial documents or other personal details are recorded or shared.

The health and safety angle

Photographs can be used to indicate whether correct safety guidance is being followed. For example fire doors and exits should be kept clear and heating devices like radiators and boilers should not be covered by clothing or other materials. You should also note any appliances being used incorrectly or power sockets being overloaded. Property inspections present great opportunities for agents and landlords to offer occupiers potentially life-saving advice regarding electrical safety.

Zoom in on repairs and maintenance

One of the most important ways photographs can be used is to indicate items that require repairs or maintenance. Consider the nature of the issue and what level of detail may be required. A close-up photo of a faulty appliance part may be more useful than one simply showing the appliance itself. If the issue relates to how an appliance functions a video may help even further.

Take a snapshot of the property’s cleanliness

Keeping the property clean and tidy is an important part of any tenancy contract. Use photos to illustrate the condition of a property and note areas that are dirty cluttered or require further attention.

Keeping renters comfortable

Taking simple steps to explain exactly what you’re taking photographs of and why it’s important to record the condition of the property is one way to ease the process and ensure renters don’t feel overly scrutinised. Being transparent about what you’re recording will go a long way to putting your renter’s mind at ease about any invasions of privacy.

Don’t forget to remind them that like with a standard inventory a photographic record of how the property looks at any time during the tenancy could end up protecting the renter just as much as it protects the landlord.

Those who are familiar with his business prowess know that he's a brilliant entrepreneur who has worked hard to establish a successful company and elevate his position in the business world to one that demands respect. Here are 10 things that you probably didn't know about Herb Simon to give you a better idea of who he really is.

1. He's a self-made man

Herb and his brother Melvin who passed away in 2009 founded the Simon Property Group Inc together in 1960. Mr. Simon is now in his 80s. The company grew quickly and is now one of the biggest REITs in the world and it owns nearly 180 shopping malls throughout the United States Asia and Europe. The business has made him one of the richest men in America.

2. He is a pioneer in the private holdings company sector

When Herb and Melvin started their business in 1960 they were among the first to take Melvin Simon & Associates (the precursor to Simon Property Group Inc.) to the publicly traded sector. In fact the brothers are credited with making history when the Simon Property Group went public with the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SPG. SPG had the largest REIT IPO of all time in 1993 when the IPO was accepted and they officially became listed on the NYSE.

3. He's a regular guy from the Bronx

Mr. Simon was born in Brooklyn New York. He went to school at the City College of New York where he earned his BBA degree in business. He hasn't attended any of the ivy league universities but he did gain the knowledge that was necessary for starting up a business and making it run efficiently. He was raised in a Bronx neighborhood and grew up without a lot of money at his disposal but he relied upon his skills and desire to get ahead in life to build a fortune.

4. Herb's Parents

Herb Simon has a very rich family history. His mother and father are Max and Mae Simon. Their ancestry goes back to Central Europe. His father worked as a tailor. Simon was raised in a Jewish family who settled in Williamsburg Brooklyn in New York. His mother was born on the lower east side.

5. He is an avid philanthropist

We were impressed by the amount of funding that Mr. Simon gives to charity. He established the Herbert Simon Family Foundation. Two generations of members of the Simon family sits on the board which decides where funding is to be allocated. Funds are distributed to worthy causes and there are a lot of them through the Foundation.

6. He's big on social justice

While learning more about the Simon Family Foundation we discovered that Herb Simon cares about social justice. He's not only concerned about issues such as meeting the basic needs of people who are disadvantaged but also about their education healthy living arts and culture and the environment. He's a well rounded person who is doing his part to make a difference in the world around him.

7. He's a multi-billionaire

Herb Simon is a self-made man who has made a fortune through the company that he co-founded with his brother. As of May of 2019 his estimated net worth is $3.4 billion. The NBA team that he owns (Indiana Pacers) is valued at $1.175 billion. His assets are well distributed and not concentrated in just one area.

8. Herb Simon is still highly active

Mr. Simon is in his mid-eighties but he hasn't slowed down much. He remains active as the Director of the Simon property Group since 1993 as well as the Chairman Emeritus for the company. He was formerly the CEO of the group but turned over the reigns to a younger family member. In addition to this he chairs the Kirkus Media LLC and co-chairs the Melvin Simon & Associates group as well as serving on the Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Board as an independent director. He serves on a variety of civic organization and community non profit boards across multiple industries.

9. He owns more than one pro ball team

We also learned that Herb Simon has a diversified portfolio of investments. He not only owns the Indiana Pacers but he also has an interest in a baseball team. He is a partial owner of the AAA Baseball Reno Aces. He has made some great investments that give us a glimpse of the things that interest him as well. In addition to owning or at least having an interest in pro ball teams he has kept his options open in a number of industry associations lending his leadership skills and serving on the boards of directors as well.

10. He is a huge supporter of Jewish causes

Mr. Simon is a generous benefactor who has not forgotten where he came from who his parents were or those who are also members of his ancestral group. Coming from a family of Jewish immigrants he understands that there is a need to help those who are struggling to make their place in the world often under extremely difficult circumstances. Herb supports the Anti-Defamation League the United States Holocaust Museum the Birthright Israel Foundation and an American Jewish Committee called the USC Shoah Foundation which supplies aid to assist in the restoration of a Jewish synagogue in need of repair that is located in Thessaloniki Greece.",,,

Reach Research Level 2 to unlock Gyarados for Mightywide River (Day). Gyarados appears after you hit a hidden Crystabloom behind one of the waterfalls with an Illumina Orb. You can hit this Crystabloom with an Illumina Orb even at Research Level 1. However nothing happens until Research Level 2.

Players plunge down a waterfall and into another part of the river early in the course. At this point different Pokemon can be found hanging off the protruding branch over the water -- Toucannon Feraligatr Arbok and others. Behind this branch is a waterfall. Scan for a prompt about something that seems to be behind the wall of water. That's the hidden Crystabloom.

Lob Illumina Orbs toward the center of the waterfall until it lights up with a golden glow. Players should see the tips of Gyarados' face and fins poke out of the water as it swims out from behind the waterfall. You can photograph Gyarados here but it's better to wait until later. It doesn't expose enough of its body for a high-scoring shot.

Gyarados won't pop out of the water until the very end of the course. Look for it to your right as the finish line is in sight. Droplets should splash your screen as its head springs out of the water. Take your time: Gyarados stays above the water until the finish point.

The Department of Human Services (DHS) announced that The GIANT Company has joined the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Online Purchasing Pilot.

This program allows SNAP recipients to purchase groceries for pickup or delivery online through GIANT Direct and MARTIN’S Direct mitigating the need for them to leave their home and be in public during the public health crisis. The GIANT Company is the sixth retailer in Pennsylvania to be approved for the pilot which lets SNAP recipients purchase groceries online using SNAP funds through participating retailers approved by the USDA.

“Though we are beginning to emerge from the public health crisis COVID-19 still remains a danger to many especially because many SNAP recipients are older and may have chronic health conditions. The online purchasing pilot has helped thousands of Pennsylvanians safely shop for fresh groceries and pantry staples since its launch and we are grateful that The GIANT Company has joined this pilot” said Acting DHS Secretary Meg Snead. “I highly encourage other retailers to reach out to the USDA and learn what they need to do to participate in this helpful program.”

“Making sure the communities we serve have access to nutritious food is at the core of who The GIANT Company is and central to our purpose of connecting families for a better future” said Matt Simon vice president of brand experience The GIANT Company. “Now customers who participate in SNAP can enjoy the convenience of online shopping while still receiving the same low prices and maximizing their SNAP benefits for the food they need to share a healthy meal with their family.”

Only eligible food items normally paid for by SNAP are able to be purchased from participating retailers online with SNAP benefits. Delivery fees driver tips and other associated charges may not be paid for with SNAP benefits. This initiative does not include the ability to transact cash assistance benefits using the EBT card and individuals will need to use another method of payment such as a pre-paid debit card to cover non-allowable fees.

The GIANT Company joins five other approved retailers: ALDI Amazon the Fresh Grocer Shoprite and Walmart and since the program’s launch these retailers saw more than $190 million in online SNAP purchases by Pennsylvanians since the pilot launched in the commonwealth in June 2020.

Retailers that are interested in participating in this program must contact the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and review the requirements. Retailers that do not wish to join the pilot program can still offer delivery or pick-up flexibility options for SNAP recipients by using mobile EBT processing equipment that would allow customers to pay with SNAP when groceries are delivered or picked up. Farmers markets may be able to receive this processing equipment at no cost through a grant opportunity provided by DHS.

Applications for SNAP and other public assistance programs can be submitted online at www.compass.state.pa.us. On-site County Assistance Office Window (CAO) services are also available if clients cannot access online services or need assistance that cannot be accessed through the COMPASS website the myCOMPASS PA mobile app or by calling the Customer Service Centers at 215-560-7226 for Philadelphia clients 1-877-395-8930 for clients in all other counties.

(WBRC) - Miles College students who fought through a pandemic-ravaged school year are starting this year with a huge lift.

The college has used just over $2 million dollars in federal pandemic relief money to clear the balances of all its students. Michael Johnson Miles’ Vice President of enrollment explains the administration began discussing how to use the CARES Act funding to help students late last year .

“We understood that they were navigating some very great challenges while navigating the pandemic some of which were studying from home or from other places and needed technology to continue their education” said Johnson. “Some situations where our students didn’t have the financial support they usually had because mom and dad were laid off or there or other situations. And so they had less resources to continue their education.”

Johnson says the school is using an addition $1.6 million dollars in federal aid for an emergency fund to help students with needs including equipment and transportation.

Students who were able to stay in school will see some new things on campus this school year. Johnson who is also the college’s Chief Innovation Officer says investments announced last year by tech giants and corporate citizens like Apple IBM and Southern Company should result in the opening of several labs and the school’s E-gaming center this school year.

Miles will also offer online bachelors degrees in Psychology and Criminal Justice to go along with the online Business Administration degree whose classes began last year.

When restoration efforts are complete the museum believes it will be the only non-articulated trainset in the U.S. to be fully reunited and restored to its original configuration.

“We never thought this project would be feasible said Charles Poling museum director and president East Tennessee Rail Car Services Inc. “Especially in the early years we’d sit and discuss or daydream about how fun it might be to do it one day but never once believing it could be pulled off or we could pull it off.

“Chris Williams who passed away unexpectedly in 2016 kept us passively focused on the project for years and always pushed the agenda when the opportunity arose. I think he’d be thrilled right now.”

Acquisition of the Fort Mitchell comes through an arrangement with the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad. It rejoins coaches Fort McPherson and Fort Oglethorpe and round-end tavern-lounge-observation Fort Benning. Coach Fort Oglethorpe has already been restored to operating condition with Fort McPherson actively being restored.

The Fort Oglethorpe was the first passenger car acquired by the museum in 1990 from railroad engineering and maintenance company Pandrol Jackson. The Fort McPherson which had roamed as far as Alaska was acquired in 1999 with the Fort Benning acquired by East Tennessee Rail Car in 2013. The company invested its own resources to return the observation car from Yakima Wash. where it was part of a shopping mall.

The Man o’War service named for a famous racehorse with cars named after military installations along the Central of Georgia was inaugurated in 1947 running from Atlanta to Columbus Ga. twice daily. Dwindling ridership led to the train’s discontinuance by the Southern Railway (into which the Central of Georgia had merged in 1963) in 1970. The equipment continued to see service on Southern trains until 1979 when Southern finally joined Amtrak and the equipment was sold off.

More information on the Southern Appalachia Railway Museum a 501(c)3 corporation founded in 1990 is available on the museum website and Facebook page. East Tennessee Rail Car Services Inc. provides rail freight car passenger car and locomotive maintenance as well as switching services and equipment leasing; its Facebook page offers more information.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcmFpbGZhbi5jb20vc291dGhlcm4tYXBwYWxhY2hpYS1yYWlsd2F5LW11c2V1bS10by1yZXN0b3JlLWNvZmdzLW1hbi1vLXdhci10cmFpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southern Appalachia Railway Museum to Restore CofG’s Man o’ War Train,"By Railfan & Railroad Staff

OAK RIDGE Tenn. — The Southern Appalachia Railway Museum announced Saturday that it had acquired the last passenger car needed to restore the Central of Georgia’s Man o’ War pocket streamliner. The group believes it is the first time that a non-articulated standard gauge train set has been brought together like this in the preservation era.

The Man o’ War was a four-car passenger train that ran twice daily from Atlanta to Columbus Georgia starting in 1947. The train was named after a famous racing horse of the area. The cars were purchased together from the Budd Company. The CofG would later merge with the Southern Railway and the cars would be used on that railroad’s passenger trains until 1979 (The Southern didn’t join Amtrak until then). In the 1990s SARM acquired two of the cars and for years volunteers wondered what had happened to the other two. In 2013 the observation car dubbed Fort Benning was found on a dead-end track at a shopping mall in Yakima Washington. East Tennessee Rail Car Services teamed up with the museum to bring the car back south.

Now the fourth and final car has been acquired from the ​​Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad. It and the observation car will be restored to service and then all four cars will be put back into their original configuration.

“We never thought this project would be feasible. Especially in the early years we’d sit and discuss or daydream about how fun it might be to do it one day but never once believing it could be pulled off or we could pull it off. Chris Williams who passed away unexpectedly in 2016 kept us passively focused on the project for years and always pushed the agenda when the opportunity arose. I think he’d be thrilled right now.” said Charles Poling SARM Museum Director and President East Tennessee Rail Car Services Inc.

But back in the mid-1970s you could find him at motocross events around Southern California hocking motorcycle gear out of his Honda Civic under the banner of a company named after his English setter Oakley.

It wasn’t a total man-with-a-van job; Oakley Products had catalogs — complete with a logo of an acorn riding a dirt bike — from which riders and vendors might purchase JT Racing gear Scott goggles Koho pads or Mikkola gloves.

Oakley the English Setter

Eventually though Jannard decided to make a product of his own. At the time handlebar grips were essentially just rubber sleeves. Jannard imagined something better. After all if bike control comes from the handlebars shouldn’t that crucial point of contact be made of something more evolved?

So he created the Oakley Grip which was anatomically shaped and tactile with tentacle-inspired suction cups. One grip the B-1B was described as “the first motocross guidance system.”

Brian Takumi a 14-year Oakley vet who’s currently vice president of its product creative catalyst team remembers Jannard coming to the bike shop that he used to frequent when he was a BMX freestyle rider. Takumi was close with many riders sponsored by Oakley and after he eventually joined the company he worked closely with Jannard for over a decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb2x1bWJpYWRhaWx5aGVyYWxkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDgvMDgvbWF1cnktY291bnR5LWNvbHVtYmlhLWZhc3Rlc3QtZ3Jvd2luZy1jb3VudHktdGVubmVzc2VlLWJ1c2luZXNzLWVjb25vbXkvNTQ0NjkyODAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Secret's out': How Maury County became the fastest growing county in Tennessee,"No commitment required.

Stephen M. Keller/Southwest Airlines



Southwest Airlines in a court filing sought info about Kiwi.com's relationship with Skiplagged.

The move was a ""distraction"" a Kiwi spokesperson said.

Southwest said the two sites broke its terms of service by displaying fares.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Flight website Kiwi.com said Southwest Airline's legal maneuvering to get more information about the site's relationship with another website Skiplagged was a ""distraction.""

It comes after Southwest sued Kiwi and Skiplagged in federal court in Texas saying both sites broke the airline's website's terms of service by displaying its flights.

The airline said the two sites were working cooperatively sending traffic to each other and adding extra fees. The airline filed a motion seeking additional information about the relationship between Kiwi and Skiplagged.

Kiwi in a court filing said Southwest's proposal for extra information gathering would ""cause undue delay"" but not provide any information that would help Southwest's lawsuit.

""Adding information that is not new to Southwest more than three months after all the motions have been filed confirms the sense of panic emanating from Southwest"" a Kiwi spokesperson told Insider on Friday. ""This is just a distraction – the focus should be on whether a company like Southwest can publish information openly on the internet and then sue for accessing the same date.""

A Southwest spokesperson declined to comment on a pending lawsuit.

""Neither Skiplagged nor Kiwi is authorized to display Southwest fares or sell Southwest flights"" the airline's lawyers wrote in its complaint.

The airline has said in court documents and letters that Skiplagged sends traffic to Kiwi.com to purchase Southwest fares including ""hidden-city"" fares.

In a filing on Thursday Kiwi included a brief timeline of its relationship with both Skiplagged and Southwest. Skiplagged began sending traffic to Kiwi.com in 2016 the filing said.

In November 2016 traffic from Skiplagged to Kiwi.com resulted in a Southwest purchase for the first time. Traffic flowing from Skiplagged to Kiwi.com to Southwest grew through 2018 before ""stabilizing"" in 2019 the filing said.

Kiwi said it had ""brokered some hidden-city flights where the traffic source was Skiplagged.com.""

""At Kiwi.com we just wish to gather all the available information for consumers about the best available routes and fares without the threat of legal action"" a company spokesperson said.







Skiplagged had filed a pre-emptive lawsuit in New York its home state asking a judge to rule on whether it had broken Southwest's terms.

Rising from the ashes of the failed WOW Air experiment Play has commenced operations between Iceland's main Keflavik Airport (KEF) and Europe with plans to eventually connect North America and Europe via Iceland just as WOW Air attempted to do before the pandemic.

I recently flew Play on its very first route from London's Stansted Airport (STN) to Iceland and was very pleasantly surprised by the experience — for a low-cost carrier it was excellent.

Related: 7 reasons flying Iceland's newest airline was a great experience

For my return flight home from Iceland I decided to choose flag carrier Icelandair founded 84 years ago to see how Iceland's newest and oldest airlines compared between the two cities.

Fares

Here's how the two airlines structured their economy fares for my one-way flights between London and Iceland:

Play Standard fare Icelandair Economy Light fare Fare including taxes £62 ($86) £112 ($155) Carry-on baggage £20 extra ($28) Included Checked baggage £25 extra ($35) £29 extra ($40) Seat selection £3 – £19 extra ($4-26) £6.80 – £21.40 extra ($9-30)

The beauty of the low-cost model is that you only pay for what you actually use. As I was not checking in a bag I saved money on both airlines this way.

Play charges different amounts for different seats depending on where you wish to sit — even in the same row of the aircraft. If you want a window seat you'll need to pay slightly more than a middle seat.

As you'll see below Icelandair sits somewhere between a low-cost and full-service airline. It charges extra for lots of things while some things are provided complimentary.

Play only accepts payment by Visa or Mastercard to pay for fares and onboard purchases while Icelandair accepts all major credit cards including American Express.

Airport experience

Both airlines use the same terminal at Keflavik Airport in Iceland (KEF). They fly to different London airports: Play operates to the low-cost Stansted Airport (STN) and Icelandair flies to the more premium Heathrow (LHR) and Gatwick (LGW) airports.

Landing at Heathrow on Icelandair definitely felt more premium than departing from Stansted Airport.

While I was able to check-in online for both flights I was required to undergo manual document checks at either check-in or the boarding gates for COVID-19-related health declarations and vaccination certificates/test results on both airlines.

Being an outstation on a fairly quiet flight there were hardly any queues at check-in for my Play flight at Stansted.

I was greeted with an enormous line for Icelandair at its Keflavik hub though these passengers were checking-in for a bank of flights all departing for the United States and I was directed to a separate European flights queue and helped immediately.

aircraft

Both airlines operate several different aircraft types and I lucked out on both.

I flew Play's Airbus A321neo which as I would consider being its best aircraft as you'll see in the seat description below.

This aircraft has a giant single cabin of 192 economy seats with 34 rows of economy seats laid out in a 3-3 configuration.

This was one of the biggest surprises between the two airlines. While both economy class seats are laid out in a 3-3 configuration meaning they are a similar width the Play A321neo seats have a staggering 34 inches of legroom for all standard seats.

I would be very pleased with this sort of legroom in economy on the likes of premium airlines such as Qatar Airways or Singapore Airlines but remember I was flying a low-cost carrier on a short-haul flight.

Icelandair's 737 MAX 8 seat had a much tighter — and more industry-standard — 31 inches of pitch as you would expect to find on other full-service European airlines.

If legroom is important to you the Play A321neo aircraft has possibly the most generous legroom of any European low-cost carrier.

Play's seats were fairly comfortable for a relatively short flight.

What Icelandair's seats lacked in legroom they made up for in padding — they were noticeably cushier and plusher than Play's.

Both seats reclined and had similar adjustable headrests tray tables and seatback pockets.

Wifi and IFE

Play did not offer Wi-Fi on my flight nor did it have any inflight entertainment whatsoever.

It was a very different experience flying on Icelandair. The new aircraft had large crisp seatback screens with plenty of entertainment options at every seat.

Wi-Fi was also offered free of charge to all passengers on Icelandair and I registered a respectable 13.16 Mbps download during an onboard speed test.

Food and Beverage

As expected Play's low-cost model meant all food and beverages needed to be paid for including water. I was really quite impressed with the quality of the food on offer and loved the Icelandic touches.

Over on Icelandair tea coffee water and soft drinks were complimentary but unfortunately all other food and drinks must be purchased.

The quality of the food I purchased was noticeably lower on Icelandair than Play. The doughy carb-filled pizza filled me up but that was about it.

Prices for onboard food and drink on both airlines were similar.

Service

Both airlines had friendly and professional crew on the ground and in the air. As you might expect from a brand-new low-cost airline the Play staff were dressed more casually were all quite young and less formal.

Icelandair staff are dressed in more corporate-like attire and provide the sort of service you would find on an older experienced airline.

Both flights departed and arrived on time.

Points and Miles

You cannot earn any points and miles flying Play while Icelandair has its own loyalty program called Saga Club. You can alternatively choose to credit the flights to its partner airlines Alaska Airlines or JetBlue.

Bottom line

I enjoyed my two flights on two very different airlines between London and Iceland.

If you can score Play's Airbus A321neo the legroom is outstanding and I would choose this plane over anything Icelandair operates for an economy flight. You are unlikely to ever see legroom like this at every seat in a standard economy cabin on any airline much less a low-cost carrier.

Icelandair's plus seats on its new 737 MAX were comfortable in terms of padding but legroom was a tight fit and reminded me this was very much economy. It was nice to have a seatback screen and Wi-Fi though this isn't solely enough to sway me to choose an airline with so many portable personal entertainment options I can take on board with me.

It is disappointing to see Icelandair charge for all food and many beverages especially when the quality was fairly poor. I ended up paying almost twice as much for my Icelandair flight as the Play flight and did not feel it was twice as good — they were fairly even overall.

I was spoilt flying the best aircraft from both airlines and I'd be happy to fly either again to or from the spectacular destination of Iceland.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy93b3JsZC8xNDczNTY3L2pvZS1iaWRlbi1sYXRlc3QtbmV3cy11cy1zdXBwb3J0LXBhc3Nlbmdlci1qZW5ueS1ncm9uZGFobC1wb3R1cy1vbnTSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvMTQ3MzU2Ny9qb2UtYmlkZW4tbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MtdXMtc3VwcG9ydC1wYXNzZW5nZXItamVubnktZ3JvbmRhaGwtcG90dXMtb250L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joe Biden supporter told to cover up sign 'offending' passengers in US airport row,"Joe Biden told to ‘do your job’ by Florida’s Ron DeSantis

Jenny Grondahl was boarding her Southwest Airlines flight travelling from Phoenix to San Diego with a sign reading ""Arizonenses Con Biden."" Ms Grondahl said that when she arrived at the gate a Southwest Airlines agent told her: “Many customers are offended by your sign.”

Trending

The agent asked her to either cover it up with white paper and tape or to fold it and put it underneath her seat. The sign had been created as a memento of her voluntary work in Arizona for the election. She told the Washington Post: ""I’m looking around at the gate and I’m thinking how many of you was it — 20 out of 110 people? ""And how offended were you? What did you say?""

She told the Washington Post about the importance of her sign. Ms Grondahl said: “I worked very hard to register Latino voters. … And Latinos showed up Arizona went blue.” Ms Grondahl also asked what they would have done if she was wearing a pro-Biden t-shirt if this was the case she was told she would have been required to turn the t-shirt inside out. Jennifer Grondahl spoke to Express.co.uk about the incident she said: ""The people standing closest to me merely looked at the sign under my arm then up at me. They looked more puzzled than anything else. When I stood in line to board I did keep looking around. The thing is whether it really was “many people” complaining or not everyone looked pretty peaceful."" She added: ""No one glared at me snarled at me or avoided eye contact with me. Which made it even more weird to me. I still don’t understand why the gate agent approached me."" READ MORE: Joe Biden impeachment: US President faces calls to be removed

Then it made things worse,"It may have taken off 12 hours late. But hey 30 minutes of TikTok. Screenshot by ZDNet

It's been uglier than a blobfish after one too many pints of lager.

Attempting to fly around America recently -- on more than one local airline -- has been akin to volunteering to eat only Cheetos in a windowless room for 10 consecutive days.

The champion perhaps has been Spirit Airlines which seems to have undergone a painful implosion.

In the same explosive discussion however is American Airlines. It's canceled hundreds of flights. It's claimed the weather has been severe in its inclemency. It's created thousands of unhappy customers. And that's just on Twitter.

I know this because one wrote: ""After being diverted to OKC my brother (and rest of the passengers) SAT ON THE PLANE for 12 hrs with NO food & no explanation! Flight finally made it to DFW to find not a single employee working. No idea of where bags are or how to get to his final destination. WTF @AmericanAir.""

And that was famed presidential associate Stormy Daniels.

I also know things were really bad because someone else opined: ""You can't blame the weather on everything. The system is collapsing on the passengers gate agents and pilots.""

This system this person said is ""antiquated."" And anyone with awareness of hardware and software systems will likely know that antiquation is not a good characteristic.

The person revealing the alleged system failures was Dennis Tajer spokesman for American Airlines' pilots union. You'd think he might know something about what's happening.

At times like this it's worth focusing entirely on mollifying your customers telling them how you might offer them compensation even promising that you'll introduce new systems that will make things better in the future.

Less wise perhaps is crowing about something that is -- for some -- marginally exciting and then the fine print reveals that it's not so exciting at all. (Which some might describe the airline ticket-buying experience over the last 18 months.)

You see in the midst of the mayhem the tears the promises never to fly American Airlines again the airline offered a press release last Monday.

Its headline clutched at excitement with the tightness of a man who's slipped over a cliff and is being held from the depths by our movie's hero: ""American Airlines Takes TikTok to New Heights with Free Inflight Access for Customers.""

The subhead made it even better: ""Only on American.""

Wow I hear at least three of you cry. This is good. This is cool. This is well something. And the kids all love TikTok right?

This was my initial reaction too. Sadly I made the error of reading further.

First there was the quite large proviso that the free TikTok would only be available on narrowbody planes equipped with Viasat Wi-Fi.

My optimism narrowed but still throbbed for those passengers who are on such planes and appreciate what American calls ""an entertainment platform powered by a global community of creatives."" (And there you were thinking TikTok was just a lot of questionable dancing videos and exposés of bad conditions in fast-food restaurants.)

But then I read the painfully defining print. This exciting offer actually gives you a mere 30 minutes of free TikTok. After that you have to pay for the wifi which as so many travelers have learned costs actual money.

It's understandable that this is a promotion. I fear however it feels like a promotion that tries to get kids to pester their parents to pay for wifi. Because who can go to TikTok and only stay for half an hour?

Perhaps in more pleasant flying times such an announcement may have earned a ripple of favor. Sometimes though it's worth withholding your excessive excitement -- and your press release -- until your customers stop screaming at you for wrecking their trips their last nerves and costing them in some cases a lot of money.

A lot of wonderful people work for American. Many especially gate agents and flight attendants are having to deal with hellbound passengers every day. Many say it's far worse than it's ever been. To then undergo entirely uncooperative weather and computer systems seems the height of cruelty.

So I wonder how many over the last week encountered passengers delightedly thanking them for 30 minutes of free TikTok."

It may be hard to see but flannel will cover every surface and sweater weather apple picking and pumpkin patches are just around the corner. And with it a lineup of autumn-themed Starbucks coffee products are coming to a grocery store near you.

Some old some new and some dairy free there’s an option for any coffee drinker. Let’s start with the new. For the cold brew addicts (aren’t we all?) the Pumpkin Spice Cold Brew Concentrate is the perfect seasonal transition. Just add water and you’ve got the fall pick-me-up you’ll be reaching for every morning.

And for those who avoid dairy there’s a dairy-free Pumpkin Spice flavored creamer. It’s made with almond and oat milk and spiced up with pumpkin flavors cinnamon and nutmeg. Mix both new products together to double up on the fall flavors.

Hitting the grocery store shelves are also some returning faves: the Pumpkin Spice Flavored Creamer and the Pumpkin Spice Flavored Coffee K-Cup pods and Roast & Grind. If you are so over the pumpkin spice Starbucks is also releasing Maple Pecan Flavored K-Cup pods and Roast & Grind and the Fall Blend K-Cup pods and Roast & Grind both returning favorites as well.

What better way to adjust to autumn than to fall-ify your coffee in the morning? All these products are available for a limited time at most grocery stores. Get them before they disappear (which is sure to be quickly!) and the holiday line up is out.

In an effort to reduce the environmental impact of its stores by keeping valuable material out of landfills and putting it to good use Starbucks offers its customers free pre-packaged five-pound bags of used coffee grounds to enrich their gardens and compost. Even the bags used to hold the grounds are recycled; the baristas use the bags in which the coffee beans and espresso were originally packaged.

Coffee grounds are a nutritional additive for your garden soil. Much of coffee’s acidity is removed in the brewing process leaving behind a green material that promotes plant growth repels ants and slugs and entices earthworms. The coffee grounds can be added directly to the garden as a side dressing for nitrogen loving plants.

ICED summer coffee drinks contain up to 12 teaspoons of sugar each — nearly double the NHS recommended daily limit.

Researchers found the high street favourites are packed with almost two days’ worth of sugar in a single drink.

1 Costa Coffee's Golden Caramel Frostino with Light Dairy Swirl contains TWELVE teaspoons of sugar

Costa Coffee’s Golden Caramel Frostino with Light Dairy Swirl has the equivalent of 48.7 grams in a single medium serving with semi-skimmed milk.

That is double the recommended limit of seven teaspoons.

Others include Caffe Nero’s Raspberry and White Chocolate Frappe Creme with 11 and a half teaspoons of sugar — 46 grams.

A McDonald’s Raspberry Ripple Iced Cooler has 11 teaspoons of sugar or 43 grams per large serving.

A regular version cuts it to seven and a half teaspoons or 32 grams.

Starbucks’ iced tipple Pink Coconut Refresha in a large size contains seven teaspoons of sugar the maximum for an adult in a day.

Our findings come just a week after Government food tsar Henry Dimbleby called for diet changes to tackle obesity and a tax on salty and sugary foods.

Paul Evans of the British Obesity Society and School Health UK said: “It is high time the food and restaurant industry took some responsibility for the excessive levels of sugar they are shovelling down peoples’ throats.”

Starbucks said that it is “committed to helping customers make informed and improved choices”.

Caffe Nero said its summer special drinks were “an occasional treat”.

Holly Gabriel - Nutritionist at Action on Sugar said: ”Year after year we see these huge sugar laden flavoured drinks pop up at every occasion with an unbelievable amount of sugar and calories which damages our health.

“These drinks show that placing a reformulation tax on manufacturers as proposed in the National Food Strategy would discourage them from pouring in so much sugar in the first place which would have a positive impact on our nation’s health.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL2hvc3BpdGFsaXR5LmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9vcGVyYXRpb25zL2Zvb2QtYW5kLWJldmVyYWdlcy90YXRhLXN0YXJidWNrcy1lbnRlcnMtcmFqYXN0aGFuLXdpdGgtdHdvLW5ldy1zdG9yZXMtaW4tamFpcHVyLzg1MTEyMTQ00gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vaG9zcGl0YWxpdHkuZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9vcGVyYXRpb25zL2Zvb2QtYW5kLWJldmVyYWdlcy90YXRhLXN0YXJidWNrcy1lbnRlcnMtcmFqYXN0aGFuLXdpdGgtdHdvLW5ldy1zdG9yZXMtaW4tamFpcHVyLzg1MTEyMTQ0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tata Starbucks enters Rajasthan with two new stores in Jaipur,"Advt

Independent Order of St. Luke Annual Convention

August 20 1901 Beginnings of the Bank At the 1901 annual convention of the Independent Order of St. Luke (IOSL) Maggie Walker laid out her goals for her organization including the formation of a bank an emporium a newspaper and a factory. Of these objectives the creation of a bank was foremost in her mind. Banks represented the pinnacle of financial achievement to many people. To Walker a bank would combat the oppressive conditions of racial segregation while encouraging economic independence and thrift in the black community. Relegated to second-class citizenship African Americans were denied rights in all aspects of life: education employment politics and business. Walker's bank along with other black-owned businesses provided spaces to conduct business away from the racism and harsh treatment often found in white-owned businesses. Mrs. Walker's idea for a bank was not new. Several fraternal orders also opened banks in turn-of-the-century Richmond including the Grand Fountain of the United Order of the True Reformers. Led by William Washington Browne the True Reformers became one of the largest African American fraternal and business orders in America. In March of 1888 the True Reformers made history by receiving the first charter granted to African Americans to open a bank. Between 1888 and 1920 five other black-owned banks opened in Richmond including Walker's St. Luke Penny Savings Bank and the Mechanics Savings Bank which served as the main depository for another fraternal order the Knights of Pythias. Numerous reasons compelled African Americans to open and patronize banks within their own community. Racial stereotypes discouraged many white bankers from loaning money to African Americans fearing that loans would never be repaid. If black customers were issued loans they were often charged a higher rate of interest than white customers. While many white-owned banks accepted deposits from black customers some did not. These white bank managers feared that black customers would scare away white patrons. Mrs. Walker understood that using white-owned banks in such an environment merely served to ""feed the lion of prejudice."" By patronizing black-owned banks African Americans in Richmond kept money in their own community and gained economic empowerment. While Maggie Walker first announced her vision of a bank in 1901 it would take over two years to see the dream realized. During that time the Independent Order of St. Luke focused on recruiting new members financing and building a new headquarters and publishing the St. Luke Herald. The bank however was never far from Mrs. Walker's mind. St. Luke attorney James Hayes drew up the charter which was approved by Virginia's Corporation Commission on July 28 1903. Local newspapers carried the story many noting the distinction that the bank would be led by an African American woman. Walker's notoriety grew when the Virginia Banker's Association extended membership to her. This offer had not been extended to any of the other presidents of the black-owned banks in Richmond. She accepted the invitation and remarked ""I shall hope to conduct myself so as to reflect credit upon my race and people."" As the plans came together Walker used the network of St. Luke councils to promote the bank. At the annual IOSL convention in August of 1903 she encouraged each council to open an account and buy bank stock. She also urged each individual member to open an account. Walker realized that if the bank was to succeed she would need the full support of her fraternal community. The Executive Committee of the IOSL served as the initial Board of Directors for the bank. At the first board meeting held on August 19 1903 the group set an opening date for the business sold 200 shares of stock to the Grand Council of the IOSL and decided that most stock would be sold only to IOSL members. At another meeting held on August 21 the board approved the hiring of clerks and set their salaries. The board appointed Emmett C. Burke as cashier at a salary of $50 per month Mary Dawson as assistant cashier at $25 per month and Maggie Walker as president earning $25 a week for her work. To prepare herself for the position Walker spent two hours a day at the white-owned Merchants National Bank of Richmond studying procedures and operations of the bank. On November 2 1903 the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank opened for business at the St. Luke Headquarters Building at 900 St. James Street. While music played and speeches were given nearly 300 eager customers many of them members of the IOSL waited patiently to open bank accounts. While some people deposited more than one hundred dollars others started accounts with just a few dollars including one person who deposited just 31 cents. At the end of the day the bank had 280 deposits totaling over $8000 and sold $1247.00 worth of stock bringing the total to $9340.44. Mrs. Walker originally hoped for deposits exceeding $75000 but she was pleased with the first day's success. At the same time she recognized the hard work ahead to find success and security for the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank.

Maggie L. Walker and the officers of the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank c. 1917 Maggie L Walker National Historic Site The Bank Expansions and Successes In an attempt to encourage deposits by children Walker distributed penny banks among St. Luke families. Walker hoped the banks would teach children how to save their money and learn the importance of thrift. Once children had one hundred pennies in their bank they could open an account at the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. As a shrewd businesswoman Walker also realized that every penny counted and that each deposit opened by a child would help strengthen the bank. To further the success of the bank and expand the empire of the IOSL Walker recommended that the bank's Board of Directors purchase a building to house a department store and the bank. The vision of an emporium run by African American women was first vocalized by Walker in 1901 at the same time she announced her dream for the bank and the St. Luke Herald. As the bank slowly prospered the time seemed ripe for the IOSL to further its influence in Richmond. In September 1904 the IOSL purchased a building at 112 Broad Street to house the St. Luke Emporium and the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. The bank moved to this new location in October 1905. The bank would continue to grow steadily at this location. The year 1910 brought many changes not only to the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank but banks throughout the state. The Virginia General Assembly added legislation that required all state banks to be examined annually by the State Corporation Committee. This law resulted in the closure of a number of banks across the state. The St. Luke Penny Savings Bank however successfully passed the examination and continued to operate. One bank not so fortunate was the True Reformers Bank. The Corporation Committee ordered the closure of the bank in October of 1910. Unsecured loans lax operations and embezzlement by a clerk led to its downfall with most depositors losing their savings. The fall of the first black-owned bank in Richmond shattered the confidence of African Americans in the city.



Although St. Luke Penny Savings Bank remained financially healthy during this time the Emporium suffered from low sales. Likely in view of the department store's impending closure the bank's Board of Directors voted to erect a new bank building in 1910. Charles T. Russell one of the first black licensed architects in the state designed the plans. In November 1911 the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank opened its doors at the corner of First and Marshall Streets. That same month the St. Luke Emporium shut its doors for good.



While the bank continued to do moderately well it would never again see the growth experienced in the previous years. In 1920 two other black owned banks were chartered in Richmond-Commercial Bank and Trust and Second Street Savings Bank-creating more competition. In 1922 the Mechanics Savings Bank operated by John Mitchell Jr. was closed by the State Corporation Committee again causing confidence in black-owned banks to decline. By 1928 resources of the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank dropped below their 1926 totals. To save the bank and to ensure that depositors' assets were secure Walker took action. The Merging of Ideas to Survive Difficult Times In 1929 Walker met with officers and directors for the Second Street Savings Bank and the Commercial Bank and Trust to discuss a merger. While the Commercial Bank dropped out of discussions the two remaining banks adopted a resolution to merge. The new institution the Consolidated Bank and Trust opened for business on January 2 1930 at the 1st and Marshall Street location of the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. Still facing financial troubles Commercial Bank and Trust merged with Consolidated in 1931. Walker served as Chairman to the Board of Directors for Consolidated Bank and Trust a position she would hold until her death in 1934. While many banks did not survive the Great Depression Consolidated Bank and Trust not only survived but thrived into the twenty-first century. In 2005 Abigail Adams National Bank purchased Consolidated Bank and Trust ending Consolidated's distinction as a black-run independently-owned bank. It is believed to have been the oldest continuously black-owned bank in the country until then. In 2009 Premiere Bank merged with Abigail Adams. Two years later Consolidated Bank and Trust was renamed Premiere Bank. It still operates today at the corner of 1st and Marshall Streets. During its long history the bank founded by Maggie Walker benefited the African American community in Richmond. By 1920 for example it had issued more than 600 mortgages to black families allowing many to realize the dream of home ownership. It provided employment for African Americans giving some a chance to leave the menial labor intensive jobs to which African Americans were often relegated. More than anything the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank-turned-Consolidated Bank and Trust was a source of pride for black Richmonders. The bank served as a reminder of the lasting impact that Maggie Walker's vision and perseverance had on an entire community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zdHRob21hcy5lZHUvcHVibGljYXRpb24tYXJ0aWNsZS9jYW4tMTk0Ni1sYXd5ZXJzLWNoYW5nZS13b3JsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can 1946 St. Thomas Lawyers Change the World? - Newsroom | University of St. Thomas,"While the majority of our School of Law alumni continue to advance the common good in Minnesota and the surrounding states we asked 17 of our 1946 alumni what they do each day and what impact they hope to have on the communities they serve outside the Upper Midwest.

Not just in your office or courtroom but in your community? Do you consider the impact you are making on the world around you?

As a law school we talk a lot about impact. Dean Robert Vischer wrote on the pages of St. Thomas Lawyer in 2014 “It’s what draws us to the School of Law. The hundreds of people who have worked to build our community – faculty staff students alumni donors and mentors – have been motivated by a mission that calls us to be part of a cause that is bigger than ourselves.”

We know we are able to make a bigger impact today than when our doors opened almost two decades ago with one standalone J.D. program and 120 first-year law students. We’ve grown and changed in the years since increasing our clinical offerings to 12 opening our classrooms to compliance professionals who seek to change corporate culture and welcoming lawyers from the far corners of the Earth who want to understand American law to better serve their clients abroad. With every change in curriculum our dedication to impacting lives and communities persists – from our state to the nation and the world.

And so we turn our attention to you. What will be your legacy?

Not only did he put Florida State on the map by taking the Seminoles from afterthought to dynasty he left an indelible mark on the game with a rare combination of coaching acumen gracious demeanor and a compassion for those he coached and competed against.

The beloved folksy Hall of Fame coach who built one of the most prolific college football programs in history died early Sunday at 91 at his home in Tallahassee Florida surrounded by his wife Ann and their six children following a battle with pancreatic cancer. Bobby’s son Terry called his passing “truly peaceful.”

And while he’s gone Bowden’s legacy as a top-notch coach — and human being — will live on.

The numbers are staggering: Bowden piled up 377 wins during 40 years as a major college coach and his teams won a dozen Atlantic Coast Conference titles and national championships in 1993 and 1999. Perhaps the statistic that jumps off the page is his sustained success with Florida State which finished the season ranked in the top five of The Associated Press college football poll an unmatched 14 straight seasons (1987-2000) under his tutelage.

Bowden’s legacy can’t just be told in numbers.

“This guy was probably the greatest ambassadors of all time because he had success coaching but he was also one of the greatest people and set an outstanding example for everyone in our profession in terms of you don’t have to dislike somebody you don’t have to discredit somebody that you’re competing against” Alabama coach Nick Saban said. “That example of being a good person is something that can help us all professionally. He wasn’t always just about him; he was always about helping other people.”

Bowden a devout Christian said last month after announcing he had a terminal illness he had always tried to serve God’s purpose and he was “prepared for what is to come.”

“My wife Ann and our family have been life’s greatest blessing” he said then.

Bowden added that he was “at peace.” Perhaps that’s because he had accomplished so much in what Saban called “a life remarkably well lived.”

Bowden was beloved by Seminoles fans respected by his peers and throughout his life one of the most accessible stars in college football. His home number was listed in the Tallahassee phone book for years.

News of his death spread quickly. Flowers many of them in Florida State’s garnet and gold color scheme adorned the statue of Bowden outside of Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee and coach Mike Norvell addressed players about Bowden before a morning practice.

Assistant head coach Odell Haggins who played and coached under Bowden praised his friend for being a hard-nosed competitor but also a compassionate coach.

“He never talked about winning the game. He always talked about saving lives. And that’s the thing I hope everybody sees (with) him” Haggins said. “You know they talk about how many football games he won. You talk about the national championships he won. But look at how many lives he won. Look at how many lives he saved.”

Bowden retired following the 2009 season with a Gator Bowl win over West Virginia in Florida State’s 28th straight postseason appearance a victory that gave him his 33rd consecutive winning season. A month after he resigned the NCAA stripped Florida State of victories in 10 sports because of an academic cheating scandal in 2006 and ’07 involving 61 athletes.

Still only Penn State’s Joe Paterno is credited with winning more games (409) as a major college football coach. Bowden’s win total ranks fourth across all divisions in college football history.

Bowden was replaced in 2010 by his offensive coordinator Jimbo Fisher who had been Bowden’s replacement-in-waiting.

“He’s one of the great human beings that’s ever coached and one of the great coaches that’s ever coached” Fisher said.

Bowden won the national championship in 1993 with Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Charlie Ward and again in 1999 with his second Heisman winner quarterback Chris Weinke and All-American receiver Peter Warrick.

The Seminoles were a contender to win the title every season for more than a decade. Florida State lost national championship games against Florida Tennessee and Oklahoma and narrowly missed out on the playing for titles in several other seasons because of losses to archrival Miami.

Bowden in fact once quipped that his headstone would read “But he played Miami” a one-liner that came the day after the Hurricanes escaped with a 17-16 win in 1991 when the Seminoles missed a field goal wide right in the final seconds. Miami also won in similar fashion in 2002 when a field-goal try went wide left much to Bowden’s chagrin.

Florida State dominated the ACC under Bowden winning championships in 12 of its first 14 seasons after joining the league in 1992.

“Bobby Bowden has meant everything to Florida State athletics and so much to college football in general” Florida State athletic director David Coburn said. “He is a part of the heart and soul of FSU but it goes beyond even that — he is a big part of the history of the game.”

Bowden was also the patriarch of college football’s most colorful coaching family. Son Tommy Bowden had a 90-49 record at Tulane and Clemson and Terry was 47-17-1 at Auburn. Another son Jeff served 13 years coaching wide receivers for his father at Florida State and six seasons as offensive coordinator before he resigned in 2006 after Florida State’s offense slumped to its lowest production in a quarter century.

Bobby Bowden left West Virginia to take over a Florida State program in 1976 that had produced just four wins the three previous seasons. The Seminoles went 5-6 in Bowden’s first year and never again experienced a losing season with him in charge.

“You face similar tasks of motivation preparation teamwork discipline” Bowden said. “I probably get the most satisfaction out of putting in the strategies and watching them play out.”

By 1979 Bowden had Florida State positioned for one of the great runs in the annals of college football.

Led by All-American nose guard Ron Simmons the Seminoles enjoyed an 11-0 regular season but lost to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. In 1993 despite a late slip at Notre Dame Florida State won its first national title after nearly getting there in 1987 1988 1991 and 1992.

Bowden’s lone perfect season came in 1999 when the Seminoles became the first team to go wire-to-wire in The Associated Press rankings No. 1 from the preseason to finish.

“The first championship was more of a relief” Bowden said. “I think I was able to enjoy the second one a little more.”

Success also brought a glaring spotlight and Bowden’s program was touched by scandal on a few occasions. The school was put on NCAA probation for five years after several players in 1993 accepted free shoes and other sporting goods from a local store. The episode led former Florida coach Steve Spurrier to dub FSU “Free Shoes University.”

Bowden prided himself on giving players a second chance but critics said he was soft on discipline with an eye on winning games.

“If short hair and good manners won football games Army and Navy would play for the national championship every year” Bowden retorted.

Randy Moss one of the most talented athletes to attend Florida State never played a down for the Seminoles and was kicked out of school after a redshirt season for smoking marijuana. In 1999 Warrick was caught in a shopping scam that led to his suspension for two games and probably cost him the Heisman Trophy that year.

“There’s only about 6 inches that turns that halo into a noose” Bowden was fond of saying during the good days when he was often called “Saint Bobby” by the Florida State faithful.

The Seminoles won 10 or more games in 18 of Bowden’s 34 seasons at Florida State but were a relatively mortal 74-42 on the field from 2001-09.

The cheating scandal that led to the loss of a dozen wins from Bowden’s final resume took place in an online music history course from the fall of 2006 through summer 2007. The NCAA said some athletes were provided with answers to exams and in some cases had papers typed for them.

Bowden stayed in the public eye after retirement writing a book making speeches and going public with his treatment for prostate cancer in 2007. His fear of retiring from coaching resulted in part from the death of his longtime idol former Alabama coach Paul “Bear” Bryant who died within weeks of leaving the sidelines.

“After you retire there’s only one big event left” Bowden frequently said.

Bowden stayed active into his 80s finally slowing down over the last year or so. He was hospitalized in October 2020 after testing positive for COVID-19. The test came a few days after he returned home from a long hospital stay for a leg infection.

Born Nov. 8 1929 in Birmingham Alabama Robert Cleckler Bowden overcame rheumatic fever as a child to quarterback Woodlawn High School in Birmingham then attended Alabama for a semester before transferring back to his hometown Howard College where he starred at quarterback.

He married his childhood sweetheart Ann and they stayed together for 72 years.

Bowden built the Florida State program by scheduling the toughest opponents he could find and he’d play them anywhere usually at their stadium. He was dubbed “King of the Road” in 1981 after playing consecutive road games at Nebraska Ohio State Notre Dame Pittsburgh and LSU — and winning three of the five.

His daring play-calling also earned him the nickname Riverboat Gambler in some quarters. Bowden’s most famous trick play came in 1988 at Clemson. He sent his punt team onto the field with 1:33 left in a tie game with a fourth-and-4 and the ball at Florida State’s 21. Florida State’s punter leaped high into the air and acted as if he were chasing down a high snap while the upback took the ball and slipped it between his legs where LeRoy Butler grabbed it and raced 78 yards to the Clemson 1 to set up the winning field goal.

“We were determined somebody was going to win that game” Bowden said after the “Puntrooskie.”

Through Bowden’s career Florida State won games in many of the nation’s toughest stadiums including at Michigan Southern California and of course rivals Florida and Miami. In 1987 the Seminoles crushed Big Ten champion Michigan State 31-3 at East Lansing and whipped Southeastern Conference champion Auburn on its home field 34-6.

Bowden also was considered one of the best handlers of great individual talents recruiting and developing the likes of Simmons Ward Weinke Warrick Butler and Deion Sanders who earned the nickname “Prime Time” during his days as a Seminole.

“God bless the Bowden Family Friends & Loved ones” Sanders posted on Twitter. “I’ve lost 1 of the best coaches I’ve ever had.”

Florida State’s recruiting classes were nearly always among the top nationally. By the 1990s the Seminoles poured star talent into the NFL on an annual basis including four of the top 19 picks in the 2006 draft the same year Bowden was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame.

Both coaches who birthed college football powerhouses in Florida during the 1980s have died this year. Howard Schnellenberger who led Miami to its first national championship in 1983 died in March at 87.

Bowden is survived by wife Ann; sons Terry Tommy Jeff and Steve; and daughters Robyn Hines and Ginger Madden. Services were scheduled for Saturday at the Donald L Tucker Center Florida State’s basketball arena.

The mall was supposed to give a shot in the arm to the downtown economy. Columnist Jerry Berger got a sneak preview of things and his is what he wrote.

AGONY L ECSTASY: ""God must have wanted it to be like this because when construction connecting the Famous-Barr and Dillard's stores neared completion the levels were only inches off!"" Elizabeth Kraft vice president of Melvln Simon & Associates Inc. philosophized Wednesday at the 11th hour before the St. Louis Centre curtain-raiser.

Meanwhile frenzied workmen put the finishing touches to the gleaming shops midway between the anchor department stores.

One workman outside the then-incomplete St. Louis Jewelry Factory moaned ""But I ordered burgundy tilel""

Stewing over whether the baseball strike would be over soon were Scott Ross partner in the Complete Athlete which stocks sports equipment licensed by professional teams.

""Fans like to root for their favorite teams then buy the merchandise"" he cried.

Conversely a tranquil mood prevailed with Sharon Leonard and Harry G. Wellard as they stocked shelves with giant jawbreakers and gummy bears at their Tropical Sun & Fruit kiosk.

MOVING ALONG: Sighs of relief filled the St. Louis Museum Shop (part of the Gallery of Museum Shops) where staffers had finally put together the pieces of a 10-foot mahogany wall piece.

""Isn't the silver through customs yet?"" should be a question asked by shop staffers Patricia Stubbers and Kathleen Simmons of their counterparts In Paris' Louvre.

A few paces away Jim Butts chief of housekeeping chuckled that the brown-bagged lunch of one of his workmen ""had been stolen during the night.""

At least he was able to sip coffee and munch on pastry served by Addle Bleser of Butler's Pantry caterers to St. Louis Centre's crew who excitedly confided ""I helped cater breakfast at the very first meeting of the part- ners in St. Louis Union Station! I'd love to see that.""

COUNTDOWN: Tickets to last night's RCGA-sponsored opening party were the hottest item in town as evidenced by Simon staffer Victor Ruthlg who regaled workers with the tale of the woman who telephoned to explain that her two tickets had been stolen at a friend's house. ""We didn't bother to check the police report"" said Ruthlg ""we just told her we'd pass her through.""

What the guests saw last night at the debut of the Centre which it Is hoped will reverse the downtown trend of more pigeons than people were 2 acres of glass more than a million floor tiles 1900 individual plants 6 million pounds of structural steel and 1500 cubic yards of concrete and the octogenarian who springs eternal Bob Hope.

Hope just may be disappointed to learn that on the fourth floor level of the Centre he could have relaxed on the ""Mommy Mommy Chair"" (It vibrates) in Abercrombie & Fitch. Or he could've opted for ogling the 18-karat-gold Carrera sunglasses there which sell for $3000 a pair.

Other big-ticket items Abercrombie touts include a chess set that will be price tagged at $15000. (""Only Queen Elizabeth has a matching set"" snapped the clerk.)

The shops planned to shutter for the preview because as the Centre's general manager Larry Troyer explained ""It will give tenants an opportunlty to work to the last minute.""

Improvisation comes easy to Troyer who recalled the arrival of 30-foot trees for planting on the bridge. He said ""They couldn't fit Into the elevators so we just cut a hole in the wall on the Sixth Street side.""

PERSONAE: While Stlx Baer & Fuller has long since disappeared from the scene to make way for Dillard's J.A. ""Cubby"" Baer II whose grandfather Julius Baer was a founder of SBF relentlessly wended his way here for the opening from his retreat in Charlevoix Mich.

Cubby who for 15 years was chairman and CEO of SBF noted that the entire project of connecting the two stores by a mall was more than a dream 19 years ago for him and bankers Don Lasater and Boardman Jones.

""We commissioned Seattle-based architect John Graham to design it"" said Baer ""but It became too expensive.""

Louis Lelpzlger 74 who retired in 1976 as president of Stlx Baer & Fuller who recalled earlier in the day how In the 1920s the store's employees contributed toward the purchase of the ornate clock that became a landmark first near the fine jewelry department and then on the corner of Sixth Street and Washington Avenue.

The clock he said was a memorial to one of the store's founders Slgmund Baer Incidentally the timepiece has been taken down for cleaning. - Asked whether he planned to attend the opening Lelpzlger confided ""I wasn't Invited.""

BOTTOM SHELF: Well cheer up Lou! All the retailers in St. Louts Centre received Invitations to the opening night party and dutifully coughed up the required $35 each.

FAST FOOTWORK: Our Centre stroll finally led us out on Sixth Street where at  least one townie lamented the premiere of the shopping complex.

Elliot Waiman who owns the Gateway Newsstand near Washington Avenue with his father Mike is sad about the departure of workmen on the project.

""Sales of Playboy and Penthouse were down"" Waxman said ""but we sold a lot of Hustler and High Society.""

Tesla has formally moved the Cybertruck’s estimated customer deliveries to 2022. The update was reflected by the company in the all-electric pickup truck’s online configurator.

Tesla’s update on the Cybertruck’s deliveries has been speculated for some time now. While the Cybertruck’s online configurator had maintained its late 2021 estimate since the vehicle’s unveiling the ongoing chip crisis and supply chain challenges have presented headwinds to Tesla’s vehicle ramp.

These headwinds were evident in the case of the newly-refreshed Model S and Model X the company’s new flagship vehicles. The Model S was initially expected to start deliveries in February with the Model X coming soon after. It took Tesla until June to start delivering the Model S Plaid and until now the company is yet to announce if the new Model X would see deliveries in the coming months.

A 2022 delivery date for the Tesla Cybertruck is not necessarily a significant delay however especially considering that the entire EV sector is experiencing the same headwinds. Rivian for one unveiled its R1T pickup truck in late 2018 but it’s yet to start customer deliveries of the all-electric truck. The Lucid Air is on the same boat with CEO Peter Rawlinson blaming the ongoing supply chain issues as reasons behind the luxury sedan’s delays.

Interestingly enough Tesla had actually teased the Cybertruck’s 2022 deliveries in its second-quarter earnings call. When asked about the vehicle’s customer rollout Lars Moravy Tesla’s VP for Vehicle Engineering noted that the Cybertruck would be moving to its beta phase by the end of the year. The end of 2021 was initially set to be the start of the Cybertruck’s customer release.

“The Cybertruck is currently in its alpha stages. We finished basic engineering the architecture of the vehicle. With the Cybertruck we’re redefining how a vehicle is being made. As Elon said it carries much of the structural pack and large casting designs of the Model Y being built in Berlin and Austin. Obviously those take priority over the Cybertruck but we are moving into the beta phases of Cybertruck later this year and we will be looking to ramp that in production and take it to Texas after Model Y is up and going” Moravy said.

The stage is coming together for the Cybertruck’s production however. Gigafactory Texas is being constructed at an extremely rapid pace and it seems like it would only be a matter of time before the Cybertruck’s Giga Presses are sighted on the complex. Even Steel Dynamics’ Sinton TX factory which would supply the steel for the all-electric pickup truck is growing steadily.

The Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) recently enquired the US military about its plans of the service to deploy Vehicle Protection Systems (VPS) that could keep tank crews safe from drones. The panel is currently debating the defense authorization bill for the fiscal year 2022.

“The committee has consistently supported the Army’s efforts to identify develop integrate and test various active and passive vehicle protection systems (VPS) that would increase armored vehicle survivability and protect crew and passengers” the subcommittee wrote in its report.

“[But] the committee is unclear however as to VPS research or development efforts related to potential threats from [UAS]” it added expressing concern over the existing efforts of the US military on how effective the protection systems are against drone threats.

US lawmakers have recommended the active protection systems (APS) for the armored vehicle fleets since they insulate against anti-tank rockets missiles as well as drones.

The Army has been struggling for years to install active protection systems onto its Abrams tanks Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles and Stryker combat vehicles.

Drone Threat Against Tanks

In the last decade drones have become a major threat to military troops and the weapon arsenal. These unmanned aerial vehicles have impacted military outcomes in conflicts like the Nagorno-Karabakh in which Turkish drones aided the Azerbaijan side to victory against rival Armenia.

Popular Mechanics reported how drones have been actively used in Ukraine Libya Iraq and Syria to drop primitive explosive payloads or launch ‘Kamikaze’ (suicide) attacks in the past few years.

Billion $ security systems failed to detect them had to orchestrate blackout at base shoot at drones with hand guns. pic.twitter.com/HGytpdgScY — Kabir Taneja (@KabirTaneja) January 8 2018

In 2017 a drone attack on a Ukrainian ammunition dump destroyed an estimated $1 billion in munitions. In the same year an ISIS drone dropped a small explosive device on an unsuspecting Iraqi Army tank killing the commander as he stood exposed outside of his hatch.

A UN report even accused Turkey of developing autonomous drones which do not require human interference before killing a target an allegation the drone maker later rejected saying the UAVs are not autonomous but are controlled by crews.

Protection Against Drones

In 2016 the US chose the Trophy Active Protection System (APS) developed by Israeli company Rafael for the Abrams tanks. Similarly the Iron Fist system from another Israeli company called IMI was chosen for the Bradley and Herdon system a Virginia-based Artis’ Iron Curtain for Stryker tanks.

While the US has been successful in fielding the interim Trophy APS system on the Abrams tanks it has struggled to integrate the Bradley and Stryker tanks with chosen protection systems.

Later in 2018 the procurement of the Herdon system was canceled for Stryker tanks and instead two additional systems were shortlisted called Rafael’s Trophy VPS and Rheinmetall’s Active Defense System.

A year later Col. Glenn Dean the program manager for Stryker who also manages the service’s effort to install APS on combat vehicles revealed that the US Army had not yet found a system that was suitable for the platform.

“Both Rheinmetall and the medium-weight Trophy both have maturity challenges but the bottom line is that they turned out to not be a suitable fit for Stryker” Dean told Defense News.

Looking at the emerging threats such as drones and laser weapons experts suggest that perhaps the ideal Army defense might be a “microwave weapon” that can take down several drones at once.

One such system is the Army’s laser warning program that is tied to the Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) program. The MAPS is a system under development with the Army featuring a common controller into which hard-kill and soft-kill protection can be plugged.

US aerospace giant Lockheed Martin was also awarded a $30 million contract earlier this year for integrating and formally testing its open-architecture processor designed to control the US Army’s future combat vehicle protection system.

The company will be developing base kits for US Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) program which then will be customized with sensors and countermeasures for different vehicles by 2023.

“Under the 36-month contract Lockheed Martin will deliver five production-ready base kits with an option for up to 20 and support Army integration and testing on Abrams Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle Bradley and Stryker vehicles” the company’s press release said.

“The contract also covers developing base kit support for vehicle protection capabilities beyond active protection such as underbelly blast protection” it added.

In addition the US government had released $16 million in FY21 to conduct testing of the Iron Fist Light Decoupled phase 2 system on a Bradley.

The committee’s discussion concluded with the panel directing the Army’s acquisition chief to brief the House Armed Services Committee no later than Jan. 28 2022 on “plans related to VPS against UAS threats” along with what the efforts might cost from research through procurement across a five-year program budget cycle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXlpbmMuY29tL3N0cnlrZXItY2VvLWtldmluLWxvYm8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Things You Didn't Know about Stryker CEO Kevin Lobo,"Back in 1941 Kalamazoo was deeply troubled by his patients’ failing health and suffering. He was a physician who was based in Michigan and he founded the Michigan based Stryker Corporation. Fast forward to today Kevin Lobo is propelling it to supply over 100 countries with medical devices. Kevin Lobo has been a phenomenal figure at the corporation. He has led the corporation into overwhelming success and has made it a pioneer in many aspects of improving global healthcare. His success has made him a person of interest and the following are 10 things you didn't know about Stryker CEO Kevin Lobo.

1. He led Stryker’s first mega Chinese acquisition

This 48-year-old led Stryker into buying a company that makes pelvic reconstruction plates. The Chinese company was the largest in the country and it was bought at $764 million. The funny thing is that the purchase was Kevin’s first acquisition as a Chief Executive officer and it served as a glimpse of his bold and daring demeanor. He personally acknowledges that it was the first time he did something so robust and he asserts that he values the lessons he learned from the move immensely.

2. He didn’t anticipate his ascent to Stryker’s top position

Lobo became the CEO of Stryker after the unprecedented resignation of the then Stryker President and Chairman. After MacMillan resigned suddenly due to family reasons the corporation had to restructure its leadership after eight years of stability. The medical devices giant relied on the then VC and Vice President to act as its acting CEO. Kevin was finally entrusted with the responsibility due to his phenomenal experience and outstanding performance at other institutions and as Group President of Stryker Orthopedics.

3. He is a French Speaking Canadian native

Kevin Lobo can speak impeccable English and fluent French. He always has to expend all his charismatic grasp of all the languages that he can speak to address the global community of 24000 professionals that Stryker employees.

4. He is the only managing member of the board

Kevin sits on the Stryker board of directors and he participates in most of the important decision making that propels this pharmaceutical giant into delivering better products. He is the only member of the board that also performs active management duties and day to day running of the corporation.

5. He sits on other major boards

Kevin Lobo’s influence spans from way back before he joined Stryker. He uses his influence at other boards to advance his agenda of improving healthcare and the pharmaceutical business for the benefit of the boards in which he sits including:

Business Leaders for Michigan

Parker Hannifin Corporation

United Way

Advanced Medical Technology Association

6. Kevin Lobo is a thematic leader

After becoming the head of Stryker and moving to Southwest Michigan where the base of Stryker’s operations lie he set out to familiarize the corporation with four themes that he intends to use throughout his tenure. They included:

Globalization

Innovation

Collaboration

Cost-optimization

He owes the four themes to Stryker’s expansion into over 100 countries and impressive growth.

7. Kevin didn’t relocate his family

Kevin is a family man and he certainly didn’t want to disrupt his son’s High School education. He says that he spends as much time in Kalamazoo as if he lived there. According to him his job description involves very frequent traveling and therefore it didn’t matter where his family was based. It would be simpler if he did the moving because he was the one required to move all the time.

8. Lobo once lived in the United Kingdom

CEO Kevin claims that he learned his most important lesson in leadership when he was supervising Rhone-Poulenc’s Phosphate Division. He says that he had to learn the hard way that he didn’t know everything there was to about the industry. His realization from the job was that he had to align himself with people who were great at what they were doing.

9. Lobo is a great listener

Lobo’s most valuable advice to industry leaders is to always listen before anything. He argues that when one listens they learn and understand.

CNBC says that both carriers had plans last year to show consumers via advertisements why they need to upgrade their phones and wireless plans to include 5G connectivity. But when the pandemic hit all of a sudden showing how much faster 5G speeds help users download streaming movies in seconds wasn't as important as showing consumers how 5G helps them work from home a message more in line with promoting cable firms.

Verizon and AT&T plan on showing why consumers need 5G in new ads







Both Verizon and AT&T want to sign up as many new 5G subscribers as quickly as possible. CNBC says that the goal is to recover the high costs of building out nationwide 5G coverage but also to keep subscribers from switching to T-Mobile. The latter not only ""tends to offer the cheapest prices among the big three"" according to the report but it also tops ""both Verizon and AT&T in download speed and 5G availability according to Open Network's July 2021 5G User Experience Report.""





Craig Moffett a wireless analyst at MoffettNathanson says that everything is going T-Mobile's way right now as the nation's second-largest carrier is using its triple-layer cake 5G coverage (combining low mid and high-band spectrum to offer nationwide coverage with decent 5G download speeds.







Moffet says ""A focus on 5G isn't going to be flattering to either Verizon or AT&T. They are falling far behind T-Mobile in what will soon matter most: 5G speed and coverage. And they charge consumers much higher prices than T-Mobile."" As a result Verizon and AT&T are looking to produce ads that explain why consumers need to subscribe to their 5G service instead of T-Mobile's and that is going to be a challenge.





AT&T plans on showing people using 5G while out and about despite the higher number of cases that are being discovered daily. David Christopher Executive Vice President of partnerships & 5G ecosystem development for AT&T says ""We almost lost the year.

While 5G download speeds will eventually be much faster than 4G LTE speeds the fact is that the largest area of 5G coverage in the states is from low-band spectrum which travels long distances but often delivers download speeds not much faster than 4G LTE. This is where T-Mobile's purchase of Sprint last year was a big deal since it provided the former with plenty of mid-band spectrum that the other carriers are not yet using.





Mid-band airwaves travel farther than mmWave but not as far as low-band. They deliver faster speeds than low-band but not as fast as mmWave. Mid-band 5G spectrum is a compromise that allows T-Mobile to deliver faster 5G service in more locations than the competition. But with more of the country experiencing slower low-band 5G this explains why a J.D. Power survey taken last year showed that only 25% of Americans believe that 5G will be much faster than the current 4G LTE service provided by carriers.

SNL's Kate McKinnon is the current face of Verizon 5G







The survey also revealed that only 5% of those responding said that they are willing to pay more for 5G. The CEO of AT&T Communications Jeff McElfresh said that he has ""always tried to soften folks' expectations around 5G.""





While Verizon and AT&T have focused on 5G use in the workplace both said that they will soon start advertising 5G from a standpoint of consumer use. Verizon's current 5G ads starring the talented Kate McKinnon from Saturday Night Live focus on its current deal that will give consumers trading in a phone up to $800 toward the purchase of a 5G-enabled handset.







While that sounds like a sweet deal it fails to show why 5G service is important and necessary for Verizon customers to have. Expect to see that in the next wave of 5G ads for Verizon and AT&T.

The FCC has made it easier for carrier customers to check how much coverage their mobile phone company provides by releasing its first map of 4G LTE coverage across the United States.

The map published by the Federal Communications Commission on Friday offers a quick reference to regional availability for coverage from major carriers with regards to 4G LTE signal. In its initial release it is offering signal information for AT&T T-Mobile US Cellular and Verizon across the country.

The map shows coverage for broadband data and voice calls from May 15 2021. The data was voluntarily submitted to the FCC by the four carriers and advises of where you can pick up signal of each carrier in a particular place.

The coverage areas can be overlaid with colors mixing to show where two or more carriers can function in the same place. Independent layers are provided per carrier and for data or voice calls though expected connection speeds are not advised.

As voluntarily provided data it is unclear how accurate the information actually is as it is unknown if it has been independently vetted or collected by a third party. It is also unknown how often the map will be updated but the FCC has said it is open to introducing data from other carriers to add to the list.

The accuracy of the data could potentially be improved using data from consumers and businesses with an FCC Task Force looking into proposals to add real-world experiences.

""Today's new map represents progress in our efforts to implement the Broadband DATA Act and build next-generation broadband maps that can help to connect 100 percent of Americans"" said acting FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel. ""Using improved systems and data we can provide better information about where broadband service is and is not across the country.""

Cellular speeds aren't the only area of interest for the FCC regarding connectivity. In April it launched an official speed test app to help collect data on home broadband speeds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvdmVyaXpvbi1hdHQtdHJ5LXRvLWNvbnZpbmNlLWFtZXJpY2Fucy10aGV5LW5lZWQtNWctbm93Lmh0bWzSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wOC8wNy92ZXJpem9uLWF0dC10cnktdG8tY29udmluY2UtYW1lcmljYW5zLXRoZXktbmVlZC01Zy1ub3cuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon and AT&T plan post-pandemic 5G marketing blitz even as consumer use cases remain unclear,"A large advertisement on the LED screen outside the apple store is to warm up the iPhone 12 series which is officially on sale on the 23rd. Shanghai China October 21 2020.

That puts pressure on both companies to sell consumers on why they should choose AT&T and Verizon — making 5G a marketing challenge as Americans emerge from pandemic quarantines.

""A focus on 5G isn't going to be flattering to either Verizon or AT&T"" said Craig Moffett a wireless analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""They are falling far behind T-Mobile in what will soon matter most: 5G speed and coverage. And they charge consumers much higher prices than T-Mobile.""

AT&T and Verizon want to transfer customers as fast as possible to 5G networks — not just to recoup the heavy capital expenditure costs of building out updated nationwide networks but also to lock in customers and keep them from defecting to T-Mobile .

""We almost lost the year"" said David Christopher EVP of partnerships & 5G ecosystem development for AT&T. ""But now people are excited to get out of their homes and experience 5G in the wild. We will dramatize use cases that matter to customers.""

Then the pandemic hit and with everyone stuck at home showing off blazing speeds and consumer use cases in stadiums airports and public places wasn't just irrelevant — it was gauche. Cloud gaming checking instant odds on gambling apps from stadiums and downloading Netflix movies at the airport became far less important than the ability to work from home — a better message for cable companies who already deliver high-speed home broadband.

U.S. wireless giants AT&T and Verizon had big plans last year to advertise why customers should upgrade their phones and start using 5G wireless.

Getting Americans excited about 5G may not be easy.

A J.D. Power survey last year found that only about a quarter of wireless subscribers said they believed 5G would be significantly faster than current 4G LTE technology and only 5% of respondents said they'd be willing to pay more for 5G service.

Even the CEO of AT&T Communications Jeff McElfresh told CNBC last year he has ""always tried to soften folks' expectations around 5G.""

Much of the messaging about 5G so far has been about enterprise solutions. A Deloitte Insights consumer survey this year found that consumer use cases that demand the faster network simply don't exist yet.

Verizon last year helped produce a documentary on 5G called ""Speed of Thought"" which showed enterprise-focused examples such as a robotic arm that a physician can use from anywhere and an augmented reality helmet for firefighters to help see through smoke. It also explored cities testing out 5G-enabled technology to avoid car collisions.

AT&T leaders have also said 5G's real opportunity is in the business cases particularly in the case of machines and equipment that are communicating via internet-of-things technology.

But both companies plan to illustrate specific consumer use cases in advertisements in the coming months to convince customers to upgrade.

In an outline of its 5G strategy for this year AT&T detailed use cases including AR-aided shopping experiences for consumers in stores and downloading content at airports. Earlier this year AT&T announced it would give its customers access to Bookful which creates augmented reality experiences around books to try to improve reading comprehension. Christopher said viewing a street map through a phone is reliable and seamless in 5G more easily allowing for activity like an augmented reality guide to a city whereas it would have consistently lagged with 4G.

Verizon is currently running a number of 5G-related TV ad spots including those with ""Saturday Night Live"" star Kate McKinnon about a promotion to receive $800 for a 5G phone when consumers trade in their old device.

Verizon has also done some marketing around what its 5G will do for gaming both in its Super Bowl spot earlier this year and a digital video released in May that tried to illustrate what video game-like lag would look like in everyday life

But the Verizon campaigns don't yet show why 5G is necessary or important for average consumers.

In one recent Verizon ad viewers see a series of images — a man climbing a cell tower a thunderstorm cars driving on the street landscape shots of cities — with voiced-over statements about ""next generation service"" ""broader spectrum"" and ""the more going the extra mile matters."" But the only clear consumer use case shown in the one-minute commercial is video chatting — an activity that doesn't require 5G.

It's possible 5G advertising could backfire on both companies if consumers view networks as interchangeable and simply choose the lowest-price offering — which will be T-Mobile Moffett said.

Christopher points out that educating consumers about 5G will benefit the entire industry. ""We're not going to spend our resources talking about the other guy"" he said. ""Everything educates the customer about the broad benefits of 5G as a category and that's a good thing too. We're happy with that.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi8AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvcmFkaW8vZGF5Ni9nYW1pbmctd29ya2Vycy1maWdodC1mb3ItY2hhbmdlLXZvdGluZy1yaWdodHMtYWN0LXVuZGVyLWF0dGFjay1saWZlLWluLXRoZS1xdWlldC16b25lLWFuZC1tb3JlLTEuNjEzMTUzOS93ZXN0LXZpcmdpbmlhLXMtcXVpZXQtem9uZS1oYXMtbm8tY2VsbC1zZXJ2aWNlLWJ1dC1kb24tdC1leHBlY3QtdG8tZnVsbHktZGlzY29ubmVjdC1zYXlzLWF1dGhvci0xLjYxMzE1NDbSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjEzMTU0Ng?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Virginia's 'Quiet Zone' has no cell service — but don't expect to fully disconnect says author,"West Virginia's 'Quiet Zone' has no cell service — but don't expect to fully disconnect says author

Day 6 10:44 West Virginia's 'Quiet Zone' has no cell service — but don't expect to fully disconnect says author

Stephen Kurczy doesn't have a cell phone and he doesn't want one.

""It started out as just kind of like a choice and then it became more of a refusal"" the author told Day 6 guest host Eli Glasner.

It was that refusal that drew him to Green Bank W.Va. better known as one of the ""quietest"" places in America.

The region is home to the Green Bank Observatory and its eight telescopes including the world's largest steerable radio telescope where researchers listen for radio wavelengths deep in space.

Surrounding it is the National Radio Quiet Zone where cell phone service is non-existent and technology that broadcasts radio frequencies is strictly limited in an effort to reduce interference with the observatory's sensitive equipment.

Even digital cameras are banned in the immediate vicinity of the telescopes.

A warning sign is seen near the entrance to a field of telescopes at The Green Bank Observatory. Gasoline-powered vehicles and even digital cameras are prohibited in areas of the observatory due to the possibility of radio interference. (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images)

""What first brought me there was this idea of maybe I'm going to find people who share my aversion to smartphones"" Kurczy said.

""Maybe this is the last place in America or maybe even the world where I kind of still fit in.""

Kurczy spent about four months living in Green Bank — speaking with locals officials and those who came to Green Bank seeking respite from the modern world — and documented the experience in his new book The Quiet Zone.

Wi-Fi creeps in

While keeping Green Bank quiet is a community effort one man is tasked with the job of keeping tabs on interference around the neighbourhood.

The observatory employs a quiet zone monitor who drives the rural community in search of radio signals. During his time in Green Bank Kurczy went on a ride along with the current monitor a man named Chuck.

In the past the monitors would knock on doors and work with residents to eliminate the signals.

Chuck Niday an radio frequency technician monitors equipment as he looks for telecommunication signals and violators. (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images)

But in an age of Wi-Fi the prospect of totally eliminating noise seems impossible. Kurczy says that wireless internet is a feature in many of the homes around the area — even if some residents don't want to admit it.

""They've come to be almost like participants in this story of the quietest place in America"" Kurczy said adding that the local church's minister said he didn't have wireless internet at home only to later admit he did.

""So a minister a man of God in the Green Bank area even he was playing into this facade and willing to lie to me.""

Facing budget cuts Kurczy says enforcement has been scaled back. Meanwhile Wi-Fi signals have more than doubled in recent years.

The problem isn't limited to smartphones and computers however. Today many different kinds of devices — including appliances like fridges and tools — now emit radio signals via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

""When we first did a drive around I think we found something like 100 signals in a couple mile radius ... of the telescopes. After about three years [Chuck] told me that he was now finding about 300 signals within that radius"" he told Glasner.

'They're changing the area'

Even as technology catches up to Green Bank the region has been flooded by individuals who claim they have a sensitivity to the electromagnetic frequencies that are ubiquitous in modern life.

""These people are absolutely convinced that they are physically harmed to the point of pain and even death by all kinds of modern technology — cell phone signals smart phone radiation the microwave in your kitchen"" Kurczy said.

The diagnosis of electromagnetic sensitivity is contested by scientists and according to the World Health Organization there is no scientific basis to link electromagnetic frequency (EMF) exposure to any symptoms an individual is experiencing.

Kurczy says that people experiencing symptoms they attribute to EMF have uprooted their lives for Green Bank changing the makeup of the region.

""I met people from Turkey heard of people from Japan and Europe ... as well as from around the United States coming to Green Bank because they're looking to get away from that pain"" he said.

While there is no cell phone service in Green Bank Wi-Fi access is becoming more common. (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images)

As of 2019 Green Bank has a population of fewer than 200 residents — a number that has fluctuated over the past decade — and not all residents are happy with the changes that have come from an influx of neighbours.

""When you have hundreds of people with this electromagnetic hypersensitivity coming in they're asking for the area to remain really quiet"" Kurczy explained.

""They've asked churches to turn off the lights local stores to turn off the lights the library to turn off its lights and for other neighbours to turn off their Wi-Fi.

""They're changing the area.""

The holding company for Rockstar Games 2K and Private Division already has three remakes upgrades or remasters set for release next year but apparently there are three more yet to be announced.

Earlier this year rumors swirled surrounding a remake of Grand Theft Auto 3 as well as its spinoffs Vice City and San Andreas. Those rumors remain unsubstantiated and unconfirmed. Nonetheless they would fit Take-Two's remaster strategy which relies on full remakes of older titles and slight updates to newer ones. Last year's Mafia: Definitive Edition is a great example of that in action. They might also fit in with the recent legal actions Take-Two shot out around Grand Theft Auto 3 mods.

Rockstar Games will release Grand Theft Auto V: Expanded and Enhanced for the latest generation of game consoles as well as the standalone version of Grand Theft Auto Online on November 11th. Kerbal Space Program from Private Division will also be released for current-gen consoles this year.

Take-Two has had a very aggressive release schedule in the past few years and has announced plans to release 62 games by 2024. (Follow the link for our guesses on what they are.) They also plan to announce a new franchise ""very soon"" which some say is going to be the leaked Marvel X-Com game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtaW5nYm9sdC5jb20vdGFrZS10d28taW50ZXJhY3RpdmUtaGFzLXRocmVlLXBvcnRzLXJlbWFzdGVycy1jb21pbmctYmVmb3JlLWFwcmlsLTIwMjLSAWJodHRwczovL2dhbWluZ2JvbHQuY29tL3Rha2UtdHdvLWludGVyYWN0aXZlLWhhcy10aHJlZS1wb3J0cy1yZW1hc3RlcnMtY29taW5nLWJlZm9yZS1hcHJpbC0yMDIyL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take-Two Interactive Has Three Ports/Remasters Coming Before April 2022,"It seems like Take-Two Interactive has a lot of irons in the fire right now.

This is in addition to three that have already been announced- Grand Theft Auto 5 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S GTA Online’s standalone launch and Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition.

It’s interesting to speculate on what these three games could be.

VIEW GALLERY - 3 IMAGES

Based on comments on Take-Two's earnings reports it looks like GTA 3 remastered may not be one of the upcoming games planned for the FY2022 period. There's two reasons for this: The first is the recent announcement of game delays and the second revolves around Take-Two's expected earnings from Rockstar Games.

Popular Now: Scientists use supercomputer to find out when humanity will perish

First let's tackle the delays. In the Q1'22 call company CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed Take-Two will has delayed two ""sub-core"" games:

""As we continue to develop our pipeline there's been movement in some of our planned releases including two of our more sub-core titles shifting to later in fiscal 2022 than our prior guidance had contemplated.""

Take-Two plans to release 21 games in FY22:

The terminology is interesting. Sub-core could refer to mobile games but it could also describe two of the three unannounced remasters. Also remember that ports are part of this re-release category too. Here's how Take-Two defines this category:

""New iterations of prior releases: This includes ports and remastered titles. Sequels would not fall into this category.""

Could two of the three re-releases have been delayed? Possibly.

Now let's take a look at Take-Two's expected earnings from Rockstar.

The publisher hasn't changed its earnings split from last year. The FY22 label revenue breakdown is 55% 2K 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division/Playdots/Social Point/mobile. This is the same revenue split expectations from FY21.

""Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year...We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and Social Point"" Take-Two CFO Lainie Goldstein said in a Q1'21 earnings call.

""Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal-year expectation. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and Q2 mobile games"" Goldstein said in a Q1'22 earnings call.

Take-Two doesn't expect Rockstar's split to change in FY22 despite releasing two new Grand Theft Auto products; the next-gen versions of GTA V on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X as well as the standalone version of Grand Theft Auto Online.

Grand Theft Auto has generated $6.4 billion in revenues since GTA V released in September 2013.

If GTA 3 were coming in FY22 Rockstar would be releasing three new Grand Theft Auto products in the same year. This should bump up expectations a bit.

It's also worth noting that 2K will release four games in FY22 including NBA 2K22 WWE 2K22 Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and another unannounced franchise.

Rockstar did tease some ""surprise announcements"" for GTA III's 20th anniversary including some things for GTA Online players. Maybe Liberty City is coming to GTA Online?

Still though there's good reason to believe we're probably not getting GTA 3 remastered this year. I hope I'm wrong.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvdGFrZS10d28taGFzLXRocmVlLXVuYW5ub3VuY2VkLXJlbWFzdGVyLW9yLXJlbWFrZXMtaW4tZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Take-Two has three ""unannounced"" remasters or remakes in development","GTA 5 parent company Take-Two Interactive has confirmed it has three ""unannounced"" remasters or remakes underway.

The news came courtesy of Take-Two's recent Q1 2022 earnings call (thanks Resetera). Nestled at the bottom of a slide called ""Pipeline Details (as of 18th May 2021)"" the company said it had six ""new iterations of previously released titles"" in development.

Three were specified and already public knowledge - Grand Theft Auto 5: Expanded and Enhanced and Kerbal Space Program for current-gen systems plus a standalone version GTA 5's fan-favourite Grand Theft Auto Online - but three remain unknown.

So: what could they be? Without a hint at what child companies are involved - Rockstar for instance would be working on a very different project than say Gearbox - fans are speculating that it could be a Red Dead Redemption 2 enhanced version bringing the sequel to current-gen systems just like GTA 5 or perhaps a remake of one of my all-time favourite franchises BioShock; it's already been half a decade since the company released BioShock: The Collection.

Alternatively it could be Mafia-related (finally) something to do with Bully or even a remake or remaster of the original Red Dead game. It's also worth remembering we recently celebrated Max Payne's 20th anniversary too. Other speculate it may have something to do with Take-Two recently targeting GTA 3 modders.

ICYMI Take-Two says it'll be announcing an ""exciting new franchise"" later this month with a release planned before the end of the current fiscal year in March 2022.

As Matt told us at the time Mafia 3 studio Hangar 13 is said to be working on a title described as ""Cthulhu meets Saints Row"" while XCOM developer Firaxis is reportedly creating a Marvel-themed turn-based strategy game. And while Take-Two offered no hint as to the nature of its ""new franchise"" in its earnings call this month's Gamescom digital event seems a likely candidate for a full reveal."

Target has announced that it will begin paying the college tuition and textbook expenses for its US-based part-time and full-time employees who attend select schools.

The retail giant is following the lead of other large US companies offering more benefits to attract and retain talent in a tight job market.

Starting as early as their first day on the job more than 340000 employees at Target stores and distribution centers will now be able to choose from 250 programs at over 40 schools and universities across the country and they won’t have to pay a dollar Target said in a news release.

“A significant number of our hourly team members build their careers at Target and we know many would like to pursue additional education opportunities” Melissa Kremer chief human resources officer at Target said in a statement. “We don’t want the cost to be a barrier for anyone and that’s where Target can step in to make education accessible for everyone.”

Target said it will also pay up to $10000 a year for master’s programs within its available network of schools which include the University of Arizona Oregon State University and historically Black colleges and universities like Morehouse College and Paul Quinn.

Along with associates and undergraduate degrees employees will also have access to numerous certificates and boot camp programs according to the release.

Target is partnering with education platform Guild Education and investing $200 million within the next four years to make it all possible the release said.

The move comes as retailers around the country face challenges hiring workers to staff stores and warehouses.

Last week Walmart America’s largest retailer announced it will pay for full college tuition and book costs at some schools for its US workers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpYi5nb3YuaW4vUHJlc3NSZWxlYXNlUGFnZS5hc3B4P1BSSUQ9MTc0MzU5MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Press Information Bureau,"Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment

In addition to Kunduz the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Sar-e-Pul and were on the verge of completing the takeover of Taloqan the capital of nearby Takhar province. The insurgents already seized two of Afghanistan’s 34 provincial capitals on Friday and Saturday and Sunday were battling government forces on the outskirts of major urban centers Herat and Kandahar.

The Taliban who swept through the country’s rural areas earlier this summer have managed to make these dramatic gains even as the U.S. continues airstrikes in support of the Afghan government from bases in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere. Those airstrikes however are due to end Aug. 31 in accordance with President Biden’s decision to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan.

The U.S. has already pulled out all combat forces except for a few hundred troops protecting the U.S. Embassy and other American installations in Kabul. Washington has also withdrawn the contractors on whom the Afghan military relied to service its own warplanes and military helicopters. That has essentially deprived Kabul of the ability to provide air support to its troops who because of Taliban control of the countryside usually can’t be supplied by road.

Kunduz the largest city in northeastern Afghanistan with nearly 300000 residents has for years been a key target of the Taliban. The insurgents briefly seized it twice before in 2015 and 2016 but were quickly pushed out by the Afghan military and U.S. Special Forces. An errant U.S. airstrike during the fighting in 2015 hit a trauma hospital operated by Doctors Without Borders killing 42 people.

Besieged by the Taliban since June Kunduz fell on Sunday morning after two nights of heavy fighting. Local residents reached by phone said that government forces fled to the fortified airport outside the city and that hundreds of Taliban fighters were in pursuit.

Faisal Noori head of the Kunduz-based Shabnam radio station said that the Taliban have taken over all government installations and freed detainees from the city’s prison on Sunday. The Kunduz headquarters of Afghanistan’s government intelligence agency was hit by an airstrike shortly after it was seized by the Taliban he added.

“Shops are burning in the city including in the money-changers market. The whole city has fallen. There is now no electricity or water. It’s an emergency situation"" said Zabihullah Majidi head of the Kunduz government’s media center who has remained in the city. Many residents are trying to flee the city but are unable to because of the fighting another resident said.

The Taliban on Sunday also seized the northern city of Sar-e-Pul isolated for weeks by Taliban fighters who had taken all of the surrounding districts. Government officials retreated to an army base outside the city after fighters seized administrative buildings.

Reached by phone Massoud an employee of the Sar-e-Pul university said the Taliban fighters knocked on doors on his street asking residents for water and food as they were looking for remaining security personnel.

“I never believed the city would collapse to the Taliban. But it happened in one night. It’s like seeing our nightmares turn into reality"" he said cutting the conversation short because a rocket hit a neighboring house.

On Saturday the Taliban captured the city of Sheberghan capital of the Jowzjan province and the traditional stronghold of ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum one of the country’s main anti-Taliban leaders who served as Afghanistan’s vice president until last year. Images released on social media showed an insurgent mockingly wearing the gold-laced military uniform of Mr. Dostum who holds the country’s highest military rank of marshal.

On Friday the insurgents captured Zaranj capital of the sparsely populated Nimroz province in southwestern Afghanistan.

Mr. Dostum who spent most of this summer in Turkey receiving medical treatment on Saturday met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to discuss a plan to retake the city and asked to declare a state of emergency throughout the country according to his aide Ehsan Nero.

While many parts of Afghanistan fell to the Taliban without a fight with government forces surrendering their equipment in deals negotiated via tribal elders the Taliban have also begun executing former government officials and other perceived enemies in areas where they solidified their control according to residents and human-rights groups.

The U.S. Embassy advised American citizens on Saturday to leave the country on the earliest available commercial flight adding that the embassy would offer loans to citizens who couldn’t afford a ticket. It warned that because of reduced embassy staffing and security concerns the embassy’s ability to assist U.S. citizens in Afghanistan “is extremely limited even within Kabul.""

The target has aligned with a Business Ambition for 1.5 C campaign led by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) a Science-Based Targets initiative. The initiative is an ambitious collaboration between CDP the United Nations Global Compact World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

The company recently launched its first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report based on TCFD recommendations and guidance. The company has pledged to set the climate targets in line with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. (Business Ambition for 1.5 C campaign- SBTi).

On committing to Business Ambition for the 1.5°C Campaign Arun Misra CEO Hindustan Zinc adds “Sustainability has always been the most prominent vision of Hindustan Zinc. The consequences occurring globally due to climatic change demonstrate that our Earth is very vulnerable to global warming. It’s time that we should do our part to control and limit the global temperature rise.”

“1.5°C is #OurOnlyFuture and being a responsible corporation we have set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. We have committed to the ‘Business Ambition for 1.5°C’ campaign to set a net-zero target in line with a 1.5°C future. which is led by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). I believe that we can yet build a better safer and greener future and this commitment will rightly help us to achieve that.” he added.

Earlier this year Hindustan Zinc was awarded the Most Sustainable Company in the Mining Industry by World Finance at their Sustainability Awards 2021 the company said.

As a COP26 Business Leader the company has always been actively initiating towards tackling the repercussions of climate change. The company is also among the only two mining companies globally and among only four Indian companies to be a part of the coveted CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) ‘A List’ 2020 the company said.

Hindustan Zinc has set Sustainability Development Goals 2025 for themselves where the company is aiming towards 0.5 mn tCO2e GHG emission savings in their operations from the base year 2017 as part of their climate risk mitigation efforts the company added.

Tesla remains a poster child for headline-grabbing innovations. The company started delivering its fully redesigned luxury Model S sedan in June. The highest-performing model in that product line the Model S Plaid can go from zero to 60 mph (96.6 kph) in just 1.99 seconds which Tesla says is the fastest for a consumer vehicle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMS8wOC8wNy90ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zLXVsdGltYXRlLW9mZi1yb2FkLW1hY2hpbmUtbWFkLW1heC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model 3 becomes ultimate off-road machine ready for Mad Max,"A salvaged Tesla Model 3 was modified by a bunch of tinkerers to become the ultimate off-road machine ready for Mad Max or the zombie apocalypse.

A handful of maniacs at Grind Hard Plumbing Co. decided to build an electric off-road vehicle using a Tesla Model 3 which certainly shouldn’t be your first choice of vehicle for such a project.

We have seen previous efforts to modify the Model 3 for off-roading but it’s nothing like what these guys have done.

They enlisted the help of Rich Rebuild known for putting salvage Tesla vehicles back into driving conditions or using them in insane projects.

Last year we reported on him and his crew building a crazy Tesla Cyberquad electric ATV.

Rich found a salvaged Model 3 Dual Motors that got into an accident and got the parts needed to get it back into shape.

Then the Grind Hard Plumbing Co. team got hard at work modifying the suspension and wheels to raise the electric vehicle and allow for more travel.

The team also went to work building a custom tube bumper that they welded to the chassis of the Model 3.

As a centerpiece of that new bumper they installed a 12000-lb Badland Apex winch.

They also cut out part of the hood to reveal the hexagonal holes that make the Tesla hood bumpier for safety.

After adding some lights behind it it looks very cool at night:

They completed the build with some very powerful LED lights that they were able to connect to the turn signals.

After blacking out the parts behind the lights it looks really sleek:

After they were satisfied with the build they took the off-road-ready Model 3 out for a first drive.

Here’s the video:

They were impressed by the torque and responsiveness of the electric dual-motor powertrain off-road.

Apparently it’s only the beginning for this new off-road Tesla Model 3 since the team plans to add “a full roll cage spare tire rack and roof tent to make the ultimate off-road Tesla.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzgvOC8yMjYxNTUzOS90ZXNsYS1jeWJlcnRydWNrLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tZGVsYXllZC0yMDIyLWVsb24tbXVza9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Cybertruck production delayed to 2022,"Production on Tesla’s Cybertruck the automaker’s first electric pickup truck has been delayed until 2022 according to its order page on the company’s website. First reported by Electrek under the “due today” section of the Cybertruck’s order page it now reads “you will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022.” This appears to apply to the single- dual- and tri-motor versions of the vehicle.

The configuration page for Tesla’s Cybertruck as of August 8th 2021.

The delay isn’t a huge surprise to those who have been following Cybertruck news closely. When Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled it in 2019 the plan called for the first Cybertrucks to roll off the assembly line in late 2021. In January during Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings call Musk said there would be a “few deliveries of the Cybertruck toward the end of this year but I expect volume production to be in 2022.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMS8wOC8wNy90ZXNsYS1jb25maXJtcy1jeWJlcnRydWNrLWVsZWN0cmljLXBpY2t1cC1kZWxheS0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla finally confirms Cybertruck electric pickup is delayed to 2022,"Tesla has now finally confirmed that the Cybertruck electric pickup truck is delayed to 2022 after months of hinting at the possible delay in reaching production.

When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019 Tesla said that the electric pickup truck would make it to market by the end of 2021.

Over the last year with the timeline coming closer there have been signs that the Cybertruck could be delayed.

First off Tesla only recently completed the engineering design of the electric pickup truck.

CEO Elon Musk also warned that Tesla is going to have some challenges in bringing the Cybertruck to production due to features like the steel exoskeleton body that requires completely new manufacturing processes.

Despite those concerns and the “end of 2021” timeline coming closer Tesla appeared reticent in confirming that Cybertruck production has been delayed.

During the release of its Q2 2021 financial results last month Tesla kept the same timeline and only specified that Cybertruck production would start at Gigafactory Texas after Model Y:

“We are also making progress on the industrialization of Cybertruck which is currently planned for Austin production subsequent to Model Y.“

Model Y production is supposed to start at Gigafactory Texas by the end of the year so it doesn’t eliminate the possibility that Cybertruck production could start this year but it made the timeline unlikely.

However a few weeks later Tesla has confirmed that the Cybertruck has been delayed to 2022.

On the order page Tesla updated the footnotes to confirm that the configurator will be available when “production nears in 2022”:

The note is the same for all three variants of the Cybertruck despite Tesla previously saying that the two higher-end variants Dual Motor and Tri-Motor will come first.

Tesla has no other mention of a timeline for the Cybertruck on its website.

There’s currently a race to bring the first electric pickup to market in the US. Tesla was never seen as the most likely contender to be first to market but this delay won’t help either.

However it’s not the only one experiencing delays.

Rivian recently delayed the production of its R1T electric pickup truck from July to September.

Lordstown is also having issues bringing its electric pickup to market. GM is expected to deliver the Hummer EV in the US by the end of the year and Ford is launching the F150 Lighting next year.

While the Cybertruck delay was expected it will disappoint many as Tesla has reportedly accumulated over 1 million reservations for the Cybertruck."

Bahnsen

The Advanced Diagnostics Laboratory (ADL) is a visionary space designed to continue Mayo Clinic’s long tradition of pioneering patient treatments and diagnostics. The ADL’s mission is to foster innovation — including grassroots innovation — across different specialties through partnerships in-house as well as with external companies. Located on the third floor of One Discovery Square in a 9600-square-foot space the lab was born out of an initiative between Mayo’s Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology (DLMP) and the Center for Individualized Medicine (CIM).

“New disruptive technologies and industry collaborations are keys to our success in innovation” says Kathy Bates senior director of Laboratory Services and Partnership Development in DLMP and administrator of the ADL. “This space has room and resources for evaluating technology quickly enabling us early access to technology and the opportunity to test it with the potential to influence the final product. These resources allow us to strike more business agreements and co-development relationships move quickly and bring more capabilities to the collaboration.”

Co-development agreements have already been struck with for example Numares a German-based company that is leveraging nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology using AI to quantify “metabolite constellations” and thus help patients with undiagnosed diseases or conditions; Breath Diagnostics a medical device company in Kentucky that is developing a test to detect lung cancer using patients’ exhaled breath; and more recently Thermo Fisher Scientific.

“Thermo Fisher is a very innovative large diagnostic company that DLMP has worked with for a number of years” says Bates. “The challenges of the COVID pandemic really strengthened our relationship. So we recently executed an updated agreement with Thermo Fisher to focus on innovation and develop novel tests on three of their technology platforms — next-generation sequencing (NGS) mass spectrometry and allergy and autoimmunity diagnostic tools.”

The collaboration is part of Mayo Clinic’s movement towards “precision medicine” and is aimed at advancing such diagnostics in a clinically relevant globally accessible manner.

Benjamin Kipp Ph.D. is director of the ADL. “I think a lot of these companies have really cool projects but we have to push the boundaries we have to know where they fail and we have to know where they work so that we can implement them for our patients” he says.

Flexibility fuels innovation

Designed as a “flexible” space the ADL moves beyond a traditional lab model: it can be quickly modified to meet each project’s needs. It’s also a think tank a fulcrum for new ideas — which is why its office area features entire walls of whiteboard to help capture ideas and cultivate discussion. The larger environment of One Discovery Square is a vibrant collaborative atmosphere that encourages various companies educators and researchers to cross-pollinate ideas and innovation in diagnostic and biomedical technologies.

“We needed to create an environment that was more of a ‘sandbox’ if you will — something that has more flexibility which used to live within the clinical labs but really does not anymore” says William Morice II M.D. Ph.D. chair of DLMP and president of Mayo Clinic Laboratories. “The ADL is really an attempt to try and bring these innovative technologies and some of these resources into an environment that’s more flexible so we can adapt to what the clinicians are asking of us.”

When the pandemic emerged last year the lab’s nimble design allowed its staff of multidisciplinary experts to pivot their efforts to the crisis.

Hatsopoulos who was born Jan 7 1927 in Athens passed away on September 20 2018 after a lifetime of solving problems that had stumped other researchers for decades — and in the meantime solving some problems that no one had most likely ever even thought of before.

“Being an entrepreneur is a bug” he explained once to interviewers in an effort to explain the extraordinary motivation that governed his life. “It’s an affliction I always had throughout my life.”

But he didn’t have just the scintillating mind of a genius — his natural warmth and wisdom was beloved by generations of MIT students as well making Hatsopoulos fondly remembered for his decades of teaching and mentoring students and colleagues.

The Greek native who earned his PhD in 1949 was perhaps best known as an expert in the area of thermodynamics an inventor and the founder of Thermo Electron Corporation (now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation).

George Hatsopoulos: A brilliant businessman scientist and philosopher

At the event hosted by MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering in January of 2020 Hatsopoulos’ former colleagues friends and family reflected on how much he meant to others as an educator economist mentor role model advisor co-worker and as his colleagues stated “his most cherished roles as husband and father.”

After writing his doctoral thesis entitled “The Thermo-electron Engine” Hatsopoulos went on to co-found the Thermo Electron Corporation in 1956; it became a global leader in analytical and monitoring instruments under his leadership.

“It was fun”

But he returned to the halls of academia because as he himself explained simply it was “fun” and he remained a lecturer at the revered institution until 1990.

Nicho Hatsopoulos the inventor’s son spoke at the commemoration saying “He was a businessman at heart who thought like a scientist and philosopher.”

His family life was everything to the brilliant entrepreneur whose daughter Marina earned her master’s degree from MIT in 1993. Hatsopoulos’ wife Daphne was described as his “best friend and closest confidant” throughout all the years of their long marriage.

Walter Bornhorst who was not only a colleague of Hatsopoulos but his son-in-law as well recalled the man who came to loom so large in his life.

“George was my mentor” he stated. “He shaped every aspect of my life he taught me engineering he taught me how to think he taught me business and how to make money” he explained. “But most importantly he provided me with my wife Marina the love of my life.”

As part of the event the first-ever recipients of the George N. Hatsopoulos Faculty Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Research and the George N. Hatsopoulos Fellowship for graduate students spoke about how their research carries his legacy on into the future.

Graduate student Dionysios Sema who himself is a native of the professor’s beloved Greece and the first recipient of the George N. Hatsopoulos Fellowship for Graduate Students shared his work on advancing state-of-the-art predictive simulations of materials in extreme environments.

A life of stunning achievement

In an extraordinary video shown at the commemoration of his life which shows what humans can achieve despite extreme privation Hatsopoulos explains his origins and how his motivation took him from scurrying around piles of rubble in war-torn Athens in 1944 to the ivy-covered campus of MIT.

Hatsopoulos recalled that he basically spent the four years of the Nazi occupation of Greece “in the library in Athens reading about Thomas Edison” — of all people and subjects to be learning about at that particular time.

“I might be the next Thomas Edison”

The budding engineer had a purpose however and it was linked to how his native brilliance had been noticed by his family members at a very young age. Hatsopoulos had only wanted he said to find out “Who is this guy Thomas Edison that my uncles were saying that I ‘might be the next Thomas Edison'”?

“You have to understand that in Greece in 1942 there was tremendous hunger” he explained as he tried to portray the desperation of those times. “There were people dead in the streets from hunger. There was also a lot of activity against the Nazis.

“I decided to do something that was very clearly punishable by death. There was a tremendous demand to hear news from the outside world. So I came up with the idea of building a shortwave radio to hear the BBC.

“The Germans were upstairs”

Hatsopoulos recounted that he would find the necessary vacuum tubes in junk piles and piles of rubble around the city and bring them back to his laboratory to work on them. “The Germans were upstairs” he adds as he gestures upward. “And that was my first enterprise. It was very dangerous — but it was very successful.

“You see you shouldn’t lose sight of your purpose” he admonished his listeners. “What is your purpose?

“I wanted to build a company that was at least as good as the company that Thomas Edison created.”

He had only he said to choose which country in which to fulfill his dream and where to write his all-important doctoral thesis. And just as importantly where to do the groundwork to prepare for the creation of his company which would be built on his own inventions.

Hatsopoulos then came up with the concept of converting heat into electricity by boiling off electrons. “For the first time” he adds proudly “MIT used its own money to support my thesis” and the revered Massachusetts institution therefore should be considered as the “co-founder of Thermo Electron.”

MIT he added “believed in serving society by finding ways to solve problems.”

Creation of artificial heart

One of the burning problems in American and Western society as a whole at the time — as it still is today — is heart disease. So of course Hatsopoulos directed his energies in that direction determining next to create an artificial heart. “By the time I retired” he recalled “we had built 23 very successful companies.”

But the entrepreneur also devoted his life to teaching students — something that many questioned at the time since he was also working so hard in his own companies. “But I like teaching I really mean that” he said.

“Focus on enjoying the ride”

“They paid me to teach at MIT but every year I would donate that pay back to MIT. You learn a subject more by teaching it than by anything else — especially” he added “if you teach students that ask the most unheard-of questions that floor you. I didn’t do it because it was useful — I did it because it was fun” he emphasized.

“That’s my goal — 80% fun” Hatsopoulos adds. “And I’ve achieved it over time many times.”

“It’s useful to set a certain direction you want to go.” However he says “After you set that direction don’t focus on that goal — focus on enjoying the ride.”",,,,,,,,,

Avail views itself as a tech platform facilitating car owners who are flying out of state to link up with incoming travelers who want to borrow a set of wheels. The airport however considered Avail a car rental company and wanted to charge it the same 10% of gross revenues fee it charges other off-site rental companies. When Avail declined to sign such a contract the airport required its partnering parking lot the Parking Spot to stop working with the company in late May.

“This is the first time we’ve had a conflict like this in any airport we’ve pursued” said Avail CEO Mike Osborn.

The move forced several abrupt canceled reservations during the busy Memorial Day travel season. But Avail resumed operations Thursday after agreeing to pay the airport its 10% fee.

“All’s well that ends well” Osborn said adding it took only two brief meetings with airport officials to reach a deal. “We had great engagement that quickly showed we had the types of interests that aligned with their interests.”

The company will continue to partnering with the Parking Spot to store cars and with Allstate to provide insurance for vehicles that get rented.

In a brief statement an airport spokesperson called its “unique” agreement a win-win for the airport and Avail as well as car rental companies and travelers who want more choices.

“The SLC Airport embraces innovative business models that ensure fair competition at the airport” the statement said. “... In essence the agreement mirrors the off-airport car rental agreement which provides a level playing field for all parties involved.”

Osborn had previously speculated that the airport was trying to shut down Avail because of the powerful car rental lobby which provides a substantial amount of airports’ revenue.

“They’re in a difficult position” Osborn said of the airport’s operators “because they have a lot of stakeholders they need to keep satisfied.”

An Avail customer loaning out a car stands to make some spare cash if a traveler opts to rent it. But even if the vehicle sits unused the owner still gets perks like a free place to park near the airport as well as complimentary cleaning and sanitization of the car. Those renting the vehicles have perks like lower rates and included liability insurance.

Despite turbulence at Salt Lake City new airport over the past few months Avail reports about 45 cars are available for booking.

Josh Odom who splits his time between Park City and San Antonio owns one of those cars. He said he averaged around $100 a week loaning out his Nissan Pathfinder using Avail.

“We got an email notice pretty abruptly in May right before Memorial Day weekend telling us they canceled future reservations” Odom said. “The car sat idle and dormant which is crazy with the shortage in rental cars. I’d rather someone get use and value out of the car.”

Odom said he and his family opted to take a ride-hailing Uber to and from the airport in the meantime.

More than losing out on the extra cash Odom said he mostly felt sorry for Avail’s idle employees.

“We had the car in the system for seven months and hadn’t had any issues with how people take care of it” he said. “It’s been a good experience. I’ve had several friends who have checked their vehicles in and had equally great [feedback].”

An Avail spokesperson said the company was able to reassign its Salt Lake City workers during the shutdown.

Avail also operates at airports in Atlanta; Baltimore-Washington; Chicago; Dallas; Denver; Houston; Los Angeles; Miami; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Austin Texas; Charlotte N.C.; and Nashville Tenn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy53cmFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9iZW5qYW1pbi1ub3Zhay1taWNoYWVsLWdyeW5iYXVtLWNvbnNlcnZhdGl2ZS1mZWxsb3ctdHJhdmVsZXJzLXR1Y2tlci1jYXJsc29uLWRyb3BzLWluLW9uLXZpa3Rvci1vcmJhbi8xOTgxNjgzNS_SASJodHRwczovL3d3dy53cmFsLmNvbS9hbXAvMTk4MTY4MzUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BENJAMIN NOVAK & MICHAEL GRYNBAUM: Conservative fellow travelers - Tucker Carlson drops in on Viktor Orban,"EDITOR'S NOTE: Benjamin Novak is a repoter focusing on Hungry for The New York Times. Michael M. Grynbaum is a Times media correspondent covering the intersection of business culture and politics.

BUDAPEST — It’s been a meeting of conservative fellow travelers: a jovial host — who heads an authoritarian government bent on targeting liberal institutions including universities the judiciary and the media — and his American guest exchanging grins.

In a week in which he broadcast nightly from Budapest the American talk show host Tucker Carlson posed for pictures with and interviewed Hungary’s authoritarian leader Viktor Orban and took a helicopter to inspect a Hungarian border fence designed to keep out migrants.

The visit by Carlson the top-rated host on the Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox News bolsters Orban’s mission to establish Budapest as an ideological center for what he sees as an international conservative movement.

For Carlson the Hungary trip was an opportunity to put Orban whom he admires on the map for his viewers back home a conservative audience that may be open to the sort of illiberalism promoted by the Hungarian leader. On Wednesday’s show Carlson praised Hungary as “the small country with a lot of lessons for the rest of us.”

Carlson’s Fox News program espouses some hard-right views especially on immigration where he and Orban share common ground. The host has held up Hungary’s hard-line policy on rejecting asylum-seekers as a model for an American immigration system that he believes is too lenient and has weakened the power of native-born citizens an argument that Carlson’s critics say overlaps with white supremacist ideology.

A one-time foreign correspondent for American magazines Carlson is also an instinctive television showman with an ear for provocation. His friendly interview with Orban has prompted a raft of think pieces in the English-speaking media that while mostly critical of Carlson have given the Hungarian leader a fresh round of international press coverage.

In the United States Fox News viewers are tuning in: This week’s broadcasts of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” attracted roughly 3 million viewers a night handily beating the competition on CNN and MSNBC.

Carlson’s visit comes at as the populist Orban has become increasingly isolated and is in a precarious position at home and abroad over his government’s backsliding on democracy and his administration’s poor handling of the coronavirus epidemic.

Carlson’s positive outlook on Hungary is not shared by many across the European Union where Orban is often regarded as a far-right strongman who has badly weakened democratic institutions cozied up to Beijing and Moscow and steered public assets into foundations controlled by his allies.

Orban’s party is now being challenged by a six-party opposition coalition in elections scheduled for next year.

In an interview with Carlson that aired Thursday Orban said he expected an effort by the “international left” to oust him next year.

To rally support from his conservative base he has immersed himself in the culture wars that have roiled politics in the United States and in which Carlson has also been an eager participant regularly railing against liberals.

Orban’s party recently adopted a law restricting depictions of homosexuality; critics said it was being used to target the country’s LGBTQ community. And the government-aligned media regularly rails against the destabilizing effect that Western “woke” culture has on traditional society.

By moving billions of dollars worth of cash and assets into quasi-private educational foundations controlled by his allies analysts say Orban is setting up an ideological control center bolstered by paid conservative thinkers from Europe and North America living in Budapest.

Several European and American conservative public intellectuals have already answered Orban’s call.

The American author and journalist Rod Dreher who writes for The American Conservative (Carlson sits on its advisory board) has been in Hungary since April thanks to a paid fellowship at an institute funded by Orban’s government.

He said he had been inspired by the Hungarian leader when he first met him along with a group of visiting conservatives in 2019.

“Here was a leader who was not the thuggish strongman of media caricature but an intelligent man who had obviously thought deeply about political and cultural issues” Dreher said.

Hungary was also a focus for another American conservative Stephen Bannon President Donald Trump’s former adviser who traveled to Europe to work with Orban and other nationalist populist parties ahead of the 2019 elections for the European Parliament. Bannon’s efforts fizzled partly because of the difficulty reconciling competing national priorities among the continent’s different nationalist parties.

Carlson himself has a family connection with the Hungarian leader — his father Richard Carlson is listed as a director of a Washington-based firm that has lobbied for Orban in the United States. In 2019 the firm Policy Impact Strategic Communications disclosed in a lobbying filing that it “coordinated an interview of Minister Szijjarto on the Tucker Carlson show” referring to Péter Szijjártó Hungary’s minister of foreign affairs and trade.

William Nixon the firm’s chairman and chief executive said in an interview that Carlson’s father — a former journalist media executive and American ambassador — was not involved in arranging the interview with the foreign minister and is neither an investor nor an employee of the firm. A filing shows that the firm’s contract with the Hungarian government ended in late 2019.

Nixon said the firm had no role in arranging Carlson’s trip this week to Hungary. Fox News said Carlson’s father “is retired and had nothing to do” with the visit or the meeting with Orban. “Tucker and his team booked the interview and the expenses were covered by Fox News” the network said in a statement.

On Wednesday Carlson rode a military helicopter to Hungary’s southern border with Serbia to inspect the chain link fence Orban’s government erected in 2015 to keep migrants from entering the country. He praised the government’s efforts.

Carlson was also slated to speak at a youth event Saturday hosted by a “talent management” institute on which Orban’s government has lavished billions. And he is filming a documentary about Hungary during his stay there which is slated to air on Fox Nation Fox News’ subscription streaming service.

Even as Orban is increasingly shunned by many European conservatives Carlson has been effusive in his praise depicting the Hungarian leader as a virtuous champion of family values and a model for America.

Since the deadly riot in Washington on Jan. 6 when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol Orban’s appeal has increased among American conservatives who have increasingly found common cause with authoritarian governments said Dalibor Rohac a senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute.

Traditionally he said “the conservative disposition was a distrust of power and imposition of checks and balances. That’s been eroded in Hungary.”

Bradley officials had predicted a quicker comeback in air travel than the broader airline industry which had targeted 2024 but this summer’s strong bookings came as a surprise even to them.

“It’s a positive sign but it’s also caused challenges in the industry” said Kevin Dillon executive director of the Connecticut Airport Authority which oversees operations at Bradley. “Once you park planes it takes a bit of effort to get planes up and flying again. In a lot of cases airlines had to rehire flight crews and are still in that process. Everyone is seeing that. This demand is returning a lot faster.”

Last week ticket counters at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks were busy with vacation travelers who are fueling a surge in air travel nationwide this summer.

Airline troubles — amid a nationwide surge in summer travel — are causing headaches for some travelers. There were thousands of flight cancellations last week alone — Spirit and American Airlines among the hardest hit — leaving flyers stranded at airports across the country and scrambling to book with other airlines.

Ericka Aguilar and her sisters Vanessa and Jessica flew in to Bradley on July 30 from Denver on the low-cost carrier Spirit. They planned to visit a friend in the Navy at Groton for what they thought was going to be a brief weekend excursion. But when they arrived at the gate on the following Monday to fly home they were told a connecting flight from Florida had been canceled.

There wasn’t another flight until three days later and again a connection — this time from Houston — was canceled. Meanwhile the sisters were racking up hundreds of dollars in extra hotel costs and on Thursday they were back at the airport no closer to finding a flight back home.

“I don’t know what we’re going to do” Ericka Aguilar said sitting across from the Spirit counter with her sisters. “The reason we stayed with Spirit is because it was affordable. I know we will pay more with another airline but we are going to pay more if we stay with Spirit and we’re told we can’t go.”

Jessica Aguilar and her sisters were stranded at Bradley International Airport last week after Spirit airlines canceled homebound flights to Denver.

There was a possible flight on Saturday.

“It was going to be a short trip” Aguilar said “but it hasn’t been a short trip.”

Last week Spirit apologized for the widespread disruption in service. The airline blamed the cancellations on “operational challenges” such as weather system outages and staffing shortages “that caused widespread irregularities in our operation and impacted crew scheduling” the airline said in a statement.

The problems were intensified by the peak of the summer travel season with high occupancy among airlines making rebooking difficult Spirit said. The airline said it was shifting its employees to more quickly process vouchers for meals and hotel stays.

Spirit said it predicted that cancellations would continue to drop in the coming days.

Industry experts say the airlines are facing problems on multiple fronts in the face of unexpectedly strong bookings this summer. They include shortage of pilots flight attendants and mechanics — either through layoffs or early retirements during the pandemic — that make it tough to quickly get more planes out of mothballs and into the air.

“I know that most people view flight attendants as like ‘waitress in the sky’ but that is actually not their primary role” said Bryan Del Monte president of the Aviation Agency an air transportation marketing firm. “Their primary role is the safety and security of passengers.”

Del Monte said large numbers of flight attendants didn’t fly during the pandemic and aren’t up-to-date in training.

“So they just aren’t current and able to be in the sky” Del Monte said.

Business travel on hold

At Bradley Dillon the CAA’s executive director said he first started noticing an upturn in travel in March and the passenger count while still well behind pre-pandemic levels of 2019 is catching up.

Since the CAA was formed and took over management of Bradley in 2013 air passengers have increased 24% to 6.7 million in 2019 from 5.4 million. For the first six months of this year there were 1.8 million passengers compared with 3.3 million for the same period in 2019 off 45%.

Passengers using Bradley are watched closely because the long-standing goal has been to reach 10 million a year which would require the construction of a second terminal.

Air travelers at Bradley International Airport last week ride the escalator to the concourse.

In March passenger volumes were down about 54% compared with the same month in 2019. By May the numbers were down 34% on the same basis.

In June the latest numbers available passengers were down 20% to 466311 travelers compared with 582256 for the same month in 2019.

Dillon said he expected July to be off about 10% to 15%.

As with other airports leisure travel is leading the way in passenger counts but for recovery to maintain momentum business travel will need to start picking up in the fall.

Dillon said he is monitoring closely the reopening of offices which many have pegged to September or later in the fall and any longer-term fallout from the surge in the delta variant of the COVID-19 virus.

The surge in summer travel has put Bradley International Airport about six months ahead of where it thought it would be in August as it recovers from a devastating downturn in travel during the pandemic.

Last week insurance giant Travelers Cos. a major employer in the Hartford area said it would delay reopening its offices in downtown Hartford — originally scheduled for mid-September — by at least a month a decision tied to the delta variant.

“It’s going to be very important to get that segment of the airline traveler back into seats” Dillon said. “Business travel is the lifeblood of any airline route.”

Dillon said he expects that the first business travel to return will be companies visiting their clients.

“The big question in my mind is [whether] you will have the intracompany travel return or have companies become used to dealing with Zoom-type platforms for meetings” Dillon said. “That’s one of the biggest questions people are trying to get their arms around.”

Even so Dillon said passenger trends have been favorable enough so that most of the airport restaurants and other retail services have reopened. But like elsewhere the airport has had a tough time recruiting workers Dillon said.

Construction on a $210 million transportation center — part of the 20-year $1.4 billion development plan — continued through the pandemic and is dramatically changing the airport. Scheduled for completion in May of next year the center will be a hub for pickup and drop-off of rental cars avoiding shuttle trips to off-site parking lots.

And Bradley Dillon said is again planning for other capital improvement projects such as streamlining baggage check-in at ticket counters that could tap into federal infrastructure funding being debated in the U.S. Congress.

‘It feels pretty normal’

At the peak of the summer travel season not all travelers at Bradley were hit with disruptions.

Tano Desseno a graduate student at the University of New Haven arrived at Bradley on Thursday after a weeklong trip to Miami to visit a friend ending a dry spell of travel since before the pandemic.

“It felt good honestly” Desseno said. “You can do pretty much what you were able to do before the pandemic with minimum requirements of vaccinations and masks. It feels pretty normal.”

Anthony Olson and his family were waiting to board their flight Thursday bound for Tampa Fla. after spending a week visiting family in Morris with a trip to a beach house in Westerly R.I.

Anthony Olson from Tampa Fla. with his wife Emily and daughters Sloane Laine and Ava traveled to Connecticut to visit family.

“It’s kind of annoying to still have to contend with the virus because it seems like there is no end in sight” Olson said. “But it was great to see family and it’s my feeling that it might get worse before it gets better so this was a good opportunity.”

Olson said his youngest daughter Sloane 2 had never been on a plane. And his older daughters Laine 5 and Ava 7 couldn’t remember flying.

“We haven’t gone anywhere since COVID” Olson’s wife Emily said then pointing down at her daughters. “It’s been a long time being quarantined together.”

BLAINE Wash. — The Canadian border is open to vaccinated American citizens and permanent residents.

However the border is not open everyone as some COVID-19 restrictions remain in place.

When will the Canadian border open to Americans for non-essential travel?

American citizens and permanent residents residing in the United States who have been fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to entering are permitted for non-essential travel.

Travelers have to bring their COVID-19 vaccination card – or a photo of it – and submit it ahead of time through the “ArriveCAN app” or online through the ArriveCAN web portal.

When will the Canadian border reopen to everyone who has been vaccinated?

On Sept. 7 the Canadian government intends to open Canada's borders to any fully-vaccinated traveler who has received an accepted COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days prior to entering the country and who meet specific entry requirements.

The Sept. 7 opening date is subject to change depending on the domestic epidemiologic situation.

Can I visit Canada if I am not fully vaccinated?

Entry to Canada remains prohibited for US travelers and all other foreign nationals who are not fully vaccinated unless they meet an exemption set out in the orders under the Quarantine Act.

Will I have to quarantine?

Fully-vaccinated travelers eligible to enter Canada who meet specific criteria do not have to quarantine upon arrival.

Travelers must provide a quarantine plan and be prepared to isolate – if ordered to.

Will I need a negative COVID-19 test?

People traveling across the border need a negative COVID-19 test result taken within 72 hours of crossing the border. People will be randomly selected to complete a Day 1 COVID-19 molecular test.

Fully-vaccinated travelers do not need a post-arrival COVID-19 test.

When will the US open its borders to Canadians?

Border restrictions for non-essential travel into the states from Canada or Mexico will continue through at least Aug. 21. Only essential travel is allowed."

Any metric you looked at showed that deGrom was the best pitcher in the sport posting numbers that have rarely been matched in MLB history. Pitching with his minuscule 1.08 ERA deGrom was casually pumping in 101 mph fastballs and striking out batter at an outrageous clip for a starting pitcher (14.28 K/9).

Unfortunately it is his body that has let deGrom down as injuries have curtailed what could have been one of the best seasons we have ever seen from a starting pitcher.

DeGrom has endured multiple stints on the Injured List this season for various minor injuries. But the latest one has him shut down every since the All-Star break. The Mets ace continues to deal with inflammation in his pitching arm what has prevented him from taking any steps towards getting back on the mound.",,,,,,

According to news reports several fire departments in the area responded to the call and no injuries were reported.

According to Tyson the decision to evacuate was made after smoke was reported in one part of the plant and operations were interrupted temporarily.

“We evacuated our Cincinnati Ohio facility Friday afternoon due to smoke coming from a piece of equipment” Tyson said. “This was a precautionary measure as the safety of our team members is always our top priority. The issue was fixed immediately and production quickly resumed as normal.”

In Ohio Tyson employs approximately 1300 workers who operate three prepared foods plants and a distribution center in the state.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYXVnLzA4L3N0b3BwaW5nLXRpbWUtcGhvdG9ncmFwaGVyLXNoYXJlcy1xdWlldC1pbWFnZXMtaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stopping Time: Photographer shares 'quiet' images in T2 exhibit | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Photographer Wesley Hitt calls himself an introvert. That's OK -- his work speaks plenty loud enough for him. Since he was 22 years old the prolific Hitt has been making a living doing what he loves to do; photography he says is his hobby as well as his career. He has a diverse roster of clients that includes professional sports organizations like the NFL the NBA and NASCAR; iconic Arkansas institutions and businesses like the University of Arkansas Walmart Tyson Foods J.B. Hunt TheatreSquared and a bevy of Arkansas hospitals; and national organizations and publications like Getty Images Discovery Channel The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Yet the photography exhibit currently at TheatreSquared is the first time his body of work has been on display.

""When all of this all came about I had to sit down and look at my work and think 'Well what do I want to show?'"" says Hitt. ""I wanted to show something that not everybody sees."" He made his choices and when he saw the complete exhibit he noticed a pattern: There were plenty of photos that showed his skill in sports photography and other dynamic situations but he had chosen a lot of ""still"" photos as well. ""I started looking at the pictures that are in the exhibit and I thought 'Holy cow my whole career has been running up and down the sidelines or photographing people in motion and everything that I wanted to show were just these quiet simple moments.' And that's the opposite of what I do for a living. I think when I'm out on my own -- I call it 'seeing' driving around or on vacation -- that's where my mind goes to that 'simple.' It's just so easy for me to look at those kinds of scenes and see it. Pretty pictures I like taking pretty pictures I think.""

Hitt received a camera for a high school graduation present and he was hooked. He attended a photography school in Massachusetts that emphasized business skills for artists.

""I think that helped more than anything"" says Hitt. ""Their philosophy was that 'We can only teach you so much about photography -- you're going to learn by doing. But if we can give you the knowledge about how business works and how to run a business then you can make a career out of it.'""

Hitt's first foray into sports photography was through a friend's passion for motocross.

""I'm definitely an introvert and was very shy back then"" he says. ""It was kind of a way to go along and have something to do at motocross [races]. When I'm taking pictures I kind of hit a zone and I don't think about anything else. And it just kind of took off from there. This will be my 23rd or 24th year as an NFL photographer. I was the Razorback photographer for 10 years Houston through Petrino and so I'm known more for sports. But I've mostly done commercial and advertising work. I started in Little Rock working with ad agencies and people like that.""

Hitt hasn't limited his career to one photographic specialty but instead has found that his skills are ideal for a wide range of assignments.

""I've shot the [Walmart] shareholders meeting for 10 years"" he says. ""I shoot down front and one of the people that works there said they've noticed that I'm really good at capturing moments on stage. That's why they like hiring me. And again that's sports too.""

It's also what makes him good at shooting theater. He's been photographing moments on stage for TheatreSquared for many seasons now.

""Theatre is ephemeral it exists live and for just that moment. Representing it in photos is so challenging"" says Martin Miller T2 Executive Director. ""We are so fortunate to work with a world-class photographer like Wesley Hitt who can capture that moment where light and movement make magic for our audiences.""

""We are so excited to celebrate Wesley's work in The Commons this month"" says T2's Director of Marketing and Communications Joanna Sheehan Bell. ""Wesley brings an ability to almost stop time with his camera. I love that in the exhibition we get to see that skill in the remarkable work he does to capture amazing moments on our stages and also the gorgeous vistas and vignettes he's captured from all over Arkansas.""

Hitt says the exhibit shows off a side of his work that isn’t always seen — “pretty pictures” of quiet scenes taken in Arkansas and around the country.

As usual Chinese eCommerce giant Alibaba made an impressive show posting stronger-than-expected results on Tuesday. It was joined by sportswear maker Under Armour in the pre-market.

The main events that elicited investor interest on Wednesday were the quarterly releases of CVS Health General Motors and streaming platform Roku. Dropbox Virgin Galactic and Beyond Meat unveiled their second-quarter data on Thursday.

The second-quarter earnings release of AMC Entertainment which created a buzz recently after the stock price shot up in a social media-driven buying spree is due on August 9. The financial reports of Tyson Foods and software firm Trade Desk are on tap before the opening bell. The next day Chesapeake Energy Corp. and cybersecurity firm McAfee will be reporting after the market’s close.

Vacation rental company Airbnb and Chinese tech firm Baidu are probably the only other major companies to report earnings in the relatively quiet week.

Why Not a Lab?,"Soaring beef prices  a new E. coli recall and a recent swine fever outbreak have added to a growing pile of evidence that the grossly over-consolidated meat industry is in need of a new model. This piece of our global food supply must be reformed – and thoroughly reimagined – before it becomes any more unreliable or environmentally costly.

While plant-based substitutes have been gaining considerable marketshare over the past year industrial meat and seafood will need a bigger savior than garden patties (or Tunato) that try to mimic the flavor and texture of the real thing. We’ve got one good candidate in lab-grown meat — aka “cultured meat” or “cellular agriculture”— an emerging frontier that has enormous potential to become the foundation of a humane climate-smart future protein supply."

And in some ways the Vikings' first practice in front of fans at the stadium on Saturday felt like normal.

The Skol chant was back in the building for the first time in 19 months. When D.J. Wonnum dropped into coverage and returned his interception of Jake Browning for a touchdown ""Let's Go Crazy"" blared through the speakers.

Even though the league's COVID-19 protocols prevent players from signing autographs for fans this year the spectators who dotted nine sections along the stadium's north sideline could still scream for Justin Jefferson and Adam Thielen who jogged over to toss something to a young fan.

It had traces of normalcy for the Vikings at the end of a week where little else did.

The previous Saturday they'd learned three of their quarterbacks would have to enter quarantine after Kellen Mond tested positive for COVID-19 meaning Jake Browning seemingly the team's only vaccinated QB would throw every pass in a night practice at TCO Stadium in Eagan.

Minutes before co-owner Mark Wilf was scheduled to talk to reporters from the new five-star hotel on the team's campus Tuesday a Dallas County grand jury in Texas indicted 2020 first-round pick Jeff Gladney on a felony family violence charge; the Vikings released him hours later.

Wilf admitted he was ""very concerned"" about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Vikings players who have the league's lowest vaccination rate as of this week. Coach Mike Zimmer offered two pointed critiques of his unvaccinated players in news conferences and said Tuesday on KFAN that quarterback Kirk Cousins ""doesn't believe in"" the league's COVID protocols. Cousins refuted the comment when he returned to practice on Thursday saying he'd been a close contact of Mond's only because the Vikings put their quarterbacks in too small a meeting room.

The public comments have been matched by tense private exchanges as decisionmakers fretted about the possibility unvaccinated stars could miss games and prominent players chafed at being called out in public.

And then on Friday Jefferson walked off the field with his left arm hanging limply by his side having injured his left shoulder while diving for a Cousins throw across the middle. The wide receiver didn't seem in much pain as he jogged lightly across the field at the end of Saturday's practice and Thielen expressed relief the injury hadn't been worse but both Jefferson and Thielen watched Saturday's practice with first-round pick Christian Darrisaw still being held out Dalvin Cook doing little and Anthony Barr absent for the second straight day.

The Vikings have not missed the playoffs in back-to-back seasons under Zimmer and began training camp confident they were set for a rebound after a months-long effort to add defensive experience this offseason. They'll practice against the Broncos twice this week before Saturday's preseason opener and play the Colts at home on Aug. 21. Good showings there could allow them to scoff at perceived skepticism before finishing the preseason in Kansas City.

The Vikings' path back to the postseason though hinges on the following things:

Improvement on the offensive line.

The durability of Cook through a 17-game season after a year when he touched the ball 356 times in 14 games.

A commanding defensive front with five players who weren't playing for the Vikings all or most of last year (Danielle Hunter Michael Pierce Dalvin Tomlinson Sheldon Richardson and Barr) staying healthy and making significant contributions.

Stability in the secondary with Patrick Peterson re-emerging as a top cover corner at age 31; Bashaud Breeland handling the other side after offseason shoulder surgery; Cameron Dantzler and Mackensie Alexander playing major roles; Xavier Woods meshing with five-time Pro Bowler Harrison Smith at safety; and Smith being freed up to make plays all over the field at age 32.

A new kicker — be it Greg Joseph Riley Patterson or someone else — doing their job effectively.

Good health both in terms of injuries and players staying COVID-free.

And a strong working relationship between Cousins and Zimmer with new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak in the middle of it all.

At the end of a frenzied week there was an uncertainty around the 2021 Vikings as many players took the U.S. Bank Stadium field before fans for the first time. The session was not a scrimmage but a normal practice — and a subdued one at that with the team's top three skill position players and its first-round pick spectating and Barr nowhere to be found.

There's enough time for the Vikings to pull it together on several fronts render all this talk meaningless and smirk at those who dared doubt them.

But for all the electrifying production elements they were able to reintroduce at U.S. Bank Stadium on Saturday they couldn't quite gloss over the events of a week that presented these Vikings with deep questions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5wcy5nb3YvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMDAwL3N0LWx1a2UtcGVubnktc2F2aW5ncy1iYW5rLmh0bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Luke Penny Savings Bank (U.S,"-Maggie L. Walker

Independent Order of St. Luke Annual Convention

August 20 1901 Beginnings of the Bank At the 1901 annual convention of the Independent Order of St. Luke (IOSL) Maggie Walker laid out her goals for her organization including the formation of a bank an emporium a newspaper and a factory. Of these objectives the creation of a bank was foremost in her mind. Banks represented the pinnacle of financial achievement to many people. To Walker a bank would combat the oppressive conditions of racial segregation while encouraging economic independence and thrift in the black community. Relegated to second-class citizenship African Americans were denied rights in all aspects of life: education employment politics and business. Walker's bank along with other black-owned businesses provided spaces to conduct business away from the racism and harsh treatment often found in white-owned businesses. Mrs. Walker's idea for a bank was not new. Several fraternal orders also opened banks in turn-of-the-century Richmond including the Grand Fountain of the United Order of the True Reformers. Led by William Washington Browne the True Reformers became one of the largest African American fraternal and business orders in America. In March of 1888 the True Reformers made history by receiving the first charter granted to African Americans to open a bank. Between 1888 and 1920 five other black-owned banks opened in Richmond including Walker's St. Luke Penny Savings Bank and the Mechanics Savings Bank which served as the main depository for another fraternal order the Knights of Pythias. Numerous reasons compelled African Americans to open and patronize banks within their own community. Racial stereotypes discouraged many white bankers from loaning money to African Americans fearing that loans would never be repaid. If black customers were issued loans they were often charged a higher rate of interest than white customers. While many white-owned banks accepted deposits from black customers some did not. These white bank managers feared that black customers would scare away white patrons. Mrs. Walker understood that using white-owned banks in such an environment merely served to ""feed the lion of prejudice."" By patronizing black-owned banks African Americans in Richmond kept money in their own community and gained economic empowerment. While Maggie Walker first announced her vision of a bank in 1901 it would take over two years to see the dream realized. During that time the Independent Order of St. Luke focused on recruiting new members financing and building a new headquarters and publishing the St. Luke Herald. The bank however was never far from Mrs. Walker's mind. St. Luke attorney James Hayes drew up the charter which was approved by Virginia's Corporation Commission on July 28 1903. Local newspapers carried the story many noting the distinction that the bank would be led by an African American woman. Walker's notoriety grew when the Virginia Banker's Association extended membership to her. This offer had not been extended to any of the other presidents of the black-owned banks in Richmond. She accepted the invitation and remarked ""I shall hope to conduct myself so as to reflect credit upon my race and people."" As the plans came together Walker used the network of St. Luke councils to promote the bank. At the annual IOSL convention in August of 1903 she encouraged each council to open an account and buy bank stock. She also urged each individual member to open an account. Walker realized that if the bank was to succeed she would need the full support of her fraternal community. The Executive Committee of the IOSL served as the initial Board of Directors for the bank. At the first board meeting held on August 19 1903 the group set an opening date for the business sold 200 shares of stock to the Grand Council of the IOSL and decided that most stock would be sold only to IOSL members. At another meeting held on August 21 the board approved the hiring of clerks and set their salaries. The board appointed Emmett C. Burke as cashier at a salary of $50 per month Mary Dawson as assistant cashier at $25 per month and Maggie Walker as president earning $25 a week for her work. To prepare herself for the position Walker spent two hours a day at the white-owned Merchants National Bank of Richmond studying procedures and operations of the bank. On November 2 1903 the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank opened for business at the St. Luke Headquarters Building at 900 St. James Street. While music played and speeches were given nearly 300 eager customers many of them members of the IOSL waited patiently to open bank accounts. While some people deposited more than one hundred dollars others started accounts with just a few dollars including one person who deposited just 31 cents. At the end of the day the bank had 280 deposits totaling over $8000 and sold $1247.00 worth of stock bringing the total to $9340.44. Mrs. Walker originally hoped for deposits exceeding $75000 but she was pleased with the first day's success. At the same time she recognized the hard work ahead to find success and security for the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank.

Maggie L. Walker and the officers of the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank c. 1917 Maggie L Walker National Historic Site The Bank Expansions and Successes In an attempt to encourage deposits by children Walker distributed penny banks among St. Luke families. Walker hoped the banks would teach children how to save their money and learn the importance of thrift. Once children had one hundred pennies in their bank they could open an account at the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. As a shrewd businesswoman Walker also realized that every penny counted and that each deposit opened by a child would help strengthen the bank. To further the success of the bank and expand the empire of the IOSL Walker recommended that the bank's Board of Directors purchase a building to house a department store and the bank. The vision of an emporium run by African American women was first vocalized by Walker in 1901 at the same time she announced her dream for the bank and the St. Luke Herald. As the bank slowly prospered the time seemed ripe for the IOSL to further its influence in Richmond. In September 1904 the IOSL purchased a building at 112 Broad Street to house the St. Luke Emporium and the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. The bank moved to this new location in October 1905. The bank would continue to grow steadily at this location. The year 1910 brought many changes not only to the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank but banks throughout the state. The Virginia General Assembly added legislation that required all state banks to be examined annually by the State Corporation Committee. This law resulted in the closure of a number of banks across the state. The St. Luke Penny Savings Bank however successfully passed the examination and continued to operate. One bank not so fortunate was the True Reformers Bank. The Corporation Committee ordered the closure of the bank in October of 1910. Unsecured loans lax operations and embezzlement by a clerk led to its downfall with most depositors losing their savings. The fall of the first black-owned bank in Richmond shattered the confidence of African Americans in the city.



Although St. Luke Penny Savings Bank remained financially healthy during this time the Emporium suffered from low sales. Likely in view of the department store's impending closure the bank's Board of Directors voted to erect a new bank building in 1910. Charles T. Russell one of the first black licensed architects in the state designed the plans. In November 1911 the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank opened its doors at the corner of First and Marshall Streets. That same month the St. Luke Emporium shut its doors for good.



While the bank continued to do moderately well it would never again see the growth experienced in the previous years. In 1920 two other black owned banks were chartered in Richmond-Commercial Bank and Trust and Second Street Savings Bank-creating more competition. In 1922 the Mechanics Savings Bank operated by John Mitchell Jr. was closed by the State Corporation Committee again causing confidence in black-owned banks to decline. By 1928 resources of the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank dropped below their 1926 totals. To save the bank and to ensure that depositors' assets were secure Walker took action. The Merging of Ideas to Survive Difficult Times In 1929 Walker met with officers and directors for the Second Street Savings Bank and the Commercial Bank and Trust to discuss a merger. While the Commercial Bank dropped out of discussions the two remaining banks adopted a resolution to merge. The new institution the Consolidated Bank and Trust opened for business on January 2 1930 at the 1st and Marshall Street location of the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. Still facing financial troubles Commercial Bank and Trust merged with Consolidated in 1931. Walker served as Chairman to the Board of Directors for Consolidated Bank and Trust a position she would hold until her death in 1934. While many banks did not survive the Great Depression Consolidated Bank and Trust not only survived but thrived into the twenty-first century. In 2005 Abigail Adams National Bank purchased Consolidated Bank and Trust ending Consolidated's distinction as a black-run independently-owned bank. It is believed to have been the oldest continuously black-owned bank in the country until then. In 2009 Premiere Bank merged with Abigail Adams. Two years later Consolidated Bank and Trust was renamed Premiere Bank. It still operates today at the corner of 1st and Marshall Streets. During its long history the bank founded by Maggie Walker benefited the African American community in Richmond. By 1920 for example it had issued more than 600 mortgages to black families allowing many to realize the dream of home ownership. It provided employment for African Americans giving some a chance to leave the menial labor intensive jobs to which African Americans were often relegated. More than anything the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank-turned-Consolidated Bank and Trust was a source of pride for black Richmonders. The bank served as a reminder of the lasting impact that Maggie Walker's vision and perseverance had on an entire community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlbmRpbmd0cmVlLmNvbS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMvYmVzdC9jYXNoLWFkdmFuY2UtY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Cash Advance Credit Cards in 2024 | LendingTree,"Citi is an advertising partner.

Financial emergencies happen to everyone — and usually at the worst possible time.

But you should avoid credit card cash advances because of their fees and high interest rates. Instead we recommend using a card with a long 0% intro APR so you can pay off large purchases over time without paying interest.

Trump’s campaign needed money when he went online and chipped in everything he could: $500.

It was a big sum for a 63-year-old battling cancer and living in Kansas City on less than $1000 per month. But that single contribution — federal records show it was his first ever — quickly multiplied. Another $500 was withdrawn the next day then $500 the next week and every week through mid-October without his knowledge — until Mr. Blatt’s bank account had been depleted and frozen. When his utility and rent payments bounced he called his brother Russell for help.

What the Blatts soon discovered was $3000 in withdrawals by the Trump campaign in less than 30 days. They called their bank and said they thought they were victims of fraud.

UBER,Uber,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL21pYW1pL25ld3Mvcm9ib3RheGlzLXViZXItbHlmdC_SATtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbWlhbWkvbmV3cy9yb2JvdGF4aXMtdWJlci1seWZ0Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robotaxis Coming For Their Jobs? Uber & Lyft Drivers Worried They'll Be Replaced,"MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) — Uber and Lyft drivers fear they'll be replaced by robotaxis.

The ridesharing companies have long advertised that driving for them is a great way to earn extra cash.

For Miami-area residents like Humberto Pimental 58 driving for Lyft for the past four months has now turned into 50% of his regular income. The rest he gets from selling tires and business there has slowed.

So the announcement that autonomously driving Lyfts will soon be arriving in the city makes him apprehensive.

""Every 'robocar' they put on the street is one job less"" said Pimental who has a wife two daughters and a mother-in-law living at home.

Self-driving technology group Argo AI along with Ford and Lyft announced last month that they would begin testing 1000 self-driving ride-hail vehicles — nicknamed ""robotaxis"" — in Miami and Austin this winter. It continues the work Argo AI and Ford have performed testing self-driving Ford cruisers in Miami starting in 2018; last fall Ford announced it was increasing its Miami testing footprint.

The results of those tests will carry extra urgency in Florida which has some of the highest densities of ride-hail drivers in the country. Uber has previously said that prior to the pandemic it had approximately 100000 drivers operating in Florida — equivalent to about one out of every 100 workers in the state. Lyft declined to say how many drivers it has here.

While experts agree that it is unlikely 100% of the platforms' fleets will ever become autonomous the start of the tests signals that robotaxis will be here faster than many have assumed. Asad Hussain a senior analyst at venture data group Pitchbook who covers the autonomous vehicle industry said that by 2030 it not before self-driving Ubers and Lyfts would start to become more common.

""The big value add here is that you don't have to pay the labor cost of a human driver"" Hussain said. ""...You're reducing the cost of transportation but on the flip side what happens to drivers is a really important question.""

The pressure to automate has if anything become more intense he said now that companies are facing higher wages a trend that has coincided with a shortage of drivers amid the pandemic.

The industry has responded to fears of a robot takeover by saying that whatever jobs will be eliminated will likely be offset by new jobs the autonomous vehicles will create including fleet management positions to service and maintain vehicles as well as an ongoing need for safety drivers and test drivers to map out new cities teaching the vehicles new roadways.

A Lyft representative pointed to CEO John Zimmer's previous comments about a future where demand — including for drivers — will actually increase as robotaxis roll out.

""When autonomous cars can only solve a portion of (trips) more Lyft drivers will be needed to provide service to the growing market of former car owners"" Zimmer wrote in 2016.

That does little to placate Walter Ruiz 34. The Miami-area ride-hail driver said he has been making good money since he began driving late last year — as much as $17 an hour. It's a rate he says is still more than many employers still desperate for workers are willing to offer. He said he has applied to become a firefighter but for now drives for at least eight hours a day to support his wife sister and parents.

""It would be hard for us if they're going to be taking our jobs"" Ruiz said.

Elliot Katz co-founder and chief business officer of Phantom Auto a remote operations company that works closely with large third-parties focused on automation said the days when a human will never be ""in the loop"" of a self-driving car's itinerary are far off. Katz previously worked as an attorney in law firm DLA Piper's autonomous vehicle practice.

Instead he said a more imminent scenario will see self-driving cars operating with remote operators sitting in an office somewhere and ready to take over a car should it run into trouble or should a human request intervention. It's already happening at some warehouses where some forklifts are now operated from a remote location. In May Phantom partnered with Mitsubishi's logistics unit to deploy remotely operated forklifts.

""So people who are in the current state of things driving ride-hail in a future state could be remote operators"" Katz said.

Katz acknowledged that Uber and Lyft driving jobs don't require prior experience or a college degree but pointed out that these individuals can perform remote operator jobs. Remote operation training is provided — and the job being remote eliminates the need to leave one's office or even house.

But that would take away a key element that a Miami-area ridehail driver named Roben who asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution said got him driving soon after arriving to the area from Venezuela. Robotaxis he said would likely result in lost work for drivers like him.

""I'm my own boss"" he said. ""I own my own time.""

Earlier this week Mears (the company that currently operates the shuttles) released their reservation system for a new shuttle service that will replace Disney’s Magical Express — Mears Connect. Of course the service will no longer be free so now those vacationing to the resort will need to factor the transportation cost into their budget. But is Mears Connect really the cheapest option?

Well today we’re comparing the cost of choosing Mears Connect versus opting to use rideshare such as Uber to help you decide which is best for you!

Mears Connect

Standard vs. Express Service

Before you open up the Mears Connect webpage to make your reservation you’ll need to have already booked the flights for your trip and determine if you would like to utilize the Standard or Express level of service. And there are TWO major differences between the options.

The Standard Service is cheaper and includes stops at multiple different Disney World Resorts for drop-offs and pick-ups. So you could end up waiting about 20 minutes at the airport from the time that you check-in at the Mears Connect reception area before traveling to Disney World.

On the other hand the Express Service is more expensive but will take guests directly to their Disney World Resort hotel without a wait time or additional stops.

So how much does it actually cost?

Cost

Mears Connect has released a chart with their introductory rates that begin at $16 per adult and $13.50 per child for one-way Standard Service and range up to over $250 for parties of four or more using the Premium Service.

So for a family of four who is traveling with two adults and two children using the Standard Service the round trip to any Disney World Resort hotel would be $118.

And if that same family opts for the Express Service the cost of a round trip will be $250 total.

If your travel party is a bit smaller and you’ve only got two people in your group the cost for a round trip is a bit cheaper using Standard Service costing $64.

However a party of two opting to use Express Service will not save on cost as the round trip is priced at $250 for up to four passengers regardless of whether you’re traveling with less.

Keep in mind that Mears Connect does NOT charge extra for your luggage so the rate that is listed on the website is what you can anticipate your fare costing. Though these are listed as “introductory rates” so they will likely increase over time.

Uber

UberX vs. Uber XL

So how does the cost of Mears Connect compare to rideshare programs like Uber? Well let’s first cover the different options you have to select from.

Unlike Mears Connect you won’t have to share a ride with guests who are outside of your party and you’ll be able to be taken directly to your resort without having to stop at any others (something that’s comparable to the Express Service). But you’ll want to keep in mind all of the options that you have to select from.

Overall Uber has over 10 different ride options but the two cheapest options for guests are UberX and UberXL.

Uber X is the most affordable economy option with Uber and fits up to three passengers. But if you’re traveling with more than three in your party (or you just want extra space) then you’ll need to opt for the Uber XL which accommodates up to five people.

And what will it cost you for a round trip using Uber?

Cost

We input some test rides with Uber and found that for a trip from the Orlando International Airport to Disney’s Port Orleans Resort — Riverside with two adults and two kids the roundtrip fare would cost a total of $83.

And keep in mind that Uber doesn’t take into account how many people are traveling when they calculate the cost of the trip so a family traveling with two adults would also be charged $83 round trip using UberXL.

The only cheaper option would be available for guests with a party of two or three using UberX making the round trip a total of $61.

Now Uber rates can vary a lot so depending on which Disney World Resort you’re staying at traffic delays surge pricing and other factors your trip with Uber could end up costing you more or less.

Which is Better For Your Trip?

So looking at these numbers it looks like the cheaper option for guests would be taking an Uber though there are still some other factors to consider.

Mears Connect does not have surge pricing rates so the cost on their price chart is the cost that you’ll be paying no matter when or where you’re traveling to. Whereas with Uber you could end up paying more than the cost of Mears Connect due to all of the variables.

Another thing to consider when deciding which transportation service you’d prefer for your Disney World trip is whether you’re willing to ride on a coach bus with other guests and make stops at other resorts before being dropped off.

Mears Connect Express Service is your only option to get straight to your hotel without a wait and costs $250 at a minimum. On the other hand Uber will always provide you with the direct service and could cost much less than $250.

And you’ll want to think about all the luggage you plan to bring with you when deciding! Both Mears Connect and Uber do not charge for luggage however if you’re traveling with many bags you may have trouble fitting into Uber’s smaller transportation options and end up needing to pay more for a larger car.

Overall you’ll certainly need to weigh your options when deciding how you’d like to get between the airport and your Disney World hotel when visiting after January 1st 2022 but when it comes down to cost Uber seems to have Mears Connect beat.

Of course we’ll continue to keep an eye out for more updates from Mears Connect and bring you all the latest updates on the best ways to plan for your Disney World trip so be sure to stay tuned to AllEars for the latest!

""That’s probably an (Uber)"" police officer E. Gallardo told a local KRQE reporter of a car that was going up and down an Encinos neighborhood street in Sunland Park but quickly left the area when it spotted the police car. ""Almost everyone carries a cell phone now"" Gallardo who is a veteran of the Las Cruces and Sunland Park police departments said of how migrants keep in touch with smugglers or rides.

Gallardo said that in Sunland Park many migrants come down a mountain early in the morning and cross into the U.S. where smugglers sometimes instruct them to order an Uber or Lyft.

TEXAS FARMERS REQUEST BIDEN ADMINISTRATION COVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION COSTS

Uber told Fox News when approached for comment that the company has a law enforcement team that works with local police departments with investigations and also partnered with various nonprofits to educate drivers on how to pick out and report potential human trafficking.

Lyft similarly noted that it has ""a dedicated law enforcement response team that works with police departments"" and is ""committed to working closely with law enforcement to support community safety.""

Local police explained they don’t stop vehicles that pick up passengers along the border unless they see the driver speeding or a car carrying more occupants than it's built for.

The ride-along comes as migrants at the southern border continue crossing into the United States at high rates with more than 188000 migrant encounters at the southern border in June .

Police explained that Sunland Park has become a favorite spot for Juarez Mexico-based smuggling organizations due to its nearby mountain that provides cover for migrants as they cross into the country.

""They hide in the brush behind houses under mobile homes … they’ll go to sleep and rest a bit and won’t come up for hours"" Gallardo said of the migrants.

Officers in the town are often inundated with calls about migrants but municipal police have their hands tied and must tread carefully due to state leaders not pushing to enforce immigration laws according to the report.

""Ultimately if I can see them on a private property I can make a consensual stop. I gotta protect the dwelling and the safety of the residents"" Gallardo said.

The immigration crisis has continued at the United States’s southern border with many local leaders blaming the Biden administration and other Democratic leaders in Washington D.C.

​​"" People blame us sometimes here in the municipality . We tell them it’s outside of our jurisdiction. You want to place blame? We know exactly where to do it and that’s in Washington. And whether it be the president Congress the Senate whatever it is they’re the ones who can take care of it"" McAllen Texas Mayor Javier Villalobos told Fox News on Thursday.

Villalobos added Friday that the city was at its ""breaking point"" and issued an emergency declaration to build a ""tent city"" for the migrants after the area received minimal help from the federal government.

""The Catholic charities just couldn’t handle it anymore"" Villalobos told ""America’s Newsroom."" ""We get a call so we have to immediately act because we cannot—we shouldn’t and we cannot let the immigrants roam around our city—especially with a high COVID rate.""

Another Texas mayor also sounded the alarm on the migration crisis Friday saying there was ""chaos.""

In 2021 the brand announced that it was temporarily shutting down to work on things internally. What are they currently planning?

Kim Kardashian West has made a name for herself as much more than just a reality TV star. She’s an entrepreneur and a business owner with several brands to her name. Her makeup company KKW Beauty has been one of her most lucrative endeavors yet.

KKW Beauty is Kim Kardashian West’s cosmetics brand

Kardashian West launched KKW Beauty in 2017. Her sister Kylie Jenner had created a successful cosmetics brand with her Kylie Lip Kits which later blossomed into Kylie Cosmetics. In 2017 Kardashian West tested the waters of the beauty world with a lip product collaboration dubbed “KKW x Kylie.”

After the success of the KKW x Kylie collection Kardashian West broke into the beauty industry herself with KKW Beauty. The brand’s first product the Crème Contour and Highlight Kit was meant for users to achieve Kardashian’s signature contoured look. It sold out immediately after launch generating over $14 million in sales.

Since then KKW Beauty has released all sorts of products from eyeshadows to lipsticks.

KKW Beauty is on hiatus in 2021

In 2021 KKW Beauty announced in an Instagram post and on their website that they would be temporarily shutting down and revamping the whole brand. “We’re currently away working on a new more modern elevated and sustainable brand and customer experience — the way Kim has always envisioned” the statement said adding “We promise we won’t be gone for too long.

It’s unclear what exactly KKW Beauty is up to but with Kylie Cosmetics’ recent transition to entirely vegan and cruelty-free products many believe that KKW Beauty is doing the same thing. Creating new formulas — especially ones that are sustainable — is not an easy process and one that requires much time to create the perfect product.

With Kardashian West’s ongoing divorce with Kanye West the fate of the “KKW” name — and Kardashian West’s legal name as a whole — remains up in the air. When KKW Beauty reemerges it could be under an entirely different name.

KKW Beauty’s net worth

KKW Beauty has been a huge moneymaker for Kardashian West. In 2021 she reached the Forbes billionaire list for the first time thanks in large part to KKW Beauty and her Skims shapewear line as well as her KKW Fragrance line.

Similar to a move her sister made with Kylie Cosmetics Kardashian West sold a stake of the company in 2020 to makeup conglomerate Coty. She sold 20% of the company for $200 million valuing the company at $1 billion at the time of the deal. Forbes estimated the company’s actual net worth to hover anywhere between $700 million and $1 billion. Her Skims line meanwhile is worth approximately $1.6 billion according to The New York Times with strong sales even through a pandemic where many women ditched shapewear altogether.

In total Kardashian West maintains a net worth of $1 billion in 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc2VwaG9yYS1rb2hsLWJpZy1yZXZlYWwtMDQwMTUyMTc4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sephora at Kohl's: The Big Reveal,"In the battle for beauty market share the opening salvo has been fired.

The first Sephora at Kohl’s a partnership between the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton-owned beauty behemoth and the midtier department store opened in a Kohl’s store in Ramsey N.J. on Friday. Measuring about 2500 square feet the shop-in-shop is located front and center in the 85000-square-foot store positioned squarely between the two main entrances one of which now has a prominent Sephora sign above it.

More from WWD

The move has the potential to be transformational for both retailers. Kohl’s gains instant access to about 125 leading prestige beauty brands (and the customers who love them) while Sephora gains scale and a foothold in the off-mall real estate sector which has been dominated by Ulta Beauty up till now.

“We are at a pivotal moment in beauty” said Jean-André Rougeot chief executive officer of Sephora Americas. “We are seeing these large movements of the top players positioning themselves for the gold medal.”

This year alone Ulta Beauty unveiled a partnership with Target Corp. to bring prestige beauty to that retailer while in addition to the Kohl’s partnership Sephora made a deal with Zalando in Germany and bought Feelunique in the U.K. while leading U.K. e-commerce player The Hut Group acquired Cultbeauty.com last week.

“It is quickly becoming a much smaller group of players that have a legitimate chance of leading this business” said Rougeot. “With this move we are positioning ourselves to be the dominant leader in selective beauty for years to come. The market share with Kohl’s is quite large.”

The numbers are indeed big — Kohl’s had 1162 stores in 49 states at year-end 2020 with an active consumer base of 65 million people in the U.S. But the hitch is that — up until now at least — those shoppers aren’t visiting the store to buy beauty products.

“We can now be a true beauty destination” said Michelle Gass CEO of Kohl’s. “We’ve been working on our strategy of pivoting Kohl’s from a department store to a leading omni-retailer serving an active and casual lifestyle. Beauty is a key part of our strategy.

“All of this transformation is coming together” she continued. “This is a new Kohl’s more fresh. A modern relevant experience.”

Under Gass the retailer has dramatically trimmed its assortment cutting 25 apparel brands and focusing on names like Nike Adidas Champion Under Armour and Calvin Klein. While the Menomonee Falls Wisc.-based Kohl’s has dipped its toes into beauty in the past partnering with the Estée Lauder Cos. Inc. in 2004 for example on a trio of brands exclusive to the retailer it was never able to gain traction in the category.

“We’ve done some experimentation along the way but we haven’t ever really been in the beauty business” said Gass. “The little we did do and the more we put in front of our customer though she was voting that she wants beauty at Kohl’s. Our beauty business grew 40 percent-plus over the last few years — and though it was small it was resonating.”

Gass declined to comment on sales expectations for Sephora at Kohl’s and how beauty is expected to rank versus other key categories but did say she expects the business to be “significant.”

“You can see the investment we’re making in the business — the store-in-store concept we built the investment in the digital experience the investments in marketing” she said. “We are making a very big bet on beauty specifically Sephora at Kohl’s.”

If this first outpost is any indication Kohl’s has put its money where its mouth is.

“They definitely get points for the ‘wow’ factor” said Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink. “It was distinctly and distinctively Sephora — everything you need and a bit more.

“Partnership works when each is allowed to do what they do best and that happened here — Sephora gets to be Sephora and Kohl’s gets to be the host leveraging its off-mall real estate customer loyalty and omni-platform” she continued. “The rest of the store is brand-rich and Kohl’s-curated but Sephora is figuratively and literally the centerpiece. It’s game on in beauty and Kohl’s brought a ‘pretty powerful’ weapon to the fight.

To that end Sephora at Kohl’s feels like a stand-alone Sephora store set apart from the rest of the box with its signature gondolas signage and black-and-white color scheme down to the striped floor. Each store will have a team of 15 Kohl’s employees manning the area who have been trained by Sephora. Even the lighting is different from that in the rest of the store.

“Lighting is crucial for the success of beauty” said Rougeot. “This is top-notch luxury lighting — not even all of our stores have it. This store checks the box of what our consumers and brands expect.”

As reported the brand lineup is very robust with about 125 brands overall and more than 8500 stock keeping units. The space is evenly divided between skin care on the left and makeup on the right with hair care and fragrances lining the back walls. The Sephora Collection is housed on a full wall adjacent to makeup and multibranded Sephora merchandising areas like Beauty on the Go Clean at Sephora and Top Picks are also featured.

Legacy brands include Estée Lauder Clinique Lancôme and Kiehl’s. Buzzy players like Olaplex Fenty Beauty Drunk Elephant Charlotte Tilbury Milk Makeup Briogeo Ilia and The Ordinary are well positioned while newer names like Gisou in hair care and Patrick Ta round out the offering. Fragrance features luxe brands like Tom Ford Giorgio Armani and YSL as well as niche players such as Nest Fragrances (the first brand to sign on said Rougeot) and Juliette Has a Gun. Signage featuring “Clean Beauty Under $20” and “Sephora Collection Under $20” call out the value-driven aspects of the proposition.

Artemis Patrick executive vice president and global chief merchandising officer of Sephora noted that she and her team had an amazing reaction from the brands and that about 90 percent of the offering in a stand-alone Sephora is represented at Kohl’s.

For their part brands seem equally as bullish on the concept. “This new distribution that completely mirrors the high-quality experience people love at Sephora combined with Kohl’s 60-plus million database most of whom are incremental to Sephora’s Beauty Insider program will mean that we have a big awareness and trial opportunity with clients but also an opportunity to build stronger relationships with existing clients” said Tim Coolican CEO of Milk Makeup. “We expect that this is a significant opportunity that could grow our U.S. business by at least an additional 50 percent once Sephora at Kohl’s reaches full distribution.”

Plans call for 70 Sephora-at-Kohl’s to open this month with 200 total by yearend. That number will reach 800 total within the next few years. The size and speed of Kohl’s was one key reason Sephora chose to partner with it for expansion rather than go it alone and open more off-mall stores on its own.

“Kohl’s is a bit of a magic wand — doing 200 stores in eight weeks is quite remarkable” said Rougeot. “We are basically tripling the size of our fleet in two years. That’s something that this partnership allows us to do. We are getting reach which is very important to us at a much higher speed and we are getting it with great quality.”

Tapping into Kohl’s real estate strategy is another key advantage for Sephora particularly vis-à-vis archrival Ulta Beauty which has about 1250 stores in all 50 states primarily in strip malls.

“We are just not very convenient for most of the American population today. To be fair Ulta has done a phenomenal job of taking advantage of that” said Rougeot. “They are a more convenient retailer — as of yesterday. Looking forward it’s a completely different ballgame. Completely different.”

Wissink estimates that there is overlap between Kohl’s and Ulta stores in about 70 percent of locations and here in this New Jersey location alone there is an Ulta Beauty across the street and a Sally Beauty about 10 doors down in the same strip mall.

Rougeot expressed confidence that Sephora’s proposition will win in the end. “Since I came [to Sephora Americas] I’ve talked about reach and being more competitive with Ulta” he said. “This is a very aggressive drive to offer customers an alternative. I believe strongly that when we fight head-to-head we win. We have a better assortment a more interesting story better service levels.

“Ulta is a great company and I respect them for sure” said Rougeot who worked closely with that retailer when he headed up Benefit Cosmetics. “But I think our stores are better and the fact that we can now bring the Sephora experience to pretty much everywhere Ulta is is a huge win for us.”

Already online sales which launched Aug. 1. are trending well. All categories are beating estimates said Patrick who noted that hair care and fragrance performing exceptionally well.

“The brands are very comfortable with this — we are already getting great feedback on the dot-com” said Patrick. “The numbers are significantly better than forecast — well above what we expected. There is strong pent-up demand.”

Moreover the Kohl’s shopper is not expected to cannibalize Sephora’s existing base. “The power of this partnership is scale” added Doug Howe chief merchandising officer of Kohl’s who noted that 70 percent of the 65 million active customers are women. “And there is very little overlap with the Sephora shopper” he added.

Rougeot said early indicators from online sales show that this is a consumer who is eager for what’s trending and relevant and new in the category.

“Exclusivity continues to be very important. Beauty is fun. Beauty is play” he said. “As a consumer you’re always looking for new.

“Patrick Ta and Charlotte Tilbury are two of the biggest successes on [Sephora at Kohl’s] dot-com thus far. I didn’t necessarily expect that” Rougeot continued. “But the consumer is smart. The Kohl’s consumer knows exactly what is happening in beauty. She just couldn’t find those brands before and now they are within her grasp.”

To Make Way For New UPS Facility,"BAYONNE N.J. (CBSNewYork) -- Two large buildings on a former military base in northern New Jersey were demolished on Sunday.

The group behind the move says the new facility planned for the land will bring thousands jobs to the area CBS2's Kiran Dhillon reported.

The sound of the explosion could be heard for miles. Smoke filled the air as two six-story structures from the 1940s came crashing down.

""It started coming down like seventh floor sixth floor fifth floor and then it was just smoke"" Thomas Hammond said.

A married couple worked in one of the two buildings for 40 years. They were some of many locals who gathered to watch the demolition.

""It was a very mixed feeling. It was sad because both our offices were on the seventh floor and that came down first"" Hasmik Hammond said.

During World War II the site in Bayonne was used by the U.S. Navy as a supply depot before the Army took control of it in 1967. A wave of base closures halted operations in 1999.

""This was a military ocean terminal. It was the Navy and the Army. If our country was attacked these buildings could withstand a 500-pound bomb"" Bayonne Mayor Jimmy Davis said.

Officials say because the buildings were created to withstand bombs crews actually removed bomb-proof panels for the implosion. After that work was completed workers then went in and placed explosives inside the structures.

The company behind the procedure Lincoln Equities Group purchased the 153-acre site in 2018 and has since demolished most of the structures on it.

The plan is to build a UPS regional hub facility on the land.

""It'll bring thousands of jobs to the region. We're building a brand new road. The major interchange has already been improved and we're adding a road in order to facilitate the traffic into the new interchange"" Lincoln Equities Group president Joel Bergstein said.

And while some are sad to see the buildings go many said they are excited to the see the economy get a boost.

""As far as jobs go I think it's great because they need a lot of jobs. It's a good thing"" Hasmik Hammond said.

Construction of the UPS complex should be completed by 2023.

Austin Hill was the leader at the time of the delay enabling him to score his second win of the year.

Hill started on the pole in the first Truck race at WGI since 2000 and he led the first four laps before Todd Gilliland took the spot. Gilliland who won the most recent road race at COTA in May would score the stage win ahead of Sheldon Creed Derek Kraus Josh Berry Austin Wayne Self A.J. Allmendinger Paul Menard Stewart Friesen Ben Rhodes and Ryan Truex. NASCAR newcomer Chad Chastain produced the lone caution of the stage when his truck stopped on lap seven.

The second stage ran green the entire distance as the lead was exchanged between Jack Wood Carson Hocevar Zane Smith John Hunter Nemechek and Hill. Hill would take the stage win ahead of Nemechek Allmendinger Smith Creed Tyler Ankrum Hocevar Gilliland Ben Rhodes and Sam Mayer.

As Hill continued to lead Nemechek and Creed ran behind him. After a caution on lap 53 for Kraus spinning after contact with Allmendinger in turn four ending the former’s playoff hopes a red flag came on lap 60 for lightning. Despite efforts to wait out the storm worries about clashing with the Xfinity Series race looming later in the day prompted NASCAR to call the race.

Albeit shortened by weather the win is Hill’s second in a row after winning a month prior at Knoxville and his first on a road course. With a tenth-place finish Hocevar locked himself into the playoffs alongside fellow rookie Chandler Smith. Although Smith who crossed the finish in eighteenth was eventually disqualified for failing post-race heights he still qualifies for the playoffs.

“It was nervewracking that’s for sure” said Hill. “I didn’t know if we were going to go back green or not but it feels so good to win on a road course. I’ve been wanting to win on a road course for a really long time—even back in the K&N (Pro Series now ARCA Menards Series East/West) days I felt like I would get around the road course fairly decent and finally we had a race that does everything we needed to do. I was really biting my nails there and then when that rain came and I didn’t know what was going to happen with the lightning and all that.”

Nemechek will enter the playoffs as the points leader after winning the regular season championship. Hill Rhodes Gilliland and Creed are the other five drivers in the ten-person grid with race wins and are seeded as such. Smith Matt Crafton Hocevar Smith and Stewart Friesen round out the lineup.

Perhaps the only person in the sprawling facility OK with lightning showing up was Austin Hill who drove the No. 16 United Rentals Toyota to a victory in the United Rentals 176 at The Glen.

With the Xfinity Series race scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. NASCAR officials called the Truck race after a weather delay of just under an hour.

""I was really biting my nails a little bit when that rain came"" Hill said. ""I didn't know what was going to happen with the lightning and all that.""

He moved into the top spot on lap 43 when race leader John Hunter Nemechek pitted. Hill went on to win the race's second stage which ended at lap 45 for his first stage victory of the season. Todd Gilliland won the first stage which was 20 laps.

Hill a native of Winston Georgia ended up leading 36 of the completed 61 laps. He was in front from laps 29 to 41 before briefly giving up the lead to Nemechek who finished second.

Hill said the only time weather potentially impacting the race was brought up by his team was on the final restart.

""I think we had a little bit of luck on our side there at the end to get to the lead"" he said. ""With it going green there's no telling what could have happened on a restart or something so it was nice to have the rain come and us not to have to go back out there.""

Hill's first Truck win on a road course

Hill 27 earned the eighth win of his career and second this season. He won the series' previous race at Knoxville Raceway on July 9.

The victory was Hill's first in the series on a road course after several wins for him in road events in the Legends Series.

""Ever since Legend cars it seems like something always happens or we're just a little bit off. Finally we were able to put the whole thing together"" he said.

Winning an event sponsored by his car sponsor only added to the experience.

""I think preparation was really big for us"" said Hill who finished second in the Menards ARCA Series race at the track Friday night giving him track time on a weekend in which there was no practice or qualifying for the Truck Series.

""To win at a place like Watkins Glen and also to do it with United Rentals sponsoring the weekend – I've got United Rentals gear all over me – it's really special. I was really excited to see that happen. I can't wait to get on a phone call and talk to a few of those United Rentals reps and see what they thought about it. I thought it was cool.""

Truck Series playoff field set

The race was the final one of 15 in the regular season for the Truck Series. Nemechek who has five victories this year leads the 10 drivers who will compete for the season title over the remaining seven races with his 34 playoff points.

The rest of the playoff field: Hill Ben Rhodes Gilliland Sheldon Creed Zane Smith Matt Crafton Carson Hocevar Stewart Friesen and Chandler Smith. Chandler Smith was disqualified Saturday because of failing heights but it didn't impact his playoff status.

NASCAR Wire Service

Race leader Austin Hill was declared the winner of Saturday’s United Rentals 176 at the famed Watkins Glen International road course after lightning in the immediate area forced the field to stop on pit road 11 laps from the scheduled race finish.

Hill had taken a 1.023-second lead over John Hunter Nemechek before the trucks headed to pit road where they waited under red flag conditions for nearly an hour before the race was officially called.

The race marked the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series regular season finale officially setting the 10-driver 2021 Playoff field. And while there were no impactful moves in the standings as far as Playoff eligibility it certainly wasn’t for a lack of trying in the truck series’ first race at the 2.45-mile vintage road course in 21 years.

Hill who had previously only led two laps in his career on road courses led a race best 36 of the 61 laps in the No. 16 Hattori Racing Enterprises Toyota to take his second win of the season – and second straight after claiming the trophy in the previous race July 9 on the Knoxville Iowa dirt track.

“It was nerve-wracking that’s for sure I didn’t know if we were going to go back to green or not” said Hill 27 of Winston Ga. “It feels so good to win on a road course.

“I was really biting my nails a little bit when that rain came I didn’t know what was going to happen with the lightning and all that” he continued. “But they gave me a really great piece today and we were able to go out there and get it done. It’s really special to get a win at Watkins Glen.”

Nemechek’s runner-up effort was his series-best ninth top five. His five wins in the No. 4 Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota are most in the series this season and a personal high mark for the 23-year old second-generation star who also receives a 15-point bonus for winning the regular season title.

The victory was especially big for Hill moving him into second place in the standings 18 points behind Nemechek to start the Playoff run. Another two-race winner Ben Rhodes who finished 15th on Saturday is ranked third.

The remainder of the 10-driver Playoff field includes Todd Gilliland 2020 series champion Sheldon Creed Zane Smith three-time series champion Matt Crafton first-time Playoff contenders rookies Carson Hocevar and Chandler Smith and veteran Stewart Friesen.

Derek Kraus the popular 19-year old Wisconsin driver was officially eliminated from Playoff contention after spinning out with 19 laps remaining. Kraus had run in the Top-5 early in the race placing third in Stage 1. He started the race ranked 11th – 40 points from the Playoff cutline line. But he and Tyler Ankrum who started the race 12th in points essentially needed a victory to secure that Playoff position. Ankrum finished seventh.

In many ways Saturday’s race was a Playoff preview. Gilliland won Stage 1 and Hill took the Stage 2 victory both fending off runs by fellow championship eligible drivers.

Creed who boasts the series all-time best road course average finish (3.0) finished third. Gilliland was fourth and Parker Kligerman rounded out the Top-5 – his first top five showing of the season.

Race leader Austin Hill was declared the winner of Saturday’s United Rentals 176 at the famed Watkins Glen International road course after lightning in the immediate area forced the field to stop on pit road 11 laps from the scheduled race finish.

Hill had taken a 1.023-second lead over John Hunter Nemechek before the trucks headed to pit road where they waited under red flag conditions for nearly an hour before the race was officially called.

The race marked the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series regular season finale officially setting the 10-driver 2021 Playoff field. And while there were no impactful moves in the standings as far as Playoff eligibility it certainly wasn’t for a lack of trying in the truck series’ first race at the 2.45-mile vintage road course in 21 years.

Hill who had previously only led two laps in his career on road courses led a race best 36 of the 61 laps in the No. 16 Hattori Racing Enterprises Toyota to take his second win of the season – and second straight after claiming the trophy in the previous race July 9 on the Knoxville Iowa dirt track.

“It was nerve-wracking that’s for sure I didn’t know if we were going to go back to green or not” said Hill 27 of Winston Ga. “It feels so good to win on a road course.

“I was really biting my nails a little bit when that rain came I didn’t know what was going to happen with the lightning and all that” he continued. “But they gave me a really great piece today and we were able to go out there and get it done. It’s really special to get a win at Watkins Glen.”

Nemechek’s runner-up effort was his series-best ninth top five. His five wins in the No. 4 Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota are most in the series this season and a personal high mark for the 23-year old second-generation star who also receives a 15-point bonus for winning the regular season title.

The victory was especially big for Hill moving him into second place in the standings 18 points behind Nemechek to start the Playoff run. Another two-race winner Ben Rhodes who finished 15th on Saturday is ranked third.

The remainder of the 10-driver Playoff field includes Todd Gilliland 2020 series champion Sheldon Creed Zane Smith three-time series champion Matt Crafton first-time Playoff contenders rookies Carson Hocevar and Chandler Smith and veteran Stewart Friesen.

Derek Kraus the popular 19-year old Wisconsin driver was officially eliminated from Playoff contention after spinning out with 19 laps remaining. Kraus had run in the Top-5 early in the race placing third in Stage 1. He started the race ranked 11th – 40 points from the Playoff cutline line. But he and Tyler Ankrum who started the race 12th in points essentially needed a victory to secure that Playoff position. Ankrum finished seventh.

In many ways Saturday’s race was a Playoff preview. Gilliland won Stage 1 and Hill took the Stage 2 victory both fending off runs by fellow championship eligible drivers.

Creed who boasts the series all-time best road course average finish (3.0) finished third. Gilliland was fourth and Parker Kligerman rounded out the Top-5 – his first top five showing of the season.

The first three-race round of the 2021 Playoffs begins Aug. 20 with the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Gateway 200 (9 p.m. ET FS1 MRN SiriusXM NASCAR Radio) at World Wide Technology Park at Gateway. The following two races of the round are are at Darlington Raceway on Sept. 5 and then Bristol Motor Speedway on Sept. 16.

Read more

The days of the stalwart solo physician hanging out a shingle and seeing patients as he or she sees fit are rapidly drawing to a close. Consulting firm Avalere Health reports that almost 70% of physicians in the United States now work as employees of a hospital health system or private corporation. That’s a 12% increase over just two years ago and is likely to accelerate after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report is “a stunning document” that shows just how much the profession of medicine is changing said Richard Baron president of the American Board of Internal Medicine the Philadelphia-based group that certifies the expertise of internists.

What do the changes mean for practicing physicians?

It suits some quite well such as Kevin Zakrzewski an internist at Abington-Jefferson Health who has practiced as an employee for his entire 22-year career. Employment means he “can move away from the business side” and focus on caring for patients. “The HR issues alone in running a private practice are immense” he said.

Besides he can take vacations without worrying about the hit to practice revenue.

New Hampshire orthopedist Charles Blitzer and his seven partners would agree. They sold their practice in 2018 to Wentworth-Douglas Hospital an affiliate of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Running an independent medical practice has come to require “high-level administrative skills” that Blitzer and his partners “had no desire to acquire.”

“I went to medical school to practice clinical medicine” not to be entrepreneurial he said.

There are trade-offs however. By turning over the business side of their practice to a large organization Blitzer and his colleagues “are not nearly as nimble as they were” when it comes to such functions as purchasing. “To replace an ultrasound machine in the office we have to go through a complex process.”

But Blitzer feels that “overall work life has not profoundly changed.”

Others are less sanguine. Steven Fassler a colorectal surgeon based at Abington has chosen to keep his practice independent. Although Fassler has staff privileges at the hospital performs surgery and admits patients there he does so through his own practice which is like a small business. It bills and collects for his services and handles administrative aspects of his practice. “I don’t like letting people tell me what to do” he said. He fears that “the force of a corporate structure alters the culture of what you want to do.”

Fassler is especially concerned that a corporate boss could make doctors pay greater heed to their employers and not their patients. The change can occur in little pieces and “all of a sudden you’re working for the dark side.”

Economic forces are making it increasingly difficult for physicians to remain in private practice. Among the first to feel the effect were older physicians contemplating retirement who have found the younger generation less willing to take on the risks and demands of independent practice and more receptive to the security of employment.

Other more subtle financial pressures include cuts to Medicare payments for imaging tests performed by cardiologists orthopedists and oncologists in their offices that make their practices less lucrative.

And many payers including Medicare and some private insurers are increasingly basing reimbursement on value-based purchasing which compares the amount paid for services with their clinical value. Administering these arrangements piles on yet more practice overhead expense.

Other administrative concerns such as the cost of malpractice insurance have been driving physicians to employment for some time. But they do not appear to account for the recent acceleration of the trend experts said.

As significant as they are these pressures pale in comparison with the administrative burden of installing and operating electronic medical records systems commonly known as EMRs. A system can cost $15000 to $70000 per provider and installing it can disrupt a practice’s workflow and revenue while physicians and staff learn how to use it.

Yet medical practices have little choice about incurring the expense. A federal law enacted in 2009 penalizes physicians who do not engage in “meaningful use” of EMRs by reducing their Medicare reimbursement.

It is also increasingly difficult to practice without an EMR which enables physicians to share information instantaneously with colleagues. Blitzer described an experience in which he diagnosed a patient with a tumor on a Friday afternoon and confirmed that the patient had visited an oncologist on Monday morning by seeing the oncologist’s notes in the system.

Larger systems can also invest in ways to make EMRs easier to use. For Blitzer and Zakrzewski that has meant funding to hire scribes who join physicians and patients in the exam room to document the encounter in the EMR letting the physician focus exclusively on the patient.

As if these disadvantages for independent practices were not enough the COVID-19 pandemic dealt them another huge blow as patient volumes and revenues shrank while medical supply expenses grew. In the face of these pressures Zakrzewski saw some colleagues in smaller practices go without a paycheck for several months a predicament that he and his employed colleagues were able to avoid.

Consulting firm McKinsey & Company predicts that COVID-19 will lead to more practice acquisitions with the pace accelerating in 2021 as smaller hospitals and independent physician groups seek partners to cushion the continuing financial fallout.

For hospitals owning physician practices offers protection against a rising tide of threats in a rapidly changing health care environment. Some especially in rural areas are trying to ensure that a base of primary care remains in their community. Others see the chance to steer physicians away from competing providers. Owning physician practices can provide protection against laws that restrict paying financial incentives for referrals.

For still others it is a way to maximize reimbursement under Medicare’s arcane and changing billing rules.

And of paramount importance to many hospitals consolidation is a way to leverage a larger size in bargaining with insurance companies.

The recent wave of practice acquisitions began about two years ago and it could turn out to alter the entire health-care landscape. It’s now not just hospitals that are snapping up practices. The share of acquisitions by private equity firms rose from 35% in 2016 to 77% in 2019. In 2018 they spent $32.9 billion on 647 health-care transactions twice the number as in 2014.

Insurance companies are also getting into the act. UnitedHealth Group’s Optum division employs more than 53000 primary-care and specialty physicians in several states. It recently acquired Surgical Care Affiliates a company that owns or operates 190 ambulatory surgery centers and surgical hospitals.

Even some insurers that do not own practices are welcoming the trend. For Donald Liss chief medical officer for Horizon Blue Cross in New Jersey negotiating with a single party is easier than with a host of smaller ones. The larger patient bases of bigger organizations also make it easier to try out “more creative and innovative arrangements” like paying for services based on their clinical value.

Where does all this leave patients?

Baron sees better care from more effective use of information systems. “Patients absolutely benefit when their clinicians have more information about them.”

And if you peel away the technology “clinical medicine is still clinical medicine” Liss observed. “It is still about an intense relationship between a physician and a patient.”

Whitlam met a coterie of health-policy experts including two health economists Dick Scotton and John Deeble. Scotton and Deeble proposed that Australia could replace private health insurance with a universal public health insurance scheme that would be funded by a 1 percent levy on taxable income. Whitlam was interested and asked them for a copy of their paper. The ALP leader subsequently announced that Labor would introduce a national health insurance scheme known as Medibank. The proposal became a centerpiece of Labor policy in the lead up to the 1969 election. Labor lost that time but only just. Crucially Medibank seemed to win the party votes. Labor formed a government after the 1972 election and Whitlam became prime minister. In August 1974 his government passed Medibank at a joint sitting of both houses of Parliament.

Why Australia Did Not Build a National Health Service Moss Cass was an unlikely broker for a national health insurance scheme. As a doctor he had written pamphlets that argued for a fully nationalized medical service staffed by salaried health professionals. This Cass argued would make it possible to abolish medical fees entirely. Making doctors salaried public employees was also attractive from a public-health point of view. A fee-for-service practitioner has a vested interest in your sickness; a salaried practitioner has a vested interest in your health. A fully public health system is thus better suited to providing preventative medicine. By contrast as an insurance scheme Medibank preserved the fee-for-service model while shifting the financial burden from individuals to the government. To understand why a public insurance scheme prevailed over a British-style National Health Service we need to backtrack a little. World War II was a watershed in the development of Australian social policy. The Curtin and Chifley Labor governments came out of the war committed to building a comprehensive social-welfare system. The government’s key advisory body on health policy the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) proposed replacing private practices with a coordinated system of hospitals and group-practice clinics. These were to be organized in a regional hierarchy staffed by a salaried medical service and administered by the Commonwealth Department of Health. A joint parliamentary committee on social security established in 1941 adopted the NHMRC’s recommendations more or less wholesale. The Curtin and Chifley Labor government opted for a less ambitious plan in the short term that would subsidize hospital treatment and the cost of pharmaceuticals. However even this proved problematic. In 1946 Chifley’s government successfully called a referendum on social services that gave the federal government power over a range of health and medical services. However Labor agreed to a proviso that this power would not “authorize any form of civil conscription.” The concession suggested that the Labor leadership had little interest in creating a nationalized salaried medical profession. A fee-for-service medical practitioner has a vested interest in your sickness; a salaried practitioner has a vested interest in your health. The Australian branch of the British Medical Association seized on this to launch a High Court challenge. They claimed that it amounted to “civil conscription” if a pharmaceutical benefit scheme required doctors to use an official government prescription pad and formulary to prescribe medicines. The High Court accepted this far-fetched claim making it clear that the legal system would deem a national health service unconstitutional. The medical profession presented a united front in its opposition to a pharmaceutical benefits scheme and “socialist” medicine. At the same time many doctors still thought preventative medicine could only be guaranteed by a salaried medical practice. For many general practitioners servicing low-income communities becoming a salaried public employee was more attractive than working under a fee-for-service model. In 1961 Whitlam conceded that Australia’s constitution ruled building a national health service on the British model. Instead he suggested that the Commonwealth Government could use its right to give state governments conditional financial grants as a work-around. It could still compel the states to build a regional network of hospitals staffed by salaried medical professionals. While the constitution precluded the “socialization of doctors” Whitlam argued it was no impediment to the “socialization of hospitals.” Although Cass would have favored shifting the emphasis from hospitals to general practice and community-based primary health care clinics this was a step forward. The 1969 Labor platform called for the provision of general practitioner medical services staffed by salaried medical practitioners willing to join and available without charge and without means test to persons who choose to use such services. However Whitlam ended up ignoring the party platform and proposing a tax-funded national insurance scheme instead.

Medibank vs. Public Health Care Despite its limitations Medibank was definitely an improvement on what had existed before. Postwar conservative governments had only provided free health services subject to a means test. Anyone who didn’t qualify had to take out private health insurance with the government limiting its role to subsidizing insurance providers. Families were allowed to claim the cost of their premiums as a tax deduction. By the mid-1960s around 15 percent of households lacked private insurance yet were barred from accessing free services by the means test. Many who did have cover still found themselves under-insured. Private insurers offered refunds as a proportion of doctors’ fees based on patients’ premiums the seriousness of their illness and the cost of the service. By the mid-1960s average insurance payouts only covered around two-thirds of fees. Those who could only afford lower premiums — or who presented with more serious illnesses — received even less. Australia’s private health insurance system gave better refunds to those who could pay higher premiums. Tax deductions also favored those with higher incomes. On top of this when medical fees rose insured patients had to cover the additional costs. When the government tried to narrow the gap between fees and refunds by increasing subsidies to insurers doctors simply raised their fees again.

The Birth of Medibank This was the system that Labor’s Medibank aimed to fix — and to a large extent it did. It was a remarkably equitable approach to health insurance. Medibank put Australia far ahead of countries like the United States that still rely on private insurance that is overwhelmingly linked to an ongoing employment contract. Along with guaranteeing free treatment in public hospitals Medibank set a standard rate for general practitioner visits while still allowing doctors to run private practices. Doctors could “bulk-bill” by accepting the scheduled fee set by Medibank effectively making consultations free for patients. Alternately if doctors wanted to charge more than the scheduled fee their patients had the option of paying the full fee upfront and claiming reimbursement to the value of the scheduled fee. While not a fully public health system Medibank was still a historic step forward. It was typical of Whitlam’s technocratic research-based and redistributive approach to welfare policy. While not a fully public health system Medibank was still a historic step forward. Whitlam did not give the health minister Doug Everingham responsibility for Medibank. Instead he gave it to Bill Hayden the social security minister. This decision was symptomatic of Whitlam’s general approach to health care and social welfare. Political scientist Peter Sloman has defined this approach as typical of the “transfer state.” Instead of providing high-quality public services funded by taxation it favors direct cash transfers that top up household incomes to reduce inequality. Whitlam wasn’t always averse to publicly owned services from education and social housing to sewerage and swimming pools. When it came to health however he opted to meet the Liberals on their own terrain accepting the insurance model of health care provision and introducing Medibank to make it more equitable. Instead of transforming the way health care was provided Whitlam’s reforms redistributed the cost of health insurance.

The Medibank Strike In November 1975 Australia’s governor general John Kerr sacked the Whitlam government with the backing of the Queen the CIA and the conservative opposition parties. The Liberal-National Coalition led by Malcolm Fraser won the following election. Immediately Fraser moved to water down Medibank initially by making it easy for people to opt out and purchase private health insurance instead. Fraser’s goal was to reduce Australia’s universal health insurance scheme to a residual system for low-income earners. This effectively abolished the guarantee of universal health insurance coverage. Although organized labor played little role in the development of Medibank the Coalition’s attack was the perfect opportunity for rank-and-file unionists to mobilize against the wider Fraser agenda. In July 1976 Australian unions called a national strike that saw up to two million workers walk off the job in defense of Medibank. It was one of the few general strikes in Australia’s history. In the mid ’70s the idea of striking to advance a nonindustrial political agenda was still relatively novel. However it was in line with an emerging trend toward politically oriented industrial action. Sydney building workers had pioneered “green bans” on ecologically historically or socially destructive projects. In the wake of Indonesia’s 1975 invasion of East Timor maritime unions placed bans on Indonesian shipping. Railway and maritime unions blockaded uranium shipments in support of the antinuclear movement. Unions in Queensland also launched political strikes defending civil liberties against Joh Bjelke-Petersen’s hard-right state government. The 24-hour Medibank general strike shut down public transport closed schools and most industrial enterprises and grounded aviation. Even pubs shut their doors. However the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) only grudgingly backed the strike. ACTU president Bob Hawke — who hailed from Labor’s right faction — believed that union militancy would stymie negotiations over Medibank between the trade union movement and the Fraser government. The ACTU did not organize union-sanctioned rallies or marches to back the rank-and-file driven 24-hour shutdown. The strike did not halt Fraser’s attacks on Medibank although it did delay them. Strike action also built broad public support for what was already one of Whitlam’s most popular reforms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vaG93LWludGVydmVudGlvbi1zY2hlbWUtZW5kcy1udXJzZS1wYXRpZW50LXJpZnQtZHJpdmVzLXNlcnZpY2UtZGVsaXZlcnktaW4tbmlnZXItcGhjcy_SAW5odHRwczovL3B1bmNobmcuY29tL2hvdy1pbnRlcnZlbnRpb24tc2NoZW1lLWVuZHMtbnVyc2UtcGF0aWVudC1yaWZ0LWRyaXZlcy1zZXJ2aWNlLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWluLW5pZ2VyLXBoY3MvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How intervention scheme ends nurse-patient rift drives service delivery in Niger PHCs,"Many primary health centres in Nigeria are famed for poor service delivery but a public-private partnership scheme in Niger State is reversing the trend AFEEZ HANAFI writes

Before now Saidu Aliyu and his wife Rasheedatu dreaded meeting nurses at the Senator Idris Ibrahim Kuta Memorial Primary Health Care Centre on Old Airport Road Chanchaga Minna in Niger State. Each time they visited the facility their hearts raced like those of erring individuals appearing before a cranky panel.

Until recent times having to contend with the attitude of most of the health workers discouraged the couple from visiting the health centre on several occasions.

Rasheedatu noticed a paradigm shift during an antenatal appointment sometime in July 2020. She was startled by the warm reception she received from the health workers and could not wait to return home to share the good news with her husband.

Expectedly Aliyu was amazed by his wife’s account and couldn’t wait to join her on the next appointment a month later to see things himself. He was impressed last August. Nurses who used to fume at any slight provocation had suddenly become friendly.

“We have a changed primary health centre now” 31-year-old Aliyu said in an encounter with our correspondent at the hospital in June 2021. “Their service is nice and the workers are now friendly they don’t shout at patients again.”

The couple had visited the hospital that Wednesday to vaccinate their six-month-old baby. Unlike their moody departure three years ago when they brought their first child for the same exercise they radiated excitement.

“I have been using this hospital for about six years and I gave birth to my first child here” Rasheedatu said. “It was last year when I came for antenatal that I noticed an improvement in their services and the way they relate with people” she added gaily.

PHC system and challenges in Nigeria

In line with the Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978 which among others identified primary health care as an integral service that should be made universally accessible to individuals and families at an affordable cost Nigeria came up with the National Basic Health Services Scheme to deliver PHC services across the country.

In 1985 the then Minister of Health Prof. Olikoye Ransome-Kuti adopted the PHC model in 52 local government areas based on the recommendation of the declaration and by 1990 it had been expanded to all local government areas. Also Nigeria’s first comprehensive national health policy based on PHC was launched in 1988.

In 1992 the National Primary Health Care Development Agency was established to sustain the PHC agenda but the military takeover in 1993 ended the giant strides recorded under the Ransome-Kuti leadership.

Nigeria currently boasts about 34000 PHCs; sadly most of them reportedly lack the capacity to provide essential healthcare services battle with poor staffing inadequate equipment inadequate distribution of health workers low quality healthcare services deteriorating infrastructure and lack of essential drug supply.

Many PHCs across the country have been bedeviled with these challenges amidst their attendant negative impacts including a high rate of maternal mortality estimated by the World Health Organisation at over 800 deaths per 100000 live births or about 58000 deaths recorded in 2015 alone.

According to WHO a Nigerian woman has a one in 22 lifetime risk of dying during pregnancy childbirth or postpartum; whereas in the most developed countries the lifetime risk is one in 4900.

Furthermore part of the problems adduced to poor performance of PHCs in Nigeria was its handing over to the local government administration in the 1980s. However in recent years federal and state governments embarked on interventions to check the ugly trend.

Niger State Primary Health Care Transformation

In October 2017 Niger State Government and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation signed a N1.2bn memorandum of understanding to improve healthcare delivery in the state.

The state Governor Abubakar Bello had said the four-year agreement spanning 2017 to 2021 would help to strengthen primary healthcare reduce pressure on the secondary health sector and bring healthcare services closer to the people.

“It has been observed that failure to provide a quality healthcare system in the past had led to all manner of clinics and hospitals especially in the rural areas” he had said.

The then state Commissioner for Health Mustapha Jibrin also noted that the MoU would strengthen the quality of data generation and engage 2500 health workers who would be trained and deployed in various health facilities within the communities.

The MoU stipulated that the state government and BMGF would make equal contributions to execute the scheme.

“The agreement has seven cardinal areas of focus” the Executive Director Niger State Primary Health Care Development Agency Dr Ibrahim Dangana told Sunday PUNCH.

He said “The thematic areas include: strengthening government health sector stewardship for leadership and governance; reducing out-of-pocket health expenditure and moving towards universal health coverage. It also sought to support a social contributory health insurance scheme.”

Dangana identified other aspects of the MoU as improving the availability of skilled manpower in primary health facilities improving data visibility quality and use ensuring quality and affordable health products as well as encouraging community participation.

He explained that one of the targeted objectives under leadership and governance was to fully implement primary health care under one roof noting the aim had been achieved.

He stated “Before this MoU primary health care was fragmented. There were some roles done by the Ministry of Health and some done by the Ministry of Local Government Affairs. For instance all the staff of primary health care centres were not under the Primary Health Care Development Agency. Their salaries and emoluments were under the Ministry of Local Government Affairs but they are our staff.

“So when you have issues like poor staff attitude truancy absenteeism and indiscipline we could not discipline the staff because we didn’t control their salaries. It is said that he who pays the piper calls the tune. Whether you talk to them or not at the end of the month they will receive their alerts.

“Also we could not effectively redistribute the staff; some facilities were overstaffed while others were understaffed. Many didn’t want to go to rural areas. Now with this MoU we have been able to achieve the transfer of salaries of staff from the Ministry of Local Government Affairs to the agency and since May 31 we have commenced screening and audit of the primary health care staff across all the 25 local government areas in the state.”

Dangana attributed the improved service delivery that the couple – Aliyu and Rasheedatu–recently witnessed at Senator Idris Ibrahim Kuta Memorial Primary Health Care Centre to the total control the agency now has over PHCs.

Outpatients demand more manpower others

Rasheedatu told Sunday PUNCH that services at the health facility were affordable but said drugs prescribed to her sometimes were beyond her means.

“They are expensive. Being a public hospital I think the government should be able to do something about it” the mother of two stated.

Apart from the Aliyus several other outpatients interviewed at the health centre and another facility at Tunga Tudunwada South along Bay Clinic Road in Minna attested that there was a remarkable difference in their relationship with health workers including corresponding better service delivery.

One of them Grace Ayodele said in her eight years of patronising the health centre she began to find fulfillment two years ago adding that “more doctors are needed.”

She said “I usually visit there whenever I fall sick and am unable to recover after three days. There was a time I stopped because I wasn’t getting quality services. That has changed now and the cost of services is affordable.”

Of the hurdles 34-year-old Funmilayo Bamigbola had to surmount each time she attended antenatal or took her two kids to the PHC in Tunga for immunisation coping with the hostile attitude of the health workers was the toughest. But in recent times such frosty disposition is no longer on her plate.

“Their services are now better and they attend to me in a friendly manner” she remarked.

However Bamigbola said mothers still endured having “to stay long” before being attended to when they took their babies to the hospital for immunisation.

“The government should provide more equipment especially in the labour room and expensive drugs should be provided at affordable prices” she added.

For Abigail John who has been visiting the health centre for three years ensuring regular sanitation of the facility seemed to be her only worry; poor attitude of health workers and substandard services had become things of the past.

She noted “There should be more cleaners and supervisors to make sure things are done at the right time but in terms of services they are really trying.”

Health workers battle increased patronage

Some nurses who spoke to our correspondent at the two primary health centres admitted that the transfer of workers’ salaries to NSPHCDA considerably led to change in attitude to work as the process empowered the agency to properly enforce discipline.

“Payment of salary by the agency is one of the best things that has happened to PHCs” Fati Saidu the Head of Senator Idris Ibrahim Kuta Memorial Primary Health Care Centre Fati Saidu stated.

“The agency knows us. They know those at work and those who are not coming to work; they know those that are qualified and those that are not they know those who know what they are doing and those who don’t. They know who deserves promotions. All primary health workers should be under the agency; that is the best way to go” she added.

Saidu stated that mutual relations between health workers and patients had increased patronage compared to the low turnout in 2018 when she was posted to the centre.

Consequently the overwhelming patronage warranted that activities were rescheduled to serve the people Saidu stated.

She explained “We run services here 24 hours on shifts. On a daily basis we attend to more than 50 people with different kinds of sickness. Most times they complain of fever malaria diarrhoea cough and cold. We attend to more than 100 persons that come for antenatal and immunisations every day. The workload is fair because there is division of labour.”

Rohina Manuga is one of the volunteer health care workers under Saidu. She helps in managing the high turnout at the hospital attending to accident victims providing antenatal care and immunisation for children.

“Even though I am not paid I enjoy what I do. I am happy seeing people receiving care. I hope one day the government will consider giving me employment” she said.

Her co-volunteers Sekinat Kudu and Khadija Hassan – both health information officials – exude the same zeal.

“I resume work early every day and do a lot of desk work. I do them with joy because I don’t want to sit at home doing nothing” Kudu said.

The officer in charge of the health care centre at Tunga Mrs Aishetu Ibrahim also said improved service delivery had led to massive patronage of the facility since 2018.

She stated “The way we attend to patients has really improved. We now get free drugs especially for malaria which we also give out free to patients. That encourages more people to visit the health centre. We attend to about 100 people per day.”

Mobilisers driving patronage

As one of the key means of delivering the MoU a platform known as Community Health Influencers and Promoters Services was recently explored Dangana the NSPHCDA director maintained.

The CHIPS agents composed mainly of secondary school leavers were selected from various communities based on the recommendation of community members to encourage more people to seek health care services.

They were trained to provide door-to-door basic health care services refer people to the health facilities in serious cases and were provided with tools for reporting their daily activities.

These include a household register containing the number of people living in that community; client register containing names of the households and their children and drug forms the director said.

He added “We also provide them with a full complement of drugs they need to work with. This includes basic testing kits for malaria pregnancy testing kits malnutrition testing devices called MUAC tapes. The drugs we give them include anti-malaria drugs drugs for treating pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections multivitamins ORS for treating diarrhoea etc.

“We provide the CHIPS agents with these drugs on a monthly basis. When they are running out of drugs they return to the central facility in their community and we restock them based on what they submitted.

“This veritable vehicle though a national initiative is being robustly funded by the MoU including the monthly stipends we give them. So far we have selected about 960 CHIPS agents and we deployed them on April 15 when the programme was launched by the governor.”

Agency struggles to attain goals despite limited funding

While some aspects of the MoU are already yielding positive results other areas have suffered setbacks largely due to the limited state government funding.

For instance contributory health insurance targeted at reducing out-of-pocket expenses has yet to fully take off almost three years into the agreement.

Dangana noted that budgetary release from the government was limited as a result of the fallen revenue “both internally and nationally.”

“So there is a constraint in terms of government funding of key activities. There is delay in the takeoff of the state contributory health insurance scheme because the MoU seeks to reduce out-of-pocket expenses but a lot needs to be done to ensure that the state contributory health insurance kicks off fully.

“There are still teething challenges in ensuring that the health insurance is fully launched and effective. There is also a slow pace in the recruitment of health workers. The MoU seeks to maximise the manpower gaps but at the moment the state is constrained in taking new manpower because of the financial constraint.

“Funding has impacted on some of the key areas that the MoU wants to strengthen. We are on course and gradually we will surmount those challenges.”

The director further stated that the agency was limited to thematic areas identified in the agreement as the resources could not be deployed for some other weak areas in the system.

He added “We also have a challenge ensuring smooth inter-sectoral synergy and coordination. The transfer of salary of health workers for instance did not come on a silver platter.”

While the salary transfer of health workers recruitment and training of CHIPS agents have birthed some improvement in service delivery at PHCs in Niger State residents look forward to a better health care system which full implementation of the MoU will guarantee.

'Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam' is the state government's programme to deliver essential healthcare services at people's doorsteps. It is aimed at eliminating the need for patients to visit hospitals to treat non-communicable diseases.

The scheme will screen people above 45 years of age and other infirmities through routine door-to-door check-ups. This is intended to diagnose and treat non-communicable diseases that cause sudden deaths and impact the quality of life.

Vision Of Scheme

In the presence of Health Minister Ma. Subramanian Stalin declared that this scheme is a pioneer in India and is part of his government's 7-point vision to ensure enhanced quality of life for all. ""Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam will ring in an era of healthcare delivery where people need not come to the hospitals but have access to medicine and screening at their doorstep"" The Hindu quoted him as saying.

In the first phase the scheme will deploy 1264 women health workers 50 physiotherapists and 50 nurses overall. It will cover 1172 health sub-centres 189 primary health centres and 50 community health centres in 50 universal health coverage blocks. An amount of ₹ 242 crore has been allocated for this scheme which is expected to benefit 1 crore people from 30 lakh families. The scheme is open for seven districts: Chennai Coimbatore Madurai Salem Thanjavur Tiruchi and Tirunelveli.

By the end of 2021 the state government plans to extend the programme across the whole state after introducing 25000 additional healthcare volunteers and nurses.

Benefits Of Scheme

The Tamil Nadu Health and Family Welfare Department released an order stating that the scheme would focus on community-based interventions to improve compliance and disease control in the state. An essential feature of the scheme is that every beneficiary listed under this scheme will also be brought under the Population Health Registry (PHR). The PHR will thus become the common denominator and make sure that the patients receive constant monitoring and follow-up.

The scheme also pressed into service a 108 ambulance for exclusive emergency response in remote areas like Bettamugilalam and its surrounding villages in Thally.

Diabetes and high blood pressure are largely undiagnosed in the villages. These problems are expected to be solved through this scheme. Those in need of physiotherapy will also receive care. Also this scheme will detect congenital disabilities in children and kidney ailments following it up with treatment at the hospital. Eventually those in need will also receive dialysis through portable dialysis machines.

Significance Post Covid

According to the order the coronavirus pandemic institutional-based care delivery access to drugs dialysis facilities senior care services palliative care etc. was compromised during the lockdown which resulted in increased infection and death rates. This has highlighted that there is a need to strengthen the responsiveness of the state's health system by providing holistic home-based healthcare addressing the health needs of all household members. Thus Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam was launched to offer a comprehensive set of such services and ensure continuity of care and sustainability of all services.

Being on lockdown and having to stay home while attending synchronous and asynchronous schooling will have distressing long-term effects including the emergence of violence against children.

Violence against children had already been a serious concern even before the pandemic. According to the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF 2015) two in three kids went through physical violence two in five underwent psychological violence one in four suffered sexual violence and two in three experienced peer violence. All in all eight out of 10 children in the country are victims of physical sexual and cyber sexual abuse.

Undeniably the pandemic has intensified poverty which is the underlying factor that causes the increase in child abuse marriages and exploitation with victims mostly coming from low-income families.

Leah Bordlee (2020) wrote in a Borgen Project blog that COVID-19 has exacerbated cyber-trafficking and “increasing risks of poverty” will lead to the growth to the online exploitation of children. “This relationship suggests a strong link between poverty and exploitation.”

The occurrence of lockdowns has made children more vulnerable to violence. According to UNICEF (2020) 1.8 billion children living in 104 countries including the Philippines are at risk due to the disrupted violence prevention and response services.

Aggravating the situation is the fact that the age of sexual consent in the Philippines is 12 years old the lowest in Asia and the second lowest in the world. Why is it that the law does not consider a 16-year-old fit to drive but makes a 12-year-old capable of having sex?

Gaps do exist in our laws and law enforcement when it comes to creating protective measures against the abuse of children. Congress should change the age of sexual consent in the face of the rise of online sexual exploitation and abuse of children (OSEAC). Senator Win Gatchalian has proposed raising the age of sexual consent to 18 in Senate Bill No. 739.

Further Republic Act No. 9775 or “An Act Defining the Crime of Child Pornography Prescribing Penalties Therefor and for Other Purposes” has to be amended. It penalizes foreigners with a lenient sentence: “he/she shall be immediately deported after the complete service of his/her sentence and shall forever be barred from entering the country.” With online sexual exploitation and abuse as the focal point of the law the pedophile may victimize children again using the Information Communication Technologies (ICT) from other parts of the world. The perpetrators of OSEAC are usually foreign-based older men in most cases from Western countries (The ASEAN Post 2020).

Society tends to forget that human rights include children’s rights. In this regard Senate Bill No. 1373 known as the “Girls Not Brides Act” or “An Act Protecting Children by Prohibiting and Declaring Child Marriage as Illegal and Providing Programs and Penalties Thereof” deserves support. The bill features an inclusive response mobilizing different agencies as “Duty-Bearers” for children empowerment and prevention of child marriage. However the penalties stated in the bill are light: “Any person who causes fixes facilitates or arranges a child marriage shall be fined at least P40000” and “Should the perpetrator of the child marriage be an ascendant or authority figure such as a parent step-parent or guardian of the minor a fine of at least P50000.” A low-cost fine in exchange for a lifelong trauma.

Actualizing protective measures has been a problem as well. According to the Office of Cybercrime at the Department of Justice 11 years have passed since the passing of the “Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009” but ISP (Internet Service Providers) companies are deficient in fulfilling their duty to protect Filipino children. Blocking child pornography is part of the requirements for ISP companies to retain their franchises.

The Office of Cybercrime has reported a 260% increase in cyber-sex offenses during the pandemic specifically online sexual exploitation and abuse of children (ChildFund 2020). This can be traced to the current stressors that lead families to put their children at risk for sexual exploitation including loss of income and suspension of face-to-face classes.

The data show the increase of family-related online sexual exploitation during the pandemic. According to World Hope International (2020) in a recent finding of its partner organization International Justice Mission OSEAC is usually a family-based crime. They found that of the 217 victims where the relationship to the trafficker was known the abuse was perpetrated by biological parents (41%) and other relatives (42%). With the emergence of social media it is easier to create a platform for an illegal family business to exploit children.

Child abuse in the Philippines is a public health crisis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) children who are exposed to an abusive environment are more likely to acquire chronic mental health problems such as bipolar disorder anxiety borderline personality disorder depression and grief. Studies show an evident correlation of child abuse to poor performance in school and overall mishandling or abuse of drugs and sexual intercourse.

The Universal Health Care (UHC) Law provides service coverage to access mental health services and rehabilitation that will strongly help victims of child abuse in the country. However these services still do not come free and are not inclusive. The government’s health spending has not been properly allocated to what has most value. Financing is inadequate for primary care services preventive health services and health promotion key components of UHC. Similarly government spending has to generate efficiencies lower costs and improve quality (Asian Development Bank 2021).

Further information is lacking about access to these services. The public for example is not familiar with the “Essential Health Benefit Package” of the UHC which includes primary care services diagnostic laboratory tests and medicine. Preventive curative and rehabilitative care must likewise provide mental health and emergency services.

The Philippines can learn harm reduction strategies from other countries. We can learn from Canada’s program to increase funding on sexual assault centers that provide safe accommodation to child abuse survivors. The funding for such may be added to the Bayanihan III bill or next year’s General Appropriations Act.

Safe accommodation for abused children can be supplemented by assistance from non-government organizations that offer face-to-face visits and consultations to houses reported regarding domestic abuse of children. For example the UNICEF together with the Child Protection Network and Ateneo de Manila University created Masayang Pamilya (MaPa) Sa Panahon ng COVID-19. This program prevents child abuse with the use of positive parenting and enhancing family sensitivity.

MaPa is a community-focused parent support intervention that is designed to specifically target low-income areas. Parents are encouraged to participate in discussions understand skills and practice role modeling. This initiative uses support rather than condemnation as the way of parenting.

This program is laudable in its effort to build relationships with parents that focus on empathy and education. However to build a stronger harm reduction strategy the government (through enabling policy and providing resources) the health community and other stakeholders should be included in this conversation.

Empowering children with education and awareness about child abuse is one step towards harm reduction. The community must also be involved stay observant of abuse situations and report suspected abuse cases.

We are aware of the rising number of children experiencing abuse and violence. We are pained by their life-long trauma and sufferings.

The government and society must act now. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic our government called us to heal us one. The healing must include the children of this nation.

Bicicletas muebles colchones y electrodomésticos comenzarán a venderse a plazos desde la segunda quincena de agosto en la unidad La Campana ubicada en el municipio de Santa Clara al centro de Cuba informaron las autoridades del territorio.

Según reportes del semanario Vanguardia el Grupo Empresarial de Comercio (GEC) en Villa Clara crea actualmente las condiciones para iniciar la venta minorista de bienes duraderos y otros artículos mediante el pago a plazos con “la intención de satisfacer necesidades de la población”.

La nueva modalidad de venta está amparada en la Resolución 98/2021 aprobada por el Ministerio de Comercio Interior el pasado 21 de julio. Además de las ventas a plazos también la resolución recogió la comercialización de productos de segunda mano en las denominadas “ventas de garaje”.

No obstante cada modalidad de venta tiene sus propias regulaciones y serán las administraciones locales quienes aprueben y supervisen muchas de estas formas comerciales.

En el caso específico de Villa Clara Yoel Romero Hernández director de Ventas Minoristas del GEC indicó que se tomará a Santa Clara como prueba inicial para estudiar el funcionamiento de estos procesos comerciales. Una vez que se monitoree y analice el funcionamiento de las ventas se implementarán a lo largo de la provincia a inicios de septiembre partiendo desde las cabeceras municipales.

La unidad seleccionada para comenzar las ventas será La Campana tienda de productos industriales ubicada en una céntrica arteria de la ciudad a pocos pasos del parque Vidal. No obstante el funcionario aclara que en estos momentos no se comercializarán electrodomésticos en la unidad.

“Trabajamos también en la captación de artículos procedentes de las industrias del territorio que los produzcan con el acercamiento a trabajadores por cuenta propia y al Fondo Cubano de Bienes Culturales para establecer contratos” indicó Romero sobre la posibilidad de incluir a cuentapropistas en estos procesos.

En la edición extraordinaria No. 66 de la Gaceta Oficial se publicó la Resolución 97 de 2021 donde se detallaron las nuevas normativas concernientes a las ventas a plazos y a las de garaje.

En el caso de las ventas de garaje el documento plantea que para realizar esta actividad las personas no necesitan licencias de cuentapropistas y los artículos a comercializar deben ser de uso doméstico y personal usados seminuevos y nuevos.

Respecto a las ventas a plazo aunque Yoel Romero aclara que ninguna entidad financiera intervendrá en el proceso y sólo se efectuará la transacción entre un establecimiento minorista y el cliente sí habrá una tasa de recargo de al menos 25 % del valor del artículo.

Además las ventas a plazo sólo procederán para la adquisición de artículos duraderos que excedan los 2500 pesos CUP.

“El primer pago no será inferior al 20 % del costo del artículo. El resto se negocia con la unidad minorista a partir de la capacidad de pago de cada cual” indicó el funcionario.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsc29sZGVpcmFwdWF0by5jb20ubXgvbG9jYWwvZXNjYXNhLXZlbnRhcy1kZS11dGlsZXMtZXNjb2xhcmVzLTcwNTU4MzkuaHRtbNIBV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsc29sZGVpcmFwdWF0by5jb20ubXgvbG9jYWwvZXNjYXNhLXZlbnRhcy1kZS11dGlsZXMtZXNjb2xhcmVzLTcwNTU4MzkuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Escasa ventas de útiles escolares,"“Casi nadie ha venido a surtir su lista” expresó Verónica Ayala comerciante de útiles escolaresquien aseguró que las ventas de productos básicos para este regreso a clases no han sido las esperadas.

La comerciante añadió que pese a que estos días no se han obtenido las ventas fructíferas que se pretendían esperan que en el transcurso de las semanas comiencen a repuntar sus ventas y que no haya de nueva cuenta un cierre de las escuelas ya que eso les podría representar un duro golpe a su economía.

El siempre activo Dee Snider no deja de compartir datos curiosos en los medios. Hace nada afeó a Gene Simmons (Kiss) que dijera que el rock está muerto echó la culpa a Disney de su contagio de Covid y hasta apoyó a David Ellefson expulsado de Megadeth. Recientemente también le dio por recordar días pasados como cuando quiso pegar a los miembros de Manowar.

En esta senda de mirar hacia atrás podrían englobarse sus últimas declaraciones a Jimmy Kay y Alan Dixon de The Metal Voice en las que reveló que Twisted Sister no empezó a recibir dinero por las ventas de sus discos hasta más de una década después de la publicación de ‘Stay Hungry’. En concreto decía lo siguiente: “Twisted Sister no empezaron a recibir dinero por la venta de discos hasta que grabamos “Heroes Are Hard To Find” para la banda sonora de ‘Strangeland’. Para reunir a la banda la discográfica eliminó la deuda. Esto fue en 1997. Habíamos estado separados durante diez años. Habíamos vendido millones de discos y no habíamos visto nada de dinero”.

Al parecer los asuntos de los grupos no debían llegar hasta las mentes de los altos directivos: “Alguien debió llamar la atención a Ahmet Ertegun (cofundador y presidente de Atlantic Records) por el hecho de que todavía seguíamos en números rojos tantos años después. Intentaron atraernos y dijeron: “Ahmet ¿te importaría poner la cuenta a cero de estos muchachos? ¿No tenemos ya suficiente?”. Pero Ahmet Ertegun probablemente no sabía nada de todo esto. Él es el fundador de Atlantic Records. Estaba por encima de eso. Era como el Clive Davis de Atlantic Records”.

Snider y compañía tuvieron suerte porque el gerifalte estaba al tanto del asunto: “Vio todo y dijo: “Ya han pagado bastante”. Por lo tanto deberían haber estado recibiendo dinero por las ventas de los discos. ¿Y lo que nos correspondería a nosotros? ¿Esa gran cantidad? Nunca la recibimos”.

Dee que figura como autor de toda la música y letras de Twisted Sister clarificó que su discográfica recopiló los derechos que le corresponderían como cantautor que no eran parte del contrato con Atlantic. “Los cantautores tienen derechos de cantautores y yo era un cantautor eso conseguí. Son algo independiente de la banda y de la discográfica…Finalmente me pagaron por suerte. Teníamos todavía pendiente el dinero por las ventas de los discos. En 1997 empezamos a recibir algo. ¿En qué año salió Napster? ¿2001? Unos años más tarde la gente dejó de comprar discos así que las cantidades por la venta de discos eran una broma. Spotify no paga nada nada” explicaba.

No no estoy hablando otro idioma hoy quiero regalarte una información que te ayudará a ser más persuasivo con tu cliente.

Son tres preguntas que te ayudarán a cerrar más ventas utilizando algunas estrategias de persuasión que puedes aplicar cuando vayas a presentar una propuesta escribir un post enviar un WhatsApp negociar llamar por teléfono etc.

Actualmente estoy leyendo el libro PRE-SUASIÓN de Robert Cialdini. Para quien no lo conozca es un psicólogo reconocido autor de varios libros entre los más importantes están: Psicología de la Persuasión y Pre-suasión.

Prepararse antes de llegar con el cliente

En este libro habla entre otras cosas que para persuadir hay que pre-suadir es decir prepararse antes de llegar con el cliente tener las herramientas listas y dejar de lado la improvisación para que seas realmente efectivo y logres los objetivos que te propones.

Lo que me llevó a estas 3 preguntas que te ayudarán precisamente a lograr preparar el terreno de la persuasión.

Empecemos:

1) ¿Qué quieres que piense el cliente cuando te lea o te escuche?

Cialdini dice que si algo es focal entonces es causal es decir cuando nos descubrimos centrándonos en algún factor es más probable que lleguemos a pensar en él como una causa.

“La atención canalizada puede hacer que los receptores estén pre-suasivamente más abiertos a un mensaje antes que lleguen a procesarlo”.

Es decir cuando vayas a presentar una propuesta prepara lo que vas a decir y en qué punto quieres que el cliente se enfoque. Así contextualizarás todo el escenario y tu receptor estará con mayor disposición hacia eso que quieres que él vea.

Nuestro cerebro dentro de sus maravillas hace 3 cosas que debemos tomar en cuenta:

Generaliza Elimina Distorsiona

Hoy me voy a enfocar en la parte de la eliminación porque guarda mucha relación con el enfoque.

Se elimina cuando focalizas tu visión únicamente en aquello que deseas alejándote de otras opciones que también existen. Como cuando tienes ganas de pizza y no ves otros restaurantes porque lo único que deseas es eso.

“Si algo es focal entonces es causal”

El concepto de eliminar está bastante alineado al punto de Cialdini donde dice: “si algo es focal entonces es causal”. Es decir donde esté dirigida nuestra atención se convertirá en una realidad eliminando por completo otras opciones.

La publicidad lo usa muchísimo cuando te hace preguntas como:

“¿Estás cansado de hacer muchas dietas y que ninguna resulte?” (ya con esto enfoca tu cerebro al punto donde él quiere llegar) y muestra una persona con sobrepeso cara de tristeza y haciendo lo que generalmente hacen todos ejercicios alimentación pastillas etc y nada le funciona.

Lo que está haciendo esta publicidad es dirigiendo tus pensamientos a una condición única dejando de lado otras opciones que también existen y funcionan pero ese es el foco y por consecuencia es la causa. Es lo que ellos quieren que veas.

La verdad es que la publicidad debería mostrarle a los clientes opciones diciendo cosas como: “Cuando haces dieta ¿trabajas tu mente? ¿tienes apoyo de un coach que te ayude a mantener la motivación? un nutricionista que guíe tu alimentación un entrenador que te diga los ejercicios que puedes hacer”. Eso amplía las posibilidades del cliente pero posiblemente aleje al vendedor de su objetivo con el prospecto porque lo hace desviar la mirada.

Sabiendo todo esto y volviendo a la primera pregunta:

¿Qué quieres que piense tu cliente?

Prepara todo lo que vas a decir para que tu receptor se enfoque exactamente en lo que tú esperas no improvises.

Tampoco creas que el cliente es un tonto y tú eres un mago encantador. Si quieres lograr resultados y ser realmente efectivo entonces cuando vayas a redactar el próximo correo léelo y revisa si lo que dices hará que el cliente piense exactamente lo que quieres.

Te pregunto: ¿Estás enfocando las ideas hacia ese punto que lo hace considerarte?

Si queremos que el cliente piense que somos una empresa confiable respóndete cuáles serían los datos que necesitarías para generar esa sensación.

Ejemplo:

Estadísticas.

Testimonios.

Clientes.

Resultados.

Presentar los puntos de dolor y sus posibles causas.

Etc.

No asumas que por decir “Somos una empresa de calidad y alta trayectoria” ya estás logrando esa sensación.

Contextualiza para que focalices y los resultados sean los que tú deseas.

Segunda pregunta que debes hacerte para ser más efectivo en tu proceso comercial:

2) ¿Qué quieres que sienta?

Si ya establecimos lo que queremos que piense entonces ahora toca crear la emoción que debe sentir cuando nos lea. Porque al final las ventas son emoción.

¿Quieres que se sientan alegres confiados prevenidos emocionados?

Utiliza palabras y acciones que generen ese tipo de sensación.

Les voy a dar un ejemplo:

La marca de juegos de Microsoft introdujo el Xbox Adaptive Controller en los EE. UU un nuevo dispositivo para que las personas que sufren de alguna discapacidad puedan disfrutar de los videojuegos.

Microsoft trabajó para que sus controles fueran inclusivos para todos.

Si miras la publicidad está muy claro que la emoción es: inclusión inspiración superación motivación pero sobre todo que sientan alegría porque al fin una marca se preocupa por ellos.

Por lo tanto determina la emoción que quieres que sienta tu cliente al leerte o conocerte y prepárate para lograrlo.

Herramientas que tienes para lograrlo: Tu voz tus palabras tu lenguaje corporal tu escritura.

Debes tomar en cuenta que no sólo estás vendiendo el producto sino a ti como vendedor cuando hagas la presentación de la propuesta al cliente debes agregarte dentro de esa emoción porque ellos no te conocen.

Usa frases como:

“Estaré acompañándote hasta el final”

“Me encantará ayudarte en todo el proceso”

“Ya este tipo de procedimiento lo he realizado “X” cantidad de veces así que sé exactamente lo que te puede funcionar”.

Por favor sólo di lo que realmente harás no queremos vendedores de humo.

Y finalmente la tercera pregunta es:

3) ¿Qué quieres que haga?

Cuál es la acción que quieres que realice el cliente: ¿te responda el correo? te diga cuándo se pueden reunir ¿quieres que te coloque la orden de compra? ¿le de like a tu post? ¿te llame?.

Toda tu presentación ha sido el medio para llegar a este punto éste es el que menos debe quedar al azar.

Fue para este momento que te preparaste y organizaste la información aquí es donde se hace evidente que tú planificación fue efectiva.

Si los resultados no son los que esperabas entonces hay que corregir algunos detalles y volver.

Lo que no debes hacer es rendirte o generalizar con palabras como: “a mí nunca me sale bien” “siempre me pongo nervioso”.

Te digo un secreto que aprendí con Jordan Belfort el lobo de Wall Street:

En una conversación la persona que tenga mayor convicción cuando habla gana la conversación.

Y para estar en un estado de certeza y convicción es necesario estar seguro de lo que vas a decir de los beneficios que ofreces pero sobretodo estar preparado sin dejar nada al azar.

Ten presente siempre estas 3 preguntas para todo. Tus llamadas redacción de correos presentación de presupuestos etc.

¿Qué quieres que piense el cliente?

¿Qué quieres que sienta?

Y finalmente y la más importante ¿Qué quieres que haga?

Grant Cardone dice que las ventas se pierden por los vendedores no por los clientes.

Dejemos de improvisar y comencemos a ser creadores de circunstancias.

La Pre- Suasión que aunque es una palabra que no existe sino inventada por Cialdini lo que busca es que prepares todo el escenario para que eso que estás buscando ocurra.

¿Quieres cerrar más ventas conectar mejor con tus clientes y elevar tus estándares de vida?

Entonces la preparación y formación es la regla mi papá siempre me ha dicho que el conocimiento es poder y un comercial preparado definitivamente hace la diferencia.

Shanghai China October 21 2020.

That puts pressure on both companies to sell consumers on why they should choose AT&T and Verizon — making 5G a marketing challenge as Americans emerge from pandemic quarantines.

""A focus on 5G isn't going to be flattering to either Verizon or AT&T"" said Craig Moffett a wireless analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""They are falling far behind T-Mobile in what will soon matter most: 5G speed and coverage. And they charge consumers much higher prices than T-Mobile.""

AT&T and Verizon want to transfer customers as fast as possible to 5G networks — not just to recoup the heavy capital expenditure costs of building out updated nationwide networks but also to lock in customers and keep them from defecting to T-Mobile .

""We almost lost the year"" said David Christopher EVP of partnerships & 5G ecosystem development for AT&T. ""But now people are excited to get out of their homes and experience 5G in the wild. We will dramatize use cases that matter to customers.""

Then the pandemic hit and with everyone stuck at home showing off blazing speeds and consumer use cases in stadiums airports and public places wasn't just irrelevant — it was gauche. Cloud gaming checking instant odds on gambling apps from stadiums and downloading Netflix movies at the airport became far less important than the ability to work from home — a better message for cable companies who already deliver high-speed home broadband.

U.S. wireless giants AT&T and Verizon had big plans last year to advertise why customers should upgrade their phones and start using 5G wireless.

Getting Americans excited about 5G may not be easy.

A J.D. Power survey last year found that only about a quarter of wireless subscribers said they believed 5G would be significantly faster than current 4G LTE technology and only 5% of respondents said they'd be willing to pay more for 5G service.

Even the CEO of AT&T Communications Jeff McElfresh told CNBC last year he has ""always tried to soften folks' expectations around 5G.""

Much of the messaging about 5G so far has been about enterprise solutions. A Deloitte Insights consumer survey this year found that consumer use cases that demand the faster network simply don't exist yet.

Verizon last year helped produce a documentary on 5G called ""Speed of Thought"" which showed enterprise-focused examples such as a robotic arm that a physician can use from anywhere and an augmented reality helmet for firefighters to help see through smoke. It also explored cities testing out 5G-enabled technology to avoid car collisions.

AT&T leaders have also said 5G's real opportunity is in the business cases particularly in the case of machines and equipment that are communicating via internet-of-things technology.

But both companies plan to illustrate specific consumer use cases in advertisements in the coming months to convince customers to upgrade.

In an outline of its 5G strategy for this year AT&T detailed use cases including AR-aided shopping experiences for consumers in stores and downloading content at airports. Earlier this year AT&T announced it would give its customers access to Bookful which creates augmented reality experiences around books to try to improve reading comprehension. Christopher said viewing a street map through a phone is reliable and seamless in 5G more easily allowing for activity like an augmented reality guide to a city whereas it would have consistently lagged with 4G.

Verizon is currently running a number of 5G-related TV ad spots including those with ""Saturday Night Live"" star Kate McKinnon about a promotion to receive $800 for a 5G phone when consumers trade in their old device.

Verizon has also done some marketing around what its 5G will do for gaming both in its Super Bowl spot earlier this year and a digital video released in May that tried to illustrate what video game-like lag would look like in everyday life

But the Verizon campaigns don't yet show why 5G is necessary or important for average consumers.

In one recent Verizon ad viewers see a series of images — a man climbing a cell tower a thunderstorm cars driving on the street landscape shots of cities — with voiced-over statements about ""next generation service"" ""broader spectrum"" and ""the more going the extra mile matters."" But the only clear consumer use case shown in the one-minute commercial is video chatting — an activity that doesn't require 5G.

It's possible 5G advertising could backfire on both companies if consumers view networks as interchangeable and simply choose the lowest-price offering — which will be T-Mobile Moffett said.

Christopher points out that educating consumers about 5G will benefit the entire industry. ""We're not going to spend our resources talking about the other guy"" he said. ""Everything educates the customer about the broad benefits of 5G as a category and that's a good thing too. We're happy with that.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvdmVyaXpvbi1hbmQtYXQtdC1wbGFuLW9uLWNoYW5naW5nLXRoZS1mb2N1cy1vZi10aGVpci01Zy1hZHMtdG8tY29uc3VtZXJzX2lkMTM0MTg40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Battling T-Mobile Verizon and AT&T plan on showing in new ads why consumers need 5G service,"Verizon and AT&T had to scramble in order to change their 5G marketing schemes during the pandemic. CNBC says that both carriers had plans last year to show consumers via advertisements why they need to upgrade their phones and wireless plans to include 5G connectivity. But when the pandemic hit all of a sudden showing how much faster 5G speeds help users download streaming movies in seconds wasn't as important as showing consumers how 5G helps them work from home a message more in line with promoting cable firms.

Verizon and AT&T plan on showing why consumers need 5G in new ads







Both Verizon and AT&T want to sign up as many new 5G subscribers as quickly as possible. CNBC says that the goal is to recover the high costs of building out nationwide 5G coverage but also to keep subscribers from switching to T-Mobile. The latter not only ""tends to offer the cheapest prices among the big three"" according to the report but it also tops ""both Verizon and AT&T in download speed and 5G availability according to Open Network's July 2021 5G User Experience Report.""





Craig Moffett a wireless analyst at MoffettNathanson says that everything is going T-Mobile's way right now as the nation's second-largest carrier is using its triple-layer cake 5G coverage (combining low mid and high-band spectrum to offer nationwide coverage with decent 5G download speeds.







Moffet says ""A focus on 5G isn't going to be flattering to either Verizon or AT&T. They are falling far behind T-Mobile in what will soon matter most: 5G speed and coverage. And they charge consumers much higher prices than T-Mobile."" As a result Verizon and AT&T are looking to produce ads that explain why consumers need to subscribe to their 5G service instead of T-Mobile's and that is going to be a challenge.





AT&T plans on showing people using 5G while out and about despite the higher number of cases that are being discovered daily. David Christopher Executive Vice President of partnerships & 5G ecosystem development for AT&T says ""We almost lost the year. But now people are excited to get out of their homes and experience 5G in the wild. We will dramatize use cases that matter to customers.""





While 5G download speeds will eventually be much faster than 4G LTE speeds the fact is that the largest area of 5G coverage in the states is from low-band spectrum which travels long distances but often delivers download speeds not much faster than 4G LTE. This is where T-Mobile's purchase of Sprint last year was a big deal since it provided the former with plenty of mid-band spectrum that the other carriers are not yet using.





Mid-band airwaves travel farther than mmWave but not as far as low-band. They deliver faster speeds than low-band but not as fast as mmWave. Mid-band 5G spectrum is a compromise that allows T-Mobile to deliver faster 5G service in more locations than the competition. But with more of the country experiencing slower low-band 5G this explains why a J.D. Power survey taken last year showed that only 25% of Americans believe that 5G will be much faster than the current 4G LTE service provided by carriers.

SNL's Kate McKinnon is the current face of Verizon 5G







The survey also revealed that only 5% of those responding said that they are willing to pay more for 5G. The CEO of AT&T Communications Jeff McElfresh said that he has ""always tried to soften folks' expectations around 5G.""

While Verizon and AT&T have focused on 5G use in the workplace both said that they will soon start advertising 5G from a standpoint of consumer use. Verizon's current 5G ads starring the talented Kate McKinnon from Saturday Night Live focus on its current deal that will give consumers trading in a phone up to $800 toward the purchase of a 5G-enabled handset.







While that sounds like a sweet deal it fails to show why 5G service is important and necessary for Verizon customers to have. Expect to see that in the next wave of 5G ads for Verizon and AT&T.

According to their announcement the map displays the areas covered by the four major wireless carriers in the country: AT&T T-Mobile Verizon Wireless and US Cellular.

Through the map users can see where they can expect 4G LTE broadband service with at least 5Mbps download speed and 1Mbps upload speed. There are separate layers for broadband and voice coverage from each carrier. This way you know the areas where you can still make and receive mobile voice and text messages over the 4G LTE network.

It gets its data submitted voluntarily by the four wireless carriers. The availability of such a map follows the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability (DATA) Act that was signed in March 2020.

The coverage map does not include home internet availability. It also shows coverage that customers can expect when they are outdoors and stationary. The map does not provide information when a user is indoors or on board a moving vehicle.

Right now the map does not include 5G coverage. Hopefully this will be included in the future once it becomes widely available.

First spotted by security firm Bad Packets earlier this week and confirmed by Juniper Labs on Friday the attacks are exploiting a vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021-20090.

Discovered by Tenable security researcher Evan Grant earlier this year the vulnerability resides in the firmware code produced by Taiwanese tech firm Arcadyan.

Grant says the vulnerability has existed in the code for at least ten years and has made its way into the firmware of at least 20 router and modem models sold by 17 different vendors which based their products on a white-label version of old Arcadyan devices.

The list of affected devices includes some of today's biggest router vendors and internet service providers such as ASUS Orange Vodafone Telstra Verizon Deutsche Telekom British Telecom and many others.

Besides the wide impact the bug wasn't initially a big deal. Found earlier this year and patched in April the vulnerability never came under attack until this week.

Exploitation only started Thursday this week two days after Grant published an in-depth technical write-up which also included proof-of-concept code.

Bad Packets co-founder and CTO Troy Mursch told The Record the attacks are leveraging the proof-of-concept code shared in Grant's blog post which is tailored to attack Buffalo routers.

As of 2021-08-05T04:09:44Z DDoS botnet operators are scanning the internet for Buffalo routers vulnerable to CVE-2021-20091 (https://t.co/OyZT3Be2SP).



This vulnerability allows attackers to alter device configuration leading to remote code execution. #threatintel — Bad Packets by Okta (@bad_packets) August 5 2021

Per Grant once exploited the vulnerability can be used to bypass authentication procedures on affected routers and modems to enable the Telnet service and allow threat actors to connect to devices remotely.

While Grant has not tested his proof-of-concept exploit for other devices and the exploit might not work out of the box for all the chances are that it does.

While still unconfirmed owners of any of the affected devices listed in the table above are advised to inquire their router vendor for security patches.

Juniper said it identified the threat actor behind these attacks as a notorious botnet herder operating a version of the Mirai malware."

You won’t see their names on Las Vegas Boulevard marquees and you may not have even heard of them.

But two heavyweight firms Vici Properties and The Blackstone Group are emerging as two of the biggest players on the Strip.

Their role? Collecting rent.

Vici a Caesars Entertainment spinoff announced a $17.2 billion deal Wednesday to acquire MGM Resorts International spinoff MGM Growth Properties giving Vici real estate ownership of many of the biggest hotel-casinos on the Strip.

Blackstone has its own growing portfolio of hotels on Las Vegas Boulevard and overall the two companies are slated to own more than a dozen megaresorts combined along the famed casino corridor mostly as landlords.

All this wheeling and dealing probably has little if any effect on guests at the properties or any immediate impact on the employees other than changing where companies send their rent checks.

But the two New York firms are betting billions that tourism here will thrive — and that casino operators can pay a fortune in rent.

‘On time and in cash’

Vici a casino landlord and Blackstone a financial conglomerate are buying hotels as Las Vegas bounces back from the still-raging coronavirus outbreak which dealt a catastrophic economic blow to Southern Nevada.

The pandemic temporarily turned the Strip into a ghost town of shuttered resorts last year sparked huge job losses in the casino-heavy region and kept people home and away from crowds for fear of getting infected devastating the tourism industry.

The landlords’ line of business however seems to be fine.

Vici CEO Ed Pitoniak said on a conference call Wednesday that both MGM Growth and his company have collected “100 percent of our rent so far through COVID on time and in cash.”

Vici’s real estate holdings include Caesars Palace and Harrah’s Las Vegas. In early March it also announced a deal with Apollo Global Management to purchase The Venetian Palazzo and Sands Expo and Convention Center for about $6.25 billion from casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp. with Vici acquiring the real estate and Apollo buying the operations side. The deal is expected to close early next year.

With its purchase of MGM Growth Vici is buying several MGM Resorts-operated properties including The Mirage Park MGM Luxor New York-New York and Excalibur.

Betting billions

Blackstone not only dropped $1.73 billion in 2014 for The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas it also has a history of multibillion-dollar real estate deals with MGM Resorts.

As announced in early July Blackstone is buying the Aria and Vdara hotels for nearly $3.9 billion and leasing them back to MGM. Blackstone also partnered with MGM Growth on a $4.6 billion deal early last year to acquire the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay’s real estate and lease them back to MGM Resorts with Vici saying this week it will retain MGM Growth’s stake in the venture.

Moreover Blackstone bought the Bellagio in 2019 for about $4.2 billion from MGM Resorts and leased it back.

As you can imagine leasing a resort with thousands of rooms is not cheap. The Bellagio sale for instance called for an initial annual rent of $245 million.

Las Vegas’ tourism industry has by no means fully recovered from the pandemic and the public health crisis is far from over. But the local economy has come a long way since the early chaos of the outbreak and Las Vegas is still a place where people spend big on hotels — not to mention gambling and booze.

“As much as parents like to spend money on their kids whether in Orlando and other locations I don’t think anybody’s ever spent $10000 on a bottle of apple juice” Pitoniak said this week.

The one-day training which was conducted at HMBS Coral Harbour was taught by Warrant Officers Pedro Rolle and Kermit Turnquest from the Royal Bahamas Defence Force’s (RBDF) Planning Search and Rescue Department. Aspects of the training included entering the water correctly off a vessel at sea adorning life vests towing an injured comrade and formation of a circle or an inline.

Force Chief Petty Officer Turnquest said: “It is important for all seagoing craft personnel to know what to do if the order ‘abandon ship’ is called. The initial actions of individuals are vital and if they are to survive the crew must follow the basic rules of the training which is being taught.”

The importance of these evolutions is relevant when out at sea because preserving lives is of the utmost importance in the event the crew has to abandon the ship. Familiarization of the ship practicing which actions to take in the event of an emergency and conduct in a life raft are all pertinent knowledge for the individuals.

Commanding Officer for HMBS ROLLY GRAY Lieutenant Themo Berkley was grateful for the training.

“The drills gave me a better insight of what actually can happen if the crew was to abandon ship” he said.

“We perform emergency drills when out at sea but throwing life rafts overboard and seeing them open was a learning experience. We wish to give our gratitude to the Search and Rescue Department for their time and effort.”

As the RBDF continues to patrol and protect the territorial waters of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas ongoing training of the officers and marines remains a priority.",,,,,,,,,
WAB,Wabtec,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWlucy5jb20vdHJuL25ld3MtcmV2aWV3cy9uZXdzLXdpcmUvd2FidGVjLWxvY29tb3RpdmUtcmVtYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXByb2dyYW0tY29tcGxldGVzLTEwMDB0aC11bml0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wabtec locomotive remanufacturing program completes 1000th unit - Trains,"FORT WORTH Texas — Wabtec has reached a milestone completing its 1000th remanufactured locomotive at plants in Fort Worth; Erie Pa.; and Contagem Brazil since the program’s start in 2015.

Norfolk Southern has received 500 of the locomotives since contracting with Wabtec to take 1990s-vintage 4000-hp D.C. traction GE Dash 9 locomotives and rebuild them into 4400-hp A.C. traction units with a new designation of AC44C6M. That includes the 1000th unit No. 4463 unveiled Friday at the Fort Worth plant and posed next to an unrebuilt unit about to enter the program.

“This achievement is a testament to the value that our locomotive modernization service provides to customers” says Pascal Schweitzer president of Wabtec Freight Services. “Our modernization program breathes new life and technological advancements into customers’ aging locomotives while also reducing a railroad’s operating costs and carbon footprint.” Finished units increase tractive effort by 50% with the switch from D.C. to A.C. traction improvements in truck design an 11-ton weight increase and new standardized control systems sacross all units. This allows Norfolk Southern to assign two rebuilt units to trains that would have required three older units to achieve the same performance.

The units’ 25% increase in fuel efficiency means these 1000 locomotives have reduced carbon emissions by 1.4 million tons since 2015. All this is important to Norfolk Southern’s long-term goals says Tom Schnautz vice presiden advanced train control. “As a leading transportation provider it is our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact” Schnautz says. “Our partnership with Wabtec is one way we plan to achieve our target of a 42% reduction in emissions intensity by 2034. Wabtec’s program is maximizing the value of our locomotives lowering operating costs and reducing emissions.”

Another environmental benefit is that 50% of the steel in each locomotive is reused in one form or another during the remanufacturing process. Over the life of the program the three Wabtec plants have reused more than 100000 tons of steel in the remanufacturing process.

“The modernization program has been a tremendous success and has created a new segment in the market” Schweitzer says. “It is now a key pillar of fleet management strategies for many railroads. That is a tribute to our employees suppliers and customers.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the sharp swing towards e-commerce and the meteoric growth of third-party e-commerce platforms over the past year Watsons remains confident in its strategy to compete with them.

“E-commerce marketplaces are an additional choice for customers to browse and shop and it also creates additional opportunities for Watsons” ​said Malina Ngai Group COO of A.S. Watson Group and CEO of A.S. Watson Asia & Europe.

“They play a part in our O+O strategy while not being able to replace our uniqueness in providing offline and online integrated experience for customers.”​

Watsons boasts a large brick-and-mortar store network – around 4100 in China alone – and a growing online presence.

While traditional online-to-offline (O2O) model drives customers from one channel to another Watsons believes that the ‘new normal’ of the pandemic is better served by the O+O model.

The prowess of its new retail model is illustrated in Watsons’ Cloud Store initiative which was launched early 2020 in China​ in collaboration with Tencent.

The Watsons Cloud Stores are hosted on the WeChat platform and connects all its brick-and-mortar stores across 500 cities in China.

Its stores serve as distribution centres allowing customers to place orders on the cloud store and receive their orders within 30 minutes.

“Our extensive physical store network gives us an unparalleled competitive edge and plays an important role in the customer journey” ​said Ngai.

Furthermore the platform gives consumers access to its beauty advisors and consultations without being in-store.

“​Since the national rollout last year millions of customers enjoy the connectivity anytime anywhere”​ said Ngai.

Earlier this year Watsons China partnered with Dr. Yu a derma skincare brand under Chinese firm Shanghai Jahwa to drive brand awareness and growth.

The brand distributed coupons for exclusive in-store skin care experiences through the Watsons Cloud Store.

This helped the brand to create engaging social media content while increasing the brand’s exposure.

During the promotion period Dr. Yu's brand awareness increased with store sales rising by more than 35% month-on-month.

Furthermore the brand’s sales via Watsons Cloud Store grew by more than 120% month-on-month.

Watson’s cloud store initiative is currently only available in China but the company sees potential to expand it further to other markets.

“The technology is ready and we will launch the services if we see customer demand in other markets”​ said Ngai.

The company has launched a service in Indonesia and Thailand where consumers can place orders via WhatsApp and LINE respectively.

The company has also expanded certain services like access to personal consultations to markets like Hong Kong where consumers can book make-up service nutrition and Traditional Chinese Medicine consultation via Whatsapp.",,,,,,,,,
WMT,Walmart,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vZW1lcmouY29tL2FpLXNlY3Rvci1vdmVydmlld3MvYWktYXQtd2FsbWFydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AI at Walmart – Comparison to Amazon and Two Unique Use-Cases,"Sam Walton opened his first Walmart in Rogers Arkansas in 1962 capitalizing on his twelve years of success running Walton’s 5&10 in downtown Bentonville seven miles down the road. Walton founded his company on the idea that retail could succeed by offering great value and great service. His competitors thought his idea was doomed to fail. Today almost sixty years later Walmart has transformed itself into a multinational corporate supergiant ranked as the largest company in the United States by gross sales in 2020 according to the Fortune 500.

Today the well-known multinational retail corporation is the world’s largest in terms of revenue and its largest private employer. Still owned and controlled by the Walton family Walmart has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1972.

In this article we’ll compare Walmart with its main digital rival Amazon and explore two unique AI use-cases deployed by Walmart today.

We’ve broken this article out into four sections:

Walmart vs. Amazon

Walmart’s Transition to eCommerce

Use-Case 1 – Item Substitutions for Grocery Orders

Use-Case 2 – Remote Fitting Rooms

Walmart vs. Amazon – A Comparison in Performance and AI Adoption

While Walmart holds the distinction of being the country’s largest company with 2020 revenues exceeding $559 billion Amazon its chief and up-and-coming rival is quickly closing in. Amazon’s 2020 revenues totaled $386 billion.

The firms differ significantly in terms of their growth. In 2010 Amazon’s revenue was $34.61 (under 10% of its 2020 revenue) and Walmart’s revenue was $404.74 (72% of its 2020 revenue). Hence Amazon’s market cap of $1.56 trillion (over 400% of revenue) compared to Walmart’s $382 billion (68% of revenue). But revenue growth is only one part of the market cap disparity – technology adoption and innovation is another.

In Bellevue Washington there’s a full-size grocery store where customers can “Just Walk Out.” From 7 AM to 10 PM every day you can grab fruits vegetables meats and prepared foods from its shelves go to the front of the store and skip the checkout line. Customers happily report saving time … and reducing contact with others.

The store isn’t a Walmart Supercenter. It’s an Amazon Fresh. The first Amazon Fresh opened in Bellevue Washington in August 2020. The chain has since grown to include fourteen additional locations in California Illinois Virginia and Washington DC.

Walmart’s grocery stores haven’t caught up. While Walmart offers self-checkouts pickup and delivery (and of course traditional staffed checkouts) the chain hasn’t yet brought all the innovations promised by computer vision deep learning and sensor fusion to its checkout process. Why?

In many ways Walmart’s brick-and-mortar birth in Arkansas in 1962 has lengthened its path to the AI world of the 21st century. Walmart for its part piloted its “Scan & Go” program in 125 stores in 2017 and 2018. When it canceled the program three years ago Walmart claimed that empowering customers to scan their own items via smartphones never really caught on.

Soon after at the 2019 National Retail Federation’s Big Show Walmart EVP and CTO Jeremy King went on to say that he was “really excited” for computer vision and what it promised in the “next couple of years.”

Fast forward to 2021 and Scan-and-Go is back available to Walmart+ members who pay the membership fee. While it’s a way of capitalizing on the promise of computer vision customers still have to scan each item with their smartphone’s camera. And that seems much less futuristic than say just walking out of a store with your account all settled.

Walmart’s Transition to eCommerce

Lagging Amazon in digital maturity Walmart is trying to put its nearly 60 years of brick-and-mortar success to work as it faces new decades and technologies.

Walmart has been a leading mass merchandiser of consumer goods for a really long time but its road to AI has not always been smooth. Now it’s starting to catch on to the value that AI can bring to its business model.

In its 10-K discussion about its strategic risks Walmart recognizes the potential pitfalls of failing to keep up with investments in technology and in failing to timely or effectively respond to consumer trends and preferences. Walmart clearly notes these exposures in its Risk 1A Risk Factors in its most recent 10-K.

“The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping” Walmart writes. “As a result the portion of total consumer expenditures … occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate.”

Spurred on by pandemic spending Walmart’s e-commerce sales grew by nearly 80% during 2020 a stat that bodes well for Amazon’s future digital investments. Walmart has made some visible investments into its digital future by exploring the innovations that AI brings to the mass merchandising consumer goods business. Below we explore the rivalry between Walmart and Amazon and two important AI-related initiatives at Walmart and the problems they solve for the chain’s customers.

Use-Case 1 – Item Substitutions for Grocery Orders

Many of us have been there. You place an order online for groceries. You submit the order and pay. Then when you arrive at the store for pick-up a store employee delivers the list of substitutions. Sometimes it’s just one brand of eggs for another. Once in a while you find out that you’re out of luck: you’ll be short taco shells for Tuesday night tacos.

Unexpected substitutions lead to a negative customer experience – and potentially lost revenue or market share (to competitors like Amazon) for Walmart.

Walmart wants to make it easier for its employees to decide on the right substitute when your requested item isn’t on the shelf — a timely innovation with surging demand for online grocery shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The decision on how to substitute is complex and highly personal to each customer. If the wrong choice is made it can negatively impact customer satisfaction and increase costs” wrote Srini Venkatesan Executive Vice President Walmart Global Tech in a June 24 2021 article for Walmart’s website.

Walmart claims that its item substitution solution incorporates deep-learning AI that evaluates hundreds of variables like:

Brand and price

Individual customer preferences

Current inventory levels

Aggregate shopper demand

The solution then communicates in real-time with the customer asking them to approve or reject the item substitution. If the customer turns the substitution down they are prompted to provide a reason. These data are then fed back into the solution’s dataset and used to inform its algorithms and improve future recommendations.

The solution also helps Walmart’s associates. Its AI delivers informed substitutions to Personal Shoppers as they navigate Walmart’s stores to complete shoppers’ orders and it also tells them just where to find the item in the store making their order fulfillment more efficient.

After implementing this AI-enabled substitution solution Walmart claims that customer acceptance of substitutions has increased to over 95%. We can estimate that this purported improvement of acceptance will help to improve Walmart’s customer satisfaction and help the firm to maintain market share. Walmart doesn’t list the before-and-after acceptance rate of substitutions.

Use-Case 2 – Remote Fitting Rooms

When you buy clothes online it’s hard to know how they’ll look and fit. Beyond that shoppers navigate the complexities of shipping charges and return policies. Even in a world where online interactions have moved recently to new and surprising facets of our lives the comfort of buying clothes in person has persisted if only because fitting rooms answer many of our concerns before we purchase new clothing.

For retailers returns of ill-fitting clothes can exert real downward pressure on otherwise healthy sales. Up to 40% of merchandise purchased online gets returned David Sobie co-founder and CEO of Happy Returns told CNBC in a 2019 interview. That means real money leaving Walmart’s P&L in reduced net sales as well as other processing and handling expenses that the retail giant must absorb.

Enter Walmart’s AI aspirations. In May Walmart announced plans to acquire Zeekit an Israeli company that makes the virtual trying-on of clothes a fun and social experience. When Zeekit’s solution goes live on Walmart.com customers will upload their photos choose a model that best represents their height body type and skin tone and then try on clothes virtually. The solution will also allow them to share their picture with friends—the equivalent of having a trusted advisor outside the fitting room door to deliver a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.

Zeekit’s short one-minute clip from their coverage on Good Morning America highlights the basic features and user experience of the app:

How does it work? The Zeekit tech breaks—into thousands of segments—both the image of the person and the clothing. It then recombines them to approximate what the clothing will look like when worn. The tech can also help shoppers visualize how different pieces of clothing will appear when paired.

As part of the acquisition Zeekit’s CEO CTO and VP of R&D will join the Walmart team bringing a wealth of AI computer vision and real-time image technology to the consumer goods giant.

Just two months post-announcement it’s too early to cite gains to Walmart’s customer satisfaction levels or its bottom line. However if remote fitting rooms can help build consumer confidence before they add an item to a cart that can go a long way to helping reduce returns and restocking expenses for retailers like Walmart.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd5bXQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDgvd2FsbWFydC1oYXJsYW4tY291bnR5LWNsb3NlZC1jbGVhbmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart in Harlan County closed for cleaning,"HARLAN COUNTY Ky.

It's a two-night role-playing theater experience built into an exquisitely themed hotel designed to make guests feel like they're taking a luxury cruise through deep space. Along the way Disney promises guests will take part in an epic adventure dine on fine foods wield a lightsaber and visit Walt Disney World's Hollywood Studios.

Watch this: How Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser hotel works: Opening date tickets more 16:47

It sounds amazing and it had better be: For two people the experience will cost at least $4809 or about $1200 per guest per night. That's wildly expensive even by Disney World standards.

Though it's true that the Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser promises a completely unique fully immersive experience that can't be found anywhere else it's important to consider just how much farther that kind of cash can go at other Disney theme parks and on Disney cruises.

Two days in the Star Wars universe versus a week at Disney World (for half the cost)

Disney Parks

Before you book your spaceflight to Batuu consider a more affordable way to see the planet featured in Disney's Star Wars Galaxy's Edge at Hollywood Studios: a regular Disney World vacation. The Walt Disney World website offers hotel and ticket packages at a wide variety of price points -- and though the cost might be daunting under normal circumstances it seems downright affordable compared with a weekend on the Galactic Starcruiser.

If two guests wanted to visit Walt Disney World the same week the new $5000 Star Wars experience launches they could pay as little as $1087 for two nights and three days at the All Star Movies hotel on Disney Property according to the resort's website -- with theme park tickets included. If they wanted to stay for a full week it would come to just $2218.

Fancy a more upscale hotel experience? Your vacation will still be comparatively affordable: At the time of writing a two-night August 2022 stay for two at Walt Disney World's midtier Port Orleans Resort Riverside can be had for $1352 or $3211 for a full week. A weekend at the classier Polynesian Village Resort costs $2626 for two nights -- and that's with the more expensive ""theme park view"" room. You can get four nights for $4739 roughly the same price as two with Galactic Starcruiser again with park tickets included.

More than Disney World for less than the galaxy

Disney

Even an international Disney vacation might cost you less than Florida's new Star Wars experience. A two-night three-day stay for two guests in Disneyland Paris can be had for between $921 and $1700 depending on which hotel you choose. Airfare will drive up that price a bit but that's a compelling alternative especially if you consider tacking on more travel days in the City of Light.

You might argue that this isn't a fair comparison: The Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser is a unique all-inclusive experience unlike the common visit to a Disney resort. That's a fair point but so is this: Right now you could pay $1571 for a fully inclusive three-day Bahamian Disney Cruise for two. That's less than half the cost of the Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser for a premium all-inclusive Disney vacation experience. It may not have an interwoven interactive themed story built into the vacation but aren't the Bahamas their own adventure?

According to archived travel blog posts a similar three-day cruise would've set you back about $1900 back in 2018 so it's likely that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought some of these prices down. Hopefully that'll be less of an influence on your vacation plans when Disney's Galactic Starcruiser experience launches in late 2022 -- but as of today the immersive Star Wars experience is among one of the most expensive Disney vacations you could take.

It's no surprise that a unique experience falls into one of Disney's more premium vacation options and while it sounds like a blast it's probably not the best value. That might be disappointing for Star Wars fans who were looking forward to immersing themselves in their favorite fictional world but it's also comforting that there are more-affordable options. You might even get more Star Wars out of the bargain than you expected: A normal Disney vacation might not come with a curated narrative but passengers on the Galactic Starcruiser spend only a few hours in Galaxy's Edge. If you visit Disney Parks in the traditional way you have the option to stay there all day.

Disney World might be for everyone but being a space adventurer is a luxury. At least for now. And maybe that's OK.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL2hvdy10aGUtYWZyaWNhbi1xdWVlbi1pbmZsdWVuY2VkLWp1bmdsZS1jcnVpc2UtZGlzbmV5LW1vdmllL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The African Queen' at 70: How One Jungle Cruise Influenced Another 'Jungle Cruise',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL2hvdy10aGUtYWZyaWNhbi1xdWVlbi1pbmZsdWVuY2VkLWp1bmdsZS1jcnVpc2UtZGlzbmV5LW1vdmllL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY2VjaGF0LmNvbS8yOTQ3NzItd2FsdC1kaXNuZXktd29ybGQtNTB0aC1zcGFya2xpbmctbmV3LWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtb24tdGhlLXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPDATED!

Substitute Kelechi Iheanacho confidently scored through a late penalty as Leicester stunned Manchester City to claim the Community Shield at Wembley.

The meeting of last season’s Premier League champions and FA Cup winners was absorbing in parts and looked to be heading for penalties but Iheanacho struck from the spot into the top corner with a minute remaining after being tripped by Nathan Ake.

City’s record £100m signing Jack Grealish was given his debut on 65 minutes but he could not muster a clear-cut opportunity for a much-changed team.

WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd2FzdGUtbWFuYWdlbWVudC13b3JsZC5jb20vYXJ0aWtlbC9mcmFuY2UtdGFrZXMtdGhlLWxlYWQtb24tZS13YXN0ZS1pbi1ldXJvcGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,France takes the lead on e-waste in Europe | WMW,"The new French legislation has a repairability index at heart.

Providing manufacturer sourced ratings judging the relative ease or difficulty in repairing smartphones laptops washing machines lawn mowers and televisions the index is meant to encourage consumers to refurbish and reuse their electronic goods rather than to dispose them.

Ratings are based on several criteria ranging from ease of disassembly (ex. access to tools) to the availability of repair guidelines (ex. video tutorials or instruction manuals) as well as of spare parts.

In essence the new system follows EPR thinking by placing the responsibility for the upkeep of produced goods at the end of their respective lifecycle squarely on manufacturers who are tasked to be more transparent.

A proposal to institute a tax or ban on the worst rated electronic goods was rejected the French government hoping that an essential give and take between producers keen on getting the best rating and consumers bent on possessing the most durable device will be enough to render the law a success.

Individual companies such as LaboFnac have already initiated programmes that analyse and provide consumers with information on the durability and reliability of products a sign that the reuse movement is slowly but surely catching on in France.

Further legislation has been instituted by the government to promote the reuse of electronic goods. The Agec law will funnel funds to thousands of social and community-led organisations (ex. recycling centres) to promote the reuse of objects.

With these measures France has effectively taken the lead in the EU with regards to recycling and repair of electronic products.

“With the creation of this index we are supporting the production of more durable products. Eco design is also a consideration when exporting goods and France should be exporting this very model internationally” said Marta de Cidrac Senator for Yvelines.

As France is next in line for the EU Presidency the institution of potentially universal right-to-repair legislation within a wider European context appears imminent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmVybi5vcmcvYWdfaW5zaWRlci9jYWxpZm9ybmlhcy1vcmdhbmljLXdhc3RlLWxhdy1zZXQtYS1oaWdoLWJhci1idXQtbW9zdC1jaXRpZXMtc3RydWdnbGUtdG8tcmVhY2gtaXQv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVmZXJuLm9yZy9hZ19pbnNpZGVyL2NhbGlmb3JuaWFzLW9yZ2FuaWMtd2FzdGUtbGF3LXNldC1hLWhpZ2gtYmFyLWJ1dC1tb3N0LWNpdGllcy1zdHJ1Z2dsZS10by1yZWFjaC1pdC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,California’s organic-waste law set a high bar but most cities struggle to reach it,"In 2016 California passed the nation’s most ambitious restrictions on landfilling food and yard waste with the aim of slashing the greenhouse gases these organic materials generate when buried. The law mandated turning the waste into compost or biogas with a goal of cutting landfill disposal by 50 percent from 2014 levels by the end of 2020 and 75 percent by 2025. But already cities have fallen behind on setting up the costly systems for collecting and processing this waste. Starting Jan. 1 2022 lagging communities could be fined up to $10000 a day.

As organics break down in an oxygen-free environment they generate methane — a greenhouse gas that over a 20-year timeframe is 84 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Globally methane is responsible for roughly 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States municipal solid waste landfills are the third largest human-related emitters of methane after oil and gas operations and livestock. In California landfills generate about 20 percent of the state’s methane emissions.

Some two dozen states have regulations in place to reduce the amount of organic waste sent to landfills and this past July bills were introduced in the U.S. House and in the Senate to establish grants to support programs that prevent food from going to waste and to promote the composting of food scraps. But California’s law known as Senate Bill 1383 has the nation’s highest targets in addition to a groundbreaking requirement that by 2025 the state recover and redistribute 20 percent of edible food that would otherwise have been sent to landfills. Nationwide an estimated 40 percent of all food is wasted.

If fully implemented SB 1383 would redirect 26.8 million tons of organics from landfills by 2025 according to the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). It would reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by at least 4 million metric tons per year by 2030 and yield an additional 5.5 million tons of soil-enhancing compost a year over the 1.8 million tons produced in 2017. The law would also lead to the recovery of enough food to generate roughly 1.8 billion meals for donation according to CalRecycle spokesperson Lance Klug.

Cities are free to choose the methods they will use to reduce methane emissions from organics. For instance they can expand their compost operations or upgrade or build new anaerobic digestors which produce biogas in addition to a soil amendment.

“In order to avoid the worsening effects of climate change we need bold public policy” said Andrea Spacht Collins a sustainable food systems specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “And we need every municipality business and household to do its part to reduce food waste and our carbon footprints.” To accelerate progress toward the state’s climate goals Governor Gavin Newsom in July directed the California Air Resources Board to evaluate ways the state can reach carbon neutrality by 2035 well ahead of its current 2045 target.

But the road from good intentions to reality is long and winding.

Timothy Hall a senior environmental scientist at CalRecycle acknowledged that the state did not meet SB 1383’s 2020 target: The agency is currently working on a study that will reveal by how wide a mark. “We’re still developing infrastructure to take the additional material” he said. “It takes a while to get these facilities permitted and built.”

Many residents resist the siting of compost facilities within sight or smell. Existing contract obligations can also cause delays. For instance the city of Oceanside in southern California must wait until its current yard-waste contract with Waste Management expires in 2023 before it can issue a new request for proposals from interested companies. Meanwhile the city can’t expand its existing capacity. The problem is common to many cities throughout the state.

Lack of funding is another holdup. The state has provided roughly $140 million in grants and loans to help local governments build out organic waste infrastructure. But CalRecycle has estimated that it will cost between $20 billion and $40 billion to fully implement the law over the next decade with up to 100 new facilities.

Many jurisdictions are already struggling with pandemic-related labor and budget shortfalls. In a survey conducted by the League of California Cities which advocates for cities on legal and political fronts 92 percent of 194 responding cities indicated they’ll need to raise solid-waste and recycling rates within the next three years to implement SB 1383 regulations. The League has asked the state legislature to appropriate $225 million to help cities develop programs to meet the law’s requirements.

Colleen Foster the environmental officer of Oceanside expects her city to barely meet the 2022 deadline but only because it has been collecting and processing food and yard waste for several years. “From a local perspective” she says “it’s a huge lift.” Many other cities have not yet built out such infrastructure and will be hard-pressed to do so without plenty of financial and logistical help.

Jack Macy zero-waste senior coordinator at the San Francisco Department of the Environment said that the city which has been collecting and processing organics since 1996 is “in good shape on mandatory collection and monitoring” but “is shifting staff to focus more on” SB 1383 compliance. “There’s scrambling going on by [other] jurisdictions with some level of freak-out” he added. Many are now hiring consultants.

Santa Clara County in the heart of Silicon Valley is also “in good shape” in terms of its existing capacity to recycle and process plenty of organic waste according to Michele Young a senior management analyst for the county. But she is much less hopeful that it can meet the law’s edible-food recovery targets. “We are fully expecting that our [ongoing] food-recovery study will show that the county doesn’t have enough infrastructure.”

In general smaller cities and counties appear to be worse off than larger ones because they haven’t historically had robust organics-collection systems in place and they are generally more cash strapped.

In response to these challenges California state legislators with the support of many cities introduced a bill (SB 619) in February that requests a one-year extension before SB 1383 penalties kick in and would prohibit the state from penalizing cities “that make a reasonable effort to comply” said Derek Dolfie legislative representative for the League of California Cities in an email. He noted that despite the fact that SB 1383 was passed in 2016 its regulations were only finalized and released to cities in November of 2020–smack in the grip of Covid-19–leaving local governments and their partners little time to build out the required programs.

The bill advanced from the state senate to the assembly this summer.

Despite all these kinks and challenges cities throughout the state agree with the spirit and goal of SB 1383. And advocates for reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases argue that the law could have a significant climate impact well beyond California.

“One of the most cost-effective ways to reduce greenhouse gases is to get organics out of landfills” said Nick Lapis director of advocacy at the nonprofit Californians Against Waste which led negotiations to pass SB 1383. “California is a huge economy—the sixth biggest in the world on the scale of France” he added. “I’m hoping that we can be a model for other states. Once we do it I hope it’ll sweep across the country.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlaHJhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQ2Mzc5My8zMi1lY28tc2Nob29scy1iZWluZy1idWlsdC1mb3ItZW5lcmd5LW1hbmFnZW1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,32 eco-schools being built for energy management,"TEHRAN – A total of 32 green schools are under construction across the country aiming to promote energy management in the education sector Mehrollah Rakhshanimehr director of the Organization for Development Renovation and Equipping Schools said.

Eco-schools also known as green schools bring a range of benefits including waste management waste reduction biodiversity energy water transport health global sustainability healthy nutrition citizenship and climate change. Countries considering their own socioeconomic and cultural characteristics must be able to adapt these criteria into their own particular circumstances.

The materials used in these schools are nature-friendly and each is built in four days and costs about 40 percent lower than the regular schools IRNA reported on Saturday.

By managing the consumption of energy water and materials eco-friendly schools will play an important role in the development of knowledge and the formation of environmental ethics he further emphasized.

In fact organizations today intend to minimize environmental damage by developing green buildings in cities and villages and managing energy water waste and materials he highlighted.

Rakhshanimehr went on to say that the country is facing problems in the field of energy that have reached their peak this year.

So that energy-saving comes to the center of attention in addition to culture promotion construction is important and green management indicators should be observed in building schools he said.

Many eco-schools in different parts of the country were built among which a school was opened in Tehran's District 5 with a green management approach and is planned to make maximum use of solar energy and water recycling he explained.

Earlier in March Barekat Charity Foundation affiliated to Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam inaugurated 100 nature-friendly schools across the country.

Current environmental problems are rooted in the lack of proper awareness and cultural weakness regarding the relationship between man and nature. Under such circumstances environmental issues have only belatedly been recognized in school activities worldwide and led to the initiation of green schools. Effective school programs should not only help students to progress the knowledge attitudes and skills necessary for responsible environmental behavior but also have the potential to spread awareness of the concept.

It aimed to be a zero waste generation zone but Covid slowed down its awareness campaigns.ROKA secretary Janani Venkitesh told TOI that eight main roads in the area have apartment complexes and houses.The three cross streets house commercial establishments. Of the 2500 homes nearly 1500 do 100% source segregation of waste.“We set up a volunteer system where members of the association would all segregate waste and also go to every residence educate and check if it was done properly.

The Government of People’s Republic of China and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) jointly launched a new initiative in Nepal to support the country in COVID-19 response by improving the healthcare waste management system under the framework of China’s South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund (SSCAF). UNDP will work closely with Department of Health Services under the Ministry of Health and Population of Government of Nepal and with seven COVID designated hospitals across the country including Koshi Hospital Biratnagar; Narayani Hospital Birgunj; Janakpur Hospital Janakpurdham; Shree Birendra Hospital Chhauni; Rapti Provincial Hospital Tulsipur; and Bheri Hospital Nepalgunj.

The joint effort will support upgrading of hospital waste management systems by providing support in the form of autoclaves setting up waste treatment areas and training the healthcare workers on their use as well as proper means to manage medical waste. It is anticipated that 350 healthcare professionals will be provided with the required technical skill-set on proper management of healthcare waste. Alongside this 100 officials from the local government will also be trained on better handling of health emergencies.

In parallel the initiative works to increase the public’s knowledge and preparedness on medical waste management by developing Public Service Announcements in various local languages in Nepal. Youth volunteers from 300 urban and rural municipalities will be mobilized to conduct an online campaign to raise awareness on this important issue.

The Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Her Excellency Hou Yanqi speaking of this initiative expresses “Hope that Nepal will benefit from the project and the haze of COVID-19 pandemic will disperse as soon as possible with the joint efforts of all countries around the world.”

This initiative is part of the SSCAF COVID-19 regional project in Asia and the Pacific and will directly and indirectly benefit over one million people.

“UNDP is privileged to enter into a tripartite agreement with the Ministry of Health and Population and China Aid to help demonstrate how we can improve the healthcare waste management system in Nepal. Besides Nepal similar initiatives are initiated by UNDP and China Aid in the Philippines Myanmar Cambodia and Laos” said UNDP Resident Representative Ayshanie Medagangoda-Labe.

This project is also expected to help the country meet its ambitious targets under the Sustainable Development Goals and contribute to the most recently updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to support emission reductions particularly on waste management in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

“As a matter of fact Nepal has set 10-year targets to adopt and implement waste segregation recycling and waste-to-energy programs in at least 100 municipalities and to enhance 1400 healthcare facilities with proper management of healthcare waste through the application of non-burn technologies. UNDP wants to seize this opportunity to transform this crisis into an opportunity and bring changes to our behavior to ensure a more sustainable equitable and prosperous future for all in Nepal” said the UNDP RR.

It was not clear how or why the man ended up in crocodile-infested waters.

An Australian army soldier was severely injured in the head and chest after being mauled by a saltwater crocodile on Friday afternoon in Far North Queensland.

An army colleague who came to his aid had reportedly suffered lacerations to his arms.

Both men were admitted to a hospital in the coastal city of Cairns on Friday night. They are in stable condition.

How did the crocodile attack the men?

Lockhart River Mayor Wayne Butcher told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the two ""had been swimming in croc-infested waters."" He said that one was attacked and the other tried to help.

Other reports however said it was unclear whether the men went swimming or fell into the waters while fishing near a coasting fishing village on the Cape York Peninsula. The incident took place about 800 kilometers or 497 miles north of Cairns. Rescue operations took about seven hours.

Denis O'Sullivan of the Queensland Ambulance Service told the media the man reportedly in his early 20s suffered severe blood loss.

""I think he's very lucky to be alive and here today to tell the story"" he told the media.

The crocodile was reportedly about 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) long. The defense department also told Australian Associated Press (AAP) that the incident was being investigated without adding any further details.

It is not clear whether the men were on or off duty at the time of the attack. Wildlife officers from the Department of Environment and Science launched an investigation later in the day.

There are about 100000 to 200000 saltwater crocodiles living in the wild in the country according to data from the Northern Territory government. The Northern Territory with the highest number of crocodiles in Australia.

Butcher the mayor of Lockhart River added in comments to ABC media that the crocodile population had spiked in recent years on Cape York Peninsula and asked people to be careful of signs that warned against going into dangerous waters.

In brief India’s contract research organizations (CROs) are no longer just low-cost compound synthesizers. Over the past 15 years they have asserted themselves as world-class chemistry-service providers. Now the country’s top CROs are setting up labs in the West fostering global teams and courting biotechnology companies. The goal of their executives is nothing less than becoming integrated partners for global drugmakers and going head to head with China as the world’s powerhouse drug discovery partner.

The diversification effort started before the pandemic says Ramesh Subramanian chief commercial officer at Aragen Life Sciences one of India’s leading contract research organizations (CROs). “What we’re seeing is a significant focus from companies on diversifying their geographical footprint” he says. “It goes both ways: companies that are fully ensconced in India look to China for diversification. Companies that are fully ensconced in China look to India.”

But India is the clear winner in the drive to diversify executives in the country say. Pharmaceutical companies have historically been more invested in China—Asia’s largest market and home to the world’s largest CRO Shanghai-based WuXi AppTec—and are now expanding into India. And China’s tensions with the US are helping fuel the shift.

Hyderabad India–headquartered Aragen is already profiting. The company which employs 3200 people just celebrated its best year yet Subramanian says and local reports peg the company’s value at $1 billion. Formerly known as GVK Biosciences the company recently rebranded as Aragen the name of its US subsidiary. The change was motivated in part by a desire to appeal to a customer base that is almost exclusively Western according to Subramanian.

Western drug companies have been looking seriously at India for research help since 2005 when the country started to comply with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights or TRIPS a globally recognized intellectual property pact says Nailesh Bhatt CEO of the US specialty pharmaceutical company Vgyaan. The new law roused the drug industry’s interest in India for cheap access to highly qualified scientists and the potential for selling patented drugs in India Bhatt says.

Part of the industry is still low cost Bhatt says but India’s largest CROs have evolved since then from cut-rate service providers to powerhouses for high-quality chemistry and biology serving the Western market. “The evolution of the Indian drug discovery services has been quite drastic” Bhatt says. “If you look at the number of contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) that were in India in the late 2000s versus what is there now the clear winners have really emerged.”

Now India’s top CROs and CDMOs are asserting themselves on the global stage. They are courting biotechnology companies by setting up satellite labs in the US and Europe. And they are hiring managers with Big Pharma or chemical experience. Their goal: go head to head with China while becoming less of an assistant and more of a partner for their drug industry customers.

Western standards

Jonathan Hunt the CEO of Syngene International says the window of India’s operating cost advantage is narrowing. The country’s successful CROs have had to keep up with globally recognized processes quality standards and operating models to compete in the world market. State-of-the-art facilities and top-notch teams are not compatible with offering low-cost services he says. But if India’s cost advantage is fading the country’s place in the outsourcing industry is holding firm Hunt says.

Founded in 1993 by Biocon a leading Indian drug company Syngene is one of the Indian CROs that have moved beyond the rote performance of research tasks and into fuller discovery collaborations.

Hunt credits the company’s success in part to a relationship with Bristol Myers Squibb that dates back to 1998. Syngene established a dedicated research facility for the US drugmaker in 2009. Earlier this year Syngene announced the addition of a 4600 m2 lab to the facility. The company will additionally add 200 researchers to the facility’s staff as part of an extension of the contract with Bristol Myers Squibb.

There aren’t many places on the planet where you can access that volume of young talent regularly. Jonathan Hunt CEO Syngene International

The partnership Hunt says has committed Syngene to processes and quality standards that are equal to global ones. In hindsight this commitment was key to Syngene’s success with future clients. “From day 1 we gained a well-founded reputation that if you go inside our walls in Bangalore our operations reflect the quality and safety standards that you find in the global markets” he says.

If Indian companies’ cost advantage is narrowing what still sets them apart from CROs in the West is the benefits of the country’s population of more than 1 billion. Syngene has more than 5400 employees of whom 87% are scientists. “There aren’t many places on the planet where you can access that volume of young talent regularly” Hunt says.

Large pharmaceutical companies turn to India to fill a gap between the type of R&D that they need and the number of people at their companies who are qualified to do it Aragen’s Subramanian says. His company has around 1600 people dedicated to drug discovery. “Scale is something very tough to reproduce. And companies’ needs evolve dramatically. You might need x number of people today and twice as many tomorrow” he says.

Not all of India’s drug discovery talent is local. Western scientists have long been hires at companies like Syngene and Aragen. And increasingly the top CROs are hiring outside managers with large pharmaceutical or chemical experience.

One example is Marcel Velterop president of drug discovery and CDMO services at the Bangalore India–based CRO Jubilant Biosys. Velterop held positions with DSM and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories before joining the CRO. And before Hunt who is British was appointed Syngene’s CEO in 2015 he was an executive at AstraZeneca.

Vgyaan’s Bhatt says the recruitment of such leaders proves companies are serious about playing the global field. “They need credibility leadership expertise and a real global perspective if they want to be able to sit with the head of R&D at AstraZeneca or GSK [GlaxoSmithKline] and say ‘Not only should we work for you; we should be partners in drug discovery’ ” he says.

Hunt who lives in Manchester England and travels between the continents when COVID-19 restrictions allow says his appointment represents not a strategy to increase Syngene’s ties with Western customers but rather the global nature of top-tier CROs. Most of Syngene’s clients are from outside India. “It’s no surprise that your talent base and your leadership increasingly represent the geographical spread and diversity of the customers in the industry” he says.

Western footholds

To Syngene the company’s geographic presence doesn’t need to mirror this diversity. The firm has been strengthening its sales staff in key markets like the US and UK but all its discovery and manufacturing facilities are in India. While Hunt says Syngene is open to establishing a base in the West he says the absence of one “hasn’t held us back so far.”

Other Indian CROs consider a site in the West necessary if they are to form more integrated relationships with their clients—especially relationships that extend beyond preclinical drug discovery and encompass the manufacturing of drug candidates that might enter clinical trials. “At some point not having a site in the West was really hurting us” says Tuneer Ghosh global head of chemistry manufacturing and controls business development at Sai Life Sciences.

Hyderabad-based Sai opened a development and manufacturing site in Manchester England in August 2020. Despite challenges posed by the pandemic the site was a success. Less than 6 months after opening Sai announced plans to double its head count and expand the site to offer active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production particle science and engineering in silico modeling and flow chemistry. A further expansion later this year will add a kilogram-scale lab that follows good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards.

Located in Alderley Park a former country estate that is now a 160-hectare life sciences center Sai’s site in Greater Manchester has opened new opportunities with UK- and European Union–based drug companies and biotechs Ghosh says. “Historically Sai has been doing really good business with large pharma in the West but for critical projects which need speedy delivery or for complex chemistry they would still look to CDMOs that are closer to them.”

Echoing other executives in India Ghosh says that some customers are nervous about taking their intellectual property to CROs or CDMOs in India but are happy to hire a team in the UK. Last year Sai began working with a drug industry client that has a policy of not outsourcing the synthesis of new chemical entities to India. The Manchester site Ghosh says “gave us a direct cutting edge. We had been trying to get into that big pharma for several years.”

The Manchester team comes mostly from Big Pharma and Western CDMOs creating a cultural link to customers says Dean Edney Sai’s global head of process R&D. Edney who came to Sai after 26 years at GlaxoSmithKline divides his time between Manchester and Hyderabad when the pandemic doesn’t thwart travel.

Sai wants to create teams on two continents that can tap into each other’s expertise. The talent pools in Manchester and Hyderabad are different Edney says and the transfer of knowledge is “absolutely key” in Sai’s strategy to build a global organization. The plan to expand into flow chemistry in Manchester for example will be aided by the team in Hyderabad where flow-chemistry experience is more readily available. And once travel is possible again team members will rotate between sites.

Sai is not the only Indian CRO that sees advantages to a Western base. In 2014 before the rebranding GVK Biosciences acquired the US CRO Aragen. Officially the rationale was to get involved on the biologics side of the drug industry. But Subramanian says GVK was also keen to gain access to US-educated talent and strengthen its relationships with Western pharma.

Similarly Kolkata-based TCG Lifesciences established a US subsidiary TCG GreenChem earlier this year. It currently occupies 5000 m2 of laboratory space across sites in Ewing New Jersey near Princeton and Richmond Virginia. TCG GreenChem’s CEO Chris Senanayake who previously worked at Boehringer Ingelheim Sepracor and Merck & Co. became the chief science officer of TCG Lifesciences in 2019 before founding TCG GreenChem.

The idea Senanayake says is to make TCG GreenChem the drug development engine for TCG Lifesciences and its clients with innovation spearheaded in the US and most manufacturing done in India. If used well this system will allow TCG Lifesciences to engineer complex molecules at low cost he says.

Newer smaller CROs are also taking this approach. Naresh Jain founded NJ Bio with the aim of leveraging India’s R&D expertise and bringing it to the US. “The expertise in CRO work large-scale manufacturing and APIs that India has grown over the last decades is stronger than that in the US now” Jain says.

The cost of labor is still an incentive for an Indian base he says: the annual price of employing a scientist in India is as low as $30000 compared with $180000 in the US. India’s chemists “produce similar results if not better” Jain says. But he also speaks highly of chemists trained in the US who bring a more innovative approach. Working together on sites in India and the US the two sides bring a lot of value for NJ Bio’s clients Jain says. “Whenever you mix two different cultures it’s very refreshing. Diversity brings innovation.”

Founded in 2019 NJ Bio occupies about 3200 m2 of a former Bristol Myers Squibb facility in Princeton. Jain also helped to launch an affiliated company Amar Chemistry in Mumbai India around the same time. Between its sites in India and NJ the CRO specializes in bioconjugation nucleotide chemistry custom synthesis biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance and flow chemistry. Jain’s ambition is to grow it into one of the largest niche-expertise CROs in the US.

To achieve this NJ Bio has to convince its potential clients that it is safe to entrust their intellectual property (IP) to a team that works partially out of India Jain says. “When we try to sell our services to most clients their main concern is their IP” he says as US companies are nervous about sending sensitive information to other continents. NJ Bio’s model gives clients the option to get early-stage work done in India and later-stage work in the US. “For example a compound that requires a 25-step synthesis has the first 10 steps done in India and the other 15 in the US” he explains. “Clients are much more comfortable with this model.”

Miles Congreve chief scientific officer at the biotech firm Sosei Heptares is an example of such a client. He is used to working with Asian CROs on drug discovery but draws the line at the manufacturing of drug candidates under GMP standards.

“We would struggle with using Indian and Chinese groups for GMP just because you can more easily audit sites in the West” he says. “You don’t want an issue with manufacturing that you don’t have control over.” This is a common hurdle for CROs that want to become one-stop shops offering both research and manufacturing services.

If Syngene for example had a site near Sosei Heptares’s base in Cambridge England then Congreve would consider the company a one-stop shop he says. As it is Sosei Heptares employs a jigsaw puzzle of CROs and CDMOs picking them for different projects according to their individual strengths and locations.

Once you start getting professional investors I think the doors will open wide for India. Ramesh Subramanian chief commercial officer Aragen Life Sciences

Last year the biotech worked with six CROs on designing inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease to find an oral drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Syngene supported chemical synthesis enzyme inhibition screening and characterization of pharmacokinetic properties of key compounds. UK-based Domainex and Croatia-based Fidelta contributed to assay development and screening. Piramal Pharma and WuXi contributed to the synthesis work alongside O2h Group a CRO based in India and Cambridge England.

O2h is Sosei Heptares’s biggest external team and receives a budget of more than $1 million each year. Run by the Indian British brothers Sunil and Prashant Shah O2h was built on a premise similar to NJ Bio’s. “We saw the strength in chemistry that India had in the early 2000s and the emergence of the biotech scene in Cambridge and put those two observations together” Prashant Shah says.

The brothers geared their business to help start-up biotech companies from the get-go. Besides drug discovery services they offer seed funding and incubation support as well as mentoring and connections to clients in the vibrant Cambridge scene.

“Having a presence in the UK was essential for building those relationships with customers and supporting them with their drug discovery requirements” Prashant Shah says. The advantage of doing most of its chemistry and biologics in India he says is the ability to scale up a project quickly.

Sosei Heptares started working with O2h in 2008. It was the first CRO the young biotech hired. Would the relationship have been this successful if O2h had only had a site in India or only in the UK? “That’s a good question” Congreve says. “It was certainly a factor in the beginning because I liked being able to go to their office in Cambridge and visit the site. But today we work with companies where we’ve never even seen their site.”

Cozying up to biotechs

To India’s CROs courting biotechs like Sosei Heptares is arguably the biggest part of their business plans and the biggest motivation behind setting up shop in the West. “Yes we are absolutely going after biotechs” Sai’s Ghosh says. When biotechs stopped partnering with Big Pharma firms for all their promising compounds and began taking some drugs to market themselves Sai changed its business model to cater to them he says.

Like NJ Bio O2h TCG and Aragen Sai is leveraging its multiple sites to provide biotechs with speed infrastructure support and reassurance that their IP is secure and in a familiar setting. Besides the Manchester site Sai has placed business development representatives in Massachusetts San Francisco and European hubs like Barcelona.

The focus on biotechs also gives CROs a chance to shake off their reputation as rote makers of compounds. Rather than settle into the service role often expected by big drug companies CROs can enjoy relationships that are more symbiotic as young companies take help from experienced contract research partners to craft their strategies for drug development.

The desire for more equal client relationships runs through all of India’s most successful CROs although none go as far as to say that gaining access to intellectual property is a part of the plan. Syngene’s Hunt says the leap from providing simple repeatable chemistry tasks to doing integrated drug discovery is natural for the industry. “We’re just a biotech company in disguise” he says. “We don’t need to own the IP but we create IP in a way that’s indistinguishable from a biotech or pharma.”

The difference may be indistinguishable but it continues to be important. CROs typically charge their customers for an agreed-upon number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. Under an FTE contract the client pays the CRO a fixed amount without regard for the project’s eventual success or failure.

Some Indian CROs are keen to establish risk-sharing agreements with their customers under which they receive less money than in a straight FTE contract but qualify to earn royalties if their contribution helps the customer launch a new product.

But biotechs tend to be skeptical of these contracts which rely on the CRO’s providing input that is worth its share of the profit. “True risk means true money on the table and sometimes the CROs overvalue the input they can give” says Robert Boyle the CEO of Sentinel Oncology a biotech in Cambridge England that outsources all its chemistry research. Sentinel has done one risk-sharing agreement with O2h in the 16 years since its foundation. Sentinel paid for five FTE chemists. O2h provided another five for free and took a share of royalties in the program.

Although Boyle was happy with the project he is not convinced that CROs can cross the bridge from being a set of helping hands to becoming a true partner for biotechs. “It’s a different business model. Contract research was driven by being a cost-efficient professional outsourcing arm” he says. “I can see more risk sharing as some CROs try to differentiate themselves as a one-stop shop but I think it’s proven hard to get that off the ground.”

Indeed Boyle still sees the financial advantage of Indian CROs as their main draw. “It would be very hard for us to suddenly flip to a UK chemistry service provider who would want to charge $200000 for an FTE agreement when we pay $75000 in India” he says. “That’s a lot of money for a young biotech.”

True risk means true money on the table and sometimes the CROs overvalue the input they can give. Robert Boyle CEO Sentinel Oncology

Eclipsing China

If money is the deciding factor for biotechs China’s CROs are as competitive as India’s. Sentinel uses both and Boyle says he has no preference for doing business with one or the other although he says working with Chinese firms can be hampered by the language barrier.

Industry watchers name language as China’s biggest hurdle for contract research dominance. India with its English-savvy population has the upper hand. And while it’s not challenging for big corporations to employ translators or local staff smaller companies such as most biotechs will struggle to create a partnership with a Chinese CRO TCG’s Senanayake says. “Communication is the only downside to China. This is where we can differentiate ourselves and support the biotech industry.”

If India’s CROs have ever had a chance to eclipse China’s this is the time. Political tensions between the US and China and the drive to reclaim the manufacturing supply chain by the pharmaceutical industry and government during the pandemic highlight the extent to which China dominates the world’s supply of pharmaceutical chemicals. These tensions have tempted some potential customers to edge away from the contract research giant.

But although some business may move to India the shift doesn’t seem to be making a visible dent in China’s prominence. WuXi for one recently forecast its net profit for the first half of 2021 to increase by more than 50% from a year ago. Another leading Chinese player Pharmaron said its profit shot up 140% in the first quarter of 2021 from last year.

Aragen’s Subramanian is optimistic that India will gain more business from China in the near future. The ingredient missing to propel India’s contract research industry to the top is investment he says. And here private equity companies are beginning to fill the gap.

Last year the Carlyle Group took a 20% stake in Piramal Pharma a CDMO headquartered in Mumbai. In November Syngene signed a 5-year agreement with the drug discovery and development subsidiary of Deerfield Management a venture capital firm. And Goldman Sachs took a significant stake in Aragen this year. Subramanian says there are “several other deals that we know are in the works.”

One of the things that differentiated China from India when research outsourcing took off between 2001 and 2010 was China’s access to government-provided capital Subramanian says. Without it Indian companies were unable to scale in the same way. “The science was always there. The talent was always there. What was lacking was financial capital” he says. “Once you start getting professional investors I think the doors will open wide for India.”

Sosei Heptares’s Congreve expects consolidation over the next decade with at least some of India’s star players being bought by or acquiring companies that will give them wider global reach. It would be good news for their clients Congreve says. “It’s attractive to work with companies that are widening their network so you can access their services around the world” he says. “Clearly in another 10 years from now there will be huge corporations that have swallowed up others as part of a group.”

And financial machinations aside O2h’s Prashant Shah adds that Indian CROs themselves have become “extremely confident” in their ability to drive the country’s industry forward. “They’ve got very strong balance sheets. They can invest and make decisions and move quite aggressively to take up new opportunities across the entire pharmaceutical landscape” he says. “India is genuinely a powerhouse in terms of its capabilities now.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

We are moving towards using larger test sizes on our benchmarks but on several tests we also used the smaller default-test sizes. This allows us to see the difference between lighter and heavier workloads.

CrystalDiskMark x64

CrystalDiskMark is used as a basic starting point for benchmarks as it is something commonly run by end-users as a sanity check.

On our first benchmark the WD Black SN850 1TB impresses. Operating in a near tie with the Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus 2TB the SN850 is fighting for the very top of our chart. Importantly the SN850 is very close to achieving its rated sequential performance for both read and write.

Comparing the sequential performance of the three test platforms there is very little differentiating them with less than 5% separating them.

Moving to the larger 8GB very little has changed and the SN850 continues to perform extremely well.

ATTO Disk Benchmark

The ATTO Disk Benchmark has been a staple of drive sequential performance testing for years. ATTO was tested at both 256MB and 8GB file sizes.

Sequential performance in ATTO is just a hair lower than in CDM with the WD Black SN850 1TB slightly falling short of its rated 7000 MB/s read and 5300 MB/s write. Once again the difference between the test platforms is minimal here as well.

The larger test has a negligible effect on the WD Black SN850 1TB which is always a welcome sight.

Anvil’s Storage Utilities

Anvil’s Storage Utilities is a comprehensive benchmark that gives us a very in-depth look at the performance of drives tested. This benchmark was run with both a 1GB and 8GB test size.

The WD Black SN850’s read performance in Anvil is the best I have ever tested by a good margin. Write performance is great as well though the Phison-equipped Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus manages to hold onto the lead in write score.

Anvil is the first benchmark where we start to see real differentiation between our test platforms on the charts. This is in CrystalDiskMark and ATTO our charts only represent sequential performance while Anvil uses a ‘score’ that incorporates random and highly threaded results as well. Here our 5900X system takes the overall read score crown and puts up a very good write score while the 3900X suffers a bit in the write score category comparatively. The i5-11600K does very well on the write score but the read score suffers a bit in comparison.

Moving to the larger Anvil test confirms the WD Black SN850 1TB’s spot at the top of our charts turning in a great performance on both read and write scores.

In addition even further differentiation of our test platforms emerges. The write score performance on the Intel platform is enough to nudge the SN850 past the Rocket 4 Plus for the write score crown while the more highly threaded AMD platforms hold onto their read score leads.

AS SSD Benchmark

AS SSD Benchmark is another good benchmark for testing SSDs. We run all three tests for our series. Like other utilities it was run with both the default 1GB as well as a larger 10GB test set.

In AS SSD the WD Black SN850 1TB once again finds itself at the top of our chart. In read score the SN850 just barely manages to edge out the Rocket 4 Plus but the Phison based drives hold onto the superior write score.

Differences between the test platforms narrow quite a bit in AS SSD compared to what we saw in Anvil with hardly any difference between them.

The performance continues to hold up on the WD Black SN850 1TB when we move to the larger AS SSD test which is good news.

The Intel system write score takes a big dip here as a large hit to the 4K-64Thrd performance was noted. This is likely the much lower thread count on the i5-11600K coming into play.

Be it photos files or applications storage requirements continue to grow. Instead of keeping up with those demands by deleting precious files or photos (or miscellaneous documents you don't remember creating) investing in an external drive is a move you won't regret making.

Aside from keeping extra files safe you can also use an external drive as a backup for your laptop or phone or even for extending your Xbox Series X or PS5 game storage. Whatever your needs is for buying an external storage solution we've got a pick for you. Here are the best HDDs and SSDs on the market.

HDD vs. SSD

Why you can trust Laptop Mag Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

Hard drive disks (HDD) traditional spinning hard drives are a much more affordable storage option. They use moving magnetic disks to store data while read/write heads manipulate data as needed. Because all of the data storage is physical you get the classic whirring sound as it operates. They also tend to be the larger option because of the space the spinning discs require. Unfortunately all the moving parts leave the device vulnerable to internal damage and transfer speeds are slow by today's standards.

Solid-state drives (SSD) on the other hand use an integrated circuit known as a microchip to store data. This means that they use electric pulses instead of moving parts to read write and store data. Without the need for moving parts SSDs process data much faster and can be built on a much more compact scale.

Why choose an HDD over an SSD?

Typically SSDs are the better choice for performance and portability. However this doesn’t always mean that they’ll be the right choice for you. While SSDs are becoming more affordable as they grow in popularity HDDs are a still much more affordable solution if you’re looking to store more “static” data. So if you’re just looking to store files such as documents photos and other files that aren’t needed on a day-to-day basis an HDD could be the perfect solution for you.

In fact you can now read up on how to install a new NVMe drive into a PS5 via an official Sony guide reports GamesRadar.

But of course you can't just buy any SSD you see. The PS5 will always perform its best if you put the right hardware in it: storage drive included. As such this article will serve as your guide to buying an M.2 drive for your PS5.

PS5 Internal SSD vs NVMe M.2: Speed Test

When Sony launched their current-gen console their marketing focused a lot on how fast the PS5's SSD is. For the first time in gaming console history games will load up in mere seconds rather than several minutes. But that's just the console's internal drive. What about an M.2?

According to DigitalFoundry via TheGalTimes an NVMe M.2 generally performed faster than the PlayStation 5's internal SSD when PS4 games were tested via backwards compatibility. However specific games such as ""Ratchet & Clark: Rift Apart"" could have some problems with loading times and frame rate drops.

This is mainly due to the game engine itself but overall the performance between the PS5's internal SSD and the one which was tested (a Samsung 980 Pro 500GB) was more or less similar.

TLDR: adding a new NVMe M.2 drive will give the PS5 faster storage in most cases. But this doesn't mean any NVMe drive you can get is compatible with your console. This then leads to the second part of this article.

It Must Meet the Minimum Speed Limit

You can't just install any NVMe drive you buy onto your PlayStation 5 system because it has a minimum speed limit: 5500 MB/sec writes MightyGadget. Any M.2 drive that doesn't meet this minimum limit is a no-go. To make it a lot easier to choose always look for a PCIe Gen 4.0 drive and nothing else.

Here are a few examples to get you started. There are others like these with similar specs which you'll have to identify yourself.

WD Black SN850 With Heatsink: If you want an SSD that works with your PS5 right out of the box this is it. Western Digital confirmed that this M.2 SSD is PlayStation 5-compatible with blistering speeds up to 7000 MB/sec read and 5300 MB/sec write. The only problem with it is that it's expensive especially with the 1TB model.

Seagate FireCUDA 530 1TB With Heatsink: Seagate claims that this product of theirs is faster than the SN850. Not only does it regularly hit the 7000 MB/sec speed mark but it also often eclipses that too. But of course this could be corpo marketing stuff so you'd best look at user reviews. The downside is that this particular model is hard to find right now.

Gigabyte AORUS Gen4 7000s: As a PCIe Gen 4.0 part this Gigabyte drive is fast and PS5-compatible right out of the gate. Furthermore it has 3D TLC NAND Flash memory which puts it far above any PCIe Gen 3.0 drive even if they're the fastest in their class.

Size Matters (Storage Capacity & Physical-Wise)

According to The Verge the PS5 supports 2280-type SSDs. This is the dominant form factor in the market right now which helps narrow your choices down a bit. Any reputable SSD maker will always put the form factor in their products' pages which will be easy to see.

Another size requirement is on the physical side. According to Eurogamer the entire drive with the heatsink and PCB should not exceed 11.25mm(0.442 cm) or it won't fit in the tiny slot that Sony has provided. Sure you can buy something without a heatsink but SSDs run and they will run even hotter inside the PS5's SSD slot. And you should know by now that heat destroys electronics over time.

As for the storage capacity a lot of storage space can't hurt anyone right? If money isn't an issue the biggest one you could buy is a 4TB NVMe. The cheapest and smallest capacity you can install is 250GB. At the end of the day the choice is yours.

Surprisingly we had more number of companies coming over for placements  giving us more options to select from. Our placement unit did a tremendous job in hosting so many companies at once” said Yatharth Batra 25 who was recently placed at Western Digital as validation engineer for a package of Rs 22 lakh.The infrastructure sector which underwent a rough patch due to manpower and supply chain disruption was sceptical in hiring due to uncertain business scenarios. However infrastructure heavyweights such as Ramboll L&T Limited WSP Arup Stantec Atkins and Vestas hired students for structural and transportation engineer roles from BITS Pilani Hyderabad campus. This year consulting and product management roles were in demand among engineering students with several prominent companies such as Bain Capability Network Ernst & Young Indus Insights Dalberg Flipkart and Deloitte offering product and IT consulting roles. “For the upcoming year of placement 2021-22 BITS Pilani Hyderabad campus looks forward to a repeat of the bullish hiring season with yet another scintillating performance” said Biju Rajan senior manager placement BITS Pilani Hyderabad campus.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NpdGllcy9IeWRlcmFiYWQvYml0cy1waWxhbmktcGxhY2VtZW50cy11cC1ieS0yMS1kZXNwaXRlLXBhbmRlbWljL2FydGljbGUzNTc5MTEwNi5lY2XSAXhodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXRpZXMvSHlkZXJhYmFkL2JpdHMtcGlsYW5pLXBsYWNlbWVudHMtdXAtYnktMjEtZGVzcGl0ZS1wYW5kZW1pYy9hcnRpY2xlMzU3OTExMDYuZWNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BITS Pilani placements up by 21% despite pandemic,"August 07 2021 09:56 pm | Updated August 08 2021 07:55 am IST - Hyderabad

Braving the economic downturn BITS Pilani campuses in Pilani Hyderabad Goa and Dubai saw 2544 students out of 3047 registered ones getting jobs during recruitment drives.

The placement season saw 698 students receiving offers of more than ₹20 lakh per annum an increase of 21% over the 2019-20 placement season. Even with an absolute increase in number of students registered for placements by 636 from 2411 registered last year to 3047 in the current year there was almost no negative impact on the placement statistics. Last year 2074 were offered placements compared to 2544 this year.

The median salary for 2021 was a healthy ₹12.78 lakh while the average CTC of ₹15.6 lakh per annum and maximum CTC of ₹45 lakh per annum remained at approximately the same level as the previous year.

Students competed for cutting-edge technology companies in Data Science Machine Learning and Cybersecurity in addition to the traditional software development roles. “The demand in the IT space was robust with internship pre-placement offers and full-time roles being given by companies such as Microsoft Google Salesforce Samsung DE Shaw Amazon Flipkart Cisco Oracle IBM and PayPal among others” said Balasubramanian Gurumurthy Chief Placement Officer India and Dubai BITS Pilani.

The electronics sector saw major semiconductor brands such as Qualcomm Texas Instruments Micron Western Digital Samsung Hardware Intel and Microchip hiring either full-time or for summer internships. The banking sector saw JP Morgan Citibank DBS HSBC Nomura Deutsche Bank among other top brands hiring for technology and fintech roles.

Top companies in the manufacturing sector like General Electric Mercedes R&D took students for full-time positions while the FMCG sector also saw marquee brands such as HUL Pepsico and L’Oreal offering leadership and general management roles.

The early indicators in terms of eight-week summer internship PPOs and registrations by companies for final placements show that the industrial demand is robust for the 2021-22 placement season which is due to begin in mid-August promising a good growth in the placement figures for the next season said Tabir Mishra head of placements Pilani campus."

This patch is no wildlife refuge. Five or so years ago loggers harvested most of the trees leaving a tangle of branches and trunks. Now waist-high maples and alders raspberry bushes and ferns are emerging amid the slash. It’s the perfect habitat for this warbler a secretive bird that likes to nest near the ground eat insects and spiders and is more frequently heard than seen.

Nearly 30 years ago a team of bird researchers came to this land to conduct the first large-scale study of the impact of commercial forestry on bird populations in the United States. At the time a big paper company was in the process of clearcutting 15000 acres. That’s an area the size of Manhattan.

The Ragmuff Clearcut named for a stream and road bearing the name was unsightly and disturbing to many humans. But migrating songbirds such as the mourning warbler a species that has been declining in Maine according to breeding bird surveys didn’t seem to mind.

A systematic survey of bird populations across 1 million acres of working forest led researchers to what was then a surprising conclusion: Cutting down trees isn’t necessarily bad for birds – as long as the harvesting was taking place across a larger landscape where the types of tree and age class were constantly changing over time.

That concept came to be known as a “shifting mosaic.” It highlighted the role of commercial forestry practices in conserving biodiversity because healthy bird populations are an indicator of a larger healthy environment for wildlife.

Different songbirds thrive in different types of forests. The observation that commercial forestry and breeding songbirds could coexist was important for Maine. Roughly 10 million acres – half the state’s land mass – was a contiguous working forest punctuated by sparse development.

That’s still true in 2021. Maine’s North Woods remains the largest uninterrupted tract of forest east of the Mississippi River. And as more land is developed in Maine and elsewhere the ability of commercial forests to provide a welcoming summer home for songbirds will become even more vital for retaining biodiversity.

An aerial photo from 1993 below shows dramatic changes in a 15000-acre tract of commercial woodland northeast of Moosehead Lake. The Ragmuff Clearcut as it’s known reflected forestry practices of the 1980s.

Below the same area in 2021. Today most of the land is reforested and in the early stages of being thinned by new landowners. Researchers are studying the impact of changing forestry practices on migrating songbirds in a nationally significant nesting area.

THE CLEARCUT PARADOX

In 2019 a landmark study published in the journal Science concluded that the number of birds in North America had fallen overall by nearly 30 percent since 1970 a decline of nearly 3 billion birds in 50 years.

Today the National Audubon Society has identified 17.8 million acres of forest in western and northern Maine as the largest “Important Bird Area” in the contiguous United States as well as a top global priority for conservation.

And while not directly tied to bird habitat this extensive woodland acts like a giant sponge that helps soak up at least 60 percent of the state’s annual carbon dioxide emissions a critical buffer against the impacts of climate change. Maine’s Climate Action Plan calls for creating incentives to increase carbon storage through forest management practices and a task force now is looking at that issue for small to midsize landowners.

Against this backdrop the key researchers who carried out the 1992 work have come back to Maine.

They’ve begun a three-year $300000 study aimed at repeating the survey work they did three decades ago. They call it the “Thirty-Year Bird Study: Changes in forest practices and bird populations in Maine’s commercial forest: 1992-2022.”

The researchers want to see which bird populations have increased or declined and how those changes compare with regional and national trends. In concert with landowners they also want to determine whether some of today’s forest management practices could be fine-tuned for the benefit of both birds and timber supply.

“What we’re trying to do is to put this commercial landscape into a national perspective” said John Hagan an ornithologist and senior adviser on the project.

Hagan is the former president of Manomet Inc. a nonprofit conservation and research organization with offices in Brunswick and Plymouth Massachusetts. He lives in Georgetown and now focuses on climate change issues.

Over a two-day period in July Hagan led a tour of commercial forestland harvesting operations and bird survey plots in an area located roughly between the northeast tip of Moosehead Lake and Chesuncook Lake. This is a remote region bisected by logging roads and streams punctuated by ponds and wetlands. Here a full spectrum of how timber is managed in Maine’s spruce-fir northern hardwood forest is on display including clearcuts.

Hagan had to confront the paradox of clearcuts 30 years ago when a forester first took him into an adjacent logging operation. In a policy paper he wrote in 1996 Hagan called it an “appalling sight” that left him disoriented.

But when his field crew starting surveying the area in 1992 they found the scrubby area full of birds.

He wrote: “Many of the species that used these habitats were species of conservation concern (e.g. chestnut-sided warbler common yellowthroat American kestrel Lincoln’s sparrow mourning warbler …). Clearcuts were not the biological deserts I had thought. My own data demanded that I confront my preconceptions.”

In July Hagan was still struck by the contrast when he compared an aerial photo of the Ragmuff Clearcut in 1993 with a drone shot he took this year. Twenty-eight years later most of the 15000 once-denuded areas in the clearcut are covered with standing timber. It has become one of the largest tracts of mid-age forest in Maine.

“Clearcuts grow back in Maine” Hagan said.

LOSS CHANGE AND OPPORTUNITY

A mix of factors have altered the condition of Maine’s commercial forests over the past 30 years and the bird habitats they provide.

For starters massive clearcuts are a thing of the past. Public outrage over photos such as the Ragmuff operation triggered a hotly contested referendum to ban clearcuts in 1996. The measure was defeated but it put the industry on notice and led to stricter state regulations such as the Maine Forest Practices Act which limits clearcuts to 250 acres.

Large clearcuts have been replaced by partial harvesting operations. That has resulted in more acres being cut each year to feed lumber and paper mills.

Driving the changes in silviculture the term for tree cultivation practices is a shift in who owns the Maine Woods.

Maine’s historic vertically integrated timber companies such as Great Northern Paper and its successor Bowater Inc. owned the Ragmuff land. Those companies no longer exist. Nor do the paper mills they supplied in Millinocket and East Millinocket.

In their place came a fragmented ownership of timber investment management organizations and individuals with different goals and shorter financial time horizons. They were more likely to cut on a 10-year cycle for example so trees didn’t get large enough to support bird species that like to nest in mature forests with closed canopies.

At the same time the market transition gave conservation interests a once-in-a-generation opportunity to buy and preserve large tracts of what had been working forest.

South of the township the Appalachian Mountain Club purchased 70000 acres in 2003 from International Paper Co. for its Maine Woods Initiative. The group is raising money now to buy 27000 additional acres from an investment fund. Some of this land is being sustainably harvested but other tracts will grow into ecologically important mature forest.

On the eastern shore of Moosehead Lake the state was able to buy 4242 acres in 2002 that comprise Big Spencer Mountain and mature hardwood stands that haven’t been cut in more than a century. Today the parcel is part of the state’s ecological reserve system.

PARADISE IN THE DARKNESS

These changes are evident today across the landscape northeast of Moosehead Lake as is the concept of a shifting mosaic of managed forestland. In July foresters from LandVest Huber Resources Corp. and Weyerhaeuser Co. offered to explain their management practices on some of the land being surveyed by the bird researchers.

In one section of the old Ragmuff Clearcut a thicket of balsam fir is taking over. Foresters disparagingly call this a “dog-hair stand.” The trees are so close together that a person can barely squeeze through the branches. It’s nearly dark inside.

But songbirds that nest in this habitat such as golden-crown kinglets and bay-breasted warblers like the close quarters. They have been observed by the project’s field crew – Jonah Levy a Tufts University graduate student and Kelsi Anderson a biological researcher from Colorado.

Standing in the dense woods last month the researchers discussed how this stand provides the meals nesting birds count on such as spider eggs and moth cocoons. Levy found an inchworm on the forest floor and examined it.

“There must be the right kind of food for them here” he said. “The nesting season is so short they need to find the right food to raise their young.”

Levy and Anderson have come to know this land well. While birds were calling and looking for mates in May and June the duo conducted predawn bird surveys on a total of 120 sites.

Expert birders don’t need to see a bird to identify it. They do most of their work by ear listening and recording data inside a set radius.

The results of these so-called point counts can be compared with data from 1992. Next year a bigger field crew will survey three times as many sites in the Moosehead Lake area to coincide with the work done three decades earlier.

With the point counts done the field crew was returning in July to the sites to conduct vegetation surveys documenting the types of tree on the land their age classes and canopy characteristics. Levy and Anderson used a tape measure to define the plot boundaries. They sighted through a hypsometer a forestry instrument that calculates height to determine how tall the trees were. This information is transferred to coded maps.

Although some birds may prefer nesting in a dog-hair stand it’s a challenging place for foresters said Jim O’Malley northern Maine regional forester for LandVest.

LandVest is managing this parcel for a company owned by Peter Buck co-founder of the fast-food chain Subway. Buck a South Portland native and Bowdoin College graduate owns more than 1.2 million acres in Maine and is the country’s seventh-largest private landowner according to The Land Report.

O’Malley has been attempting some thinning in the area but the thick stands make it hard. This stand also is vulnerable to damaging insects notably the spruce budworm so he’s considering options.

“Do we continue to thin or do we cut it hard and reset the clock?” O’Malley said.

HIGHER PERCHES FOR WARBLERS

The dog-hair stand is very different from the one O’Malley went to next a few miles away off the Golden Road. This is a mature softwood stand dominated by tall black spruce. Dappled sunlight penetrates the understory permitting small balsam fir and maple saplings to spring up.

Blackburnian warblers known for their flaming orange throats and their long journeys from South America like this habitat. They spend their time here high in the canopy.

O’Malley brought along an increment borer a forestry tool used to extract wood tissue from the core of a tree. After screwing in the shaft he pulled it out and counted the rings. This tree is 85 years old.

“This is prime saw log and stud wood now” he said.

On nearby land managed by Huber and owned by Buck’s company a logging crew was clearcutting 13 acres of 40-year-old spruce and fir. The stand is in an area prone to wind damage so foresters decided to cut it now.

The harvest is a three-person operation. It started with a feller buncher a motorized vehicle with a large arm and rotary saw that cut trees and stacked them as it moved through the stand. Behind the feller buncher a processor instantly stripped the branches. Then a logger driving a forwarder sorted the pile with a grapple and carried the timber to a roadside pile. The logs will end up at Moose River Lumber Co. in Jackman and become two-by-fours.

This small clearcut is adjacent to mid-age forest. Warblers and other birds that nest nearby may fatten up prior to fall migration on the raspberries and blueberries that will emerge.

Huber manages 650000 acres in Maine. Most of its clients want their land harvested in a sustainable manner according to Trevor London Huber’s director of operations. The health of birds which eat vast quantities of insects including those that damage some trees are part of the management equation.

“It’s important for our clients to operate with the best research available” London said.

The tour soon came onto a logging road north of Kokadjo next to land that looks like a Christmas tree farm. It’s a spruce and fir stand managed by Weyerhaeuser. The company owns 850000 acres in Maine half of it around Moosehead Lake.

Sixteen years ago Plum Creek Timber Co. announced plans to create house lots and a resort on 17000 acres around the lake. Weyerhaeuser which acquired Plum Creek in 2015 has since abandoned those plans.

In a few years the company expects to conduct what’s called pre-commercial thinning here. This method removes small growth to space out the stand so the remaining trees can get big enough to become lumber. That will likely happen in 25 years or so.

Foresters here also had set aside some big trees and wooded patches that can serve as perches for birds. During the visit Levy heard the calls of a song sparrow and Lincoln’s sparrow which forage for seeds and insects on the ground. Then the group spotted a sharp-shinned hawk gliding overhead. Sparrows beware: This small raptor is known to swoop down and catch songbirds in midair.

CRUNCHING DATA TO PROTECT BIRDS

As this year’s field work winds down Hagan and his team are taking stock of what they’ve learned and gearing up for a major survey effort in 2022. They were able to raise $53000 from sources including the Cooperative Forestry Research Unit at the University of Maine. They’re currently soliciting funding from national foundations and conservation interests for next year.

The team has developed a matrix from this year’s surveys that records birds per acre and per species in a variety of forest types. The forest habitats range from clearcuts to mixed hardwood stands and mature softwood stands. The status of each of roughly 60 species of bird is noted for each forest type.

“I’m pleased that the suite of birds is still here” Hagan said. “They are still using this landscape and they are as dense as they were 29 years ago.”

But Hagan is concerned about the impact that fewer mature hardwood stands may have on the birds that depend on them the results of partial cutting and a recent industry preference for more hardwood fiber.

The next step is to compare the data with what’s happening nationally. That will help show whether species populations that are declining in North America are also trending downward in Maine’s commercial forests and whether different silvicultural practices can help.

The good news Hagan said is that Maine’s working forest has largely escaped development pressures after 30 years. It remains a globally significant nesting place for migrating songbirds. The question now is how to balance today’s forestry practices with the needs of birds that have been migrating here for thousands of years and the new urgency to store more carbon related to climate change.

“Just letting the forest grow” Hagan said “is probably not a solution.”

In Hard Reset: Framing Diversity Equity and Inclusion as the New Normal Marlin Williams and Marlo Rencher argue that the economy’s reignition in the Black Lives Matter and post-COVID-19 era provides an important opportunity for a range of organizations to reimagine how they approach these often-thorny issues.

“Embracing inclusion and equity is not an act of weakness or surrender” write Williams vice president of global diversity and inclusion at StockX and Rencher the director of technology-based programs for TechTown Detroit and founder of Tech Founders Academy in their opening chapter. “It’s a business imperative rooted in common sense. Strategic fairness profits all.”

The authors self-published this slim volume of case studies they say because both the pandemic and the national reckoning on racial disparities jumpstarted by the murder by police of George Floyd illuminated the importance of a fairer society and more inclusive work culture.

“Workplaces around the world from mom-and-pop establishments to global enterprises are facing a hard reset on their relationships with their employees” they write early on. Frontline workers during the pandemic — health aides nurses cashiers utility staff — have often been underpaid which creates a ripple effect of problems for the economy writ large they note. “In terms of pay and quality-of-life inequities all those things happen on systemic and organizational levels” Rencher says. “There’s a perception this change can be addressed solely on the individual level but organizations are where inequities are structurally embedded.”

Rencher and Williams offer Hard Reset as a guidebook of sorts to organization leaders reluctant to spend big on this pursuit as well as to those eager to do so but unsure about how to start. In Hard Reset Rencher and Williams recite case studies and recall their own personal workplace experiences to assert the need for a top-to-bottom review of whether companies are doing the best for all employees. Their advice can be useful not only for for-profit businesses but “all the places you’re socially working with other folks” including church and social clubs.

Yet the most provocative notion is that a lack of inclusion and diversity can hurt profits and diminish an organization’s ability to retain talent. “Upcoming generations are much less inclined to accept the status quo” Rencher says. “Your top talent is not going to want to work somewhere people aren’t treated fairly.”

They’re also often adept at seeing through cosmetic changes that are unsupported by substance. Rencher says many organizations present a sympathetic facade on social media but that’s as far as it goes. “I’m not saying don’t put your efforts out there” Rencher says. “But most companies are not structured for inclusion so there’s a great deal of deeper more strategic work to be done. You need to have not only a plan but also actual resources behind it.”

Read more

The days of the stalwart solo physician hanging out a shingle and seeing patients as he or she sees fit are rapidly drawing to a close. Consulting firm Avalere Health reports that almost 70% of physicians in the United States now work as employees of a hospital health system or private corporation. That’s a 12% increase over just two years ago and is likely to accelerate after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report is “a stunning document” that shows just how much the profession of medicine is changing said Richard Baron president of the American Board of Internal Medicine the Philadelphia-based group that certifies the expertise of internists.

What do the changes mean for practicing physicians?

It suits some quite well such as Kevin Zakrzewski an internist at Abington-Jefferson Health who has practiced as an employee for his entire 22-year career. Employment means he “can move away from the business side” and focus on caring for patients. “The HR issues alone in running a private practice are immense” he said.

Besides he can take vacations without worrying about the hit to practice revenue.

New Hampshire orthopedist Charles Blitzer and his seven partners would agree. They sold their practice in 2018 to Wentworth-Douglas Hospital an affiliate of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Running an independent medical practice has come to require “high-level administrative skills” that Blitzer and his partners “had no desire to acquire.”

“I went to medical school to practice clinical medicine” not to be entrepreneurial he said.

There are trade-offs however. By turning over the business side of their practice to a large organization Blitzer and his colleagues “are not nearly as nimble as they were” when it comes to such functions as purchasing. “To replace an ultrasound machine in the office we have to go through a complex process.”

But Blitzer feels that “overall work life has not profoundly changed.”

Others are less sanguine. Steven Fassler a colorectal surgeon based at Abington has chosen to keep his practice independent. Although Fassler has staff privileges at the hospital performs surgery and admits patients there he does so through his own practice which is like a small business. It bills and collects for his services and handles administrative aspects of his practice. “I don’t like letting people tell me what to do” he said. He fears that “the force of a corporate structure alters the culture of what you want to do.”

Fassler is especially concerned that a corporate boss could make doctors pay greater heed to their employers and not their patients. The change can occur in little pieces and “all of a sudden you’re working for the dark side.”

Economic forces are making it increasingly difficult for physicians to remain in private practice. Among the first to feel the effect were older physicians contemplating retirement who have found the younger generation less willing to take on the risks and demands of independent practice and more receptive to the security of employment.

Other more subtle financial pressures include cuts to Medicare payments for imaging tests performed by cardiologists orthopedists and oncologists in their offices that make their practices less lucrative.

And many payers including Medicare and some private insurers are increasingly basing reimbursement on value-based purchasing which compares the amount paid for services with their clinical value. Administering these arrangements piles on yet more practice overhead expense.

Other administrative concerns such as the cost of malpractice insurance have been driving physicians to employment for some time. But they do not appear to account for the recent acceleration of the trend experts said.

As significant as they are these pressures pale in comparison with the administrative burden of installing and operating electronic medical records systems commonly known as EMRs. A system can cost $15000 to $70000 per provider and installing it can disrupt a practice’s workflow and revenue while physicians and staff learn how to use it.

Yet medical practices have little choice about incurring the expense. A federal law enacted in 2009 penalizes physicians who do not engage in “meaningful use” of EMRs by reducing their Medicare reimbursement.

It is also increasingly difficult to practice without an EMR which enables physicians to share information instantaneously with colleagues. Blitzer described an experience in which he diagnosed a patient with a tumor on a Friday afternoon and confirmed that the patient had visited an oncologist on Monday morning by seeing the oncologist’s notes in the system.

Larger systems can also invest in ways to make EMRs easier to use. For Blitzer and Zakrzewski that has meant funding to hire scribes who join physicians and patients in the exam room to document the encounter in the EMR letting the physician focus exclusively on the patient.

As if these disadvantages for independent practices were not enough the COVID-19 pandemic dealt them another huge blow as patient volumes and revenues shrank while medical supply expenses grew. In the face of these pressures Zakrzewski saw some colleagues in smaller practices go without a paycheck for several months a predicament that he and his employed colleagues were able to avoid.

Consulting firm McKinsey & Company predicts that COVID-19 will lead to more practice acquisitions with the pace accelerating in 2021 as smaller hospitals and independent physician groups seek partners to cushion the continuing financial fallout.

For hospitals owning physician practices offers protection against a rising tide of threats in a rapidly changing health care environment. Some especially in rural areas are trying to ensure that a base of primary care remains in their community. Others see the chance to steer physicians away from competing providers. Owning physician practices can provide protection against laws that restrict paying financial incentives for referrals.

For still others it is a way to maximize reimbursement under Medicare’s arcane and changing billing rules.

And of paramount importance to many hospitals consolidation is a way to leverage a larger size in bargaining with insurance companies.

The recent wave of practice acquisitions began about two years ago and it could turn out to alter the entire health-care landscape. It’s now not just hospitals that are snapping up practices. The share of acquisitions by private equity firms rose from 35% in 2016 to 77% in 2019. In 2018 they spent $32.9 billion on 647 health-care transactions twice the number as in 2014.

Insurance companies are also getting into the act. UnitedHealth Group’s Optum division employs more than 53000 primary-care and specialty physicians in several states. It recently acquired Surgical Care Affiliates a company that owns or operates 190 ambulatory surgery centers and surgical hospitals.

Even some insurers that do not own practices are welcoming the trend. For Donald Liss chief medical officer for Horizon Blue Cross in New Jersey negotiating with a single party is easier than with a host of smaller ones. The larger patient bases of bigger organizations also make it easier to try out “more creative and innovative arrangements” like paying for services based on their clinical value.

Where does all this leave patients?

Baron sees better care from more effective use of information systems. “Patients absolutely benefit when their clinicians have more information about them.”

And if you peel away the technology “clinical medicine is still clinical medicine” Liss observed. “It is still about an intense relationship between a physician and a patient.”

Unemployment for young people (in the 16-24 age range) hit a high of 27.4% in April 2020 — that's nearly 1 in 3 who were unemployed. Meanwhile Etsy reported that the number of sellers on its platform nearly doubled to 4.4 million by the end of 2020. They don't break it down by age group but Etsy reports the average age of its sellers is normally 39 but last year when creators started selling goods during the pandemic the average age dropped to 33. That says a lot of young people were turning to Etsy for a source of income. Face masks sanitizing kits homemade household items care packages and even virtual hugs were some side business students created in the pandemic. They sold them on e-commerce sites like Etsy but also directly on social media platforms like Instagram. Instagram says 90% of its users follow a business. And 50% of users surveyed by Facebook (Instagram's parent company) said they are more interested in a brand when they see ads for it on Instagram.

Madison Klimchak a 20-year-old rising senior at the University of South Carolina majoring in finance and risk management and insurance sold personalized reusable masks to sororities and other organizations. She promoted them on Instagram and her typical order was 150 to 400 masks at the height of the pandemic in March. She sold them for about $10 each and a portion of the proceeds was donated to the Emotional PPE Project which connects health-care workers with mental-health services. Klimchak said she chose Instagram because she already had a following and it was easier to promote on her personal accounts. When business started to slow down as mask mandates eased up college entrepreneurs like Klimchak had a decision to make: Do you pivot to another type of business or shut it down? Ultimately she decided to close up shop and focus on her career and obtaining her Graduate Record Examinations (GRE). ""I will think about going back but for now I will focus on studying for my GRE"" Klimchak said. She noted that experience helped her understand the business world and gain skills for her future.

Generation Hustle: Young entrepreneurs got creative during the pandemic

How college students are turning hobbies into side hustles — and extra cash

How I started my own successful YouTube channel reviewing tech products Jacqueline Cabrera a 23-year-old former student at the Fashion Institute of Technology also sold masks during the pandemic. She sold them in uptown Manhattan both through her personal Instagram account and the one she used to showcase her fashion design portfolio. Cabrera said she chose Instagram because she already had a following. ""I already had an Instagram page/website for my fashion design portfolio where I occasionally showcased some of my work so this is where I began selling my face masks"" Cabrera said. ""I also promoted it on my personal Instagram where I had more of a following so that definitely helped to draw more attention to my business."" Cabrera's business lasted a successful 8 months and was able to take in $2000 to to $3000 in sales. But as the number of mask sellers rose and sales waned she ultimately decided to pivot back to her career in fashion design.

""The market for them became very saturated over the pandemic once it went from no one selling them to everyone selling them"" Cabrera said. ""The fashion industry is where I aspired to grow as a professional so I thought to myself: Why not put my skills to use and follow the example of the industry I wanted to be in?"" Cabrera explained. ""I was able to land my first full-time position in the fashion industry as an assistant designer."" Cabrera said she has certainly thought of going back to her business one day with a focus on apparel or accessories. For other college students who already had side hustles when Covid hit like 22-year-old Grace Williams the pandemic actually forced a pivot. Williams graduated from Farmingdale State College with a bachelor's in business management amid the pandemic in 2020. She had created a slime business freshman year of college – several years before the pandemic. She advertised on Instagram Facebook and YouTube which allowed her to connect with followers and grow relationships. She also attended slime conventions in person across the U.S selling in-person to thousands of ticket holders.

""It was great that my product was handmade as costs were low and I was in control. But it had its downside once the pandemic hit and everyone was nervous about germs"" she said. Sales started to fall. So Williams pivoted: She started making content on TikTok and looked for brands who were looking to promote their products. There were a lot of benefits to this move: She no longer had to create physical products and manage inventory and she could work remotely from anywhere. ""This is when I completely turned my hands-on business to hands-off relying on technology and creating content from my phone"" she said. ""I have always had a passion for creating content and making others smile through my videos"" Williams said. ""This allows me to work remotely from anywhere in the world and influence others in a positive way."" Starting a business when the economy is suffering could be far from easy but these young entrepreneurs reflected upon their experience and have advice for college students who may be thinking about launching a side hustle. ""Plan and learn how to manage your time"" Cabrera said. ""I would recommend having inventory instead of 'made to order' products.""

Andrew Kelly | Reuters

Employers in the U.S. face an interesting challenge ahead – how to fill nearly 10 million job openings with about a million fewer workers than there are positions available. How successful they are will go a long way in determining whether the recent strong of outsized job gains can continue. The Department of Labor reported Friday that there are some 8.7 million potential workers who have been looking for jobs and are counted among the unemployed. At the same time job placement site Indeed estimates there are about 9.8 million job vacancies as of July 16 or just a few days after the government's sample period for the monthly numbers. Companies have been using a variety of techniques including signing bonuses higher salaries and flexible working arrangements to entice people. That likely will have to continue as the Covid-19 pandemic changes the jobs market perhaps permanently. ""This is one of the most complex labor markets in recent memory"" said Scott Hamilton global managing director for the human resources and compensation consulting practice at Gallagher a global insurance brokerage risk management and consulting firm. ""One of the biggest factors is employers are essentially having to buy back job applicants' Covid lifestyle.""

A just-released survey from Gallagher shows the extent to which employers are willing to go to entice workers in the pandemic era. Some 41% of employers responding said they are offering enhanced benefits. One such enticement: 19% say they are offering pet insurance a perk that is expected to rise to 27% of companies in the next two years. They're also providing discount programs legal services and identity theft protection though 71% of respondents said medical and pharmacy benefits remain atop the most important added benefits they're offering. Job growth has been surging in recent months with July's number reported Friday showing an addition of 943000 the biggest spike since August 2020. That came on top of respective gains of 938000 and 614000 in the previous two months for an impressive three-month average of 832000. Still there's a lot more work to be done as there are still 6.1 million fewer Americans working now than in February 2020 just before the pandemic hit. ""Labor force participation is flat so this is just job regrowth"" Hamilton said. ""All the big jobs numbers are great but we're still growing into lost jobs. So it's going to get slower as folks are coming back into the market with changed expectations and changed lifestyles.""

Unemployment benefits could be key

One important factor looming ahead is the September expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits. Indeed reports that in past months many workers had refrained from taking jobs they didn't want because they had enough financial cushion to wait. Even with concerns about the virus the need to get back to work will start to grow. ""Money issues seem to be a rising concern among unemployed workers not searching urgently"" Nick Bunker Indeed's economic research director said in a recent report. ""More of them said the end of [unemployment insurance] benefits or financial cushions running low were major milestones that could prompt them to take a job.""

Enhanced benefits child care issues and fear over the pandemic and now its delta variant have long led the list of things keeping people out of their jobs. Each could continue to play a role though renewed precautions over the delta strain are likely to become front and center. ""They're all important they're all interconnected"" said Joseph LaVorgna chief economist for the Americas at Natixis and former chief White House economist during the Trump administration. ""So I guess it's dependent on what happens in the fall. Are schools going to reopen? If they're not going to reopen if people are limited in their ability to send their kids to school some people are going to be hard-pressed to go back to the labor market."" July's nonfarm payrolls report provided a raft of good news across a variety of areas. While the total employed is well below its pre-pandemic level it did improve by 1.04 million. Labor force participation inched up at least to 61.7% as the unemployment rate slid to 5.3%. And a gauge that measures the employment level compared to the total working-age population – a metric critically important to Federal Reserve policymakers – rose to 58.4% its best since March 2020 and now just 2.7 percentage points below its peak. Heading into the end of the summer the unusual burden of convincing workers to fill a historically high level of job openings will be critical for the economy. ""We have a lot of cloudy skies and that's largely tied to delta and delta-plus"" said Beth Ann Bovino chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings. ""There's still a lot of moving parts. I wouldn't call the game over yet.""

""I think it's obviously extremely exciting for our hockey program and our whole community to finally be a part of this great day"" Senior High coach Tyler Palmiscno said. ""It's just another exciting thing for our program. If you look at the last 10-15 years our program has taken steps obviously with some success we've had and some things we've done internally. To finally put that on display will be great.""

Outdoor games have been a staple of Hockey Day Minnesota.

It started on Baudette Bay in 2007 and 2008. It has played at other outdoor locations including Lake Pokegama near Grand Rapids and Lake Bemidji. But this year will be the first time it has been played at a football stadium. Blakeslee Field (capacity 7500) is home for the Minnesota State-Mankato football team.

There will be three games played at Blakeslee Field on Jan. 22: a girls game between Edina and Andover at 9:30 a.m. the boys game between the Green Wave and Prior Lake at 1 p.m. and a men's college game between Division-I newcomer St. Thomas and NCAA Frozen Four semifinalist MSU-Mankato at 4:30 p.m.

The final televised game of the day will be the Minnesota Wild and Chicago Blackhawks at Xcel Energy Center.

Palmiscno and some Green Wave players made the trip to Mankato on Saturday for the official announcement.

""After the announcement we drove over to the stadium"" Palmiscno said. ""It's going to be an awesome setting. It's a cool stadium. I think it's going to be a pretty cool atmosphere for a hockey game.""

The Green Wave were initially selected to be a part of last year's Hockey Day Minnesota event but the coronavirus pandemic spoiled that. Palmiscno said they're excited they still get to participate.

""(Hockey Day Minnesota) has been going on for almost 15 years now"" Palmiscno said. ""We've always wanted to be a part of it probably like every program in the state.""

The Green Wave are coming off of a Section 8A title and a trip to the Minnesota state semifinals. Several key players on that team were not seniors including UND commit Jaksen Panzer UND commit Trey Ausmus Caleb Schmiedeberg Zach Stocker Justin Overgaard and Grady Magner.

""Obviously they're extremely excited"" Palmiscno said of his players. ""Every year we seem to play somewhere when this day is going on. If you're on the bus you see kids watching the live feed throughout the day. For these kids to finally be a part of it it makes it that much more special.""

Given the COVID-19 pandemic the King Soopers mass shooting and the intensity of the discourse around the CU South annexation project and the Xcel Energy franchise agreement Wallach said it made sense that others opted against running for re-election.

“I think that’s an indication of how hard this two-year term has been” he said.

“They’re all probably smarter than I am” Wallach quipped. “I had a sense of wanting to provide some continuity on Council.”

Additionally he argues there’s work left to be done.

Wallach a retired developer who spent the majority of his life in New York moved to Boulder in 2014.

In his time on the Council Wallach is perhaps most proud of his work on the financial strategy committee. On that committee Wallach worked with the city’s financial team to make challenging decisions during the pandemic and assisted as Boulder worked to develop the framework for the capital infrastructure tax extension ballot measure. Boulder voters will decide whether to extend the 0.3% sales tax in November.

Moving forward Wallach would like to focus on housing. He maintains that the city should consider converting the Boulder Municipal Airport into affordable housing an idea he pushed during the 2019 election as well.

“I’d like to take a greater look at our unutilized real estate assets to see what we can do with them” he said adding “It’s a funny debate we have in this town. Everybody wants affordable housing. The argument is over what strategies are actually going to be effective to create it.”

As of Friday there are eight candidates who are certified to campaign for one of five vacant seats on the Boulder City Council. The nomination petition period concludes Aug. 23. The Daily Camera is writing a short story on each candidate as they are certified.",,,,,,

Park City took another approach to water conservation,"(Park City Public Utilities) Park City Public Utilities engineer Griffin Lloyd gets sprayed with water when the city uncovered a water main that had likely been leaking for years.

This story is part of The Salt Lake Tribune’s ongoing commitment to identify solutions to Utah’s biggest challenges through the work of the Innovation Lab.

As persistent drought conditions have threatened the water supply in Utah Park City residents met the call to conserve by cutting water use by 50% since 2000. The city’s tiered water pricing notices to residents of potential water overuse and savings comparisons with similar water users encouraged the residents to cut back.

But huge amounts of water were still being wasted.

Park City Public Utilities was losing about one third of its water before it was even getting to customers in 2018 water resource manager Jason Christensen said. Some of that was from routine maintenance like water flushing to remove debris from pipes and some could be from faulty meters that didn’t record all the water a home used but it looked like a much simpler problem.

Park City was dealing with leaky pipes. In a home that may mean enough water to fill up a bucket every day or so but in Park City that was enough to fill Olympic-size swimming pools.

In Utah’s arid conditions Park City Public Utilities decided that water is too precious to just let go.

“We needed to take a hard look at and see how we could improve and reduce our water loss in the system” Christensen said.

Park City contracted Xylem a New York-based water technology company to identify problem areas in the utility’s infrastructure.

One way Xylem is able to help Park City identify leaks underground is with machinery that listens to the pipes. When pipes are leaking or have pressure problems there is a sound that these machines and crews can detect Christensen said.

When a crew isn’t able to determine where a leak is sensors can also be placed to continuously monitor the area. Using that data Xylem can notify Park City about locations of leaks.

A $70000 investment in that sensing technology identified several leaks in the Upper Deer Valley that were spilling about 400 gallons a minute of water. One hour of water lost from those leaks could supply about 100 homes for a day. Fixing those leaks saved about $200000 a year Christensen said.

“It helps us save money which we’re able to pass on to all the residents from Park City” Christensen said. “It also helps us save water which is especially critical in an exceptional drought like this year.”

Billions of gallons of water lost

Park City’s water problems weren’t unusual either. It is one of thousands of water utilities around the country working to close up leaks before they lose significant amounts of water.

Every day about 6 billion gallons of drinking water leaks from utilities across the country according to the most recent report from the American Society of Civil Engineers. That’s enough water for 9000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

Aging infrastructure is a “fundamental piece” of why utilities are losing water through leaks Xylem vice president of business incubation Christine Boyle said. Without an influx of cash to do repairs all across the water lines utilities need to find ways to prioritize where they make repairs or replace pipes.

“The financial reality of how these utilities operate is that things at some point break faster than the utility is able to keep up with maintenance” said Boyle who has a PhD in water economics.

Using data to conserve water

Park City is also working with Xylem to use its Hidden Revenue Locator program which was based on technology developed by Boyle. Boyle joined Xylem when the company bought her startup and technology Valor Water Analytics.

Using software developed in part by Boyle Park City will be able to determine whether the water meters on certain homes are inaccurate.

When customers’ meters undercount the amount of water used utilities lose out on revenue. Inaccurate meters also make it more difficult for users and the utilities to identify whether conservation goals are being met.

There’s also an equity component to making sure meters are accurate Christensen said.

“One of our goals is to make sure that the system is treating everyone fairly” Christensen said. “If your neighbor is using more water to irrigate his lawn he’s paying the price of that additional water.”

Getting started on infrastructure

Stopping leaks can better maintain water supplies amid droughts which are more likely to persist with the effects of climate change on Utah.

“I do think it’s something we all should take a look at as we plan for the future” Christensen said of utilities.

Contracting with companies to identify leaks has saved the utility money in the long run. Companies use the same technology for each utility they work with which lessens the burden of research and development costs that any one utility would have spent for that technology.

But that doesn’t mean dealing with leaks is cheap Christensen said. It was just a worthwhile investment.

“Any time you look at real water losses there’s going to be a [large] price tag” Christensen said. “Thankfully our city council and community were willing to invest.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
