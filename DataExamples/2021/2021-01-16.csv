The what-ifs and unknowns are difficult — and all the money from Minnesota's $850 million settlement with 3M Co. over the groundwater pollution from the man-made chemicals won't change that.

""Your instinct as a mother is to blame yourself"" DeWoskin said choking back tears. ""Did I expose myself to something?""

The township is a hot spot for contamination from the man-made per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances called PFAS. The toxic nonstick chemicals manufactured by Maplewood-based 3M are linked to a host of diseases and don't break down in the environment. They've polluted more than 150 square miles of groundwater across southern Washington County affecting the drinking water of 14 communities and more than 170000 Minnesotans.

The scale of the problem is enormous and state officials trying to divvy up the settlement face little consensus among cities residents environmental groups — and now 3M — over how to spend it. A sample of the more than 200 public comments on the three options the state issued last fall show myriad concerns such as costs being underestimated priorities being misplaced and PFAS treatment levels not being strict enough.

In its 24-page letter to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and the state Department of Natural Resources 3M Co. lawyers blasted the proposals for violating terms of the settlement. For example the company said many of the drinking water projects under consideration are not ""reasonable and necessary"" projects as the settlement requires.

The MPCA said the settlement clearly gives the state the sole authority to pick projects and all three of the proposals fit the settlement's goals. 3M has no veto authority said MPCA Assistant Commissioner Kirk Koudelka.

But it could take the state to court.

""Whether 3M selects to do so and attempts to delay the implementation of a future final decision on projects is up to them"" Koudelka said. ""We hope after our very public and inclusive process which 3M is a part of they do not decide to attempt to delay the implementation of projects.""

3M issued a statement saying it ""looks forward to continued engagement in this discussion.""

Despite the discord the state still aims to have a final plan in hand by late spring. Officials are now busy revising cost estimates upward and analyzing all the suggestions.

""The final decision isn't going to be a carbon copy of one of those three options"" Koudelka said. ""They are going to morph and change based on the feedback we're getting.""

Water system overhaul

Getting PFAS out of the tap water in Washington County means building million-dollar treatment systems shuttering private residential wells constructing a vast network of pipes installing more filters like the DeWoskins have and much more.

""It's a logistical nightmare"" said Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz an attorney with the San Francisco-based environmental nonprofit Earthjustice who works on PFAS issues.

Nationally concerns will arise again and again he said as the mass of PFAS litigation from coast to coast gets resolved. Everyone is trying to figure out how to safely remediate PFAS and get it out of the drinking water.

Two of Minnesota's options for Washington County are similar involving different mixes of new public wells public water treatment plants new water mains and granular carbon-activated filters to homeowners for example. The second option includes a stricter treatment standard for PFAS than the first option which is the state's preferred choice but both levels are stricter than the state's current safety guidelines for PFAS.

The third option would connect Oakdale and Lake Elmo to St. Paul Regional Water Services switching their water source from groundwater to the Mississippi River.

For Lake Elmo none of the options ensures it keeps its own municipal water system said city administrator Kristina Handt. She said the city was caught off guard by a last-minute proposal to connect it to Woodbury's system.

""We really feel like we've had everything upended on us at the 11th hour"" Handt said. ""We are going to keep fighting for them until we can't fight anymore.""

Woodbury meanwhile has requested multiple changes to the proposals. For example it wants treatments for all existing municipal wells across the settlement area and wants treatment to the strictest possible health risk level.

""As water providers we have a responsibility to provide equitable water and service across all of our ratepayers"" said Mary Hurliman Woodbury's public works director. ""We're still waiting for what the solution is.""

Oakdale City Administrator Christina Volkers agreed saying there are too many questions to pick an option: ""We just need some answers.""

Rural township's resistance

West Lakeland Township is a wooded community bordered by Interstate 94 to the south and the St. Croix River to the east. It's had a minimum lot size of 2½ acres since the 1970s and residents rely on private wells. It was hit hard by PFAS.

All the proposals call for building the township its first municipal water system and hooking up many homes. It's unclear how much that will increase local water bills. The state estimated that it costs about $500 a year to maintain a private well and that hooking up to a municipal system will double that said Township Supervisor Marian Appelt.

""Right now we have nothing to go on for what the water costs would be"" she said.

Many residents also dislike the idea that the state would likely require the contaminated private wells to be sealed preventing their use for such things such as irrigating lawns. The concerns persist even though sprinkling contaminated water would spread PFAS again.

""I think that is a huge hurdle for support behind the municipal system"" Appelt said. ""If they were able to keep their private wells for irrigation purposes I think there would be stronger support.""

Appelt said that many other local residents particularly younger families who are uneasy about the health effects of PFAS have told her privately that they ""can't wait for this to go through.""

DeWoskin said she opposes the new municipal system as too destructive and unnecessary since the carbon filters effectively screen out PFAS.

""I don't want them in the yard digging it up"" she said.

DeWoskin said she drank her well water throughout her pregnancy with Mckenna learning only in 2018 that her well was contaminated — with one of the forever chemicals at levels more than double current health limits. Mckenna now an outgoing 14-year-old who likes fast cars Beethoven and horses was diagnosed as an infant with developmental delays and then epilepsy DeWoskin said. She will never be able to live on her own.

PFAS has been linked to a range of human health impacts including changes in liver enzymes reproductive problems low infant birthweights and kidney and testicular cancer. Fetuses and babies are more vulnerable.

The jury is still out on whether PFAS causes neurological effects according to Harvard University environmental epidemiologist Philippe Grandjean. Helen Goeden senior toxicologist at the Minnesota Department of Health said it's ""very unlikely"" PFAS exposure could have caused Mckenna's particular health issues. 3M has always insisted that PFAS doesn't harm people.

DeWoskin and her former husband Mckenna's father said they will always wonder.

""We don't know what the future holds"" she said of Mc­kenna. ""It's still difficult.""

BREAKDOWN OF 3M PFAS FUNDS

Here's how the state is spending the $850 million settlement with 3M Co. over PFAS ""forever chemicals"":

$700 million for top projects to ensure a safe and sustainable drinking water supply.

$125 million for outside legal counsel assessments and analysis.

$20 million for projects to restore and enhance natural resources.

$4.8 million to reimburse the state for the cost of providing filters temporary drinking water treatment systems and natural resources assessments.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s injury has highlighted that they currently lack a good alternative.

Rafael Leao has played as the centre-forward recently doing a decent job with three goals in five league games. That being said he’s a very different player and Milan could bring in one that’s more similar to Zlatan Ibrahimovic such as Mario Mandzukic.

According to Sky Italia (via MilanNews) the Rossoneri aren’t disputing the Croatian’s technical ability but evaluations are underway with regards other factors. At the age of 34 the striker isn’t exactly young anymore.

Then there is the salary as Mandzukic most likely would get a deal worth at least €3m. Elliott Management the Milan owners have always promoted young players and this would go against that. Of course though it’s tempting given his qualities.

P&K Brothers LLC and its majority owner Phan Tran price-gouged consumers when selling the masks in March through Amazon.com Inc.’s online marketplace the attorney general claimed in a new lawsuit. The complaint filed in Common Pleas Court in Philadelphia seeks restitution for 130 consumers who collectively paid more than $24000 for the marked-up masks as well as civil penalties.

“P&K and Tran have illegally used the health and economic crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic to charge Pennsylvania consumers and other consumers an outrageous price for a vital product that was in very short supply” the complaint said.

Tran did not answer email or phone messages Friday afternoon.

It’s the latest lawsuit brought by Attorney General Josh Shapiro against companies accused of seeking excessive profits during a health emergency. In August he sued another Philadelphia retailer that allegedly charged $75 per hand sanitizer bottle. Since the pandemic swept the nation in March Shapiro’s office has fielded more than 5800 complaints and returned thousands of dollars to Pennsylvanians who paid too much for items ranging from hand sanitizer to water Shapiro said in a statement.

Pennsylvania bars companies from charging more than 20% above the average price recorded for an item the week before an emergency declaration. Gov. Tom Wolf declared a state of emergency on March 6 due to the pandemic.

P&K Brothers allegedly sold 3M brand N95 masks at prices that not only exceeded the market before the state of emergency but also the price the retailer charged just three weeks earlier according to the complaint. On Feb. 13 the firm charged Amazon users $43.00 for a 10-pack of 3M Model 8511 N95 respirator masks. On March 6 it charged between $160 and $200 for the same product the suit said.

P&K Brothers took 130 orders for the masks on March 6 the same day Wolf declared the state of emergency and March 19 the complaint said. The Attorney General’s Office contends the retailer could have canceled the March 6 orders after learning of the state of emergency.

Amazon the online retail giant gave the attorney general a tip about the March 6 order according to the complaint. The company has said it monitors its marketplace and has removed offers for attempted price-gouging. Price hikes last spring were particularly egregious online where third-party sellers using Amazon Craigslist Facebook and other sites sold masks and hand sanitizer at sky-high levels.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhcGFydC5mci9lbi9qb3VybmFsL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvMTYwMTIxL2ZyZW5jaC1wcm9iZS1uaWNvbGFzLXNhcmtvenlzLTNtLWV1cm8tcnVzc2lhbi1jb250cmFjdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,French probe into Nicolas Sarkozy's 3m-euro Russian contract,"The cookies and similar technologies we use on Mediapart are of different natures and allow us to pursue different purposes.

Paul was a Corporate Scientist 3M's highest technical position and a member of the Carleton Society 3M's Hall of Fame and a community of exceptional innovators who also embody uncommon leadership characteristics. At 3M Paul contributed to the development of many successful products; some credit him with the founding inventions of three divisions at 3M. He was a prodigious inventor of medical products including Coban Micropore surgical tape and molded polyester face masks the earliest iteration of the N95 respirator as well as products like Scotchbrite Petrifilm and Nomad. Despite this incredible success as an innovator Paul is perhaps best remembered for his kind and enthusiastic spirit; he was inclusive and encouraging striving to help people make unlikely yet positive connections. Outside of 3M Paul was active in his community and with his family.

Just about every form of entertainment today can trace its roots back through the years and see how classic entertainers helped pave the way for today’s stars. Time and again modern-day celebrities will pay homage to acts from the past as a way to acknowledge this thread of talent that has developed into contemporary entertainment.

The comedy world is definitely filled with these kinds of links. Comedians like Lucille Ball helped pave the way for stars like Tina Fey to shine today. Eddie Murphy’s stand-up is a direct antecedent to many of today’s stars in the genre.

Among these comedic greats are Abbott and Costello a comedy duo that certainly inspired many of today’s stars.

Bud Abbott and Lou Costello were a famous comedy duo

William Alexander “Bud” Abbott and Lou Costello rose to fame with their comedic flair which they brought to the stage onto the radio airwaves and into films and television. The duo did some work together throughout the 1930s. Then as Encyclopedia Britannica reports they officially teamed up in 1936.

They polished their shtick on the burlesque circuit at a time when their particular flavor of quick-talking exchanges and slapstick was rising in popularity. While they had each done many of their skits with former partners it wasn’t until they perfected them together that they really gained fame.

Bud Abbott played the bully in their exchanges

During their time as a comedic pair Abbott and Costello had fairly solidified roles to play. As Encyclopedia Britannica puts it “Abbott was something of a bully and a schemer and Costello played the hapless childlike patsy who was known for catchphrases such as ‘I’m a ba-a-a-a-d boy!'”

Together the duo made several films and their famous “Who’s On First?” skit lives on as a shining example of linguistic wit. They’re also credited with helping to preserve the tradition of vaudeville and burlesque as entertainment made the leap into film.

While today their humor may be seen as fairly old-fashioned and tame they managed to make quite a splash in their own day. In fact both men were heavily investigated by the FBI.

Abbott was investigated on charges of pornography while Costello was turned in by an informant for having an extensive collection of obscene films. Despite these scandalous charges and some others involving mob connections the men escaped charges for these suspected crimes and went on to continue their successful comedy career.

One legal situation that didn’t clean up so neatly was Abbott’s trouble with taxes. As The Los Angeles Times reports Abbott planned to retire to become a horse rancher. Costello decided he would continue on in a solo career rather than take on a different partner.

Unfortunately Costello died just a few years later in 1959 following hospitalization after an unexpected collapse. He was only 52 years old and was buried near the toddler son he tragically lost in a swimming pool accident in 1943.

Despite being the older of the pair — Abbott was born in 1895 while Costello was born in 1906 — Abbott outlived his partner by several years. He died of cancer in 1974.

While his comedic legacy lives on to this day he unfortunately did not get to enjoy the spoils of his riches. He had gotten tied up in an IRS dispute and sold almost all of his assets while trying to settle the charges. One of entertainment’s most memorable and recognizable stars died virtually penniless due to the taxation scandal — a tragic mistake that has caught up to many stars since.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGxhcmRmYW1pbHljaGFwZWxzLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL0dlcmFsZGluZS1NYXJpZS1TY2hyZWltYW5uP29iSWQ9MTk3MjYyNDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary information for Geraldine Marie Schreimann - Millard Family Chapels Inc.,"TM Tribute Notifications

John Cornyn and Ted Cruz plan to attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration,"Republican U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas will both attend President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration next week their offices confirmed Friday.

The news of their attendance is perhaps most unexpected for Cruz who has spread baseless claims attempting to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Biden’s win over President Donald Trump since the November election.

On Friday Gov. Greg Abbott’s office told KVUE-TV that he would not attend the inauguration ceremony. Abbott’s office did not respond to a request for comment from The Texas Tribune. Abbott attended Trump’s inauguration in 2017.

Leading up to the violent Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol Cruz along with other GOP senators led a fight in the Senate to reject the certification of the 2020 presidential election results in Arizona unless an emergency audit of voter fraud was conducted. Former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr said there is no evidence of widespread fraud and courts have repeatedly dismissed Trump’s meritless lawsuits to overturn the election results.

Still even after Trump supporters attacked Capitol police officers broke windows and scaled walls to invade the U.S. Capitol Cruz stood by his objection to the certification of the electoral results. The measure was overwhelmingly rejected 93-6 in the U.S. Senate and 303-121 in the U.S. House after Congress reconvened to finish business.

Cruz condemned the violent attack but he continued to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election in a written statement shortly after the Capitol was desecrated despite there being no evidence of widespread fraud.

“Millions of Americans who have peacefully expressed their deep concerns regarding election integrity deserve to have their voices heard” Cruz said in a statement after the Capitol siege. “I very much wish Congress had not set aside these concerns but I respect the position each of my colleagues took. Debate in the two houses of Congress is the proper way to resolve our political differences not through violent attacks.”

Cruz’s office confirmed he would attend the inauguration but did not respond to other questions.

Cornyn however accepted Biden’s victory over Trump and voted against Cruz’s objection to the election certification.

“I am disappointed by the election results. Any one person’s disappointment however cannot and should not override the legitimate votes of millions of Americans and our duty to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States” Cornyn a former Texas Supreme Court justice wrote in a letter last week. “Doing so would be a violation of my oath do irreparable harm to our great democracy and set a dangerous precedent for future elections.”

When asked if the senators had any safety concerns about the inauguration given the violence that took place last week neither office immediately gave a response.

**Article contains spoilers for A Quiet Place**

John Krasinski’s Horror Sequel Is Almost Here

2018’s ‘A Quiet Place’ was a surprise hit for Paramount Pictures dazzling fans of horror and suspense with its intriguing premise memorable and action-packed scenes and a stellar cast (it also boasts an impressive “96% Fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes). The story followed a small family’s desperate attempts to survive in a post-apocalyptic world—one crawling with alien-like monsters who possess ultra-sensitive hearing and deadly physical features. The original film’s cast included John Krasinski (Lee Abbott) Emily Blunt (Evelyn Abbott) Millicent Simmonds (Regan Abbott) and Noah Jupe (Marcus Abbott).

Seeing the real-life married couple—John Krasinksi and Emily Blunt—playing a fictional married couple on screen worked surprisingly well—featuring moving and memorable performances—and showcased obvious chemistry between the two actors. Krasinski also juggled multiple roles for the film—he impressively directed acted executive produced and helped with the film’s screenplay. Although Krasinski actually made his directorial debut way back in 2009 for his adaptation of David Foster Wallace’s ‘Brief Interviews with Hideous Men’ (a stellar written collection of stories by the way) Krasinski’s directing career was arguably catapulted by the success of 2018’s wonderfully original horror-drama.

Originally scheduled to release last year on March 20 Paramount Pictures was forced to delay the sequel to a later Sept. 4 date due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Paramount was initially hopeful North American theaters would reopen in Fall 2020 but was forced to delay the film again to March 20 until finally settling on an April 2021 date. With (presumably) only three months left to the anticipated sequel’s long-awaited release here’s everything we know so far about Krasinski’s ‘A Quiet Place Part II’:

Krasinski Reprises His Role as Director

Just like for the original film Krasinski returns as the director for the freaky alien-themed sequel. Known primarily for his role as Jim Halpert from NBC’s hit comedy series ‘The Office’ (which was recently pulled from Netflix and switched to NBC’s recently launched streaming platform Peacock) Krasinski made headlines for his strong directorial performance in ‘A Quiet Place.’ He also wrote the sequel’s script juggling multiple roles just like he did for the original.

Krasinski’s Character Will Return in ‘Part II’…Sort Of

For those who’ve seen ‘A Quiet Place’ (SPOILERS AHEAD) viewers may be surprised to learn that Krasinski’s character Lee Abbott—who tragically ended up sacrificing himself to save his family from the deadly creatures—is actually set to return in the film’s sequel… via flashbacks. During an appearance on Ellen DeGeneres’ talk show Krasinski talked about his character’s fate from the first film and how Lee Abbott will be integrated into the sequel. He specified that Lee won’t be brought back to life somehow nor that the events from the first film will change.

Instead Lee’s flashback in the sequel will be used to explain how “the world went silent”: “It’s one of those things where I wasn’t really going to do a second one because the first one was such a personal experience. It was my love letter to my kids which looks insane now that you’re watching that. It was really important for me to continue the metaphor and so we actually start dealing with how this all started.” Emily Blunt further elaborated on the flashback scene stating how “…you really get a sense of what the world was and what the family was before it all happened.”

Needless to say Krasinski’s method of resurrecting his dead character to further build the mysterious world surrounding ‘A Quiet Place’ sounds genuinely exciting and for fans looking to learn more about the Abbott family prior to the “apocalypse” the sequel is all but guaranteed to provide some answers.

Krasinski Didn’t Originally Want to Do a Sequel

Surprisingly enough—despite the original film’s overwhelming success at the box office—Krasinski was reportedly hesitant on filming a sequel. The star stated that he “…totally understood why the studio wanted to do a sequel for financial reasons. I didn’t want anything to do with it because weirdly as much as I’m the writer-director I’m also a huge fan of this movie. I didn’t want to be a part of anything that would be viewed as a cash grab.” However after being asked by producers to at least try writing out a new outline Krasinski started tinkering with an idea for a story and joked about finding himself “Jedi-mind tricked into directing this thing.”

Even his wife and co-star Blunt agreed by saying “it became very apparent that we’d be idiots not to do it. Ultimately you will never catch the [same] lightning in the film but there is a bigger world.” Whether or not Krasinski’s decision to return for a second installment proves to be a success will have to wait to be seen but judging by his statements it does sound like the sequel has the potential to (hopefully) be as strong and wildly original as its predecessor.

Returning + New Cast Members

In addition to Emily Blunt reprising her role as Evelyn Abbott and Krasinski as Lee Abbott Millicent Simmonds (Regan Abbott) and Noah Jupe (Marcus Abbott) will return as the older Abbott siblings. Regarding new cast members Cillian Murphy (‘28 Days Later’ ‘Peaky Blinders’ who will play Emmett) and Djimon Hounsou (‘Blood Diamond’ ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’) are set to play survivors in the sequel who come across the remainder of the Abbott family. In the sequel’s trailer released early last year Murphy’s character (Emmett) tells Evelyn “I don’t know why you came all the way up here. There’s nothing left” to which she responds “There are people out there worth saving.” Other credited cast members include Lauren-Ashley Cristiano (who’s listed as Emmett’s Wife) and Zachary Golinger (Emmett’s Son). Krasinski described Emmett’s character as a kind of contrast to the Abbott family stating his role represents “survival in its purest form—which is really really dark.”

Unlike past years however there was still plenty of elbow room.

Rochester resident Sean Miller sat at the bar with three other friends and family members happy to be among fellow ticket-holding fans even though they had to forgo their usual tailgate party in a nearby lot.

""If there was a table here I'd be breaking tables for you"" he quipped.

But there weren't nearly as many tables as usual inside the restaurant because of capacity restrictions and parking spots were easy to find. During a normal game day owner Peggy Cerrone said ""there's an hour-and-a-half wait to get in here.""

That was good news for Miller and his friends because it meant they could finally get a seat inside the restaurant he'd often walked past but never set foot in because it was always so crowded.

Danny's South restaurant enjoyed as good a crowd as could be expected Saturday. But Rich Ebeling part of the family that owns Danny's could still imagine what the team's run to the playoffs would have meant for business in a year free from the pandemic's grip.

""We've been here over 20 years – it easily would have been our best season ever"" Ebeling said Saturday from the Abbott Road restaurant where roughly 90% of the workers were forced onto unemployment.

Fans with timed entry tickets to the game against the Baltimore Ravens didn't seem to mind the restaurant roominess. They still showed up at the nearby bars and restaurants for beer wings and other munchables in lieu of private and stadium lot tailgating which is forbidden under the current rules.

Buffalo residents Joe Marrero and Raul Rodriguez had been at O'Neill's since before 5 p.m. They had entry tickets for 7:15. Given the food limitations at the stadium they said they each ordered 20 wings — 10 to eat before the game and 10 to eat after.

""We mapped out the whole day"" Marrero said.

He reminisced about past Bills games and tailgate parties when they'd get handed free beers from other fans and eat with strangers. This was a time to be with family he said the Bills family.

Not all restaurants were in the same position to to capitalize on the Bills traffic. Big Tree Inn on the south side of the stadium was subdued despite some fans singing ""Heyyyyyy! Let's go Buffalo!"" The bar and restaurant sat just inside the Abbott Road closure marker.

Orchard Park resident Emily Conforti and her friends who had 7:05 p.m. timed entry tickets were still grateful to be there for some substitute game-day atmosphere instead of her family's traditional tailgate.

""This is where all the legends used to hang out so perfect"" she said.

It had been only two days since restaurants in Erie County's ""orange zone"" learned they would be allowed to reopen their dining rooms at 50% capacity under ""yellow zone"" rules but with a 10 p.m. curfew in place that required them to shut down indoor dining during the third quarter of Saturday's playoff game.

Danny's South has set up about 14 tables for outdoor dining but that's a far cry from the 200 or 250 people who could fit inside in pre-coronavirus days.

Ebeling said they had reservations for people going to the stadium where 6700 fans are allowed and some reservations for people who plan to leave the restaurant at halftime to beat the 10 p.m. curfew.

Normally for a home Bills game Ebeling said he would have 10 parties in the parking lot bus parties of fans from Canada and motor homes parked in their lot in the days before the game.

""It would be crazy"" he said adding ""I'm looking at it as something but I'm not happy with just something. 'Something' doesn't pay the bills.""

Cerrone at O'Neill's Stadium Inn echoed similar frustrations.

""It's a third of our yearly income that's gone"" she said. ""It hurts.""

The restaurant was completely booked for Saturday night's divisional playoff game even though customers had to leave well before the end of the game.

Hamburg resident Josh Lang and Orchard Park resident Rich Braun were regulars at the place rotating through the long list of wing flavors. Last week they sat outside. But they were glad to finally take a seat inside for a change. They were eating through their anxiety about the possible outcomes of Saturday's game.

""I've been anxious and nervous pretty much all week"" Lang said.

""But you know what?"" Braun chimed in. ""We'll see you here next week at this same time.""

Other local restaurants opened their doors to fans who consigned themselves to enjoying the dinner-and-game camaraderie only until half time. At JT's Urban Italian restaurant in the Elmwood Village of Buffalo downtown residents Kevin Lynch and Sarah Works reviewed their bill as the last seconds of the second quarter wound down.

The couple had arrived at 7:30 pm thrilled that one of their new favorite restaurants was once again open. They asked for seats at the bar to afford them the best view of the game which was up on two of the giant screens.

""I was worried we wouldn't be able to get a seat at 8 o'clock"" Works said.

That wound up being no problem. The staff announced last call for drinks at 9:30 p.m. and all patrons had their bills by 9:45. Everyone cleared out at halftime which was how the couple expected the night to go."

File Photograph: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty

US pharmaceuticals giant AbbVie has won an appeal against an unexpected €500 million-plus Irish stamp duty bill it was left with in relation to its takeover of Dublin-domiciled peer Allergan last year.

The Irish Tax Appeals Commission published its determination in the case on its website in recent days in a heavily-redacted document that does not name the appellant.

""The Commissioner determines that the assessment raised under section 31D of the SDCA (Stamp Duties Collection Act 1999) should be reduced to nil"" said Marie-Claire Maney chairperson of the Tax Appeals Commission. ""The appellant should not have received the assessment in respect of the transaction as this came within the definition of restructuring operations.""

A spokeswoman for Abbvie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The surprise tax bill resulted from a move by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe in October 2019 to slap a 1 per cent stamp duty on so-called scheme of arrangement takeover structures which involve the company being acquired cancelling its existing shares and issuing new stock to the acquirer.

This type of deal – used routinely in takeover deals involving Irish public limited companies – previously avoided stamp duty.

The immediate target of the budget measure was property group Green Reit's €1.34 billion sale to UK real estate investment firm Henderson Park which was in the works at the time. However Allergan as an Irish-domiciled company was also caught by the stamp duty even though its shares are traded in New York and its top executives operate from New Jersey.

However Abbvie’s $63 billion takeover was already in train at the time of the budget announcement. At the time the euro equivalent value of the deal was €57.2 billion which would have given rise to a €572 million tax bill. However exchange-rate movements since then mean that the euro equivalent is currently €520 million.

The Tax Appeals Commission document redacts that date and exchange rate at which the stamp duty liability was assessed.

The document shows that the appellant paid the amount claimed by Revenue the Commissioners pending the outcome of the appeal.

Department of Finance secretary general Derek Moran told the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee in November that Abbvie had paid over the stamp duty ""roughly in the order of €600 million"" but that it was appealing liability through the Tax Appeals Commission.

The commission agreed with Abbvie’s argument that the stamp duty should not have been applied retroactively as the takeover agreement predated October 2019 budget announcement even though it was to be executed at a later date.

Separately Abbvie filed a lawsuit against Revenue on January 13th according to High Court notifications.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Get to know Alumni Advisory Group member Israel Nery

Q: What is your current job title and what are some of your duties?

A: I am a Management Consultant Manager for Accenture Federal Services as well as a Commissioned Officer in the Army Reserve. I have the opportunity lead soldiers and prepare for what we are expected to do in the case of national emergency – deploy. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to develop in my career.

Q: What was your favorite class at CSUMB?

A: My favorite class at CSUMB was Service Learning. It gave me the opportunity to earn college credit to volunteer for causes I believe in and the opportunity to help the local community. Looking back at it it was the foundation of my public service-oriented career.

Q: Do you have any memorable moments while attending CSUMB that you would like to share?

A: My most memorable moment attending CSUMB was my first weekend on campus. The fact that I was able to walk to the Dunes and be next to the Pacific Ocean in the central coast was surreal. It became my place to come to for reflection and for times that I needed to get away and recharge. I heavily recommend incoming students to find such outlets. Moreover enjoy being in one of the most beautiful places in the world.

Q: How has CSUMB helped you get to where you are today?

A: I was selected for my first job out of undergrad solely because the hiring manager was also a CSUMB alumnus. That job helped set me on the path to where I am today and instilled in me the mentality that with determination and hard work I can also gather multiple achievements in my career. Moreover many of my best friends today were from CSUMB and they are an amazing support system that has helped me stay focused during crucial times in my career.

Q: Do you have any helpful tips for incoming freshman/transfer students?

A: Enjoy yourself at CSUMB but stay focused on the reason you are here! It is easy to be distracted and get sidetracked with the many distractions that are present here. Enjoy the beach go to social gatherings once we are over this pandemic and meet new people! College is a time where you find out many things about yourself. Use it as a time for self-development. But once again always remember the end goal which is to get your degree!

Q: Do you have any helpful tips for new alumni entering the work force?

A: Make sure you get experience via internships/summer jobs. One of the common mistakes I see is that someone completes college successfully but never got any work experience via internships. Nowadays with the internet you can find many talent pipeline programs that are meant to ensure you will be gainfully employed once you graduate. Definitely look at those programs. Do not ever think you are not good enough to apply for internships – as one of my mentors once told me - “you don’t win the raffle unless you buy the ticket.”

Q: What do you like to do in your spare time?

A: I am very active so I like to go do anything physical outdoors such as running hiking and biking. I also have developed a passion for academic writing and have been successful in having my work published by prestigious institutions such as Harvard and Georgetown. I still like to volunteer in my local community as a mentor for kids that want to attend college. Moreover being involved in local causes in my community such as economic opportunity and environmental justice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEvMTYvdXMtc2xhcHMtbW9yZS1zYW5jdGlvbnMtb24taXJhbi1pbi1maW5hbC1kYXlzLW9mLXRydW1wLXByZXNpZGVuY3nSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMS8xNi91cy1zbGFwcy1tb3JlLXNhbmN0aW9ucy1vbi1pcmFuLWluLWZpbmFsLWRheXMtb2YtdHJ1bXAtcHJlc2lkZW5jeQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US slaps more sanctions on Iran in final days of Trump presidency,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says seven companies were targeted for shipping steel to or from Iran.

The United States has imposed more sanctions on companies in Iran China and the United Arab Emirates for doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and on three Iranian entities for conventional arms proliferation.

They are the latest in a series of measures aimed at stepping up pressure on Tehran in the waning days of President Donald Trump’s administration which ends on Wednesday.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that Washington had sanctioned seven companies including Chinese-based Jiangyin Mascot Special Steel Co and UAE-based Accenture Building Materials and two people for shipping steel to or from Iran.

He said Iran’s Marine Industries Organization Aerospace Industries Organization and the Iran Aviation Industries Organization had also been blacklisted for conventional arms proliferation.

In a statement later on Friday Pompeo said he was also increasing the scope of metals-related sanctions against Iran administered by the Department of State.

Those who knowingly transfer 15 materials which the State Department said are used in connection with Iran’s nuclear military or ballistic missile programmes including certain types of aluminium and steel would be subject to sanctions he said.

During his four years in office Trump has tried to force Tehran back into talks about its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and its activities in the Middle East. Saying the agreement did not go far enough Trump quit the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 which Tehran had struck with world powers in 2015 to rein in its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington had sanctioned seven entities and two individuals for violating U.S. sanctions on shipping steel to or from Iran including Chinese-based Jiangyin Mascot Special Steel Co. and U.A.E.-based Accenture Building Materials.

Pompeo also designated three Iranian defense companies as arms proliferators. The three companies -- Marine Industries Organization (MIO) Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO) and the Iran Aviation Industries Organization (IAIO) -- were already sanctioned under the same authority.

The latest U.S. sanctions on Iran come as U.S. President-elect Joe Biden who will be inaugurated on January 20 has suggested that Washington will seek to restart diplomacy with Iran.

Tensions between the United States and Iran have risen since 2018 when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from an international nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers and imposed crippling sanctions as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign.

How to Use a PDF Viewer To Remove Password Protection From a PDF

For legal reasons you should only ever remove password protection from a PDF that you possess and know its password. Passwords are typically added to prevent plagiarism or to encrypt the information so that it's safer to transmit online.

It's possible to follow very similar steps in most PDF viewer apps but we're using Google Chrome here as it's available on all formats including Windows Mac and Linux.

Open Google Chrome. Click File > Open File. Find your password-protected PDF document and click Open. Enter the password of the document. Click Submit. Click Print. Click on the Destination drop-down menu. Click Save as PDF. Click Save. Enter a name for the new document and click Save.

How to Use Adobe Acrobat DC to Remove PDF Password Protection

While Adobe Acrobat Reader is a free PDF viewer for all Adobe Acrobat DC is a paid app that offers enhanced features for users that regularly need to manipulate PDFs. It's also considered the more appropriate way of removing the security on a PDF.

Adobe Acrobat DC offers a free trial.

Open Adobe Acrobat DC. Click Open File. Find the file you wish to remove the password from and click Open. Enter the password and click OK. Click File > Properties. Click Security. Click the Security Method drop-down menu. Click No Security. Click OK. Click OK one last time.

What If You've Forgotten the PDF Password?

If you've forgotten the password to one of your PDFs it can be trickier to remove the password protection.

In most countries the only legal use of PDF password crackers is to remove the security on a PDF file that you have permission to access. Never use a PDF password cracker or removal method for a file that isn't yours to unlock.

There are numerous free PDF password remover tools that you can try. There's no guarantee they'll work as it depends on the security level of the PDF and other restrictions but it's definitely worth trying.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NsYXRlc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMTYvYWRvYmUtZmxhc2gtcGxheWVyLXN0b3BzLXdvcmtpbmctb24td2luZG93cy0xMC_SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW5kb3dzbGF0ZXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzE2L2Fkb2JlLWZsYXNoLXBsYXllci1zdG9wcy13b3JraW5nLW9uLXdpbmRvd3MtMTAvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Flash Player stops working on Windows 10,"Microsoft is believed to be working on an automatic Windows 10 update that will kill off Adobe Flash Player completely in 2021. Windows 10 update won’t affect any third-party programs and Chrome or Edge browser plug-ins but Adobe is now rolling out a server-side update that blocks Flash Player content.

Flash Player hasn’t received any update since December 2020 and it has been on a downward trajectory since HTML5 and other alternatives came out. Adobe has been planning to end support for Flash Player for a few years now and it has also been working closely with tech giants to disable the flash player.

Starting January 13 Flash content no longer runs in Flash Player on Windows 10 third-party apps and web browsers like Chrome.

If you try to open Flash Player content Windows 10 app or the browser will automatically block the content and you’ll see the following icon:

The icon opens Adobe’s warning page highlighting the Flash Player end of life. Unfortunately it looks like there’s no easy way to load the flash content again which means some of your flash-based online games will also stop working.

Flash contents won’t work in any versions of Windows 10 and it is recommended that you manually remove Flash Player software.

Microsoft is ending Flash Player support in Edge

Microsoft and Google have confirmed that they’re planning to remove Flash component from their web browsers later this month.

As we mentioned at the outset an update will be pushed via Windows Update and Windows Update for business over the next few weeks to eliminate the legacy flash player. Windows update will also remove the ‘Flash Player’ section from the Control Panel.

Adobe Flash player is no more bringing with it an end to one of the most creative eras in gaming history.

To those who were born in the 90’s and the early 2000s to the crew of us who can’t remember if we’re Millennials or Gen Zs. To those of us who weren’t fortunate enough to get our hands on the coveted XBox 360 or Playstation 2 or 3 this is for you.

Earlier this week I revisited a website I had frequented so many times in my youth onemorelevel.com. While there I played Gunmaster Onslaught 2 a simple game where your character a redheaded combination of Johnny Bravo and Rambo fights his way through waves of enemies helicopters and stealth bombers. Unbeknownst to me onemorelevel.com and other websites which hosted so many Flash games would be rendered nearly useless in the next few days.

Flash Games: a very brief history

An incredible resource for this story is How FLASH GAMES shaped the video game industry written by Jonas Richner. Richner a former game developer who made e7 Pwong and many more created an entire timeline for Flash games.

“It all started in 1996 when the Flash player was first released” Richner writes. “Originally it was intended for Web graphics and animations but when it got its own programming language in 2000 developers started to use it to make games.”

Soon after the first automated Flash games website Newgrounds was created. Anyone could upload their games and they were published immediately. From here Flash games evolved rapidly for the next 20 years in what Richner considers “one of the most creative periods in the history of gaming.”

End of an era

The last page of this history has been written though with nearly all those games rendered unplayable since Tuesday January 12 2021. The reason for this is Adobe blocking Flash content from running in Flash Player.

According to Adobe the reason for this change to the player is put simply evolution.

“Open standards such as HTML5 WebGL and WebAssembly have continually matured over the years and serve as viable alternatives for Flash content” Adobe’s statement reads. “Also major browser vendors are integrating these open standards into their browsers and deprecating most other plug-ins (like Flash Player).”

In Richner’s article Jonathan Gay one of the founders of Flash Player said being the creator of and steward for Flash was a privilege.

“I felt that we were building a pencil and it was the community of creators that was responsible for the creation of Flash as a creative form” he said also adding that he hopes something like it will happen again.

Leaving a legacy

Perhaps the elimination of Flash wasn’t such a big surprise to some by 2012 the number of players on Flash game websites was declining causing many developers to jump ship and make mobile or console games. Former Flash game animators started YouTube channels.

Sites like Newgrounds onemorelevel.com Miniclip Armour Games and Kongregate are still running just many of the games are unplayable now.

It seems much like the preteens that played those simple colourful games the internet has moved on. At first I was sad at this fact I felt like a piece of my childhood has gone the way of so many memes and faded into obscurity.

Through my research for this story though I remembered one of the beautiful (and sometimes terrifying) truths of this world wide web: it never truly forgets. If you need to scratch that Flash game nostalgic itch YouTube videos of past Flash game animators or playthroughs can do so easily.

Plus the more stubbornly reminiscent of us have found ways of getting around the Flash Player hiccup. Newgrounds has its own player that is capable of playing Flash games similar workarounds are also offered on various other sites although Adobe strongly recommends not using them.

In closing if these games mattered to you as much as they did to me don’t be disheartened. Their creation influenced the games we know and love today and your involvement in that part of the Internet’s history is something you can be proud of.

PDF readers and editors are a popular part of our day-to-day work related to documents ebooks presentations whitePaper and more because of PDF’s portability and security. However when it comes to reader applications for PDF files you will generally find a one on Linux desktop systems easily. However PDF editors may still need to be installed which are available only a handful.

Adobe developed the PDF (portable document format) in such a way that it can present the layout in the final document as it is anywhere regardless of the OS system or software in which you are going to use it later. Therefore editing PDF files afterward is not an easy task- apart from the standard note and comment functions. However Adobe offers a professional PDF editor for Mac and Windows but that also has limited capabilities. This means we can edit all PDF files not thoroughly like we do Word documents.

As PDF is an open format and doesn’t restrict to Adobe only thus various third-party paid free and open-source software emerged to handle it. Some of them can edit files to some extent while others are only capable of merging splitting extracting annotating and compressing PDF files.

Well if you ask how to edit PDF files in Linux many people suggest using Adobe on Linux using Wine. However that still is not the best method because heavy documents often crash the software.

Some best PDF editors for Ubuntu & other Linux

1. Master PDF Editor on Ubuntu & CentOS

It is one of the popular PDF editors available for Ubuntu and CentOS Linux systems. Master PDF offers a variety of functions to deal with PDF documents. However it is available in the personal and commercial versions thus the free version which is personal will have some limitations.

The free version of Master PDF editor for Linux offers:

Edit bookmarks in PDF files

Provides the ability to create a new PDF document from a scanner or existing file(s)

Comment and annotate PDF documents

Split and merge PDF documents

Whereas if you want more such as Edit PDF text and images PDF Form creation Add/Edit Document Actions; Add Headers and Footers Watermarks Backgrounds; 256 bit AES encryption and more than one has to go for the Commercial version. Learn how to install Master PDF free version on Ubuntu 20.04.

2. Inkscape

Inkscape is a drawing program and works like Adobe photoshop to deal with PDF files. When importing a PDF document the user can have the PDF fonts replaced by installed fonts with similar names. Its interface is quite good and lets you easily select text and edit them. Apart from that being a vector graphics program we can deal with different graphics present in PDF files. However it is not a multi-page editor program like LibreOffice thus when you import multiple PDF files it will only select the first one to edit.

You can restrict the export to selected parts of the drawing and convert the texts into paths or lines. Inkscape imported his self-written PDF almost perfectly only merging the text frames one on top of the other into one large one.

The software is available for Linux Windows and macOS.

3. LibreOffice Draw for PDF editing

LibreOffice doesn’t need any introduction it has been around for a very long time and cannot only deal with Word Excel or PowerPoint documents even support PDF file creation and editing. The office suite of LibreOffice comes with a Draw module that can open and edit PDF files however don’t expect much from it other than basic PDF editing. In Draw the PDF files become temporarily like images and with the help of various tools one can modify edit save and create PDF files for free.

If desired bookmarks comments and a watermark created from any text can be transferred to the PDF. Therefore it is not a PDF editor for Linux like the Adobe Acrobat (Windows only) however worth trying.

Free Download LibreOffice

4. Qoppa PDF Studio editor – Free trail

Qoppa is a paid option to edit files in Windows Linux or macOS however one can try it for free by downloading the trial version. It comes with a good range of features to compete with Adobe Acrobat.

You can install this PDf editor on Ubuntu or any other Linux by downloading its installation script from the official website and running it using the command sh ./PDFStudio_linux.sh . PDF studio is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

5. Okular

Although Okular is not a PDF editor like the one mentioned above however instead a reader with basic editing skills or rather I say annotating with the help of pop-ups & inline notes; freehand line drawing highlighter stamp and other features.

Furthermore after opening PDF files in Okular we can copy text and save images from them. Okular is a cross-platform application and is available for Windows Linux and macOS.

Closing thoughts

Of course Linux distros deprive of some solid free PDF editors however actually the PDF format itself was developed to keep the layout and other items as it’s so that people couldn’t change things randomly on any file. Yet the tools given here are enough to edit PDF files nevertheless when it comes to editing PDFs of scanned documents even Adobe Acrobat is not perfect as well.

For more info and free car insurance quotes visit https://compare-autoinsurance.org/why-drivers-should-get-pay-per-mile-car-insurance.

Drivers who are no longer using their vehicles as much as they used before can save some money when getting a car insurance policy. Paying for a full coverage auto insurance policy doesn't make sense for these drivers. However since it is required by law cutting out car insurance entirely from their expenses is not an option for these drivers. By making use of telematics technology pay-per-mile insurance helps policyholders and car-owners with their problems on expenses by introducing an option that lets them pay for their insurance rates based on how much they use their cars.

Before getting pay-per-mile insurance drivers should consider the following:

How the rates are determined. Pay-per-mile insurance charges the policyholders only for the miles they drove. Many of them are already saving 25%-40% on their auto insurance premiums. Usually drivers who are driving for less than 500 miles per month should consider getting this type of insurance.

It's not a new concept. Back in the mid-1980s the National Organization for Women filed a class-action lawsuit against the car insurance industry claiming discrimination. They claimed that car insurance providers were charging more for policies covering women drivers even though statically women have fewer accidents. As it turns out the reason is not that women are naturally safer behind the wheel than their male counterparts. The reason is that women drive less.

It's a win-win situation. Policyholders who drive their cars for less than 2000 miles per year can get incredibly cheap policies and the insurance company can still make a profit. It also benefits the insurance companies because pay-per-mile car insurance would ensure that those who drive less will not be forced to ""maximize"" their policies by using their car more in turn causing more accidents which will mean costs for the company. Of course there is always the issue of fraud. However insurance companies have some solutions for that. Some companies are asking their customers to send in photographs of their odometer settings from time to time.

It's a green idea. Pay-per-mile insurance can encourage people to drive less saving on resources and resulting in cleaner air.

""The company confirms that it is not owned controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military and is not a 'Communist Chinese military company' defined under the NDAA"" the company said in a statement on Friday.

The company further added that the company has been ""operating in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations of jurisdictions where it conducts its business"".

""The company reiterates that it provides products and services for civilian and commercial use"" the statement said.

It comes after the United States Department of Defense added the Chinese hardware manufacturer to a list of alleged Communist Chinese military companies.

Alongside Xiaomi Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Luokong Technology Beijing Zhongguancun Development Investment Center Gowin Semiconductor Grand China Aie Global Tone Communication China National Aviation Holding company and Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China were also added additions to the list.

Other Chinese companies that were already on the list included Huawei Hikvision Inspur Panda Electronics and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.

Outgoing and twice-impeached US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on 12 November 2020 that forbids trading and investing in any of the listed companies and bans trading in any new companies 60 days after the US places such a Communist Chinese military company label on them.

The New York Stock Exchange struggled to handle the consequences and interpretation of the listings saying it said would delist a trio of Chinese telcos -- China Telecom China Mobile and China Unicom Hong Kong -- before changing its mind and then reverting to its original decision.

In the executive order Trump said China was ""exploiting United States capital"" to boost and update its military which he claimed would allow Beijing to threaten the US and its overseas forces as well as develop ""advanced conventional weapons and malicious cyber-enabled actions against the United States and its people"".

""Through the national strategy of Military-Civil Fusion the PRC increases the size of the country's military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese companies to support its military and intelligence activities"" Trump said.

""Those companies though remaining ostensibly private and civilian directly support the PRC's military intelligence and security apparatuses and aid in their development and modernisation.""

Trump also recently signed an executive order to ban eight Chinese apps -- Alipay CamScanner QQ Wallet SHAREit Tencent QQ VMate WeChat Pay and WPS Office -- citing national security concerns.

If you've been watching Cobra Kai then you already know that Daniel and Ali didn't end up together. While their teenage romance burned out after the first Karate Kid film the actor who plays Daniel is still going strong with his real-life high school sweetheart.

Ralph Macchio first met Phyllis Fierro at a birthday party when he was 15 years old long before his part in Karate Kid made him a household name.

""This is 1970 or whatever"" Ralph told People. ""She was a friend of my cousin and we just smiled and talked and danced a little. Probably the Hustle!""

The pair quickly fell in love and tied the knot in 1987 less than a year after Karate Kid II was released. Now they have been happily married for more than 33 years and share two children together: Daniel 25 and Julia 28. For the sake of his wife and kids Ralph has taken a ""one foot in one foot out"" approach to Hollywood—and he credits Phyllis with making that possible.

""Without her and without the foundation and the family we established 'one foot in one foot out' would have been very very difficult on my own"" Ralph explained. ""Because there would not be balance.""

Photo credit: Noam Galai

As Mr. Miyagi once said ""balance is key."" But that's not their only secret to a long-lasting marriage. Ralph says his relationship with Phyllis is rooted in their ""commitment"" to each other.

""It's the belief through the easy times through the tough times whatever we encounter that we are meant to be together"" he said. ""We know that we will overcome all because we believe in that the foundation of that.""

So in case you were wondering whether Ralph is as great of a husband as Daniel is on Cobra Kai...the answer is yes! ❤️"

Well YouTuber Ryan Trahan did exactly that and stayed for one night at an Airbnb in the middle of nowhere in a cold desert in Denver Colorado in the United States.

The interesting part of this Airbnb was that it just had a few basic amenities like a bed with blankets mattress and a sleeping bag. There was no roof or room as such and it almost looked like a scene from Man versus Wild. Ryan told his viewers that on the way to his Airbnb he came across a wolf and a carcass of a horse which meant that he could pretty much be attacked by the wild animals.

The eight minutes forty-five second video that came out on January 15 shows how Ryan survived one night at the Airbnb situated in a remote cold desert where temperatures were in -15 degree Celsius. Giving an idea of how remote his Airbnb location was Ryan said that the nearest hospital was six hours away. However the 22-year-old YouTuber did come prepared as he showed the stuff that he was carrying with him that included a bear repellant spray a few snacks like mini pretzels and Arizona Iced-tea.

Ryan also carried some durable washcloths and firesticks with him in case of emergency. However when Ryan wanted to start a fire to keep himself warm in the night he did not find any tree for the wood and the fire plan was cancelled. Even with the help of some rocks and little dried grass that was in the region the fire did not light up.

Moving further in the video Ryan discovered a cardboard box under his bed where the hotel staff had kept a bathing robe a sleeping mask and most interestingly a room service phone number. At first Ryan thought that the number would not work since his place was situated at a faraway place. But on dialing the number Ryan did get to talk to the front desk of the hotel that he booked. He asked them to get him a hamburger to which the front desk responded that it would take thirty minutes for the order to reach him. However the delivery guy lost his way and it was not until five hours had passed since Ryan placed his order that he finally got to eat his McDonald’s hamburger with fries. The food was rock hard as Ryan described it in the video.

However the youtuber managed to survive his night at the remote desert and the video has garnered over 305792 views till now.

They booked an Airbnb house in Suffolk and paid £4709. Four days before they were due to travel tier 4 restrictions were imposed on London where they live and overnight trips were banned. Suffolk went into tier 4 on Boxing Day.

The couple cancelled the booking to comply with the rules but were told that they would not get their money back because the host operated a no-refund policy. They were also required to forfeit the £185 cleaning charge included in the booking cost and the £625 service fee retained by Airbnb. “If it had been allowable to travel we would have done so but it wasn’t” said Karlin. “It seems that Airbnb is trying to penalise us for not breaking the rules.”

Travellers the world over have been left out of pocket after coronavirus restrictions forced them to cancel Airbnb reservations. Last March the online booking platform introduced an “extenuating circumstances” policy in response to the pandemic. It promises “coverage for Covid-19 to help protect our community and provide peace of mind”.

What it means however is that there’s no coverage for customers who booked accommodation after 15 March unless the host’s terms and conditions include a refund clause.

These terms and conditions were designed in pre-pandemic days for cancellations for personal reasons but Airbnb is insisting they apply to those forced to cancel to comply with new laws and government guidance unless they test positive for Covid-19.

Government lockdowns and tier restrictions are not considered “extenuating circumstances” because Airbnb argues Covid-19 is no longer an unforeseen event.

It takes a different stance with hosts who cancel because of government rules. They can do so without incurring the usual cancellation fee demanded by Airbnb or compromising their coveted “superhost” status.

Yet crucially the company stops short of requiring hosts to cancel trips that fall foul of the rules. Under contract law if the holiday provider does the cancelling it must refund customers so many hosts are relying on customers to take the initiative. Guests like the Karlins who are scrupulous about the rules are then left to foot the bill.

Magda Saunders’s* vigilance cost her £2180 when her Christmas getaway was scuppered. The Londoner had booked a week in Oxfordshire and cancelled it when London went into tier 4 the day before check-in. Oxfordshire followed on Boxing Day halfway through her planned stay but she was refused a refund.

“I cancelled to obey the rules” she said. “Airbnb says that I am not eligible because the host’s policy only allows refunds for cancellations within 48 hours of a reservation. The host argues that since they were still able to provide the service and it was me who was prevented from using it they were open and willing to honour the contract.”

Even when hosts with no-refund policies do agree to reimburse guests who cancel Airbnb still retains its service fee which is usually 14% of the total booking. Meanwhile the host may retain the cleaning charge in these circumstances.

Kaye Tyler also from London had booked a house in Devon for Christmas week back in October before the tier system had been introduced. She too cancelled it when London entered tier 4. The host’s policy allowed a 50% refund but she offered to return 64%. Airbnb refused to return the £711 service charge however.

“I understand booking a holiday during a pandemic was always a risk and that we have been lucky to afford to go away but for us to be punished as responsible travellers feels a kick in the teeth” said Tyler.

Airbnb refunded the fee after the Observer questioned it but it refused to do the same for the Karlins and Saunderses.

Contract law is not clear-cut when it comes to the restrictions imposed by the tier system because these count as government “guidance and compliance” which is not legally binding. However the Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) which regulates trade states that businesses have a duty to follow the guidance and those who pressure customers not to comply may infringe consumer protection law.

Lockdowns are enshrined in law and the CMA is adamant that customers should be refunded if the legislation scuppers their holiday.

Airbnb’s policy also refuses to recognise lockdown as an “extenuating circumstance”. Last year the CMA forced holiday lettings firms Sykes Holiday Cottages and Vacation Rentals to abandon their no-refunds policy for bookings affected by the pandemic. It refused to comment on whether it would apply similar pressure to Airbnb which last month floated on the Nasdaq stock market with a value of more than $100bn.

Airbnb told the Observer that it was a marketplace rather than a travel agent or accommodation provider and hosts were therefore responsible for defining and fulfilling contracts. It declined to address why it did not insist that all hosts should cancel and refund bookings affected by Covid restrictions.

“We want to make it as easy as possible for hosts and guests to follow the rules and stay safe” it said. “That is why current government restrictions and host cancellation policies are made clear to guests on the platform before they book. Hosts set their own cancellation terms that are right for their personal circumstances with the majority having policies that allow guests to cancel without penalties.”

Consumer organisation Which? told the Observer that it planned to work with Airbnb to change its stance. “Airbnb and its hosts should do right by its customers and ensure that anyone unable to travel because of the lockdown is given the option of a full refund” said Rory Boland editor of Which? Travel.

He said: “While hosts’ cancellation policies are clearly set out and customers can choose hosts that offer flexible cancellation Airbnb should consider updating its policy for extenuating circumstances’.”

See below.

Vrbo the vacation rental platform run by Seattle-based Expedia Group is getting some blowback online for not following the lead of competitor Airbnb which announced this week that it was blocking and canceling reservations in the Washington D.C. area during the upcoming inauguration week.

Following the violent storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 officials in D.C. including the city’s mayor and Metro Police urged people not to travel from outside the area for the inauguration of President Elect Joe Biden.

In a blog post on Wednesday Airbnb said it was “aware of reports … regarding armed militias and known hate groups that are attempting to travel and disrupt the Inauguration.” It said guests whose reservations are canceled will be refunded in full.

Expedia and Vrbo both put out statements on Friday. Vrbo said the safety of its guests and hosts is of the utmost importance and anyone planning to travel to D.C. next week was encouraged to follow local governmental regulations and check the latest news for updates.

Hello will you please take action and refund all of the DC trips planned for the inauguration week!!! @Airbnb decided that the safety of their clients is more important that making them pay their fees. Will you please do the same? We’re begging you! — G®EM (@grem_pls) January 14 2021

“If you mistreat people there’s no space for you on Vrbo. We reserve the right to remove anyone from our marketplace who violates these principles and we are encouraging hosts to cancel bookings during this time if they believe a guest intends to violate these policies” the blog post stated.

Expedia said in a tweeted statement that it was carefully evaluating bookings activated crisis response teams and launched “extraordinary emergency procedures.”

Sarah Gavin VP of global communications for Expedia told GeekWire Saturday that Vrbo has legitimate customers booked next week and it does not want to cancel on them.

“We are working to ensure that those people who are traveling and staying at a Vrbo are in D.C. for legitimate travel reasons” Gavin said. “And we’re implementing extraordinary emergency procedures to assess all risks for existing and any new bookings in the D.C. area. And we’re working very closely with a number of different law enforcement agencies.”

With the steps Expedia has taken Gavin added “We feel like we’re doing the right thing.”

Buzzfeed News wrote about the rental saga on Friday and interviewed a man who was planning to travel from California to the nation’s capital because he wanted to see the Biden swearing in. The man booked three nights in an apartment on Vrbo for a total of $900 but when he had second thoughts and reached out to Vrbo for a refund he was reportedly denied.

@vrbo I’ve been a happy customer of yours for a while. In the wake of what just happened I’m begging you: #DontRentDC Jan 17-21 — Katy Otto (@exfkaty) January 11 2021

Steve Schmidt one of the founders of the anti-Trump group Project Lincoln was among those calling out Expedia and Vrbo on Twitter on Saturday urging the company to “be responsible” and “do good” and warning that the company’s CEO board and senior management “don’t have what it takes” for a fight with Project Lincoln.

.@Expedia @vrbo Here is the deal. @ProjectLincoln and the majority of America detests sedition and chaos. We love democracy and the rule of law. Here is some free advice. I suggest you get your shit together immediately. You will feel immense pain if we fight. Cancel — Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES) January 17 2021

Reservations and help secure DC. Do you really want to be the quartermasters and housing supply to the fascist racist violent extremist mob that has attacked America? Be responsible. Do good. @ProjectLincoln is not playing games and trust me when I say this. Your CEO Board — Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES) January 17 2021

And Senior management do not have what it takes for this fight. Take the exit. We are watching. So are your investors and shareholders. — Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES) January 17 2021

Gavin told GeekWire that she was attempting to get in touch with Schmidt and Project Lincoln to explain Expedia’s case on Saturday.

With the overall travel industry and Expedia’s business hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic for the past year rental platforms have been one of the few spots to rebound. Expedia announced in July that gross bookings on Vrbo “increased significantly” in May and June compared to last year as “drive-to destinations” were one of the first segments of travel to recover from the global health crisis.

Expedia retired the HomeAway brand and brought its entire vacation rental portfolio under the Vrbo name last summer. Expedia paid $3.9 billion in 2015 to acquire HomeAway which bought Vrbo in 2005.

Vrbo competes with Airbnb and is live in 15 countries.

Update Monday Jan. 18 9:30 a.m. PT: Expedia Group issued a new press release on Monday morning expanding on the steps it is taking to bolster security related to those who use its Vrbo rental properties in the Washington D.C. area this week.

Along with heightened screening measures for those booking rentals Expedia said it has expanded Vrbo policies for cancellations and refunds for both travelers and partners. “In the event we cancel a reservation for security concerns a host chooses to cancel a reservation or a traveler decides to cancel a reservation the guest will be refunded and the host will be paid in full. This applies to the Washington D.C. metro area and all U.S. state capitals through January 24 2021” Expedia said.

“We continue to support travel for individuals and families who are or plan to be in and around Washington D.C. and all U.S. state capitals for legitimate and critical reasons” the company added.

Update Tuesday Jan. 19 10:30 a.m. PT: Expedia Group and Vrbo tweeted on Tuesday that new bookings in and around Washington D.C. would be blocked through Friday. Expedia said it had received “updated guidance” on security threats."

Walsh added to Cowboys' coaching staff per report,"Scott Wright

STILLWATER — Oklahoma State’s new offensive quality control coach is a familiar face.

Former Cowboy quarterback J.W. Walsh was hired for the position on Friday according to Pokes Report.

Walsh was at OSU from 2011-15 spending part of that time as the Cowboys’ starting quarterback.

He had been bouncing around Texas as his coaching career progressed since leaving OSU. Walsh began as a graduate assistant at TCU then became the running backs coach at Abilene Christian and most recently served as an analyst at Texas where he reconnected with his OSU offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich.

Yurcich left Texas as part of the full overhaul earlier this month and was hired as offensive coordinator at Penn State.

According to Friday’s report Walsh will work directly with quarterbacks under assistant coach Tim Rattay.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The announcement comes after Parler registered its domain with host sharing website Epik last week following Amazon Web Services' decision to shut Parler down for failure to moderate ""egregious content"" related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

Epik Senior Vice President of Communications Robert Davis told FOX Business in an interview that the company spoke with Parler following its domain registration regarding techniques it could use to improve its moderation and oversight practices should it return in the future but noted that hosting the platform had not been discussed.

Representatives for Parler and Epik did not immediately return FOX Business' request for comment.

PARLER AMAZON REINSTATEMENT FEUD IN JUDGE'S HANDS

Parler is suing Amazon for its decision to sever ties claiming the move is ""motivated by political animus"" and is both a breach of contract and an antitrust violation.

Parler's lawyer David Groesbeck argued during a hearing on Thursday that the company would suffer irreparable harm if it was forced to permanently shut down and that it is in the public interest to restore the platform's service.

""Millions of law-abiding Americans have had their voices silenced"" Groesbeck said. ""There is no evidence other than some anecdotal press references that Parler was involved in inciting the riots.""

Amazon cited examples of violent content during the hearing that it claims appeared on the platform including calls to assassinate Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer Amazon's Jeff Bezos Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and members of the media.

Amazon's lawyer Ambika Doran noted that the abusive posts were just the ""tip of the ice berg"" and that it is well within the public interest to deny Parler's injuction based upon the events of Jan. 6.

""The events of January 6 changed the way we think about the world. It took what was merely hypothetical and made it chillingly real"" Doran said. ""Amazon had every right after that happened with the surge of violent content on Parler to take that into account when it made the decision it did.""

When asked by Judge Barbara Rothstein if Amazon Web Services would restore Parler if they implemented moderation policies Doran said there is ""no reason"" to believe Parler could develop an effective moderation plan within the next 30 days.

""They had been unwilling to and unable to"" Doran said.

Rothstein said on Thursday that she would move ""as quickly as possible"" to make her decision on whether to grant Parler a temporary restoration order.

Previously vice mayor Kamei succeeds Margaret Abe-Koga who remains on the City Council. Each year the council chooses one of its own members as mayor.

The new vice mayor is Lucas Ramirez.

Two new council members former State Assembly Speaker Sally Lieber and Pat Showalter who has previously served on the council were sworn in. They replaced Chris Clark and John McAlister who were termed out.

The other council members are Alison Hicks and Lisa Matichak.

For the first time the council has a progressive majority and all but one of the members are women.

“Mountain View is a special place” said Kamei who was elected to the council in 2018. “It’s a place where a person who used to have to check the ‘other’ box to identify themselves can call home. It’s a place where the daughter of a Japanese American father born at an internment camp in Wyoming and a Chinese and Puerto Rican mother from Harlem New York is able to serve as your mayor.”

Kamei said that her top priority will be the state eviction moratorium. “We have legislators who share our common goals of keeping people housed and we want to keep Mountain View a welcoming place. The pandemic has brought hardships for everyone coupled with so much uncertainty. I’m moved by the compassion of our neighbors.”

Abe-Koga served as vice mayor in 2019 and was re-elected to the council in 2020. She previously served two terms on the council from 2007 to 2015 as vice mayor in 2008 and as mayor in 2009 becoming the first Asian Pacific American female to serve in those capacities in Mountain View’s history.

The meeting was adjourned in memory of Judy Moss Mountain View’s first female council member and mayor who served from 1972 to 1980. She died on Dec. 13.

Roots in Mountain View

Kamei posted the following autobiography on her website:

“For me Mountain View is home. Born and raised in Silicon Valley I am the daughter of a first-generation Chinese and Puerto Rican American mother from New York City and a third-generation Japanese American father born at Heart Mountain internment camp in Wyoming. I am multiracial and multilingual learning to speak Spanish Japanese and Mandarin.

“I grew up on my family’s ten-acre flower-growing nursery. The nursery was first located in Mountain View and later moved to Morgan Hill the two cities where I grew up. My grandparents lived in Mountain View and along with my younger brother I would spend many days with them at their home in Waverly Park planting the seeds for my roots in the city. These childhood experiences brought me back to Mountain View when my grandparents fell ill. They have both since passed away but I have been fortunate enough to be able to stay.

“Inspired by community service since youth I began volunteering in elementary school and haven’t stopped since. I hold the steadfast values of participation and assistance especially to those in need within the community. Driven to service my career has taken me from Japan to the East Coast and back home to Mountain View. My professional experience spans over a decade in public service at the city county state and federal government levels. I have helped work on national issues to public safety within Mountain View.

“In addition to my professional experience I am a graduate of Leadership Mountain View and served on the Leadership Mountain View Advisory Council. I served as a member of the Mountain View Public Safety Foundation Board volunteer of the Mountain View Firefighters Random Acts nonprofit assisting in the annual Fire Drill 5K/10K Race and Pancake Breakfast. I assisted the Mountain View Historical Association of which I am a member with their Spring Panel on ‘Japanese in Mountain View’ to celebrate May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and to reflect on the 75th anniversary of Japanese [American] internment in 2017.

“For six years I was a member of the City of Mountain View’s Environmental Planning Commission serving as vice chair in 2014 and chair in 2015.

“Our middle class is shrinking and our diverse community is changing. I ran [for City Council] to make sure opportunities continue for our next generation as well as our family-oriented community. I sought to pair my leadership experience and skills with the passion of the voices of the community to ensure that Mountain View continues to stand in support of all its residents and that it is a welcoming and safe community.

“I live near the Moffett Boulevard/North Whisman neighborhood with my husband Chris and our dog Nori.”

Previously vice mayor Kamei succeeds Margaret Abe-Koga who remains on the City Council. Each year the council chooses one of its own members as mayor.

The new vice mayor is Lucas Ramirez.

Two new council members former State Assembly Speaker Sally Lieber and Pat Showalter who has previously served on the council were sworn in. They replaced Chris Clark and John McAlister who were termed out.

The other council members are Alison Hicks and Lisa Matichak.

For the first time the council has a progressive majority and all but one of the members are women.

“Mountain View is a special place” said Kamei who was elected to the council in 2018. “It’s a place where a person who used to have to check the ‘other’ box to identify themselves can call home. It’s a place where the daughter of a Japanese American father born at an internment camp in Wyoming and a Chinese and Puerto Rican mother from Harlem New York is able to serve as your mayor.”

Kamei said that her top priority will be the state eviction moratorium. “We have legislators who share our common goals of keeping people housed and we want to keep Mountain View a welcoming place. The pandemic has brought hardships for everyone coupled with so much uncertainty. I’m moved by the compassion of our neighbors.”

Abe-Koga served as vice mayor in 2019 and was re-elected to the council in 2020. She previously served two terms on the council from 2007 to 2015 as vice mayor in 2008 and as mayor in 2009 becoming the first Asian Pacific American female to serve in those capacities in Mountain View’s history.

The meeting was adjourned in memory of Judy Moss Mountain View’s first female council member and mayor who served from 1972 to 1980. She died on Dec. 13.

Roots in Mountain View

Kamei posted the following autobiography on her website:

“For me Mountain View is home. Born and raised in Silicon Valley I am the daughter of a first-generation Chinese and Puerto Rican American mother from New York City and a third-generation Japanese American father born at Heart Mountain internment camp in Wyoming. I am multiracial and multilingual learning to speak Spanish Japanese and Mandarin.

“I grew up on my family’s ten-acre flower-growing nursery. The nursery was first located in Mountain View and later moved to Morgan Hill the two cities where I grew up. My grandparents lived in Mountain View and along with my younger brother I would spend many days with them at their home in Waverly Park planting the seeds for my roots in the city. These childhood experiences brought me back to Mountain View when my grandparents fell ill. They have both since passed away but I have been fortunate enough to be able to stay.

“Inspired by community service since youth I began volunteering in elementary school and haven’t stopped since. I hold the steadfast values of participation and assistance especially to those in need within the community. Driven to service my career has taken me from Japan to the East Coast and back home to Mountain View. My professional experience spans over a decade in public service at the city county state and federal government levels. I have helped work on national issues to public safety within Mountain View.

“In addition to my professional experience I am a graduate of Leadership Mountain View and served on the Leadership Mountain View Advisory Council. I served as a member of the Mountain View Public Safety Foundation Board volunteer of the Mountain View Firefighters Random Acts nonprofit assisting in the annual Fire Drill 5K/10K Race and Pancake Breakfast. I assisted the Mountain View Historical Association of which I am a member with their Spring Panel on ‘Japanese in Mountain View’ to celebrate May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and to reflect on the 75th anniversary of Japanese [American] internment in 2017.

“For six years I was a member of the City of Mountain View’s Environmental Planning Commission serving as vice chair in 2014 and chair in 2015.

“Our middle class is shrinking and our diverse community is changing. I ran [for City Council] to make sure opportunities continue for our next generation as well as our family-oriented community. I sought to pair my leadership experience and skills with the passion of the voices of the community to ensure that Mountain View continues to stand in support of all its residents and that it is a welcoming and safe community.

“I live near the Moffett Boulevard/North Whisman neighborhood with my husband Chris and our dog Nori.”

(Port City Daily/Courtesy Wikimedia Commons)

SOUTHEASTERN NC — In the wake of the attack on the U.S. Capitol Rep. David Rouzer is losing the support of the state’s most powerful corporations. Yet Wilmington’s most powerful family — and Rouzer’s biggest donor — is standing by their man.

“We support David” Scott Sullivan responded Friday when asked if his company Jh Land LLC fully supports Rouzer after the congressman challenged the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.

Jh Land LLC is one part of the Cameron family’s large portfolio of businesses in the Wilmington area and donated $21200 to Rouzer’s campaign in the most-recent election cycle according to Federal Election Commission data released Dec. 26.

Another major local supporter for Rouzer Live Oak Bank gave no indication that it was changing its donations.

Rouzer is losing the support of several major North Carolina companies including Bank of America and Duke Power after they suspended all political donations following the events at the Capitol in which pro-Trump protesters violently stormed the building as Congress was in the process of certifying the Electoral College votes. When the House was able to reconvene that night Rouzer was one of the 139 representatives and eight senators who voted to overturn the presidential election outcome even though each state had certified its results.

While some companies such as Walmart General Electric and Verizon pulled their financial support only from the members of Congress who tried to block the election results Bank of America and Duke Power were among those that stopped all political donations — at least temporarily.

“For upcoming elections we will take into account the appalling events of Jan. 6 before making any PAC decisions regarding those members” Bank of America informed employees who have contributed to the company’s PAC.

Bank of America was Rouzer’s 12th-largest donor in the last cycle with $11451 in donations.

Duke Power was the congressman’s 32nd-largest donor at $9000.

Rouzer also is losing his second-largest contributor: tobacco giant Altira Group (formerly Philip Morris) which is suspending all political donations. The Richmond Va.-based company gave Rouzer $17800 over the 2019-20 campaign cycle.

Contacted Saturday about the loss of donors Rouzer issued the following statement through his press secretary:

“Under the First Amendment employees and the management of a company have the right to give — or not to give — to any candidate for any reason. What a PAC chooses to do has no influence on my decisions. My votes are based on principle and conviction — not donations.”

Campaign donations are regulated by a complex web of rules and the money comes to candidates through many different avenues.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics which runs the campaign finance website OpenSecrets.org the corporations themselves do not donate. Rather the money comes from political action committees (PACs) they have established from employees or owners and those individuals’ immediate families.

Not all donations to a candidate go in the same bucket. Some contributions are directed to an actual campaign fund while others are made to a Leadership PAC which the Federal Election Commission defines as a “political committee that is directly or indirectly established financed maintained or controlled by a candidate or an individual holding federal office.”

Leadership PAC fund expenses are not allowed by campaign committees or congressional offices such as travel to raise a politician’s profile according to the Open Secrets website. Elected officials also can donate money from their Leadership PAC to their colleagues or other candidates.

For example a donor seeking to influence regulations on the timber industry might give money to their own congressman’s Leadership PAC with the intention for it to be used to gain favor with another congressman who holds sway on the timber issue.

The top donors to Rouzer’s Leadership PAC in 2019-20 were Jh Land LLC ($10000) National Chicken Council ($7500) and Lowe’s Companies ($6000). Lowe’s said it was evaluating its political contributions and that the events of Jan. 6 would be taken into consideration.

The biggest donor to Rouzer’s official campaign fund was another well-known local organization Live Oak Bank which donated $16850. About $12000 of that came from Live Oak employees and $5000 from the company’s political action committee. Live Oak made no donations to Rouzer’s Leadership Pact.

Live Oak head of corporate communications Claire Parker released the following statement Friday morning:

“In the wake of the riots on Capitol Hill last week many in our industry and across corporate America are reconsidering how they provide financial support to elected leaders and we too are re-examining if and why we give and to whom. We strongly believe in the power of American democracy and condemn any actions that undermine it.

“The focus of Live Oak Bank’s PAC has always been supporting small business owners. While we cannot change past decisions to support specific candidates we will continue to be purposeful in our actions going forward.”

But because no cloud provider is as popular as Amazon people skilled in say Oracle's cloud aren't as as easy to find as those who know how to build on AWS.

It would take time to figure out how to perform similar functions on Parler's own servers or a cloud other than AWS. And in the case of Parler time is critical because it came as the service was gaining attention and new users following Twitter's Trump ban.

Parler's engineering team had built software that drew on computing resources from Amazon Web Services and the company had been in talks with Amazon about adopting proprietary AWS database and artificial intelligence services the company said in a district court filing on Wednesday.

The incident demonstrates a type of power that Amazon wields almost uniquely because so many companies rely on it to deliver computing and data storage. Amazon controlled 45% of the cloud infrastructure in 2019 more than any other company according to estimates from technology research company Gartner . The app survived without being listed in Apple and Google's app stores but getting sent away from Amazon's cloud has left Parler absent from the internet for days.

It happened this week when Amazon dropped Parler  a social network that gained traction from conservatives after Twitter banned President Donald Trump and housed content that encouraged violence. Parler filed suit against Amazon in federal district court in an attempt to stop Amazon from suspending Parler's account and Amazon pushed back requesting that the court deny Parler's motion.

Getting kicked off Amazon Web Services is rare but it has enormous consequences.

The swiftness with which Amazon acted shouldn't come as a shock. Companies have been disclosing details about their deals with Amazon that warn of these kinds of sudden discontinuations for years.

In 2010 DNA sequencing company Complete Genomics said that ""an interruption of services by Amazon Web Services on whom we rely to deliver finished genomic data to our customers would result in our customers not receiving their data on time.""

Gaming company Zynga warned about how its AWS foundation could quickly vanish when it filed the prospectus for its initial public offering in 2011. At the time AWS hosted half of the traffic for Zynga's games such as FarmVille and Words with Friends the company said.

""AWS may terminate the agreement without cause by providing 180 days prior written notice and may terminate the agreement with 30 days prior written notice for cause including any material default or breach of the agreement by us that we do not cure within the 30-day period"" Zynga said.

AWS can even terminate or suspend its agreement with a customer immediately under certain circumstances as it did in 2010 with Wikileaks pointing to violations of AWS' terms of service.

Parler started using AWS in 2018 long after the Wikileaks incident and the first corporate disclosures about the possibility of cloud interruptions.

When AWS told Parler it planned to suspend Parler's AWS account it said Parler had violated the terms repeatedly including by not owning or controlling the rights to its content.

Over the course of several weeks AWS alerted Parler to instances of user content that encouraged violence Amazon said in a court filing. More of that content surfaced after protesters stormed the Capitol building in Washington on Jan. 6 interrupting Congress' confirmation of the Electoral College results from the 2020 presidential election. AWS conveyed that Parler wasn't doing enough to speedily remove that sort of information from its social network.

Parler could have protected itself more. Large AWS customers can sign up for more extensive agreements which allow more customers time to get into compliance if they wind up breaking rules.

Gartner analyst Lydia Leong spelled out this difference in a blog post: ""Thirty days is a common timeframe specified as a cure period in contracts (and is the cure period in the AWS standard Enterprise Agreement) but cloud provider click-through agreements (such as the AWS Customer Agreement) do not normally have a cure period allowing immediate action to be taken at the provider's discretion"" she wrote.

Other cloud providers have their own terms their customers must follow. AWS now has millions of customers though and it holds more of the cloud infrastructure market than any other provider. As a result many organizations could be exposed to the sort of treatment Parler received rare as it is if they don't behave in accordance with Amazon's standards.

Parler recognized the drawbacks of being beholden to a cloud provider but ultimately the flexibility clouds offer was too appealing to ignore. ""I'm personally very anti-cloud and anti-centralization though AWS has its place for high-burst traffic"" Alexander Blair Parler's technology chief wrote in a post on the service.

Parler and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The giant e-tailer wants to build a 91000-square-foot distribution hub at Francis S. Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach but the seaside village of nearly 2000 is worried the already heavy airplane traffic would become nonstop.

“It’s going to be horrible” said one resident who has had a summer home in the village since 2003. “I’m already hearing airplanes when I sit outside by the pool in the summer. Can you imagine if Amazon is here?”

A spokeswoman for Amazon declined to comment Friday telling The Post only that the company weighs “a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites.”

The Suffolk County-owned Gabreski which has an Air Force base on the grounds services private jets helicopters and single-engine recreational planes an airport spokesman told The Post.

Last year Gabreski had nearly 56000 “operations” — takeoffs and landings the spokesman said.

In November Rechler Equity Partners secured $2.3 million in tax breaks to build a $36 million warehouse in an industrial park on airport land where the Long Island developer has already constructed three warehouses. The Amazon space is slated to create 100 construction jobs and 50 full-time Amazon staff slots Rechler has said.

Suffolk County legislator Robert Trotta doesn’t like the hub plan. The Republican claims Rechler snagged the deal by misleading the county stating on an aid application that Amazon would pick an out-of-state warehouse if lawmakers didn’t OK the tax breaks.

“Why are we giving billionaires tax breaks?” Trotta told The Post. “The tax breaks — they got should be immediately rescinded.”

Rechler did not return The Post’s calls Friday.

Rechler’s Hamptons Business District prohibits tenants from receiving freight deliveries at the airport but Trotta and residents don’t think Amazon will abide by that rule — at least for long.

“If you think they are not going to be using airplanes and drones you are totally out of your mind” said an entrepreneur in Westhampton Beach. “From a business point of view I support them coming as a land-based distribution hub but it’s totally naive to believe they won’t be eventually using the airport for air freight deliveries.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2FtYXpvbi1icm9hZHZpZXctZmFjaWxpdHktYm9zY2gtcGxhbnQvOTcxNDIxOS_SAUpodHRwczovL2FiYzdjaGljYWdvLmNvbS9hbXAvYW1hem9uLWJyb2Fkdmlldy1mYWNpbGl0eS1ib3NjaC1wbGFudC85NzE0MjE5Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon opening new facility at Broadview Bosch plant site,"Broadview Amazon facility opening at Bosch plant site

The lawsuit filed by law firm Hagens Berman in a federal district court in New York alleges that the publishers pay high commissions and other costs to Amazon which in turn increases the retail price of e-books sold on the platform. Due to the deal between Amazon and the publishers— HarperCollins Publishers Hachette Book Group Penguin Random House Simon & Schuster and Macmillan — the Amazon price is the price the publishers charge other retailers as well preventing other sellers from offering the e-books at lower prices according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit claims the five publishers account for 80 percent of books sold in the US and calls the arrangement a “conspiracy to fix the retail price of e-books” which it argues is a violation of antitrust law.

Amazon declined to comment as did Penguin Random House. The other publishers named in the lawsuit did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Verge on Sunday."

Each year sees a small number of airlines close up shop for any number of reasons but last year had the pandemic to speed some along.

A surprise announcement in February that the promising Qatar Airways-backed Air Italy would be liquidated set the stage for a year of losses even before lockdowns grounded the world's airlines. And while the coronavirus was well-known by then its destructive power in the airline industry was still yet to be realized.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

In the US all 11 major airlines remained intact but smaller regional carriers folded amid an unprecedented drop in passengers that remains low even into the new year. Three carriers operating flights on behalf of larger carriers both closed up shop after their services were no longer required by the majors costing thousands of jobs in the industry amid an already grim period of furloughs.

Brett Snyder of the aviation blog CrankyFlyer's yearly list of ""airlines we lost"" that reveals just how many didn't live to see the new year.

(The ballot measure failed.) At the time United said

United is deeply committed to promoting diversity equity and inclusion within our company as well as endorsing political action that supports furthering those efforts in citizens’ everyday lives. …As an organization made of a diverse workforce we are proud to support legislation that furthers the success of underrepresented communities.

When United furloughed 16000 employees they didn’t use race as a factor. However this fall they did commit to choosing board members based on race.

Now they’re reminding employees about United Airlines speech codes which threaten termination for criticizing anyone on social media on the basis of a protected category.

We work to promote a safe and inclusive environment. It’s valuable to bring together people from different backgrounds who express different views but we need to pay attention to our words and how they may impact our diverse population of employees and customers. It’s not okay to say (or post) things that are offensive or racially charged. This applies when using social media when posting comments on Flying Together and when simply having conversations. And where social media is concerned it doesn’t matter whether your post is public or within a closed group – nothing on the internet is truly private or anonymous. Use common sense and good judgment and if you have any doubt about whether or not what you’re saying or posting may be offensive you probably want to avoid it. …It’s never okay to criticize others on the basis of race gender age or any other protected category. This includes conduct within the workplace as well as outside of the workplace and on social media. We take this very seriously.

That’s among the reasons why the EchoStar subsidiary believes its high-capacity Ka-band satellite service is well positioned to secure meaningful aero business in the Americas despite the fact that Viasat has gained strong ground in the region.

Hughes is presently involved in two high-profile Ka aero projects in the Americas — its satellite capacity helps to power the SES/Thales program that will support inflight Wi-Fi across Spirit Airlines’ fleet and it has separately partnered with Inmarsat on an integrated GX+ North America solution that will see aircraft exploit Hughes’ high-throughput Ka satellites over the continental US and roam into Inmarsat’s Global Xpress Ka HTS fleet when operating outside of that footprint. Inmarsat boasts a remarkable technology roadmap for Global Xpress and aircraft fitted with GX+ North America can be positioned anywhere in the world.

“We believe airlines have significant demand and need significant amounts of capacity to serve their passengers. Our Jupiter fleet is the largest fleet of Ka-band capacity across the Americas and the launch of Jupiter 3 will bring even more capacity to the region” says Hughes vice president Reza Rasoulian. The ultra-high density Jupiter 3 satellite is now expected to launch in the first quarter of 2022 representing a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic.

When you look at the airlines’ routes and hubs Rasoulian tells Runway Girl Network “very high capacity is needed. Only a fleet like Jupiter Ka can deliver that performance”.

Those are strong words given Viasat’s recent successes in the US inflight connectivity market. In addition to fitting the lion’s share of American Airlines’ narrowbody fleet with Ka IFC — and having long powered JetBlue’s free streaming class of service — Viasat early this month announced a deal with longtime Gogo customer Delta Air Lines to fit over 300 narrowbodies with its solution. The Gogo 2Ku kit presently installed on those aircraft will be completely removed and replaced with Viasat Ka.

But Rasoulian does not mince words telling RGN that: “Only one provider will not be able to meet the airline demand.” That’s particularly true if a number of airlines adopt free or freemium models he says. As such Hughes believes the Jupiter fleet will become a “very important asset” to aviation.

When industry emerges from the COVID-19 crisis Hughes is hopeful it will see “a significant uptick” in airline orders. There is certainly heightened demand for high-bandwidth functionality on account of the pandemic and a transition to remote work. “Folks wanted to be connected prior to COVID but post-COVID they want to check on their loved ones and check social media and check on their home from a distance — and all the home automation that we’re seeing now as well. So absolutely we’re hopeful that in 2021 as we emerge from COVID and everyone is safe and get back to a normal routine that airlines are also ready to invest” says the Hughes executive.

Though Hughes supports inflight connectivity through both its service and hardware the company does not go direct as an aero ISP for airlines. “Our strategy is to sell our Jupiter solution and managed capacity via partners and basically the value of the partner system is they marry our systems and solutions with a value added layer that they bring to the table” explains Rasoulian. Among Hughes’ service partners Global Eagle for instance has expressed an interest in collaborating on the GX+ North America solution.

“There’s a lot of art and science that goes into [implementing] an IFC program successfully for airlines. There is a lot of knowhow that requires an integrator. It’s not just about bolting an antenna on an aircraft” says Global Eagle CEO Josh Marks.

Hughes’ partnership strategy differs from Viasat which is vertically integrated and acts as aero ISP in addition to powering inflight connectivity service with its satellites.

“We’re really giving airlines many choices you’re not limited to just one provider” notes Hughes’ Rasoulian. “You can use the Jupiter technology or managed service via multiple channels so the airlines will have to decide which is the best channels.”

He continues “I think Hughes as a company is laser focused on connecting the unconnected and in aviation and aero we really have a compelling approach and strategy and compelling capacity to help our airlines really move the needle as the world kind of emerges from the pandemic.”

BP v. Baltimore Is First Environmental Case To Come Before Newly-Reconstituted High Court

On Tuesday the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in its first environmental case of the 2020-21 Term. That case BP PLC v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore involves an important nationwide climate change litigation trend and will provide the first indication of the post-Ginsburg Court’s attitude towards environmental law and litigation generally.

The Baltimore case is part of a nationwide initiative of 19 separate lawsuits brought by numerous local governments–and a few states–against major international coal oil and gas companies. The government plaintiffs seek compensation from the multinational energy companies for the financial harm and burdens the local and state governments have suffered from the impacts of climate change–impacts they attribute to greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels the companies have marketed and from which they have profited greatly. Critically the government plaintiffs rely on a variety of state common law (i.e. court-developed) legal theories in pursuing their claims for monetary compensation. (Previous posts on this nationwide litigation initiative can be found here and here.)

As in virtually all of these cases the City of Baltimore filed its lawsuit in state court. As part of their nationwide defense strategy the energy defendants immediately removed (i.e. transferred) the case to federal district court believing that Baltimore’s climate change lawsuit would receive a chillier reception there than it would in state court.

But under federal law it is the federal court not the defendants that has the ultimate say in determine whether a case has been properly removed there or alternatively if it should be remanded back to state court for resolution. In Baltimore the energy defendants argued that they were entitled to transfer the case to federal court under the so-called “federal officer” doctrine. Specifically they claimed that they were quasi-federal officials by virtue of the fact that they regularly do business with the federal government–such as by bidding for and purchasing oil gas and coal leases from the government. The federal district court judge unsurprisingly found that argument attenuated and without merit and ordered the case remanded back to state court. (Both rulings are consistent with those of other federal courts around the nation in the other related government v. Big Energy lawsuits.) The energy defendants appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals which agreed with the district court that removal was improper. The energy defendants then successfully sought Supreme Court review.

At first blush then the Baltimore case would appear to be a narrow rather arcane case about federal court procedural rules. But it’s not. Instead how the Supreme Court decides may well influence–or even dictate–how state and local governments’ legal efforts to hold Big Energy accountable fare on their legal merits.

That’s because the Big Energy defendants have not-so-subtly shifted their legal arguments in the Baltimore case once the justices granted review last fall. Instead of simply contending that their attempted remove the case to federal court is permissible under the “federal officer” rule they’re now asking the Court to go much further and hold that the City’s substantive state law-based legal claims are meritless.

To understand why and how a bit of background is required: in its 2011 decision in American Electric Power v. Connecticut the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that states could not rely on federal common law principles such as public nuisance law to hold the owners and operators of coal-fired power plants liable for the adverse effects of their plants’ GHG emissions. Those federal common law claims are “displaced” by the federal Clean Air Act the justices concluded.

But critically the American Electric Power decision left unresolved the companies’ related argument that state law-based common law claims are similarly superseded by the Clean Air Act. (It is those very state common law principles on which the City of Baltimore and 18 other state and local governments around the country rely in the current set of climate change lawsuits.). And just last year the justices held in a hazardous waste dispute involving the federal Superfund law that state common law theories of liability remain valid notwithstanding the existence of a comprehensive federal statutory scheme; that decision suggests the City of Baltimore’s state common law claims may well be similarly viable.

So it’s perhaps unsurprising that the Big Energy defendants in Baltimore are trying to strangle the municipal plaintiffs’ legal claims before lower courts even have a chance to consider them. Understandably the City of Baltimore argues that the Court should not allow the energy defendants to “smuggle” these new legal claims into the case after they’d initially sought Supreme Court review on a far narrower procedural point.

It will be most interesting to see how the justices react to Big Energy’s attempted bait-and-switch tactics. On the one hand the Court has traditionally frowned on advocates’ efforts to shift their legal arguments after they’ve obtained Court review. However the newly-expanded conservative wing of the Court may view the Baltimore case an an opportunity to double-down on Chief Justice Roberts’ previously-stated view that climate change disputes are inappropriate for resolution by the courts. (As a middle ground the justices could send the case back to the lower federal courts to sort out both the energy companies’ removal and state common law arguments initially.)

If the justices decide to address only the narrow procedural issue of whether the Big Energy defendants are “federal officers” for purposes of federal court removal rules it would appear the City of Baltimore has the far stronger argument. And should the Court so rule that means the Baltimore case–and the others currently pending around the country–will likely head back to state court for resolution on their merits. There in turn the City of Baltimore and the other government plaintiffs are likely to find a more friendly forum than they would before the federal courts.

If on the other hand the Court decides to accept Big Energy’s invitation in Baltimore to hold that there is no appropriate role for state common law-based theories in addressing state and local government climate change concerns this important nationwide climate change litigation trend could suffer a fatal blow.

More broadly the Baltimore case provides a newly-constituted and more conservative Supreme Court its first opportunity to declare its views on environmental law generally and climate change litigation in particular.

In sum the Baltimore case is one very much worth watching.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAxLTE4L3doYXQtZG9lcy1hLWdyZWVuLWdyaWQtbWVhbi1hbmQtY2FuLWJpZGVuLW1ha2Utb25lLXF1aWNrdGFrZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's a Green Grid and Can Biden Make One?,"Why did this happen?

Is Latin America Ready?,"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) turns 100 this year. Though predominantly a domestic commemoration the CCP’s centennial will likely bring policy adjustments that reverberate abroad particularly in Latin America. After 2021 China is projected to deepen its interest in Latin American commodities while further capitalizing on Latin American’s strategic proximity to the United States. Faced with enhanced Chinese outreach in the coming years Latin American leaders have the options of active non-alignment collaboration with or explicit disinterest in China. Ultimately Latin American governments’ active non-alignment with China may be both the most developmentally sound policy and the most difficult to implement amidst domestic political constraints.

Founded in 1921 the CCP has ruled modern China since its 1949 victory in the Chinese civil war. In 2020 the party experienced one of the most challenging years of governance to date including the global spread of COVID-19 and sustained pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Cognizant of how political tensions emerge during commemorative occasions Chinese authorities have sought to stamp out 2020’s challenges to their image and governance ahead of the 2021 CCP centennial. They have been largely successful: early Chinese whistleblowers on COVID-19 were muzzled Australia’s calls to investigate the virus’ origins led to a wave of tariffs and import suspensions and Hong Kong activists have been detained in waves of arrests.

Given that recent challenges to CCP governance have subsided in 2021 the CCP will likely emphasize a more expansive and interventionist foreign policy. Even if silencing domestic discontent regarding COVID-19 and Hong Kong appeared temporarily successful dissent can still reemerge. Having a high-visibility foreign policy will help bolster the CCP’s domestic legitimacy during a sensitive year. As a 2015 academic article published by the Political Studies Association notes “Evidence of an increase in international recognition could bolster claims that the regime has improved the country’s international statu… [Chinese] leadership [could] attempt to appease domestic audiences by gaining ‘face’ for China abroad.”

Beyond addressing domestic legitimacy an expansive and interventionist foreign policy is currently favored among political elites and reflects a hardline interpretation of CCP interests. Chinese diplomats honed a confrontational public engagement style known as “wolf warrior diplomacy” during the COVID-19 outbreak. This strategy dismisses and discredits foreign criticism of CCP actions as conspiratorial. In recent years fringe viewpoints have also been welcomed into CCP foreign policy. One such example is Liu Mingfu a Chinese colonel who has “advocated the need for China to overturn American global dominance to secure peace worldwide.” Wolf warrior diplomacy suggests that China will increasingly intervene to aggressively defend its foreign policy values. Meanwhile Liu’s views underscore a growing CCP belief that China’s foreign policy interests are innately opposed to and will inherently conflict with U.S. foreign policy interests.

The final ingredient predicting China’s more expansive and interventionist foreign policy in 2021 is a conducive international environment. If prevailing CCP thought places China in direct competition with the United States the past year has significantly weakened the U.S. ability to compete with China abroad. The United States’ continual withdrawal from international treaties besieged democratic institutions sluggish COVID-19 response and recent widespread social unrest help China extol the Chinese system of government as well as rapidly forge new partnerships with traditional U.S. allies to assert Chinese preferences.

As part of its expansive and interventionist strategy China will likely make Latin America a renewed foreign policy priority in 2021. Latin America’s commodities and geographic location have developmental and strategic value to China. China imports both industrial and foodstuff commodities from Latin America chiefly soybeans copper petroleum and iron. Although Chinese developmental finance patterns in Latin America have waxed and waned exports and imports have continued to rise in keeping with this decade’s trends. As commodities fuel China’s growing urban population and infrastructure China may seek to further dominate the commodity market past 2021 to assure a continued source of domestic growth.

Just as critically Latin America has symbolic and strategic value to Chinese foreign policy as it seeks to compete with the United States. U.S. policymakers suspect that Chinese investment in Panama will compromise the commercial neutrality of the Panama Canal on which American trade strongly depends. Others worry that Huawei’s telecommunications expansion will enable Chinese surveillance and espionage of U.S. trade activities. China may likely further invest buy and construct to deepen its foothold in the Americas in 2021. Domestic finances permitting such a strategy enhances China’s own developmental resources while sticking a finger in the eye of the CCP’s self-appointed adversary during a symbolic and commemorative year for the party.

Paradoxically however deepening Chinese attention to Latin America may undercut China’s own objectives. China has framed its regional presence to Latin American governments as an alliance of equals painting both China and Latin American countries as collaborative developing nations. This messaging becomes less plausible if China visibly leverages its presence in Latin America to antagonize the United States. If Latin American countries perceive that China is using the region as a stepping-stone for great power competition regional governments have less incentive to collaborate with China. In particular left-wing politicians in Latin America commonly use income from China’s commodity spending to boost domestic social services. Yet leftists with nationalist beliefs may find that using Chinese money is politically untenable if those funds are associated with neocolonialist endeavors.

In the face of projected increased Chinese interest Latin American governments can choose active non-alignment collaboration with or explicit disinterest toward China. Collaboration with China risks alienating U.S. support while disinterest toward China also limits countries’ development possibilities. Ultimately Latin American governments’ active non-alignment with China may be both the most developmentally sound policy and the most difficult to implement amidst domestic political constraints. Active non-alignment would require Latin American governments to diversify the sources of their loans practice collective bargaining create and adhere to a bipartisan foreign policy on China and marginalize populist politicians who would threaten that consensus. Each of these factors is a challenge; achieving all of them would be an astounding feat. Nonetheless such an outcome should not be ruled out. In 2021 China will be pushing the horizons of the possible and Latin American leaders would be wise to do the same.

Lott and Breaux for post-Trump era,"The US subsidiary of Chinese viral video app TikTok has hired its first former members of Congress as it seeks to scroll past the Donald Trump era.

Ex-Sens. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and John Breaux (D-La.) of Crossroads Strategies will lobby on “internet technology and learning-enabled content platforms” for California-based TikTok Inc. according to a new lobbying filing. The registration was effective Dec. 7.

Also lobbying on the account are Crossroads Executive Vice Presidents Ben McMakin and Sam Adcock. McMakin is a former legislative director for Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) the third-most senior Democrat in the Senate.

This marks the first lobbying hire for TikTok itself. Four other firms lobby for parent company ByteDance: Monument Advocacy K & L Gates Mehlman Castagnetti and American Continental Group. That’s on top of ByteDance’s in-house lobbying which topped $1.5 million in the first three quarters of 2020 (see chart below).

The new push comes as TikTok has gotten a reprieve from this summer’s demand by the Trump administration that ByteDance sell the app citing concerns that US users’ data could be shared with the Chinese government. This past week the US government extended the deadline in a court battle with TikTok until Feb. 18 kicking the issue over to the Joe Biden administration.

Biden shared few specifics about his approach to Chinese technology companies during the presidential campaign but many of his advisers share Trump’s concerns about unfair trade practices. The president-elect himself called Chinese President Xi Jinping a “thug” last year. And the Biden campaign has labeled China’s discrimination against its Muslim Uyghur minority “genocide.”

Crossroads’ hiring brings to at least six the number of former members of Congress registered to lobby for Chinese technology companies. Others include:

Former House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) who is lobbying for tech conglomerate Tencent and image sensor manufacturer Omnivision via Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck ;

(R-Calif.) who is lobbying for tech conglomerate and image sensor manufacturer via ; Former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) a Mercury Public Affairs lobbyist for video-surveillance company Hikvision ;

(R-La.) a lobbyist for video-surveillance company ; Former Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) who lobbies for cloud computing company Inspur via Sidley Austin ; and

(R-Ill.) who lobbies for cloud computing company via ; and Former Rep. Jon Christensen (R-Neb.) who is helping smartphone maker OnePlus with visa applications via Appo-G.

A Foreign Lobby Report analysis (see chart below) of lobbying filings reveals that at least 15 Chinese technology companies spent almost $16 million in lobbying and public relations in the first three quarters of 2020. That’s up from around $15.3 million for all of 2019 which itself dwarfed 2018.

The lobbying surge has not been without controversy. Last week former Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said she would drop Hikvision after news of her involvement sparked a backlash. The company is accused of involvement in the surveillance of Uyghurs in the western province of Xinjiang.

ByteDance in particular has been ramping up its US presence in recent months to push back against political and economic threats to its popularity with young people a coveted demographic. The company claims 100 million active monthly users in the US.

Former Walt Disney executive Kevin Mayer became the company’s first chief executive in June but quit after 100 days. Michael Beckerman a former president of the Internet Association continues to run the company’s in-house lobbying team which also includes:

David Urban  a senior adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign and former chief of staff to former Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania;

 a senior adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign and former chief of staff to former Sen. of Pennsylvania; Michael Bloom  a former senior aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.);

 a former senior aide to House Speaker (D-Calif.); Kim Lipsky  a former Democratic staff director of the Senate commerce panel; and

 a former Democratic staff director of the Senate commerce panel; and Edgar McConnell Abrams a former chief of staff to ex-Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.).

TikTok is the second foreign client for Lott and Breaux since their acrimonious departure from Squire Patton Boggs in June 2020. They are also lobbying for the government of Alberta the western Canadian province that is part-owner of the Keystone XL oil pipeline that Biden has vowed to block.

Not to his fans and not even to himself. Landry is trying to send a message to his 2½-year-old son.

“My goal whenever I had my son was to be able to play long enough to let him understand what I do and understand how much work I had to do and what hard work does and how it can pay off” said Landry the 33-year-old tour pro who earned his second PGA Tour victory at the 2020 American Express in La Quinta.

“I get chills thinking about that” Landry added. “I didn’t have that growing up as a kid. I want him to understand what hard work is and where it can lead you.”

Landry says his son Brooks Ryan now looks at the television and can recognize it is his father on the screen and he understands that when Andrew leaves the house in the morning it’s to go to work to practice his craft.

“He wants to go to the golf course with me” Landry said. “He’s 2½ and he’s already swinging a club.”

Perhaps when Brooks Ryan gets a little older he’ll understand that the hard work has led his father to two PGA Tour victories in the last three years including the 2020 American Express. The win was not only his first since 2018 but also a bit of payback for Landry who lost the 2018 American Express in a four-hole playoff against Jon Rahm.

Those two performances have come in what has become one of Landry’s favorite stops on tour since first seeing the desert in 2016 the year he joined the PGA Tour after winning in 2015 on the Korn Ferry Tour.

Discovering the desert

“I was in Phoenix at the Ping factory and my coach Chuck Cook was out in Palm Springs with (Jason) Dufner and they were practicing and playing out there” Landry said. “I had never been and I wanted to get out and get a practice round in. I spent like three days out there with my coach and man I absolutely loved it. I thought it was the greatest spot in the entire county. The weather and the golf and everything. I kept telling my wife you've got to come out you’ve got to come out.”

Elizabeth Landry agreed with her husband about the charms of the desert and friends they have made in the Coachella Valley now make the desert feel like a second home to the couple who live in McAllen Texas.

But just liking the weather or the people doesn’t always translate into good play on the course. For Landry the three-course rotation at the American Express has been as comfortable as the weather in the desert though COVID-19 changes to the tournament will rob Landry of one of his favorite tracks.

“I just think La Quinta Country Club suits my game very very well. Drive it straight” Landry said. “The Stadium Course it’s the same thing. You’ve got to be very very precise. And the Nick course (Nicklaus Tournament Course at PGA West) is the same way. But they can all jump up and bite you.

“It’s three good golf courses that suit my game really well” he added. “The length of them suits me well. The weather suits me well.”

In 2018 Landry still looking for his first tour win at the time finished four rounds at 22-under tied with Rahm who eventually won the playoff. Later that year Landry broke through for that first elusive victory at the Valero Texas Open.

Last January in the desert on the same three-course rotation Landry ran away from the field in The American Express reaching 27-under par through 12 holes of the final round at the Stadium Course and leading by six shots. But a charge by Abraham Ancer and a three-bogey stretch by Landry left Landry tied for the lead with two holes to play. A great tee shot to the island green on the par-3 17th led to a go-ahead birdie and a closing birdie on the par-4 18th pushed Landry to 26 under and the victory by two shots.

Limited by the pandemic

It seemed like the start of a great year for Landry but just two months later the PGA Tour was shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic. Landry’s early season vibe was erased.

“It was both good and bad” Landry said of the shutdown. “I think that I would have probably finished a lot higher in the FedEx Cup being able to keep that momentum building on that win learning what I learned in 2018.

“On the other hand I was able to spend a lot of time away from golf taking a break from golf” he added. “We never really take a break. It was nice to be with family make sure everyone is safe being able to say financial you know we are okay. It’s nice to catch a win early in the year secure my job.”

Not only was The American Express Landry’s only victory in 2020 it was his only top-10 finish in the calendar year until a tie for fourth in November at the RSM Classic at another of Landry’s favorite places on tour Sea Island Ga. The year included 27 events from January through November for Landry with the two top-10 finishes and 13 missed cuts. It is that inconsistency that bothers Landry and has caused him to make some changes for 2021.

“We’ve kind of gone back and the inconsistency of my short game and my putting is just what it is” Landry said. “Every year I have progressively gotten better with my irons. My driver I am getting better. The only thing that is not getting better whether it is stagnant or getting worse is my putting.”

At Sea Island for instance Landry finished two shots out of a playoff. But he was outside the top 20 in putting for the week so better putting could have turned a fourth-place finish into a victory. For the 2019-20 season Landry ranked just 214th in strokes gained-putting on tour.

It is that kind of improvement turning a missed cut into a weekend check turning a 40th-place finish into a top-20 or even a top-10 finish that Landry hopes will happen with harder work on his putting with a new putting coach Marcus Potters of Portland Ore.

“You have got to get better at it and part of that is my fault because I haven’t worked as hard at it as I should” Landry said. “I’m looking forward to working with (Potters) kind of going on a quarterly basis just getting locked in.”

Knowing that he’ll be playing on some of the best greens on the tour at The American Express – he says the greens at La Quinta Country Club are the best he’s ever seen on the tour – Landry believes better putting will provide a better year in 2021. And he hopes to do it with the faith in hard work that he wants to hand down to his son.

“My goal is to become the best putter I can be” he said. “I am going to work really really hard on it hoping it pays off quick this year.”

There was no possible upside only risk. But the apolitical CEO is one of the many norms shattered by Donald Trump. In many respects the 45th President has made it easy for corporate leaders to be more outspoken. It’s sort of a no-brainer to speak out as National Association of Manufacturers president and CEO Jay Timmons put it on Jan. 6 against “armed violent protesters who support the baseless claim by outgoing President Trump that he somehow won an election that he overwhelmingly lost.”

There are a number of factors driving CEOs’ new embrace of the bully pulpit. For one insurrection sedition and violence in the streets is bad for business. Big organizations require stability. Tear gas and bear spray make it hard to achieve the “visibility” into future earnings much prized by Wall Street. “With our country in the midst of a pandemic business leaders recognize that ongoing division and distrust in our political system threatens the economic recovery and job creation our country desperately needs” says the Business Roundtable an organization made up of the CEOs of the nation’s biggest corporations including Apple JPMorgan Chase GM and Walmart.

On its most basic level Trump’s persistent assault on the rule of law and the degradation of a federal election risked undermining the foundations of the system that made the American economy the most dynamic and successful on earth. The primacy of U.S. capital markets and the nation’s standing as a safe haven for global investors were at risk with Trump’s attacks on the norms of good governance. An authoritarian government and a free market can’t co-exist. At its heart the capitalist system requires honoring contracts which made Trump’s flouting of rules a profound threat to financial institutions capital markets and corporate governance. “We believe in investment in the rule of law not the law of rulers” says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld senior associate dean of leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. “CEOs say that about investing abroad—now that has to apply that at home too.”

Defending that system helps explain in the week after the Capitol attack a who’s who of the nation’s most prominent blue-chip companies including Marriott AT&T American Express and Amazon said they would halt campaign donations to members of Congress who voted to challenge the presidential-election results. Unsentimentally Hallmark Cards which is based in Kansas City Mo. took the additional step of asking Republican Senators who objected to certifying the results to refund the company’s previous donations. Other companies including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup called a temporary halt to donations to both Republican and Democrats.

“We are taking a pause on federal contributions and using this as an opportunity to really evaluate the candidates that we have supported and do their actions and values align with ours” Lynn Good CEO of Duke Energy said in an interview with TIME. “We felt like this was an important one for us to weigh in on as a company.” Good said the decision came after careful deliberation and was informed by the strong reaction of many of the company’s employees and customers. “Everyone was watching with some degree of dismay and shock” says Good. “We are not a supporter of violence being used as a way to voice an opinion on an important topic.” (One could ask whether corporations should play such an outsize role in funding candidates but that’s a separate topic for another day.)

Additional moves may be forthcoming. Sonnenfeld who has convened three emergency summits with CEOs since the election said the majority of CEOs at a recent meeting said they would “reconsider their investments in states of seditious Congressmen.”

Business leaders are stepping in to fill a void left by the erosion of trust in government and other institutions. Communications firm Edelman which annually measures trust in institutions including government NGOs business and media found in its new study that business is the “only trusted institution … and the only institution seen as both ethical and competent.” The report concluded “The heightened expectations of business bring CEOs new demands to focus on societal engagement with the same rigor thoughtfulness and energy used to deliver on profits.”

One marker of a sea change is the emergence of a new vocabulary. Deplatforming—kicking bad actors off the tech infrastructure—has become a mark of corporate activism. Twitter Facebook and most recently YouTube have deplatformed President Trump. On Jan. 12 YouTube said in a statement “After careful review and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence we removed new content uploaded to the Donald J. Trump channel … We are also indefinitely disabling comments under videos on the channel.”

Other tech giants up and down the digital food chain took similar steps in the wake of the Capitol attack. Amazon’s immense cloud-services businesses (in the most recent quarter they generated nearly $10 billion in revenue) kicked right-wing social network Parler off its web-hosting servers earlier this month. (Parler has sued for breach of contract.) Apple and Google which removed Parler’s app from its app stores have moved to dismantle the infrastructure of hate. And Stripe a high-flying fin-tech startup said it would no longer process payments for Trump’s campaign website in the wake of the Capitol riots for violating its policies against encouraging violence.

Whether this was a bold act of corporate leadership—or the equivalent of closing the digital barn door after the rabid horse had already kicked the stable manager in the head and flung its rider to the ground—is a complex question. The deplatforming largely resulted in a collective short-term sigh of relief but was a stark demonstration of the inordinate and lightly regulated power of a handful of tech giants based in Silicon Valley. Global leaders including the heads of state of Germany and Mexico expressed concern over private companies’ ability to censor speech. Forging a new paradigm around the complicated questions of free speech market concentration and tech regulation will be one of the most consequential global policy debates of our time.

A final driver forcing CEOs to come off the sideline is the expectation of today’s more politically engaged younger workers. The Edelman survey found that 86% of respondents expected CEOs to speak out on societal issues. “We govern with the consent of the governed and the governed are restless” one CEO of a small firm told TIME voicing concern over the expectation that a CEO statement was now considered de rigueur after any development of note. Speaking out is fine on big issues like climate change or illegally closing the borders to people of one religion according to the CEO. But there is a growing unease about where it will lead particularly with issues that hit closer to home like executive compensation and the wealth gap. In a post-Trump Joe Biden world “no comment” is no longer an option.

The second American Civil War is here.

No official announced Trump’s Civil War. That’s why our major news organizations dance around the awful truth using confusing language.

But we don’t need a press release to recognize Trump directed white supremacist followers to attack a branch of our national government on Jan. 6. The treasonous assault on Congress capped years of also undermining the judiciary and the executive branch’s intelligence law enforcement and health agencies.

Trump apologists will quarrel with the word directed. Yes Trump spoke as he often does out of four sides of his mouth when he said he would march with the throng to our Capitol. Recordings show people shouting they were invited by the president and doing his will. It is the message the mob understood that matters as well as video during the siege where Trump expressed love for the insurrectionists.

That Trump will not attend the inauguration of Joe Biden should make you shudder. Without him on the outdoor platform rebels hellbent on overthrowing our government could assassinate Biden and incoming Vice President Kamala Harris with no risk to messianic and delusional Trump.

We face danger from more than the lawless Trump mob that attacked our Capitol.

This is why police and National Guard will flood that zone on Jan. 20. And it explains why Biden and Harris insist on being sworn in outdoors to signal fear has no place in the land of the free and home of the brave.

And it’s not just government buildings that require extra protection from disloyal and self-righteous Americans who love Trump more than our Constitutional liberties. Mosques synagogues and some churches especially Black churches will be vulnerable to attack by those who want to make America white again. Many claim to be Christians but are in fact the embodiment of evil.

Trump’s mob will not win this war. No matter what buildings they attack what leaders they assassinate they cannot win because there are not enough of them to destroy the United States of America in favor of a dictatorship under Trump his children or anyone else.

Making America Endure

Eager and willing as Trump’s army is to assassinate for perceived betrayal outgoing Vice President Mike Pence as well as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Biden and Harris our freedom and continuity of our government does not hinge on any individual.

Our nation endures so long as we sustain a broad and deep commitment to the five noble objectives of the Constitution articulated in our Preamble. Each objective is designed to perfect our union over time.

If you don’t know the Preamble please click here and read the 52 words again and again until you memorize them. Take note that riches neither are mentioned nor implied. Liberty the general welfare and justice are along with their byproducts peace and tranquility.

Even though the outcome of Trump’s Civil War is certain Trump’s band of domestic terrorists can and already have imposed enormous and lasting damage.

These true believers in Trumpian rule can dissuade many from peaceful and joyful mingling in houses of worship government buildings sports arenas and political venues. While Biden and Harris are brave millions will hold back because of their rational fear of violent attack. Doubt that? How eager are you to visit on vacation or ride a bus in Jerusalem? Kabul? Baghdad?

Our nation’s capital is an armed camp today. So are the downtowns of many of our state capitals. Law enforcement and the intelligence community sift through plots organized on the Internet in the hope of disrupting attacks before they occur. The police and soldiers are backups for the inevitable failures to prevent attacks.

Among the Attackers

We also need to recognize we face danger beyond the lawless Trump mob.

We now know the insurgents attacking our Capitol included rogue active-duty military and police officers. Dozens of people on FBI terrorist watch lists were among the attackers evidently not being watched at all closely. There are disturbing indications some members of Congress Republicans all may have helped the attackers reconnoiter the Capitol pointing out hidden offices of Democratic Party leaders.

One Republican lawmaker openly encouraged rebellion. Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama outfitted in camo riled up the Trumpian mob before its attack. Another Republican Lauren Boebert of Colorado tweeted out the location of Pelosi who was then being hunted by the mob. A Boebert text described a plan to put a bullet in Pelosi’s head on TV. Think about what America would be like today had the insurgents assassinated leaders by firing squad or hanging them from the gallows they set up outside the Capitol.

Brooks and Boebert must be expelled from the House. Failure to do this will only give succor to others tempted by traitorous opportunity.

Democratic lawmakers who reported seeing pre-siege extremist Republicans giving guided tours to insurgency leaders are worried the riot had even further traitorous inside help. Coming investigations will tell us the facts especially if prosecutors are smart about leveraging cooperation in return for less severe sentences.

That we may have a Fifth Column in Congress immediately alarmed unwitting collaborators from the dominant economic force in America big corporations. From American Express and AT&T to Tyson Foods and United Parcel Service many big companies stopped at least for now aiding and abetting with money these faithless enemies of America.

We live in strange times when we need help from soulless corporations to defend our liberties. To be sure they acted out of self-interest. Under a dictatorship corporate directors and executives would be forced to bend to the will of an unelected and unaccountable autocrat who could eviscerate their privileges and plunder their wealth.

Disloyalty and oath-breaking by officials also marked the 1860s when some representatives senators and federal judges used their power to wage war on the United States. Until they were stopped. Texas lawyer Barbara Radnofsky tells some of this compellingly in her concise book A Citizen’s Guide to Impeachment.

Our Noble Purpose

The costs of Trump’s Army waging war on our government will drain resources from improving America from perfecting our union.

To secure our safety National Guard troops sleep on the cold marble floors of America’s Capitol. Fences and walls are becoming ubiquitous a twisted outgrowth of Trump’s lie that he would build a wall. Other barriers metal detectors and other protections against domestic terrorists are abounding.

Trump’s Civil War did not begin with the murderous attack on our Capitol. It dates to at least August 2017 when his violent thugs marched in Charlottesville Va. shouting Nazi slogans. “Jews will not replace us” and “blood and soil” they chanted while marching past a synagogue. The next day one of them drove his car into a crowd killing Heather Heyer the first fatality in Trump’s Civil War.

What these rebels heard the next day what instilled them with bravado was not Trump’s confusing comparison of anti-Semitic racists and the counter-demonstrators but this line about themselves: “very fine people.”

Don’t make the mistake of thinking there is no Second Civil War just because all is peaceful where you are. Six days before rebels bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12 1861 The New York Times reported that an attack was imminent. But once the fighting began there was no battle of Grand Rapids no skirmish in Rochester no siege in Cincinnati. In some states such as Oregon all regular Army were withdrawn and volunteers maintained military outposts and kept watch on Confederacy sympathizers.

That is how wars take place. People may be sipping espresso in sidewalk cafes or picnicking beside a stream while soldiers fire on one another within earshot.

As we prosecute this war on Trump’s militias and half-organized renegade insurgents we must give no quarter in terms of criminal prosecution especially for seditious conspiracy and murder. Where they fire their arms we must respond with lethal force as the laws of war allow. But we must be better than the attackers.

We must take care not to give Trump’s army a perverse victory by destroying the soul of America by losing sight of our nation’s great purpose. We must not descend into a militarized safety zone.

Instead we must build up the institutions we have damaged with decades of malign neglect—schools colleges public health and more. We need law enforcement to act as guardians instead of warriors. Even restoration is needed of public furniture to parks and bridges making life pleasant and commerce efficient.

We must make our union more perfect through caring for our citizens providing the tools for stable and prosperous lives and vigorous debate about the way we want to order our liberty.

We must keep in our hearts and our politics the fundamental purpose of our government—to ennoble the human spirit with liberty and fraternity so that our people can attain the best that our nature makes possible.

He is the president of Eurasia Group a political-risk consultancy and GZERO Media a company dedicated to providing intelligent and engaging coverage of international affairs. He teaches applied geopolitics at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs and his most recent book is The Power of Crisis

There is no advanced industrial democracy in the world more politically divided or politically dysfunctional than the United States today. How did the world’s most powerful country get to this point? To paraphrase a great American writer—slowly then suddenly. The Capitol riot was not just years in the making but decades. That’s because of three distinct features of American society that have been ignored by U.S. politicians for far too long: the enduring legacy of race the changing nature of capitalism and the fracturing of our collective media landscape.

Begin with race; the U.S. is far from unique in having a troubled history with race relations. But it has been particularly slow to address the structural legacy of that racism—it took nearly a century following the end of the Civil War for the 1964 Civil Rights Act to get passed to cite just one example. Steps have been taken in recent decades to begin addressing this legacy in earnest from anti-discrimination laws to affirmative action efforts. It has worked to bring Black Americans toward a more even footing even paving the way for the U.S. to elect its first Black president. But as the Black Lives Matter protests this past summer made all too clear there is still much work left unfinished.

And that’s only part of the story. The other part is the backlash as a group of white Americans—many of them white rural—are seeing their status in society threatened as a result of demographics and the recent racial reckoning. That has manifested itself both in politics—see redistricting and voter suppression schemes—as well as the violence we witnessed at the Capitol. While this anxiety has economic elements (more about that in a bit) it is best understood in terms of broader identity (and if you haven’t read Isabel Wilkerson’s Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents you should). Years in the making these feelings of resentment hit a fever pitch in the Trump years culminating in last week’s deadly riot. To be clear the U.S. is not the only country that has to deal with elements of racism in their populist movements—plenty of European countries can attest to that. But given the structural way racism has been woven into the country’s fabric combined with years of neglecting the problem race relations have contributed mightily to the current state of U.S. political affairs.

Then there is the evolving nature of capitalism. Capitalism and the economic growth it drove is what made the U.S. the world’s preeminent superpower in the latter half of the 20th century. The entrepreneurial spirit of American-style capitalism in particular generated the kinds of innovations and growth that were exported around the world helped along by globalization. America’s enduring faith in capitalism and specifically the power of the individual is the reason generations of immigrants made their way to the U.S. to give their dreams the best chance of succeeding. It’s also why the country today is home to the companies—especially technology companies—that power our modern world (at least in the West).

But there’s the flip side to U.S.-style capitalism—this capitalist individualist economic system generates tremendous amounts of wealth but it has also resulted in an average American worker with less of a social safety net (especially compared to European counterparts) not to mention a political system more prone to capture by moneyed special interests. Again this is not something new that suddenly appeared with Trump’s arrival at the White House. Yet while U.S. capitalism has long allowed for inequality of outcomes in the last thirty years we’ve increasingly seen the rise of inequality of opportunity as well. And this latter form is more devastating—when people feel that they never even got a shot to compete let alone to succeed they get angry. And it’s accelerating. 30 years ago when we spoke about those who lost out from capitalism we usually referred to a specific set of blue-collar workers left behind by free trade (in a globalized world U.S. workers that earn more than the global average are less attractive to hire). But now we are getting to the point where automation and AI are slowly looking to displace a far wider set of workers and across socio-economic classes. As the rise of politicians like Bernie Sanders shows this is as much a concern for voters on the left side of the political spectrum as it is on the right. The end result is a more divided electorate fueled by fear about how they are going to survive in an American future that gives the have’s more and the have-not’s less with less prospect of moving from one group to the other.

Which brings us to the media. The same tech companies that power our modern world have also brought a revolution in our media consumption. Plenty are quick to point their fingers at the tech companies for fracturing our media landscape but in hindsight the evolution of social media has followed a familiar path—talk radio cable news and blogs were all once mass media ways of communicating that over time fragmented into more and more niche offerings until consumers could “enjoy” only those viewpoints that reinforced their own. The speed of technology is such that we’ve seen the fracturing happen much quicker with social media but the truly disruptive element tech companies have introduced is algorithms—actively designed to capture more ad revenues and attention often achieved by promoting extremist and misleading content. And it has come at the cost of a healthy and informed citizenry.

Compared to countries in Europe where tech platforms face more severe government regulation and must take more responsibility for content posted the U.S. has a particular problem given its inclination to go lighter on private sector regulation. But the U.S. government won’t be able to sit on the sidelines much longer given recent developments—while plenty cheered at Twitter and Facebook’s decision to de-platform Trump in the wake of the Capitol riot it opens serious questions about who has the democratic right to limit others’ speech. U.S. politicians will have to wade in lest they effectively cede that power to unelected tech CEOs a recipe for a disaster of a whole other sort.

There are other contributing factors to today’s U.S. political divisions but for me these three are the most structural and the most crucial. Even more worrying no matter what happens with recent impeachment efforts all three of these trends are set to grow stronger over the near-term. Absent more earnest efforts across the political spectrum to deal with these issues—and make the political compromises necessary to truly address them—these are problems that will grow worse.

Joe Biden faces numerous challenges when he takes office. And while tackling the pandemic may be his most immediate challenge it isn’t his more daunting.

The American Petroleum Institute the nation’s largest and most powerful oil lobby is losing one of its biggest members over a disagreement about addressing the climate crisis.

France’s Total announced Friday it is quitting the API because of the lobby’s stances on regulation and carbon pricing as well as its support for politicians who oppose the Paris climate agreement. The move makes Total the first major oil company to leave the API because of the climate crisis.

The exit underscores the divide in the oil industry over how to respond to climate change. Top European oil companies including Total and BP have made more aggressive promises to slash carbon emissions and invest in clean energy than ExxonMobil (XOM) Chevron and other US firms.

The move also comes amid a broader reckoning in Corporate America over political contributions following the insurrection at the US Capitol.

“This is a serious blow for API whose influence largely stems from its claim to be the voice of the entire oil and gas industry” Andrew Logan director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres said in a statement. He added the split is “likely to mark the beginning of an exodus from the trade group.”

Founded in 1919 the API now has more than 600 members including ExxonMobil Chevron (CVX) ConocoPhillips (COP) BP and Shell.

‘Hostile’ to climate policy

Total has helped lead the industry response to the climate crisis. Last year Total announced a goal to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. Importantly that goal included the so-called scope 3 emissions from the products it sells namely gasoline jet fuel and diesel. For major oil-and-gas companies scope 3 can comprise as much as 85% of total emissions according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

“We are committed to ensuring in a transparent manner that the industry associations of which we are a member adopt positions and messages that are aligned with those of the group in the fight against climate change” Patrick Pouyanne Total’s CEO said in a statement.

Total said a “detailed analysis” of API’s climate positions revealed the lobby is only “partially aligned” with the company. Total cited several “divergences” including API’s support for rolling back US regulation on methane emissions which the company opposed in November 2019. Total also noted that API is part of the Transportation Fairness Alliance which is opposed to providing subsidies for electric vehicles.

Additionally Total said that during the recent elections API supported candidates who opposed the United States’ participation in the Paris climate agreement. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to swiftly return the nation to the accord.

Indeed InfluenceMap a London-based think tank focused on energy and climate change said the API “appears to be broadly hostile to progressive climate policy.” The group gives the API an “F” in terms of how aligned its climate policy is to the Paris agreement.

API says it wants to work with Biden

In a statement the API defended its climate record and thanked Total for its membership.

“We believe that the world’s energy and environmental challenges are large enough that many different approaches are necessary to solve them and we benefit from a diversity of views” an API spokesperson said.

The API said it supports the “ambitions of the Paris Agreement including global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate poverty around the globe.”

Mike Sommers API’s CEO said during a call with reporters this week that the group wants to work with President-elect Biden and the EPA on reducing methane emissions. “We’re open to the possibility of further regulation in this space” Sommers said adding that the Biden administration should collaborate with the industry to come up with regulation that can “actually survive judicial scrutiny.”

Will BP and Shell follow suit?

Edward Collins director of corporate climate lobbying at InfluenceMap said Total’s departure will “place pressure on BP and Shell to seriously examine their own memberships.”

Both European oil companies have promised to overhaul their businesses as they transition to low-carbon energy. And they both plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2050.

In a statement BP (BP) said it “actively” monitors its membership in trade associations “especially those we view as only ‘partially aligned’ with us on climate-related issues.”

“We remain committed to trying to influence those associations from within” BP said adding that it plans to publish a trade association update in the second quarter.

Shell (RDSA) said that it regularly reviews its membership in industry associations but it signaled no imminent exit from the API.

“Specific to climate API is moving closer to Shell’s own stated views” a Shell spokesman told CNN Business. “As a result we feel it’s beneficial to remain a member so that we can continue to advocate for change from within.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzc29jY2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjEvMDEvZml2ZS10aGluZ3MtdG8ta25vdy1jb2xvbWJpYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five Things to Know: Colombia,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ussoccer.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The Price Tower in Bartlesville received national attention recently when it was one of 16 structures included on CNN.com’s list of “Famous Buildings in the American South”.

The website featured an architectural tour of must-see buildings and landmarks and touted Frank Lloyd Wright’s world-renown Price Tower as one of his most influential designs.

Price Tower Executive Director Rick Loyd said the team at Price Tower was elated about the designation.

“We are so pleased to hear the tower is part of this impressive list” Loyd said. “When a national media giant such as CNN identifies the uniqueness and important aspects of Price Tower it’s a great reminder to visitors near and far that it’s worth your time to see what the tower is all about.”

Price Tower is listed alongside many well-known buildings and attractions in the southern part of the U.S. The list includes:

• The Mercedes Benz Superdome in New Orleans

• The Clinton Presidential Library and Museum in Little Rock Arkansas

• The Alamo in San Antonio

• National Aquarium in Baltimore

• Ryman Auditorium in Nashville Tennessee -- original home of the Grand Ole Opry

• National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery Alabama

• Nemours Estate in Wilmington Delaware

• Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando Florida

• Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello in Charlottesville Virginia

• Mercer Williams House Museum in Savannah Georgia

• Humana Building in Louisville Kentucky

• Elvis Presley Birthplace in Tupelo Mississippi

• Biltmore in Asheville North Carolina

• St. Philip's Episcopal Church in Charleston South Carolina

• The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs West Virginia

“First of all these are some amazing buildings to be associated with and secondly this is such a unique and eclectic list of buildings to be part of. … It includes an aquarium major sports arena castles and The Alamo … so Price Tower is in great company” Loyd said.

At the beginning of his article CNN writer Forrest Brown encourages travelers to explore the highways and byways of the American South to best view its architecture. Brown says sojourners will discover the “true nature” of the South to be a region of the U.S. that’s “far more diverse than many imagine.”

In the portion of the story featuring Price Tower Brown refers to the building as the only skyscraper designed by noted “horizontalist” Frank Lloyd Wright. He outlines the tower’s original intended location in New York City and its coming to life in the mid 1950s as headquarters for a pipeline construction company located in Bartlesville.

Brown then enlightens readers on Wright’s poetic nature-based tree design with the tower’s “trunk” (elevator shafts and structural walls) serving as support for “branches” (concrete slabs) that extend outward -- and the Tower’s “leaves” being the copper panels and sun louvers.

Loyd said this national publicity reinforces the widespread appeal Price Tower holds across the U.S. and beyond.

“I’m amazed where our guests come in from. In just November and December of 2020 even with it being an off year and not a peak time period we had guests staying in our hotel from 43 states and Canada” Loyd said. “That’s incredible to me. I doubt there are many communities our size that can tout that. Of course tourism brings revenue to our area and we are all very proud to show off Bartlesville.”

Price Tower houses a 19 guest room boutique inn Copper Restaurant + Bar and and a free art gallery open seven days a week. Historic tours of the iconic Tower are offered daily and more information can be found at PriceTower.org.

“It’s easy for all of us to take for granted the amazing aspects of our own community – but we hope recognition like this from CNN will be a good motivation to bring friends and family when they come to town to appreciate all the awesome things Price Tower brings to our great city” Loyd said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbmV4dHN0bC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS9ob21lLW9mLWZpcnN0LWFmcmljYW4tYW1lcmljYW4tcHJpbmNpcGFsLW9mLWEtc3QtbG91aXMtcHVibGljLXNjaG9vbC1kZXNpZ25hdGVkLWFzLWNpdHktbGFuZG1hcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Home of First African American Principal of a St. Louis Public School Designated as City Landmark,"1211 Tower Grove Avenue

On Friday the Board of Aldermen passed a bill to designate the Oscar Waring House at 1211 Tower Grove Avenue as a City Landmark.



Oscar Waring was the first African American principal of Sumner High School the first public high school for African American students west of the Mississippi River. According to the SLPS Waring was appointed principal of Sumner High School in 1879 and remained until retiring in 1908 due to failing health as the present Sumner High School building (4248 Cottage Avenue in The Ville) was being constructed.



Waring moved into the home at 1211 Tower Grove Avenue in 1884 with his wife and educator Mary Waring and lived there until his death in 1911.



Prior to coming to St. Louis around 1877 Waring practiced law in Washington D.C was a mathematics teacher in Mississippi and served as a high school principal in Kentucky. He was a scholar of seven languages. According to Landmarks Association Waring was remembered by his SLPS colleagues as a quiet studious man who gave what time he did not spend on his students to his family. He loved chess as well as his extensive home garden.

Andrew Weil the executive director of Landmarks Association of St. Louis who assisted Timothy Greenwald the current owner of the Waring House in drafting the petition for landmark designation wrote in the organization’s newsletter: “Today Waring’s former home in Forest Park Southeast is worthy of recognition for its association with two African American pioneer educators in St. Louis. Following use as a homeless shelter by New Life Evangelistic Center and as transitional housing by Agape House Outreach Center the condition of the home had deteriorated badly by the early 21st century. When it was purchased for rehabilitation in 2016 very few original details were visible. Faux wood paneling and drop ceilings obscured original wall surfaces and room volumes. Spaces had been subdivided windows boarded and the exterior neglected. Original features like paneling and balustrade were uncovered during the renovation process. The rear wall had to be taken down and rebuilt the masonry detailing of the parapet had to be restored and all windows were replaced with custom historic replicas.”

A Landmark in the Making: the Oscar Waring Home



The bill designating landmark status was sponsored by 17th ward Alderman Joe Roddy. The architect for the renovation project was Killeen Studio Architects and Millennium Restoration was the contractor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVzc2FuZGpvdXJuYWwuY28udWsvZnAvbmV3cy9oaWdobGFuZHMtaXNsYW5kcy8yODE4NDU5L2EtcmlnaHQtcm95YWwtZG9uYXRpb24tYW1lcmljYW4tbWlsbGlvbmFpcmUtZG9uYXRlcy00MGstdG8tY2hhcml0eS1hZnRlci1jYWl0aG5lc3MtaG9tZS1zdGFycy1pbi10aGUtY3Jvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A right royal donation: American millionaire donates £40k to charity after Caithness home stars in The Crown,"An American millionaire has gifted £40000 to a Caithness community group after opening the doors of her private residence to producers of the Netflix hit drama The Crown.

Dr Betsee Parker an Episcopalian minister and philanthropist from Virginia bought Ackergill Tower in early 2019 after it ceased trading as a luxury hotel.

The 15th century manor located on the coast of Sinclair’s Bay near Wick became one of a host of Highland destinations to form the backdrop of the fourth season of the award-winning drama.

Through acknowledging the struggle of rural communities amidst the pandemic Dr Parker opted to support of her fellow ‘neighbours’ by reinvesting the money it is understood was paid for using the castle into the local community.

Pulteneytown People’s Project (PPP) received a donation of £40000 towards their work in supporting those in need.

Meanwhile £10000 was also donated to the Episcopal Diocese of Moray Ross and Caithness towards its Covid-19 response.

Dr Parker who served as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 2013-2018 said: “I searched for areas of greatest need in our community.

“I feel that the leaders should decide how best to use the donation. They are the ones who truly know the needs of the community”.

Katrina MacNab chief executive officer of PPP praised Dr Parker for her generosity.

She said: “We never expected it. We got a phone call from her solicitor who asked would we be interested and wanted to know a wee bit about what we did.

“Dr Parker phoned herself from Virginia. She blethered for a good hour on the phone she was lovely.

“The money was actually money that Dr Parker got for The Crown the Netflix drama because part of that was filmed in Caithness and they used Ackergrill Tower for a bit of the filming.

“When they did the filming she got paid for that and basically what she has done is she has given that money back to the community.”

The 17th Baroness of Lochiel and goodwill ambassador has worked closely with the UN in Africa as well as the Vatican receiving many awards for her philanthropic work covering issues including sustainable development climate change poverty and hunger.

She received two Honorary Doctorates and Distinguished Service Awards for her service in 9/11 and was recipient of an Alumni Achievement Award at Harvard in 2016 after graduating with honours from the University in 1985.

The Caithness-based charity provide a range of services and across the community each year and donated around 14000 meals to elderly residents during the first lockdown.

Mrs MacNab said they are aiming to reinvest the money to achieve match funding in providing a holistic service for struggling carers across the region.

She added: “We have been really good at getting money from the Scottish Government to do other things though the pandemic but carers is something where we feel there has been a big gap.

“In Wick if people have a partner with dementia they would go all day to the Laurandy Centre and you would get to go and see your friends and do your own thing and you would have them at night.

“Now all of that is closed the same with the mental health teams like Haven so partners are stuck at home all day every day with people.”

“They are pretty isolated they don’t have the network of friends or the activities they used to go to they can’t go for an appointment anywhere because they’re a full-time carer 24 hours a day” Mrs MacNab said.

“We are hoping to try and build up some form of project to support carers and provide something holistic.”",,,,,,

Michigan’s Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud and Wayne County Prosecutor Kym L Worth announced that after 12 months of jury proceedings the nine officials were indicted on a total of 42 counts “related to a series of alleged actions and inactions that created the historic injustice of the Flint Water Crisis”.

“We must remember that the Flint Water Crisis is not some relic of the past. At this very moment the people of Flint continue to suffer from the categorical failure of public officials at all levels of government who trampled upon their trust and evaded accountability for far too long” Hammoud was quoted as saying in a statement.

Former governor Snyder was charged with two counts of willful neglect of duty. “As Governor of the State of Michigan a public officer did willfully neglect his mandatory legal duty to protect citizens of this state against disaster and/or emergency” his indictment mentions.

Snyder who is a Republican became Michigan’s 48th governor and was sworn in on January 1 2011. He remained in this position until 2018.

What was the Flint Water Crisis?

The Flint water crisis is an ongoing public health crisis that began in 2014 when the City of Flint in Michigan–which has a population of roughly 100000–changed its water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint river. This switch caused the water distribution pipes to corrode as a result of which lead and other contaminants were leached into the municipal drinking water.

This led to an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease a serious type of pneumonia caused by the Legionella bacteria and other health complications in thousands of its residents. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) people can get sick from this if they breathe in mist or accidentally swallow bacteria-containing water into the lungs.

While the water supply was switched back in 2015 the damage was long-lasting and many residents of the city continued to suffer.

In January 2016 the state of Michigan declared a state of emergency and in October the same year residents of the city were advised not to drink the municipal tap water unless it was filtered.

As per an article published in the American Water Works Association (AWWA) in 2016 which described the water crisis a few weeks after the water source was switched despite warnings and concerns from some officials residents started complaining about the colour taste and odor of their drinking water. In May 2014 some residents informed officials that the water was causing rashes especially in children.

As per a Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) conducted by the CDC in May 2016 over 66 percent of the households in the city reported one or more adult members experiencing at least one behavioural health issue “more than usual” and 54 percent of the households reported that at least one child experienced at least one behavioural health issue.

But why was the water source changed?

The AWWA article notes that in order to reduce costs for treated water Flint officials decided to join the newly formed Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in 2013 which was constructing a pipeline to transmit water from Lake Huron.

In the meantime the city of Flint had the option to either purchase treated water from the Detroit Water and Sewage Department (DWSD) which was sourced from Lake Huron or treat water from the Flint river on its own.

After officials failed to strike a short-term agreement with DWSD Flint officials decided to use water from the Flint river and treat it at the Flint Water Service Center (FWSC). But the water wasn’t treated properly at the FWSC resulting in lead contamination.

The article also notes that while the Flint river water is difficult to treat “oversights and missteps” combined with “inherent chemical conditions” set the stage for the water crisis.

A report published in 2017 by the Michigan Civil Rights Commission said that race and racism played a role in causing the water crisis even though both black and white residents were victims. The report is based on the testimony of over 150 residents community leaders experts academics and government officials.

“We are not suggesting that those making decisions related to this crisis were racists or meant to treat Flint any differently because it is a community primarily made up by people of color. Rather the disparate response is the result of systemic racism that was built into the foundation and growth of Flint its industry and the suburban area surrounding it” the report said.

The crisis has been the subject of a film and a documentary film. A 2017 TV film called Flint directed by Bruce Beresford starring Queen Latifah featured her as a woman dealing with the effects that the contaminated water had on her and her family. A documentary on the subject also titled “Flint” was released in 2020 and is based on half a decade of research into the crisis and the failure of officials to respond to it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3RoZXRhbmRkLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGVzL21hZ2F6aW5lL3dhdGVyLWlzLWxpZmUtYWxsLWFib3V0LXNhbnRlZS1jb29wZXJzLXdhdGVyLXN5c3RlbXMvYXJ0aWNsZV8xNTE5NzA5NS00OTdmLTUwMWItOWQzYy01MjM2OWVjZGNmZmIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WATER IS LIFE: All about Santee Cooper's water systems,"The water treatment process In five simple steps

How do we transform water from the Santee Cooper Lakes into the award-winning thirst-quenching water coming out of your faucet? There are several stages it moves through to get there.

1. Water gets pumped in. First untreated water from Lake Moultrie is pumped into

the treatment facility. Screens on the inlet pipes prevent fish and large debris like logs and branches from entering the system.

2. Coagulation. Disinfection cannot occur unless all suspended solids and particles

have been removed. The removal process begins with coagulation where aluminum salt chemical coagulants are swiftly mixed into the water. The coagulants help by clumping the floating particles together.

3. Sedimentation basin. In the sedimentation basin the water is gently agitated to help the sediment gather in flocs or clumps of larger particles. Flocs are given two to four hours to settle and form a sludge bed.

4. Filtration. Water from the sedimentation basin is sent to the filters which is a 3-feet layer of sand and anthracite to remove any remaining suspended fine particles and organic material. The disinfection process also starts here with the addition of chlorine.

5. Disinfection pH and corrosion inhibitor. At this stage (not pictured above) additional chemicals are added to the water to continue the disinfection process control the pH and minimize the corrosion of lines in the distribution system. The disinfection process is critical to kill pathogens making the water safe for your family to drink.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2NvbG9yYWRvL25ld3Mvd2F0ZXItdXRhaC1jb2xvcmFkby1hYXJvbi1taWxsaW9uL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9jb2xvcmFkby9uZXdzL3dhdGVyLXV0YWgtY29sb3JhZG8tYWFyb24tbWlsbGlvbi8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pipeline Dream: Ambitious Proposal To Bring Utah Water To Colorado,"(CBS4) -- A Fort Collins man is pressing forward with a proposed 325-mile-long pipeline which would transfer water from northeastern Utah into the northern part of Colorado's Front Range. It could cost Aaron Million a billion and a half dollars to build.

He claims to have sufficient support from private investors to make his pipeline dream a reality.

""The reality is Colorado needs an alternative water supply"" Million said.

Nine years in state and federal regulatory authorities have refused to give him clearance.

The latest setback came in November when the state of Utah rejected the idea again. A spokesperson for the Utah State Engineer who refused to give the project approval said the state office is waiting for Million's next move.

Million acknowledges that might be through attorneys and courts.

""The project's on track. This is just a process. We're moving forward on a variety of fronts.""

Aaron Million (credit: Water Horse Resources)

It's a process that started in the basement of the Colorado State University Library when the now-60 year old was studying for his Resource Economics degree. He found a 1913 map showing usable grades stretching from the Green River near Flaming Gorge Reservoir north into Wyoming and then parallel to Interstate 80 extending into the Cheyenne area. By the time he found the map most of that route was already established with pipeline delivering natural gas.

His idea was to use lay new pipe over the existing natural gas lines thereby taking advantage of earlier permitting.

""We've been able to stand on the shoulders of previous work"" Million said.

The rest of the concept: Pumps solar- and wind-powered as well as natural gas self-reciprocating engines would push water uphill to Rock Springs. From there electric power would be generated by in-line turbines as the water travels downhill.

A brand new section of pipeline from Cheyenne would bring the new water to an as-yet unestablished reservoir located somewhere north of Fort Collins preferably close to the Rawhide power plant where the newly-generated electricity could be plugged straight into the power plant's transmission lines and distribution system.

Another branch of pipeline is tentatively planned to descend the Dale Creek drainage from Wyoming and dump more flow into the upper stretches of the Poudre River. That's an area that sorely needs it said Million who claims to be an avid fisherman and kayaker. More than half the year the Poudre lacks any flow at all.

""There's not enough to fill a beer can"" in the river in January he said. His project would change that. ""This will be a completely secure underground system that will be able to deliver 365 days a year. This will be a completely closed system.""

(credit: Water Horse Resources)

Million made the concept the subject of his master's thesis in college and he hasn't given up on the idea since. Work on it began in earnest in 2012. It's now called the Water Horse Project.

""No one has ever questioned the ability of water to move from Wyoming to Colorado from Utah to Wyoming from Utah to Colorado"" Million told CBS4 citing legal precedent. ""The right to move water from one upper basin state to another is absolute.""

Current water providers aren't so sure and are skeptical the project will ever pass the federal government's guidelines.

""I can't imagine how they're going to this through Wyoming and Utah"" said Rep. Jeni Arndt (D-D53) Chair of the state legislature's Agriculture Livestock & Water Committee. ""I don't know how they're realistically going to get that done.""

She also questioned whether Utah will decide to part with its own water knowing it would benefit Colorado citizens.

The Green River in Utah. (credit: Bureau of Land Management)

Million who grew up on a ranch in Green River Utah and who knows the usage demands placed on the Colorado River (which the Green eventually flows into) said the numbers are on his side. His project aims to pull 55000 acre/feet of water annually from the Green River which has a total flow of 4.2 million acre/feet.

""This is one-half of one percent of the river"" Million said. ""This Green is a giant river with very little consumption use very little compared to the Colorado. The Green has none of that. It's very flexible.""

(credit: Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce)

Million points out that the headwaters of the Green River originate near Jackson Hole Wyoming. By adding runoff from those mountains to the Front Range supply Colorado increases the ""diversification of its water portfolio"" he said.

""This helps differentiate our entire water supply. If you have one savings account and it gets depleted you're S-O-L. But if you have also have a 401k...""

With that Arndt agrees.

""I can see why people are trying to get more water here"" she said noting 80% of the state's water supply is on the Western Slope where only 20% of the population resides. ""Aaron's talking about getting more of the resource.""

She adds it's not that simple. Learning to reduce consumption has to be part of the long-term plan too.

""We have a mismatch between the growing population and the supply. We need to conserve. We need to change how we live. We can't continue to have everything we have now.""

Municipal water managers have the same worries.

""The City of Greeley is growing. We're projected to double in population by 2050"" said Adam Jokerst Deputy Director of Water Resources for the City of Greeley.

In an unusual move Greeley's City Council is expected to approve in March the purchase of underground storage.

The Terry Ranch project will house a new supply of water under 10000 acres of grassland near Carr Colorado. Engineers have determined a natural aquifer exists there - one not currently supplied by any natural stream river or lake but which promises to retain the same amount of water that would exist in a surface lake.

It will hold an estimated 1.2 million acre-feet of water - 48 times more than what the City of Greeley currently uses annually.

""It's really the capstone project for Greeley"" Jokerst said. ""It takes the place of a large surface reservoir that had a lot of environmental impacts. So we're really excited about that.""

Jeff Stahla (credit: Zoom)

The Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District which manages the water supply for six municipalities is working on two new reservoirs.

The first Chimney Hollow Reservoir will link up with nearby Carter Lake west of Loveland.

The second more complex and controversial project is the Northern Integrated Supply Project (NISP). It involves two new reservoirs (Glade and Galeton) drawing from the Poudre and South Platte rivers several pumping stations and miles of new pipeline.

""Many people move here from areas where water is a problem to be gotten rid of rather than water is a problem that you don't have enough of"" said NCWCD spokesman Jeff Stahla. ""It's a reminder to those of us who might be newcomers to the state of Colorado that water's precious here. It reminds us that we live in a semi-arid portion of the country. We have enough of it to give us good beer and good agriculture to live in great cities and have great farms but we don't have any to waste.""

Both agencies eye Aaron Million's concept with caution.

""Greeley's not opposed to the project"" Greeley's Jokerst said.

""Our organization is dedicated to the projects we have in front of us"" Northern Colorado's Stahla followed. ""For others who are looking to fill some of the water supply gaps that might occur later this century...we're neutral on those sorts of things.""

RELATED: Historic Colorado Wildfire Season Could Impact Drinking Water For Millions

That's not exactly a ""welcome to the neighborhood.""

There's a reason.

The most significant impact of the Water Horse Project should it be approved may come from the uninvited collision of ideals. Specifically the principles of the past and the necessities of the future.

For the first time in our state's modern history public resource might mix with private investment in the water world.

Previously they've mixed as well as oil and water.

(credit: Facebook/Ft Collins Police Services)

Colorado water law declared water a public resource in the 1860s as the State Constitution was being formed. Water rights were - and still are - granted to those who could prove their immediate use of it.

Water rights do not work like land ownership for example. A water right cannot be purchased and held unused for appreciating value over time.

That activity is referred to by the water industry as ""speculation"" and for a century and a half such profit-centered pursuits have been excluded from the development of the water supply.

RELATED: Construction Begins On Pipeline To Deliver Water To 40 Colorado Communities

Private development ""must be balanced with the public interest"" Jokerst said. ""Water is the property of the state and of the citizens of the state. A water right just gives somebody the right to use it. I think it's very dangerous to allow too much speculation in water.""

Doing so would increase prices that without privatization have already increased six-fold in the last decade.

""Early on"" Stahla added ""the folks who developed the Colorado constitution and Colorado water law recognized that if you turn water into a straight economic commodity that it really could do damage - that is unintended - to other industries like agriculture and to the tourism industry and to mining.""

A study enacted last year by the state legislature reaffirmed that stance. In fact the study group asked for suggestions to strengthen it.

Million argued any privatization would actually bring the water business back closer to where it began.

""The private sector initiated the water development in this state"" he said. ""It's a public good like a hospital but it's held privately.""

Both sides agree northern Colorado needs more water in the future. But changes to the current system may not happen soon.

""Knowing it's taken us 20 years to get a permit to build Glade Reservoir in Larimer County building a reservoir is a complex task"" Stahla said. ""We've been working really hard to get a reservoir built and we're getting really close. I'd say 'Godspeed' to anyone trying to get another reservoir built in northern Colorado.""

Rep. Arndt agreed calling Million's Water Horse Project a 20-year effort as well.

In that time the Front Range communities will need to decide if it matters where the additional supply comes from and whether a public agency or a corporation provides it she said.

Values may change over time and under pressure.

""We will need to have a community conversation - which is a nice way of saying 'a political fight' about how we change"" Arndt said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmotc3Vlcy1mZWRlcmFsLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtc2F5aW5nLWZvcmV2ZXItY2hlbWljYWxzLWF0LW1pbGl0YXJ5LWJhc2VzLXBvbGx1dGVkLWRyaW5raW5nLXdhdGVyL9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmotc3Vlcy1mZWRlcmFsLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtc2F5aW5nLWZvcmV2ZXItY2hlbWljYWxzLWF0LW1pbGl0YXJ5LWJhc2VzLXBvbGx1dGVkLWRyaW5raW5nLXdhdGVyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NJ sues federal government saying ‘forever chemicals’ at military bases polluted drinking water,"Lax regulation until recently

The action is the latest attempt to curb PFAS in New Jersey which has some the nation’s highest concentrations of the chemicals because of its long industrial heritage and until recently lax regulation. In the last five years the state has set some of the nation’s strictest health standards for PFOS PFOA and a related chemical PFNA (perfluornonanoic acid).

In November last year the state sued Solvay Specialty Polymers a Gloucester County chemical company for allegedly polluting local groundwater with PFNA. In 2019 it issued a directive to that company and four others that it said had contaminated water supplies for years and done little to clean them up.

The latest suit was filed in federal court in South Carolina where related actions are being consolidated. It says the federal government has violated federal and state laws on safe drinking water and asks the court to order the government to investigate and pay for the cleanup of the PFAS contamination in and around its New Jersey facilities. It also asks the court to order the federal government to pay for the medical monitoring of people in affected areas.

PFAS chemicals are linked to serious medical conditions including some cancers immune-system impairments ulcerative colitis and elevated cholesterol.

PFAS originally used in heat-resistant consumer products such as Teflon and Scotchgard have been dubbed forever chemicals because they don’t break down in the environment and accumulate in the body. Scientists say the chemicals can be found in the body of virtually every American.

Protecting health of ‘military and civilian families’

“With today’s lawsuit we are inviting the federal government to finally take the risks posed by PFAS chemicals as seriously as New Jersey does and to take appropriate steps to protect the health of military and civilian families who live near our military bases” said Attorney General Gurbir Grewal in a statement Thursday.

The action was taken jointly with the Department of Environmental Protection whose soon-to-retire commissioner Catherine McCabe said the federal government must “do the right thing” by investigating and remediating the chemicals on military bases.

Neither the Department of Defense nor officials representing New Jersey’s joint base immediately responded to a request for comment on the suit. In 2016 the DOD issued a directive to stop using the foam for training testing and maintenance and said that if it needed to use the foam for saving lives the affected soil would be treated and removed.

The suit was welcomed by the Environmental Working Group a national advocate that has pressed the federal government to set strict standards for the chemicals in drinking water.

Military ‘understood the risks’

“For decades the military understood the risks from PFAS in firefighting foam but failed to warn service members or take action to restrict discharges into the environment” said Melanie Benesh an attorney for the Environmental Working Group. “As a result DOD is responsible for contaminating hundreds of communities and exposing countless services members their families and members of nearby communities to PFAS. State lawsuits are an important mechanism for holding DOD accountable for these harms.”

New Jersey’s suit follows another by the State of New Mexico which sued the U.S. Air Force in March last year to stop using Aqueous Film-Forming Foam.

Tracy Carluccio a longtime campaigner for stricter state and national PFAS standards welcomed the suit as a “bold and righteous” legal action.

“New Jersey is rightly insisting the federal government address the groundwater and drinking water pollution they have caused at federal facilities in the state to protect the public from exposure and to force the cleanup of the sources of contamination” said Carluccio deputy director of the environmental group Delaware Riverkeeper Network."

Sunday January 17th 2021 15:37 | By Oliver Musembi

Members of Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET) Kiambu county elect their union leaders during an annual general meeting in Ruiru.

Teachers are putting pressure on the government to effect a favourable insurance cover and a medical policy.

Over 5000 tutors from secondary and tertiary institutions in Kiambu County say they got a raw deal from the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) which 'pushed down their throats' an insurer whose terms have been unfavourable to them.

Speaking during an annual general meeting of Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET) members from the County in Ruiru their representatives asked the union to intensify the fight for better medical insurance terms.

KUPPET national assistant treasurer Ronald Tanui who presided over the meeting said the union is in talks with government officials to resolve the matter.

Teachers have been up in arms over services offered by AON-Minet Insurance company which was contracted by their employer to provide a medical scheme which they claim is wanting.

The Senate initiated a probe last year following a statement by nominated Senator Rose Nyamunga highlighting the difficulties and frustrations teachers underwent through the insurance scheme while seeking medical treatment with many of them being unable to access the service.

Senators raised concern over sub standard services by AON-Minet noting there were no commensurate services to the monies remitted to the insurer by TSC.

TSC is set to remit Sh 14 billion through the medical insurance cover this year even though teachers have had issues with its effectiveness.

During the meeting new union officials were re-elected to office led by the chair person Rose Kiiru and new county executive secretary Moses Thogo.

Most of the office bearers were unopposed except for the position of executive secretary in which Thogo beat his only opponent John Mbugua with 848 votes against 252.

Others re-elected treasurer Irene Githua vice-chairman Lawrence Mwaura assistant executive secretary Pauline Waceke and organizing secretary Joseph Macharia.

There was some drama when police arrested and briefly detained an intruder who entered the venue masquerading as a teacher.

Ms Kiiru vowed to push for better terms for members of the county and pledged to bring harmony between the union and relevant government departments.",,,,,,,,,

Apple senior executives are measured on key financial goals when it comes to being awarded among the market's most lucrative pay packages such as sales earnings and valuation growth. Now for the first time executives at the stock market's largest company are also going to have a portion of their millions in cash bonus pay linked directly to factors reflecting a fast-changing world of capitalism: environmental social and governance (ESG) metrics. In 2021 Apple is adding an ESG ""bonus modifier"" to its cash incentive program which can swing the total bonus payout by 10% — executing on ESG goals can increase the bonus by 10% while failing to hit ESG targets could cost Apple's top brass a bonus reduction of the same amount. The new executive compensation measure revealed in Apple 's recent 2021 proxy — shareholders have to approve executive compensation plans each year — comes after years of pressure from activist shareholders. In fact just last year Apple opposed a proxy measure filed by shareholder Zevin Asset Management — which received 12% support from the company's stockholders — that asked for executive compensation to be linked to ESG. Apple argued to shareholders there was no need to narrowly link pay to ESG since its corporate mission already included ESG goals foundationally. What changed in one year? A lot. For starters activist shareholders say it is common practice among corporations to resist any resolution introduced at annual meetings even in cases where the companies are moving in a similar direction — if at a slower pace — and when they are ready will do an about-face. ""The general posture with companies toward proposals is oppose in every instance"" said Pat Tomaino director of socially responsible investing at Zevin Asset Management which authored the ESG compensation proposal last year. The Apple shareholder said that this posture is even more likely to be the case when the issue is executive pay. ""Companies desire to have a free hand with executive compensation and we see it across the marketplace. The relationship between the compensation committee and the CEO is guarded very closely."" To its credit Tomaino said Apple reached out to him after his measure's defeat at the 2020 meeting and provided him with an indication that change was coming. He said throughout the process Apple was eager to understand what the shareholder was asking. ""I don't think of shareholder resolutions as adversarial. They wanted to understand what we wanted and i never doubted they were going in good faith to compensation consultants to study and understand whether it made sense. They could have chosen to do nothing.""

2020 accelerated corporate pressure

The past year was no ordinary year either. After a 2020 that included civil unrest in the U.S. the Black Lives matter movement and a pandemic that showed the financial fragility and health risks across many communities and workers there is more pressure on companies to focus on ESG themes such as diversity equity and inclusion and labor policy. ""For better or worse this year the world is a lot different than it was last proxy season"" said Jannice Koors senior managing director at Pearl Meyer an executive compensation consultant. ""Diversity equity and inclusion is taking up a lot more bandwidth in boardrooms."" Apple declined to comment to CNBC beyond citing the proxy language. ""It will enter into the discussion more"" said Courtney Yu head of research for executive compensation consulting firm Equilar. ""What happened over the course of the past year and summer has helped supercharge lots of these processes and put direct focus on how companies are looking at diversity ... and just their contribution to society in general."" An analysis by JUST Capital which ranks corporations on ESG (Apple is No. 3 overall behind tech peers Microsoft and Nvidia ) found that in recent years among the Russell 1000 universe of companies about 20% have linked executive pay to ESG goals. That is consistent with other surveys showing between 10% and 20% of companies have some executive pay tied to ESG key performance indicators. Most are of the magnitude of the new Apple 10% swing factor in bonus pay according to a Pearl Meyer survey from last summer. Roughly 25% of the firms that said they have an ESG pay component indicated it was less than 5%; 67% indicated it was 5% to 10%.

Old ESG versus emerging ESG

Executive compensation and ESG experts say the data on companies that have incorporated ESG into pay can be misleading though and overstate the trend's influence when the details are not considered. A significant percentage of the existing ESG compensation plans are in industries where they have been mandated for a long time due to safety concerns such as in oil drilling mining and other industrial operations where the risk of an accident is an immediate material and legal risk to the company. Or as Koors put it ""Old ESG versus emerging ESG. Emerging ESG is different."" If 15% of S&P 500 companies have incentive plans with an ESG component that includes many with the ""old"" ESG according to Gregg Passin senior partner and Mercer's U.S. executive solutions Leader. ""It will be much bigger this year and in future years"" he said. A small number of companies included diversity equity and inclusion as a metric in prior years. ""We expect many more this year"" he added. The majority of companies that have an ESG pay metric use a bonus modifier like Apple. It allows companies to still rely on core financial metrics such as sales and profit as the most influential payout measures while bringing in newer metrics — which also may be harder to measure — on the edges. ""Is it enough? Ten percent of a bonus doesn't strike me as being a massive swing factor"" said Martin Whittaker CEO of JUST Capital. Apple's top executives received bonuses in 2020 that were 179% of the target payout opportunity according to its proxy. ""It's laudable it is in there at all and it puts Apple in a minority. That's leadership. ... If we only have 20% of companies tying compensation to ESG that tells you there is lots of room for intelligent incentive packages that will drive performance even better"" Whittaker said. Using a modifier takes the pressure off in the goal-setting process and reflects the imprecision that still exists in ESG. ""Companies can't just dive into the deep end of the pool right off the bat"" Koors said (her firm does not work with Apple specifically). ""The question for them is 'How do we start to introduce these measures in a way where we don't end up regretting it. You don't necessarily want to be the first one out. You can tell the pioneers by the ones that have arrows in their backs. But lots want to be a fast follower."" Pearl Meyer expects more companies will be adopting ESG metrics in incentive plans — in its summer survey the number of companies that said they were looking at adding an ESG pay metric this year (9%) more than doubled over those that said they already had one (6%). ""Given the data we've seen this is still the early adopter phase"" Koors said.

Sometimes getting started is the hardest thing. We expect to see a lot more shareholder pressure on executive compensation. Martin Whittaker JUST Capital CEO

Which ESG metrics and how many to incorporate remains a challenging question. ""That everything is important should be signalled but on the flip side if everything is important than nothing is important"" Koors said. Mercer's Passin recommends no more than a handful of executive compensation metrics in total and only one or two tied to ESG though companies can have multiple factors considered within each category. ""What are we measuring? That's the bigger problem"" says Whittaker. Climate is an area in which metrics are maturing such as reductions in carbon emissions across multiple well-defined scopes of emissions types. But not all ESG metrics are as easy to define. ""The issue is there has been no generally accepted standard set of ESG metrics"" Whittaker said. In the Equilar 500 roughly 20% of the companies tie compensation to some kind of diversity metric ""and even there it is very broad"" Yu said. There are quantitative measurements for gender pay gap or ethnic pay gap analysis but there is no ""monolithic approach"" says Koors. The issues should not deter companies from thinking about senior executive incentive plans though because they drive behavior and performance throughout an organization. ""You need everyone in the boat all rowing in the same direction and the more companies that make a plan like this it can cascade down through the entire management.""

watch now

""It's typically the first step companies take the bonus modifier"" Tomaino said. ""Companies typically do not reorient a whole portion of equity incentive around ESG but take an existing part of the cash bonus plan."" Even in taking its first step Tomaino said Apple has done more than other companies that insert basic language into a proxy saying it is at the discretion of the company's compensation committee to set targets for pay and that could include ESG performance. Apple's move is better than a blanket statement but ""it gives them a ton of wiggle room"" Whittaker said. ""Sometimes getting started is the hardest thing. We expect to see a lot more shareholder pressure on executive compensation."" More shareholder measures are coming soon and targeting Apple peers among the market's dominant tech firms. Tomaino said Zevin Asset Management will again introduce a measure at Alphabet for this year's meeting. ""Impact investors can now point to Apple and I think it is a powerful example"" Tomaino said. ""Our argument is there is no better way to send a signal that it is mission critical than putting a portion of executive compensation at risk. I wouldn't say Apple went from zero to 60. Apple went from zero to 30."" Microsoft  Intel and IBM already have a compensation plan in place that accomplishes something similar to Apple's new incentive. An Alphabet spokeswoman told CNBC in an email that in ""assessing the individual performance of our executive officers the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee considers their performance against a number of strategic goals including those related to sustainability and diversity."" Tomaino described Alphabet 's approach to similar resolutions introduced over the past three years as ""less transparent"" than Apple. ""It is harder to tell if they are considering a change and their contention to us is that within each executive performance review there are certain basic sustainability issues on the table. Our contention is we want ESG aimed at senior officers and need more on what the mechanism is. And we have not been able to understand it over the past three years"" Tomaino said.

What we will find out about Apple in 2022

For Apple the proof that the ESG metric matters won't come until next year. That is because companies do not actually detail their compensation awards and how they arrived at those awards until the following year's proxy. ""We have to wait and see how serious they are about using this tool now that they have it"" Tomaino said. Investors will be looking at the discussion in next year's compensation section of the Apple proxy and how executive payouts moved up or down in respect to ESG. ""That's what we get with any other financial and we are already pushing on Apple to outline what investors would want to see."" ""No one telegraphs this in advance"" Koors said. Apple has increased transparency on climate and raw materials relative to conservation and investors want to see that metric-approach in supply chain risks and with diversity and inclusion. As examples that can include recruiting at historically Black colleges and universities and employee participation in affinity groups. ""The labor issues in their supply chain are a big issue as is progress on diversity in engineering"" Tomaino said. ""Tim Cook has described these issues as mission critical and ESG is financially relevant right now and into the long term. It is time for Apple to put their money where their mouth is ... a warts and all analysis. My message is consistent to companies: as an investor I don't want to substitute my judgment for their own or micromanage. They tell me which are the most relevant factors for them and how to get there.""

Touch ID might appear in 2021 alongside Face ID not in place of it.

Also Apple reportedly has a folding screen in the prototype stage.

The return of Touch ID to iPhone

Cupertino is testing an in-screen fingerprint scanner according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. It might be used in the iOS handset coming this autumn.

Touch ID was a highlight of iPhone for years back when the fingerprint-recognition system was embedded into the Home button. But Apple dropped that button in the iPhone X going with Face ID instead. Unfortunately facial recognition is less convenient when people regularly wear face masks.

However Gurman says Face ID isn’t going anywhere. Touch ID would be an additional option. Apple argues that its system for recognizing faces is far more accurate than a fingerprint scanner.

Also Apple is still only testing the hardware. Previous unconfirmed reports indicate Cupertino has been investigating an in-screen fingerprint scanner since at least 2019. And it hasn’t happened yet.

Other than this possible change the 2021 iPhone supposedly will offer only a few tweaks over its immediate predecessor. Even Apple engineers are reportedly calling it an “S” upgrade. This harks back to the years when the company regularly followed big redesigns with minor updates and an “S” added to the iPhone model’s name.

Apple working on a folding iPhone

Bloomberg also provides an update on the possibility of a folding iPhone. “Apple Inc. has begun early work on an iPhone with a foldable screen” reports Gurman. The goal is to fit a larger display into a smaller device. But this won’t happen for years.

Gurman built a solid reputation for correctly predicting Apple’s future moves so this serves as possible confirmation that a folding iPhone is in preliminary development. But there’s been plenty of earlier evidence. Company engineers keep filing for patents related related to flexible handsets. Just in 2020 there was work on a “self-healing” display new hinge designs and bendable batteries.

Recently an unconfirmed report indicated Apple is testing two different folding iPhone designs in Asia. But the Bloomberg reporter says that’s not true — the company hasn’t gone beyond a flexible display.

Gurman has an 89.1% accuracy ranking on AppleTrack which rates tipsters on how well they predict Apple’s future actions. That gives him one of the best records. But keep in mind that he’s saying Apple is testing a new iPhone with Touch ID and prototyping a bendable display — not that these products are definitely going to be released.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2FwcGxlLXdvcmtpbmctb24tZm9sZGFibGUtaXBob25lLXRvLXJpdmFsLXNhbXN1bmctZGVzaWducy1wcm90b3R5cGUtc2NyZWVuLTEyMTAxMTYwMDEyOV8xLmh0bWzSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYXBwbGUtd29ya2luZy1vbi1mb2xkYWJsZS1pcGhvbmUtdG8tcml2YWwtc2Ftc3VuZy1kZXNpZ25zLXByb3RvdHlwZS1zY3JlZW4tMTIxMDExNjAwMTI5XzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple working on foldable iPhone to rival Samsung designs prototype screen,"The foldable Apple screens in testing like those from Samsung have a mostly invisible hinge with the electronics stationed behind the display.

The Cupertino California-based company has developed prototype foldable screens for internal testing but hasn’t solidified plans to actually launch a foldable iPhone. The development work hasn’t expanded beyond a display meaning Apple doesn’t yet have full handset prototypes in its labs according to a person familiar with the work who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.

The Perfect Fifth

The Perfect Fifth

Miami Beach Florida Jan. 16 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Despite COVID-19 complicating the accessibility of alcohol at restaurants and local retailers the spirits industry has actually shown an increase in demand since March 2020.

The International Wines and Spirits Record (IWSR) recently announced that “premium-and-above spirits are forecasted to increase their global volume market share to 13% by 2024 as consumers continue to favor quality over quantity.”



For premium-spirit businesses owners like Karl J. Schoen’s this news shines a much-needed light on a frighteningly somber situation.



Schoen is the founder and president of The Perfect Fifth: an award-winning Miami-based independent bottling company specializing in bottling single-malt scotch whisky. His company is recognized for selecting and bottling the most uniquely tasting high-quality single-malt scotch from the finest distilleries in Scotland.



While bigger branded whisky companies are known to push out thousands of bottles from their virtually unlimited blended casks Schoen’s company concentrates on having its bottles hold well-matured single-cask whisky with ABV ranging anywhere from 47-56%. The main difference between the branded bottlers however is distinguished in product rarity. Single-casks can only produce a certain quantity of bottles per barrel depending on its size. The bottles are then sold as an exclusive limited item that cannot be replicated or remade once the barrel is used up and the bottles are distributed.



In circumstances of a pandemic Karl’s company is lucky to remain largely unaffected. Due to his company working solely off of their existing resources rather than basing off demand they have been able to continue conducting business regularly.



Their production lines in Scotland however have indeed been affected as a result of the worldwide pandemic. Supply chains have severely backed up due to a high number of workers being furloughed. Karl admits that the company has had to readjust their timely-sensitive expectations in order to be more patient and work around the given unalterable conditions. But given the benefit of having a fairly new company with only five employees and plentiful resources he remains comfortable in the midst of an issue that could have been detrimental.



Nevertheless The Perfect Fifth will continue to carry on with their projected initiatives and will release five more bottles by the end of the year. Each bottle will contain their usual 750mL and prices will range from $800-3000. For more information visit ThePerfectFifth.com or follow them on Instagram at @perfectfifthspirits.

The streaming service predicts it will have between 230 million and 260 million global subscribers by 2024 when it will be five years old.

The platform’s surge owes in part to an immense content library bolstered by the high-profile acquisition two years ago of 21st Century Fox which brought aboard franchises like “X-Men” and “Deadpool” as well as old favorites like “Home Alone” and “Night at the Museum.” (The agreement also gave Disney 60% ownership of Hulu.)

Billionaire media investor Haim Saban told Yahoo Finance that the $71 billion deal between Disney and Fox “stumped” him at the time because it deviated from the longtime strategy of holding onto assets favored by Rupert Murdoch executive chairman of Fox parent company News Corp.

But Saban said he understood the thinking behind Murdoch’s side of the deal explaining that Murdoch believed he could not achieve the scale necessary to compete with other media behemoths and instead opted to “play the Disney card.”

“Rupert doesn't sell anything. He doesn't like to sell absolutely anything” says Saban who partnered with Murdoch in the 1990s on the launch of “Fox Family Channel” which later sold to Disney in 2001.

“He realized it's a matter of too big to be small and too small to be big so he really needed to make a move” Saban adds. “He realized you need more scale both at the content and as well as the distribution level.”

Saban said Murdoch first tried to acquire other entities that would help Fox amass enough scale to compete.

“When he identified the fact that there wasn't much for him to buy” Saban says. “And [Disney CEO] Bob Iger came to him with this offer he said ‘Well okay I'll go the other way I'll play the Disney card.’”

After the sale of 21st Century Fox Murdoch retained ownership of Fox Sports the Fox TV network and Fox News the latter of which set cable news viewership records last year. The channel drew heightened scrutiny for its friendly coverage of President Donald Trump over recent days in the aftermath of the siege of the Capitol.

Saban spoke to Serwer in an episode of “Influencers with Andy Serwer” a weekly interview series with leaders in business politics and entertainment.

Known for his entertainment industry savvy Saban rose to prominence in the 1990s with the creation of “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” which led to a joint production venture with News Corp. called the Fox Family Channel that later sold to Disney (DIS). Currently Saban serves as chairman and CEO of the private investment firm Saban Capital Group which specializes in media and entertainment.

Speaking with Yahoo Finance Saban offered unequivocal praise for the another recent media merger: between AT&T and Time Warner which overcame a prolonged legal challenge from the Trump administration in 2019. He highlighted the content acquired by AT&T and praised Jason Kilar who last April became the head of the company’s entertainment and news.

“Jason Kilar is a guy with a vision to run it and I think that they're doing some very interesting things” Saban says. “I think they're going to come out really well with the [Time] Warner acquisition in my humble opinion.”

Buying solar energy stocks is not always as straightforward as it should be. With so many choices investors are really confused and they want to catch up with growing investor interest and sky-high stock returns. Now we take a closer look at the solar energy sector and stocks.

Investing in Renewable Energy has never been so important. As society faces climate change and its consequences businesses have to put a lot of effort in to meet compliance requirements. One way is doing this is by increasing the usage of renewable resources to meet the energy demand. Besides governments support renewable energy generation to reach their net-zero emission targets. As a result companies are taking advantage of this interest and the number of renewable energy companies is skyrocketing. Not only does the sector focus on PV systems but also solar thermal applications besides manufacturing components installation and operating services.

There is no doubt that Biden’s administration will support the renewable energy sector as he announced ‘9 Key Elements for a Clean Energy Revolution’. The hearth of the plan and probably the most exciting part is that putting America on a path to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050. Furthermore the USA will likely spend $400 billion over ten years on clean energy and innovation in accordance with his statement. Precisely solar energy is going to be very much part of this policy.

According to International Energy Agency (IEA) ""power generation from solar PV is estimated to have increased by 22% in 2019 to 720 TWh. With this increase the solar PV share in global electricity generation is now almost 3%"". IEA is also expecting that Solar PV electricity generation capacity will go up by 19.2% in 2022. Furthermore Solar PV will account for 55% of total renewable electricity production in the same period. According to IEA 'Average annual solar PV capacity additions during 2023‑25 are expected to range from 130 GW in the main case to 165 GW in the accelerated case accounting for almost 60% of total renewable energy expansion.’

With all the positive reviews and news it sounds like a good idea to invest in solar energy stocks that are prioritizing cash generation and have healthy balance sheets. The finance sector has already tailored itself to the new solar revolution through ETFs. Consequently energy ETFs captured the attention of investors. In order to come up with the 10 best solar energy stocks to buy now we identify the publicly traded solar energy stocks that are in Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) and ranked them using Insider Monkey's hedge fund sentiment data.

Baptisé «Petites villes de demain » et développé par l'Agence nationale de la cohésion des territoires il vise à soutenir les villes de moins de 20 000 habitants dans la réalisation de leurs différents projets de territoire.

Une aide financière mais aussi technique

Le dispositif vise à améliorer les conditions de vie des habitants de ces petites communes et de leur périphérie en donnant aux élus des villes et de leurs intercommunalités les moyens techniques ou financiers de concrétiser leurs divers projets en s’appuyant sur 3 axes : le soutien en ingénierie des financements sur mesure et enfin l’accès à un réseau d’entraide grâce au « Club des Petites Villes de demain"".

Pour ce faire trois milliards d’Euros ont été budgétés jusqu’en 2026 pour aider un millier de communes à travers toute la France dont 25 dans les Pyrénées Orientales.

Des villes réparties sur l'ensemble des territoires de notre département que ce soit sur le littoral et les plaines ( Banyuls Port-Vendres Saint-Laurent de la Salanque Rivesaltes Claira Pia Elne Millas Estagel Saint-Paul de Fenouillet Thuir Ille sur Têt) ou dans les montagnes et l'arrière-pays ( Bourg-Madame Osséja Saillagouse Font-Romeu les Angles Olette Prades Vinça Vernet-les-Bains Arles-sur-Tech Amélie-les-Bains le Boulou et Céret).

Accélérer le développement des petites communes

Port Vendres fait partie des 25 communes des Pyrénées Orientales retenue pour le programme ""Petites Villes de demain"". Une satisfaction pour son maire Grégory Marty qui espère ainsi donner un coup d'accélérateur aux projets municipaux:

"" Grâce à ce dispositif nous allons notamment pouvoir financer le recrutement d'un chef de projet qui va nous aider grandement à trouver les financements et à impulser les nombreux chantiers de rénovation urbaine ou de transition énergétique que nous comptons mener. C'est une structure qui est habituelle dans les grandes villes mais le budget contraint de plus petites communes comme la nôtre ne nous aurait pas permis cette embauche"".

Conçu comme une boîte à outils sur mesure ce dispositif ""Petites villes de demain"" est censé dynamiser les politiques d'aménagement du territoire dans de nombreux domaines: rénovation des friches urbaines et industrielles réhabilitation du patrimoine non classé création de circuits courts lutte contre le gaspillage rénovation énergétique amélioration de la mobilité... Chaque dossier sera étudié au cas par cas et pourra également bénéficier de partenariats avec d'autres aides de la Région ou du Département.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL2xhMWVyZS5mcmFuY2V0dmluZm8uZnIvbm91dmVsbGVjYWxlZG9uaWUvcHJvdmluY2Utc3VkL3lhdGUvZG9zc2llci11c2luZS1kdS1zdWQtYmxvY2FnZS1zdXItbGEtcm91dGUtZGUteWF0ZS1lbi1yZWFjdGlvbi1hLWRlcy1pbnRlcnBlbGxhdGlvbnMtOTEyMzU4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dossier usine du Sud : blocage sur la route de Yaté en réaction à des interpellations - Nouvelle-Calédonie la 1ère,"Alors que les opposants à la reprise de l'usine du Sud par Prony Resources et Trafigura sont rassemblés à Ponérihouen la route de Yaté a été un temps bloquée ce samedi à hauteur du carrefour de la Madeleine et du col de Mouirange. En guise de protestation après de nouvelles interpellations.

F.T. •

[MISE A JOUR AVEC LE PROCUREUR]



Dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi la gendarmerie a interpellé quatre personnes à hauteur de l'usine du Sud «au niveau du belvédère» précise ce soir le procureur de la République. Le motif ? «Il est reproché à ces personnes des faits de violence avec arme par projection de pierres sur les gendarmes mobiles assurant la sécurité du site ainsi que sur des salariés de l’usine au cours de la journée du vendredi 15 janvier».

Une personne toujours en garde à vue

«Il ressort des investigations diligentées à ce stade que des éléments à charge semblent réunis contre l’une des personnes interpellées justifiant la prolongation de sa garde à vue» développe Yves Dupas. «En revanche le Parquet a ordonné au cours de l’après-midi la remise en liberté des trois autres mis en cause en l’absence d’indices venant établir leur participation aux faits reprochés.»

Je tiens à rappeler que le ministère public a pour mission de contrôler les enquêtes et de traiter les procédures diligentées avec la plus grande objectivité dans le strict respect de la loi. - Yves Dupas procureur de la République

Blocages en réaction

Ce samedi matin la circulation sur la route de Yaté était à nouveau entravée par un point de blocage à hauteur du carrefour de la Madeleine mis en place autour de 8 heures. Seuls les véhicules de secours passaient selon le collectif «usine du Sud = usine pays». Blocage également sur la partie Mont-Dore de cette même route au col de Mouirange. La circulation a pu reprendre plus normalement à la mi-journée.

Protestation

Et il s'agissait bien de protester après ces interpellations comme dans le communiqué diffusé ce matin par l’Ican. Le document - qui évoque «neuf» interpellations - renvoie la justice aux «contre-barrages armés» précédemment mis en place.

Nous dénonçons encore plus que jamais que nous sommes les seuls à subir cette justice française à sens unique. - Instance coutumière autochtone de négociation

Rassemblement à Ponérihouen

Le bras de fer autour de la cession de l'usine du Sud va-t-il encore se durcir ? Un «rassemblement populaire» est organisé ce week-end à Ponérihouen dans la tribu de Grondu à l'initiative du FLNKS en partenariat avec «les forces politiques nationalistes associations le collectif ""usine du Sud = usine pays"" l'Ican et les collectifs communaux».

«Eviter les déplacements non urgents»

En attendant la municipalité du Mont-Dore évoquait cette question des barrages routiers dans un communiqué diffusé en fin de matinée. Le maire Eddie Lecourieux y invitait la population «à une vigilance accrue et à éviter les déplacements non urgents».

Réaction de l'ACM

Une situation observée avec attention par l'Association citoyen mondorien. L'ACM qui a réagi en demandant que «ce ""barrage"" soit levé dans les plus brefs délais».

Généralement les fonds collectés leur permettaient d’apporter des jeux et jouets aux enfants hospitalisés à Montauban. Mais crise sanitaire Covid-19 oblige ils ont dû modifier leur projet cette année et se tourner vers l’association Les Chats Libres de Caussade et du pays caussadais. Ainsi la cagnotte constituée leur a-t-elle permis de faire l’acquisition de trois caisses de transports et d’une litière à chats ainsi que d’un stock d’aliments sous forme de pâtés et de croquettes. La remise de cette collecte a eu lieu jeudi en fin d’après-midi au lycée en présence de la directrice de l’établissement Fabienne Morcillo qui mettait l’accent sur la conjonction des compétences l’établissement assurant une formation sur la vente en animalerie et l’association veillant au bien-être des animaux. Avec les enseignantes Sabrina Bernabeu et Marie Nieto formatrices et assistantes vétérinaires d’une part et la responsable de l’association Gaëlle Mateudi d’autre part deux projets sont à l’étude l’un pour la création d’un espace de dressage de chiens de compagnie l’autre pour la création d’un refuge pour chats sur un terrain situé à proximité du lycée un espace qui servirait de lieu de pratique pour les élèves. L’association Les chats libres envisagerait par la suite une extension avec un site LPO (ligue pour la protection des oiseaux). Reste à ficeler le dossier à lever les autorisations et à mobiliser l’ensemble des partenaires pour ce projet qui permettrait aux jeunes de mettre en pratique leur formation.

On Monday night the Metropolitan Museum of Art will play host to one of the biggest fund-raising events and starriest parties of the year: the annual Costume Institute Benefit or as it’s been known for years the Met Gala.

The event which raises millions of dollars for the museum’s self-funding fashion wing has become known for its audacious red carpet with a highly exclusive guest list handpicked by Anna Wintour the longtime Vogue editor and Condé Nast executive.

But this year’s event has been unusually shadowed by drama. The union representing employees of Condé Nast publications including Bon Appétit GQ Vanity Fair and Vogue escalated the stakes in its long-running contract negotiations on Saturday telling the company in a video posted on X that if management didn’t meet the union at the bargaining table its members would “meet you at the Met.”

Open Extended Reactions

CINCINNATI -- Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow marked a major offseason milestone on Monday.

As the team started the second phase of voluntary workouts Burrow was in uniform and throwing a pass in a video shared by the team.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday. But quarterbacks coach Brad Kragthorpe told the team's website he was pleased with how Burrow looked in his first practice back since suffering a season-ending wrist surgery last November.

""He looked like the Joe Burrow we're used to seeing"" Kragthorpe said. ""I didn't see any difference. I thought the ball came out of his hand well. Confidently. I'm happy where he's at.""

HE IS SO BACK. pic.twitter.com/ZsZjzkZEmg — Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) May 6 2024

On Nov. 27 Dr. Thomas Graham repaired the scapholunate ligament in Burrow's right wrist a source confirmed to ESPN following an initial report by the Cincinnati Enquirer. In March Burrow told ESPN that he expected to be fully cleared following his surgery. He noted that the timetable for his return if he remained on track was no different than other offseasons.

""In a normal offseason I wouldn't be throwing until OTAs really anyway"" Burrow said. ""I can lift basically normal now which I'm excited about.""

Burrow missed the final seven games of last season after he suffered the wrist injury in a Week 11 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. It capped an injury-riddled year that started with a strained right calf that he suffered during the first week of training camp in 2023 and re-aggravated in Week 2.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday as they started Phase 2 of their offseason program. During this three-week period coaches are allowed to work with players on the field and teams are allowed to run plays at a walk-through pace under certain conditions.

A 4-year-old boy and his parents got out of a car stuck in floodwaters to try for safe ground but a 911 caller said they were swept away.

Copied

It’s been a rough latter half of the week for the Lone Star State which has dealt with severe storms that brought hail dangerous flash flooding and tornadoes on May 2-3.

The body of a 4-year-old boy was found after flash floods ripped through a suburb of Fort Worth Texas on Sunday. Someone called Johnson County Sheriff's Office dispatchers around 2 a.m. and reported that a family of three was in a car stuck in high water in Burleson about 15 miles north of Fort Worth according to local news affiliate WFAA.

The boy and his parents got out of the car to try for safe ground but the 911 caller said they were swept into the floodwaters.

Rescuers found Aaron and Chelsey Warren later that morning and transported them to the hospital according to the Johnson County Office of Emergency Management. The body of Lucas Warren who would've turned 5 this month was found a few hours later.

Aaron Warren's brother created a GoFundMe on behalf of the Warrens saying ""The accident totaled their only car ruined their phones and swept away their wallets. They are in extreme need and anything y’all can contribute will be used to pay for Lucas’ funeral and help rebuild their lives. This is the hardest thing anyone in my family has ever been through.""

Severe storms unleashed torrential rainfall and caused flooding in southeastern Texas cities from College Station to Houston. After days of nonstop rain hundreds of water rescues occurred across southeast Texas over the weekend. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo told CNN that 153 pets have also been rescued during the deluge.

A police officer responded on a jet ski to a flooded trailer park in Houston. He rescued a man swimming in 10-feet deep waters as well as three dogs spotted while driving through.

Various videos posted to social media show people inadvertently driving into deep floodwaters and in some cases being swept away. Drone footage from Livingston Texas 70 miles northeast of Houston showed cars homes and roads underwater.

The Red Cross is on the ground in southeast Texas spokesperson Stephanie Fox told AccuWeather offering refuge for those who need a safe dry place to stay.

The driver drove through a flooded parking lot and directly into a creek hidden by the water becoming stranded and needing rescue in College Station Texas on May 2.

AccuWeather Flooding Expert Alex Sosnowski put the serious flooding into historical context: “The flooding occurring in parts of Southeast Texas is some of the most significant since Hurricane Harvey affected the region in 2017. This time it is focused over a smaller area and a bit farther to the north when compared to Harvey’s days of tropical rains that dropped upwards of 60 inches in some locations.""

At least one spot bested a record set more than a century ago. According to NOAA's National Water Prediction Service the Navasota River gauge near Easterly Texas set a new record high Thursday night of 30.62 feet beating the previous record of 29 feet set on June 1 1899.

Floods are the most common severe weather emergency in the United States. That’s why it’s important to know what to do if you find yourself driving in one.

The Harris County Sheriff's Office says that while many hazards remain the water is slowly receding for now. However AccuWeather meteorologists urge residents not to let their guard down. When adverse weather conditions last for days people can develop weather fatigue but taking every notification seriously is important. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive watches and warnings keep a close eye on conditions in your area and have a plan in place on where you'll go if floodwaters begin to rise.

AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said there is some good news for the flood-ravaged Texas as any concentrated thunderstorms will remain to the North. ""However there are two concerning timeframes for locally heavy rain"" he said. ""The first will be Thursday as cold slowly drops south. The second is late this weekend into early next week as a stronger front arrives from the northwest.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnBlcnNiYXphYXIuY29tL2NlbGVicml0eS9sYXRlc3QvYTYwNjYyNDY2L3plbmRheWEtcmVkLWNhcnBldC1waG90b3MtbWV0LWdhbGEtMjAyNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zendaya Brings the Drama in a Completely Unexpected Jewel-Toned Gown at the 2024 Met Gala,"She’s back!

After five long years Zendaya made her long-awaited return to the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art tonight—this time as a first-time co-chair for the annual Met Gala. To honor this year’s dress code “The Garden of Time” the superstar teamed up with her longtime stylist and close collaborator Law Roach to deliver an eternally stylish look that will go down in Met Gala fashion history.

The Challengers star opted for an incredible Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano creation based on a 1999 Dior dress. The one-shouldered gown featured a long trumpet skirt covered in royal-blue and emerald-green diagonal stripes as well as fruitlike embellishments adorning one side of the waist. She upped the ante with a net mesh and tulle-feathered fascinator.

The actor last attended the Met Gala in 2019 when she honored the year’s “Camp: Notes on Fashion” theme in a light-up ball gown designed by Tommy Hilfiger. The look took inspiration from the iconic dress worn by Cinderella in Disney’s animated 1950 film (and Roach even showed up alongside her dressed as Cinderella’s fairy godmother).

But Zendaya had been topping Met Gala best-dressed lists for years prior to that moment. Some of her other most memorable looks include a chainmail Versace gown that paid homage to Saint Joan of Arc a vibrant Dolce & Gabbana ball gown covered in a tropical floral-and-parrot print and a bodycon Michael Kors dress entirely bedazzled with reflective gold rhinestones.

“I like to look at fashion as creativity” Zendaya said in a recent interview on Live With Kelly and Mark. “Even in press tours it’s a way to continue the creativity from the film. I like to just create characters. … You get to embody this character for the day and clothes can do that for you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvamFtZXMtZ3Vubi1zaGFyZXMtZmlyc3QtbG9vay1hdC1kYXZpZC1jb3JlbnN3ZXRzLXN1cGVybWFu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Gunn Shares First Look at David Corenswet's Superman,"DC Studios co-CEO and Superman director James Gunn has shared the first full look at David Corenswet as the Man of Steel.

Revealed on Threads Gunn told fans to ""get ready"" for the July 11 2025 premiere date while fully revealing Corenswet's Superman. The image shows him sitting in what's presumably a Metropolis skyscraper very casually pulling up his boot while an earth shattering event takes places outside.

While this is a fresh new Superman from a fresh new DC Universe the suit itself doesn't appear particularly new as the sacred S symbol and its arms appear dirtied or faded. Though we'd already been shown the logo the new image reveals the rest of the suit and gives fans plenty more to analyze as they try to figure out Gunn's influences ahead of the film's release.

Superman previously Superman: Legacy will be the first film in the rebooted DCU's Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters but it's definitely not an origin story and also features a ton of other DC heroes and villains.

Alongside Corenswet's Superman stands Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane and the film also stars Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho María Gabriela as The Engineer and more. Gunn confirmed these actors will play the roles in other DCU projects too.

Chapter 1 of the DCU also features TV shows and while the exact contents have shuffled a tad since Gunn and co-CEO Peter Safran announced it in 2023 an animated series called Creature Commandos will officially kick off the new universe in late 2024.

A New Yorker Herbert Gentry (1919-2003) was at the center of the milieu. In 1949 he established Chez Honey a gallery-club in the Montparnasse area of Paris a popular gathering place that engendered many of his friendships and artistic connections. His circle included Beauford Delaney Romare Bearden Ed Clark Larry Rivers James Baldwin Richard Wright Eartha Kitt Orson Welles Duke Ellington Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.

The venue where art was displayed by day jazz flowed at night and American and European artists musicians and intellectuals gathered across racial lines inspired one of Gentry’s paintings. “Chez Honey” (1949) is on view at Ryan Lee Gallery in New York. He produced the moody-hued gestural abstraction the same year he started the club.

“Herbert Gentry: Paris and Beyond 1949-1978” at Ryan Lee presents paintings and drawings surveying Gentry’s European years across three decades. Bursting with expression and networks of calligraphic lines the improvisational works channel the spirit of jazz. The presence of faces and figures suggest the artist’s cultural fluidity and the spectrum of people in his orbit. The gallery is presenting works by Gentry for the first time in cooperation with the artist’s estate.

The works are channel the spirit of jazz bursting with expression and networks of improvisational lines. The presence of faces and figures suggest the artist’s cultural fluidity and the spectrum of people in his orbit.

Gentry was born in Pittsburgh Pa. His father was a printer and his mother was a dancer. When his parents separated he moved to New York City. Gentry grew up with his mother and stepfather in the Sugar Hill section of Harlem where they regularly hosted artists and musicians in their home. She had studied ballet and modern dance and worked as a chorus girl for a time dancing on the same line as Josephine Baker. His mother counted Baker Ellington Langston Hughes and Paul Robeson among her friends.

Gentry was in the U.S. Army when he first visited Paris in 1944. After he was discharged in 1945 he soon returned and studied at the Sorbonne and the Académie de la Grande Chaumière where he later taught. He opened Chez Honey with Honey Johnson a singer and painter who was the first of his three wives. In the late 1950s he ventured elsewhere in Europe establishing studios in Copenhagen Denmark and Stockholm Sweden. In 1969 he moved into the famous Chelsea Hotel splitting his between New York City and Stockholm for the rest of his career.

Gentry discussed his incredibly dynamic life during an oral history interview conducted in 1991 by the Smithsonian’s Archives of American Art. Reflecting on his childhood Gentry said: “I met almost everyone that was in Harlem during that period who was famous.” He said he encountered Bearden years later at his Paris club. Back in New York the artists became “close friends” Gentry said calling Bearden “a wonderful person.” He also spoke about his work.

“Well there’s a certain spontaneity that exists. I work with my my subconscious plays a great role I don’t calculate I’m not generalistic and the form plays the great role. The figures come into it the faces come into my work that I don’t calculate to be the types that appear but they are the types that I’ve met in my life” Gentry said.

“My base is African American also it’s in my paintings the people I’ve met throughout the world American African American but I’ve met people throughout the world who are my friends who actually I love and we’ve done things together so this appears in my work.” CT

ODESSA Texas — These days banks have made it easy for people to access their money whether it be through an app or online but there are people who still like to go to the bank itself. However lots of customers ran into a problem when the Bank of America on Grant Avenue in Odessa closed.

Customers claimed that they weren't notified of the bank's closure and had little to no communication from the bank for a couple weeks while it was closed.

It turns out that the bank closed because of COVID-19. This left customers with only a few options.

The first was to use the ATM at that location but several customers reported negative experiences with the ATM and left them with even more problems.

The second option was to go to a Bank of America location in Midland. This was another problem as some customers didn't have the means to travel from Odessa to Midland just to go to the bank.

This begs the question when will the Grant Avenue location open back up?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWNyYXNoLWJ1YmJsZS13YXJuaW5nLWluZGljYXRvcnMtaGFydG5ldHQtYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLTIwMjEtMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stock-Market Crash: BofA's Top Strategist Warns of Bubble Developing,"Investor sentiment has climbed from rock bottom in March to what is now approaching extremes on the other end of the spectrum — and it's starting to worry Bank of America's top strategist.

As investors react to the prospect of more robust fiscal stimulus interest rates remaining low and the Federal Reserve continuing to pledge its support they are rationalizing ""increasingly irrational price action on Wall St."" Michael Hartnett said in a January 7 note.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

His comments came as stocks hit record highs and the bank's latest ""Bull & Bear"" indicator showed sentiment had climbed on a 1-10 scale to 7.1 last week from 6.7 on December 17. The bank labels ratings above 8 as ""extreme bullish"" territory and advises investors to sell when the indicator reaches those levels. In March the indicator's reading was 0.

In the note Hartnett said he expected sentiment to keep rising over the next month or two and that ""peak positioning"" would be in February or March.

""We'll know if it's a bubble by end-Q1"" he said.

Hartnett said the most dangerous risk to the market's current valuations was rising 10-year Treasury yields which will eventually cause investors to step out of growth stocks.

He pinpointed six warning signs to watch out for that could signal interest rates pose a threat to riskier assets:

The iShares' iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) drops below $133 and/or banks start to lend more. The US dollar rises surprisingly if Europe and Asia experience weaker growth. The Chinese yuan and Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite fall with Chinese bond yields as a result of weaker growth. Inflation rises. Hartnett said food prices were at six-year highs and up 20% over the past eight months. Higher yields lead to losses in ""speculative favorites"" like Tesla and bitcoin. Popular low-rate plays like the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) and the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index (SOX) fall.

Hartnett also highlighted risks to a bubble in financial markets.

These include heightened wealth inequality and political and social polarization; the fact that the value of US financial assets is now six times the size of GDP; price action on initial public offerings and special-purpose acquisition companies growing ""increasingly speculative""; extreme wealth gains which have been a symptom of the end of recent bull markets; and investors ignoring rising rates.

Hartnett also seemed to express concerns about bitcoin's rally over recent weeks. He included a chart which can be seen below with the title: ""Bitcoin the mother-of-all-bubbles?"" He also included a flow chart also below showing the projected next step for bitcoin following the current speculative craze is a correction.

Hartnett among others

Hartnett isn't the only prominent strategist on Wall Street expressing concern about investor-sentiment levels.

Charles Schwab's chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders told Business Insider in December sentiment was getting ""frothy"" and that this would make a market sell-off more severe when it's eventually triggered.

More specifically she said investors should be worried about a deterioration in fundamentals if sentiment kept rising.

""Where you tend to get a bigger problem is if sentiment is really really elevated and then you start to see a brisk deterioration in the market but sentiment just stays optimistic"" Sonders said. ""That to some degree is what happened in the early part of 2000. You started to see some underlying deterioration in what was going on in the market but sentiment was like 'Nope doesn't matter. It's a new paradigm.'""

Several renowned bears like David Hunter Jeremy Grantham Albert Edwards and Mark Yusko have also warned of valuations reaching stretched levels in recent months.

Major Wall Street banks have also laid out the threats that could derail the stock market in 2021.

But while overall sentiment and valuations remain high — namely in megacap tech stocks — many see gains ahead in 2021.

State Senator Scott Wiener told us “I spoke with senior Bank of America folks yesterday about the incredible importance of this sacred site to our community. They have agreed to remove the signs. Previously the bank manager would take care of the area and store memorials that had been up for a while until someone could claim them. This branch has been closed for months however so there was no one to monitor the site and Bank of America was concerned after political and other signs were pasted to the building itself and covered the windows. However B of A immediately acknowledged the importance of the site to the community and agreed that it was of the utmost importance that people be able to post memorials on the small fence as usual. The bank branch will be putting up different signs eventually that will discourage people from posting things other than in that area which they are reserving for the community. We are working on activating community groups to take over the maintenance.”

Bank of America spokesperson Colleen Haggerty sent us the following statement: “After speaking with community members we realized the code enforcement signs created confusion and therefore we had them removed immediately. We absolutely understand the significance and importance of the space and will continue working with the community to ensure it remains a memorial as it has for decades.”

Meanwhile historian Gerard Koskovich added context to the importance of Hibernia Beach: “The angled corner of the building at the intersection of Castro and 18th streets has been a profoundly marked territory for expressions of shared queer public mourning since the darkest years of the AIDS crisis in the mid-1980s—well before Bank of America leased the space. Spontaneous folk memorials mounted in this location have commemorated the deaths of hundreds of members of the LGBTQ community as well as famous allies such as Princess Diana in 1997. They also have marked our participation in moments of national mourning including the death of Matthew Shepard in 1998 and the response to the attacks of Sept. 11 2001. The GLBT Historical Society has preserved the Matthew Shepard and Princess Diana memorials which can be accessed for research purposes.”

ORIGINAL STORY:

For decades at the southeast corner of Castro and 18th Street makeshift memorials have commemorated recently passed members of the LGBTQ community. The stretch of pavement a long-ago sunbathing and cruising spot known as Hibernia Beach after the adjacent Hibernia Bank branch now a Bank of America has served as a place to gather and grieve as photo montages and personal items of the deceased are displayed along the little fence bordering the bank. During the AIDS pandemic and horrific events like the Pulse Nightclub massacre and Ghost Ship fire these memorials provided solace and remembrance.

“That is our sacred ground soaked in the blood of our ancestors and family” former Assemblymember and Supervisor Tom Ammiano told us. “That was where we remember our dead especially in times when their own families refused to even acknowledge their existence. It is a place of profound importance to the community.”

That sacred ground appears under threat as new signs posted by Bank of America along the building warned “Please do not post or affix materials to the fence or building surface.” The signs cite San Francisco Police Code article 10 section 709 which prohibits posting signs on private property without the owner’s consent and states that violators can be “fined not less than $50 nor more than $500.” While a handful of memorials still stay up on the fence for now the possibility of future such shrines could be in doubt.

Anger and confusion quickly spread online at the news. The signs were posted with no warning to the community and seemed to many to ignore the magnitude of longtime cultural traditions. In an email to 48 Hills Bank of America spokesperson Colleen Haggertty wrote

As a longtime business located at this historic location we recognize the importance for people to honor this history and continue to temporarily preserve mementos placed onsite until regularly removing items for public safety and cleanliness needs.

In recent months the increased volume of items placed onsite in addition to being posted onto our walls and windows began to pose greater potential safety concerns. The signage recently placed is to help curtail safety risks for neighbors and visitors. We remain committed to the Castro and are working with community organizations to find a solution that continues to allow mementos honoring the LGBT historical significance of this location while maintaining safety and appearance especially once the newly renovated financial center reopens for business in March.

Supervisor Rafael Mandelman told 48 Hills that the move by Bank of America “absolutely” threatens sacred space. “It’s outrageous” he said. “We were given no warning of the signs going up. I spoke with the property manager and apparently there is a history of the bank being frustrated by maintenance burdens associated with the space. But this is not the solution to that problem.

“I told them the signs must come down” Mandelman said. “And we should find a different answer probably by bringing the Castro Community Benefits District the Castro Cultural District and the Castro Merchants together and finding away for them to take greater responsibility in the area’s maintenance. We remain in communication with the bank and are working towards that now.”

Current displays memorialize Patrick York Ron Flavin and Mary Elaine Botts an unhoused woman known as Princess Leia who died in December.

Bank of America’s signs come at an especially raw and painful time for the community. Like most other marginalized groups LGBTQ people have been touched deeply by death COVID-related and otherwise in the midst of a depression-spurring pandemic skyrocketing overdose rates and healthcare crisis. Formal memorial services are being delayed and it seems like everyone is going through an intense and extended personal grieving. Perhaps the uptick in volume of materials placed at Hibernia Beach is due to the exponentially increased need to mourn publicly.

The most recent huge loss for the community was Black LGBTQ and HIV activist giant Ken Jones a veteran who was the first African American chair of SF Pride and a member of the BART Citizens Review Board after the killing of Oscar Grant. He passed this week of cancer and many discovered the new signs while planning a memorial. Before this death Jones recalled the importance of Hibernia Beach. “In the 1970s before the Internet ironing board tables at Hibernia Beach were our community organizing headquarters” Jones wrote in a memoir cited by the Bay Area Reporter.

Fellow activist Cleve Jones echoed the importance of the location “This has been a tradition for many decades a place where we came together to mark the passing of people who mattered to us. It’s where we remembers the victims of the Pulse massacre. It was a place to remember everyone from our favorite bartenders to the most famous celebrities among us. For anyone to even think about taking that away is a grievous insult and must be reconsidered.”

Ammiano shared a funny memory of the Hibernia Beach area in the 1970s. “Every Friday the line outside the bank would stretch down the block. We all wanted to cash our paychecks and go out drinking. This was during the time of the Symbionese Liberation Army when Patty Hearst held up a Hibernia Bank branch. Well we were all waiting in this humongous line and one queen yelled ‘Patty Hearst didn’t have to wait!’ The whole place burst into hysterics.”

Ammiano’s mood turned dark at the thought of losing the space. “This is non-negotiable. We will protest we will organize I will pull out some nellie ninja shit. Nobody takes that space away from us. Nobody.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtnZXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8xLWtpbGxlZC0xLWluanVyZWQtYWZ0ZXItYmVpbmctc3RydWNrLWJ5LXZlaGljbGUtaW4tYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLXBhcmtpbmctbG90L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtnZXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8xLWtpbGxlZC0xLWluanVyZWQtYWZ0ZXItYmVpbmctc3RydWNrLWJ5LXZlaGljbGUtaW4tYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLXBhcmtpbmctbG90L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPDATE: KCSO identifies woman killed after being struck by vehicle in Bank of America parking lot,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.kget.com/news/local-news/1-killed-1-injured-after-being-struck-by-vehicle-in-bank-of-america-parking-lot/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtnZXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8xLWtpbGxlZC0xLWluanVyZWQtYWZ0ZXItYmVpbmctc3RydWNrLWJ5LXZlaGljbGUtaW4tYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLXBhcmtpbmctbG90L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtnZXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8xLWtpbGxlZC0xLWluanVyZWQtYWZ0ZXItYmVpbmctc3RydWNrLWJ5LXZlaGljbGUtaW4tYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLXBhcmtpbmctbG90L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyb3VuZG9zY2VvbGEuY29tL2hhYml0YXQtaHVtYW5pdHktZ3JlYXRlci1vcmxhbmRvLW9zY2VvbGEtY291bnR5LWdldHMtMjAwMDAwLWdyYW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Habitat for Humanity Greater Orlando & Osceola County gets $200000 grant,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyb3VuZG9zY2VvbGEuY29tL2hhYml0YXQtaHVtYW5pdHktZ3JlYXRlci1vcmxhbmRvLW9zY2VvbGEtY291bnR5LWdldHMtMjAwMDAwLWdyYW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9maWxtcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA0L2thdGUtd2luc2xldC1zdGFycy13YXItcGhvdG9ncmFwaGVyLXdhc2hlZC1oaXRsZXJzLWJhdGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kate Winslet stars as war photographer who washed in Hitler's bath,"Looking every inch the battle-hardened foreign correspondent this is Kate Winslet as World War Two photographer Lee Miller.

Farmer Joe was enticed to take a bath with Claire both of whom developed a connection with each other during their first 24-hour date together.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

'I saw the bathtub near our tent so yeah I just wanted to set up a little spot for us to share some time together' Claire told producers.

Farmer Wants A Wife Australia fans said they were left 'cringing' away from the TV on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Farmer Joe 33 (pictured) was enticed to take a bath with Claire 36 both of whom developed a connection with each other during their first 24-hour date together

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

Others noted that it was only awkward because Farmer Joe did not appear to be as interested in Claire as she was him.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle

One wrote: 'To me that date thing that Claire planned for Joe fell flat I honestly don't think he's feeling it for any of the women.'

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

Farmer Joe has formed several connections this season but still hasn't had much luck after Susie walked out on him when she realised farm life was not for her.

However fans believe he will ultimately end up with Sarah a livestock administrator who grew up on a cattle farm because of their similar backgrounds."
BAX,Baxter International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vbWFkaXNvbjM2NS5jb20vbWlkd2VzdHBvd2VyYnJva2VyczIwMjAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Midwest Power Brokers 2020: 32 of the Region's Most Influential People of Color,"We launched just over five years ago as a nonprofit news outlet to carry the voices of and tell the stories from communities of color in Wisconsin.

We’ve published our Black Power list — highlighting the most influential Black leaders in Wisconsin — every year since our founding and it’s become the most anticipated thing we do. Since 2015 we’ve also published five lists of Wisconsin’s most powerful Latino leaders and just this year we’ve added lists of the state’s most influential and accomplished Indigenous and Asian American leaders.

And now this year more than ever it’s time to look beyond Wisconsin. To people on the coasts and even in the mainstream media even the word “Midwest” is often a substitute for “white.” But we know better and so do you — from the Twin Cities to Cincinnati from Michigan’s UP to central Iowa people of color are thriving leading and changing their communities.

We can’t pretend of course that this is just another year. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on our communities — our health and our jobs and our financial wellbeing and our education system and all of these effects are most pronounced in our Black communities. Add to that the brighter-than-ever spotlight on the injustice of systemic racism — it’s been a tough year for everybody but even more so for our communities of color.

Many have responded to this extraordinary year by expressing an authentic desire to learn more about Black communities celebrate Black excellence. This has also led to a reckoning with regard to other communities of color and a desire to learn more about and celebrate communities of color more broadly. That’s what this list is about. This list is not just a list. It is also an invitation — an invitation to engage to create to make your states and your communities wherever you are across this region a better place to attract and retain leaders of color.

We have never intended our lists to be exhaustive. It’s also not limited to people we agree with politically or otherwise. This list will however introduce you to some people you’ve never heard of who are doing great things in other parts of the region or simply working behind the scenes doing the work without the accolades.

With this list I hope you learn something you didn’t know about some of the real leaders in communities throughout the Midwest and that we might be able to make some connections and start conversations that really move communities forward.

National Football League lineman Ndamukong Suh tries to speak with Warren Buffett quarterly to catch up and solicit investment advice. The two have been close since 2009 when Suh attended the University of Nebraska. The last time he spoke with the ""Oracle of Omaha"" was during the holidays. Suh who now plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers said Buffett discussed opportunities and being in position when they arrive. ""As you can see he's been super cash-heavy"" Suh told CNBC on Friday. ""It's being prepared to make moves and see where there's opportunities in the market."" Though Suh is busy preparing for the New Orleans Saints on Sunday in a showdown between iconic NFL quarterbacks Tom Brady on the Bucs and Drew Brees on the Saints he said he stays aware of market turmoil and activity via CNBC mobile alerts. While waiting for investing opportunities he's also preparing for life after football. ""I have aspirations to be more successful off the field than I was on the field"" Suh said. ""I think I'm in a fairly good place but I know I have a lot of hard work ahead of myself to accomplish that.""

Suh's portfolio

Suh 34 has been particularly keen on opportunities in hospitality and restaurants and says he's ""bullish"" on the sectors. ""I've seen a lot of good growth in those areas that a lot of people wouldn't expect"" Suh said. (He's an advisor in a SPAC in the hospitality space but declined to name it.) ""There's going to be a bigger demand as the vaccine is rolling out and people more open to being out in public"" Suh said. ""Deliveries and the opportunity to grab and go; I've seen a lot of success in those spaces."" Suh didn't add publicly traded food companies to his portfolio in 2020 but privately he has ""projects in the pipeline"" this year around Portland Oregon where he grew up. ""We've signed leases and waiting for things to get up and rolling as things come back"" Suh said. Other investments include Silofit a fitness company that specializes in privatized workouts. The Canadian company went through a $2.5 million fundraising round last November according to Crunchbase and Suh says the firm is expanding. He's used his NFL stardom to make connections with Gary Shiffman chairman of real estate company Sun Communities Inc  and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. He has stock in both companies and is exploring investments in tech firms too. ""I would say I'm a hands-on investor"" Suh said. ""I like to get my hands dirty. I like to add value which is why I like to be an advisor to companies if I'm not a board member or a venture partner.""

A meeting with Phil Knight

While with the Detroit Lions in 2011 Suh made the headlines when he was suspended for two games after stomping a Green Bay Packers player. He returned to Portland and met with Nike founder Phil Knight who helped him turn a negative into an opportunity. Suh said Knight told him: ""'We're going to be able to leverage this from a branding perspective.' And Nike is one of the smartest groups as storytelling so they've been able to leverage me in a lot of ways."" Since then Suh's foundation has focused on providing opportunities for others one of which he described as the ""young Black professional housing project."" Suh's mission is to provide housing to young entrepreneurs allowing them to focus on building their business not on rent. With Covid-19 impacting the nation rent prices in the city have declined but monthly rent for a a one-bedroom apartment still exceeds $1100 according to The Oregonian which used data from apartment websites. ""Rent is not easy"" said Suh adding he has a 40-unit and 56-unit project in the architect phase before moving to city approval. ""I think they'll find that it's a good project and one that will come online soon"" he said. ""It's high-quality living and having the ability to help young professionals get their feet wet in their business focuses but also at the same time not having to be concerned with their living situation.""

Brady owes Suh

Suh described the NFL's Covid-19 season as ""challenging"" especially with changing protocols as the league got serious following an outbreak on the Baltimore Ravens. ""I'm lucky to be an older guy"" he said. ""I anticipated what I needed to do and knew all I needed to take care of when it comes to football. The ancillary pieces I could just handle that as it came."" Suh added he's was impressed with how young players on the Bucs handled the season especially rookies. ""I know their head was spinning just with football let alone with the pandemic they had to deal with"" said Suh. ""Definitely a challenging year but something that we all believed that we could handle. As professional athletes we're always adjusting and adapting. So I think it's in our blood to be able to find ways to get things done."" Speaking of getting things done Suh is counting on Brady to lead the team past the Saints to continue their pursuit of a Super Bowl. It would be his first title and Brady's seventh. Suh gives Brady flak for the 2019 Super Bowl the quarterback cost him as the Los Angeles Rams fell to Brady's New England Patriots. ""He owes me a Super Bowl since he stole one from me in [2019]"" Suh joked. ""I got to take care of business this year and would love to get that Super Bowl"" he added. ""I've seen a lot of individual success but I need that team success to really solidify my career.""

In the third quarter of his team’s AFC Divisional round meeting with the Baltimore Ravens he scored.

Naturally context is everything.

The touchdown for Johnson came moments after his team had just put up the game’s first touchdown on offense. The Ravens were successfully responding and Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson was cruising. Then Johnson ended all that as he jumped in front of Jackson’s pass in his own end zone and took it 101 yards all the way to the other end of the field putting Buffalo up 17-3.

That’s the way the game ended.

Johnson explained after the final whistle that he did consider taking a knee and decided against it. In doing so Buffalo’s offense would’ve taken the ball after the touchback. Good thing he didn’t. Because not only did he score he helped create what could go down as the most iconic photo in Bills history.

Johnson took off down the right sideline. He’s a fast guy but Baltimore’s quarterback is without a doubt faster. But Jackson cannot go through people and cornerback Tre’Davious White the cornerstone of Buffalo’s defense blocked the QB trying to stop Johnson as the image shows.

However the best part of the photo might be in the background. There we see Bills quarterback Josh Allen on the sideline. He looks stunned and jolted with excitement watching the play as he’s jumping up and down on the sideline cheering for Johnson.

An iconic snapshot. Look for the No. 17:

Allen’s excitement comes from a desire to win of course. Whether it’s the QB scoring himself or his defense he’ll take it. What perhaps really got him going was the roller coaster of emotions he went through. Allen explained following the game via video conference that he did not want Johnson to take the ball out of the end zone. He thought the defensive back was going to get tackled.

“I saw him come out of the end zone usually when there’s a lot of bodies around you want to stay in [the end zone] so I was like ‘Dang it he’s going to get tackled at the five or 10” Allen said.

Good thing Johnson didn’t do what his QB wanted… and Allen’s happy he didn’t as well. Allen like everyone was thoroughly impressed by what went down. Not just with Johnson’s work but what White did too.

“I’ll tell you what Tre White to go out and get a block on Lamar to spring (Johnson) free… I mean it’s unbelievable” Allen added. “Just an unbelievable play just one of those plays that will be remembered for a really long time.”

As of now the picture is an iconic snapshot. But exactly how iconic it becomes is still to be determined with how far the Bills keep on rolling.

I want to tell you about a book I am still reading.

It’s not just any book — it’s Morgan Housel’s new book The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth greed and happiness.

The reason I want to tell you about this book is because of this quote I read in it that I’m still pondering. It’s thought-provoking.

As I write this Warren Buffett’s net worth is $80 billion. Of that $19.7 billion was accumulated after his 50th birthday. $70 billion came after he qualified for Social Security in his mid-60s. Warren Buffett is a phenomenal investor. But you miss a key point if you attach all of his success to investing acumen. The real key to his success is that he’s been a phenomenal investor for three quarters of a century. Had he started investing in his 30s and retired in his 60s few people would have ever heard of him.Consider a little thought experiment. Buffett began serious investing when he was 10 years old. By the time he was 30 he had a net worth of $1 million or $9.3 million adjusted for inflation. What if he was a more normal person spending his teens and 20s exploring the world and finding his passion and by age 30 his net worth was say $25000? And let’s say he still went on to earn the extraordinary annual investment returns he’s been able to generate (22% annually) but quit investing and retired at age 60 to play golf and spend time with his grandkids. What would a rough estimate of his net worth be today? Not $80 billion. $11.9 million. 99.9% less than his actual net worth. Effectively all of Warren Buffett’s financial success can be tied to the financial base he built in his pubescent years and the longevity he maintained in his geriatric years. His skill is investing but his secret is time. That’s how compounding works.

I am a huge fan of the compounding effect.

It’s one of the the most powerful forces in the universe.

One of the best things you can do your life and is to understand the logic of compound — the exponential increase in the value of an asset over time. Gary Foreman from The Dollar Stretcher wrote “What is compound interest? It’s interest earning interest.”

In other words a small action repeated over time can make a huge difference in your life career relationship and finance.

The great Albert Einstein once said: “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it earns it … he who doesn’t … pays it.”

Most people want radical change now. Real growth and progress doesn’t work like that. It takes time patience and consistency.

Warren Buffett has been stressing the the importance of compounding for over six decades — it’s made him billions.

“I always knew I was going to be rich so I was never in a hurry to” Buffett once said.

If you’re serious about living an extraordinary life you can use the compounding principle to your advantage to improve every area of your life. Those small daily actions add up — they count. Deliberate actions performed daily for weeks months years and decades changes everything.

Is it safe?,"Screens in vehicles are getting bigger and bigger.

But is that better?

German automaker Daimler's Mercedes-Benz revealed a new 56-inch screen nearly spanning the width of an entire car this month becoming the latest brand to bet on larger-than-ever digital displays.

The Jan. 7 announcement came as other car brands like Tesla Ram and Toyota turn the dashboards and instrument panels of certain new vehicles into a sort of Apple store.

Gone are the days of playing-card-sized screens causing drivers and passengers to squint their eyes at low-resolution text and poorly designed graphics.

Welcome to the era where the screen is king and analog buttons are facing the guillotine.

""It seems like screens in cars are taking after screens in homes"" said Jessica Caldwell executive director of insights at car-research site Edmunds. ""We never thought screens would get this large.""

The Mercedes-Benz Hyperscreen is a 56-inch wide curved screen encapsulating the vehicle's infotainment system console buttons and cockpit panels.

Consumer Reports: These are the 10 most and least reliable 2021 cars trucks and SUVs

But safety watchdogs have raised concerns that bigger screens can distract drivers especially if they're hard to use.

“There are already some studies that indicate significant driver distraction can be a result of in-dashboard screens"" Jason K. Levine executive director of the Center for Auto Safety said in an email. ""The question is by making them bigger wider and more integrated with the vehicle does this make an existing problem worse?""

For example a 2019 study by AAA found that the design of in-vehicle infotainment technology's voice commands software menus and center consoles was often distracting – and especially so for older drivers.

The federal government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which regulates vehicles has raised a red flag about driver distraction but has not rolled out federal standards to limit it Levine noted.

""Which means there’s always likely to be at least one manufacturer who will be willing to push the limits to get that 'wow' factor"" Levine said.

The Mercedes-Benz Hyperscreen

There's certainly a ""wow"" factor with the Mercedes-Benz Hyperscreen.

The screen should debut this year in its new electric sedan the Mercedes-Benz EQS Daimler said.

The EQS is billed as the luxury automaker's finest electric car and is expected to compete directly with vehicles like the Tesla Model S and Porsche Taycan. It will be sold as a 2022 model and while a starting price hasn't been announced Edmunds estimated a $110000 price tag.

Story continues

The Mercedes-Benz Vision EQS show car was introduced in 2019. It provided a preview for what the 2022 Mercedes-Benz EQS electric sedan will look like.

The car has a curved-panel OLED screen that includes digital instrument clusters a touchscreen on the center console and a high-tech display that can show movies to the front-seat passenger in markets where that's allowed. The panel curls around analog air vents to maximize screen capacity.

Daimler Chairman and CEO Ola Källenius said the Hyperscreen was specifically designed with advanced voice commands and eye-tracking technology to ensure that drivers keep their focus on the road.

""We're (using) technology to make sure that driver distraction doesn't happen"" he said.

For example if you take your eyes off the road to watch the movie on the front passenger's portion of the screen the system is programmed to automatically shut off the film. Once the driver's eyes hit the road again the show resumes.

""It's so intelligent that it can distinguish between watching the movie and (looking at) the right mirror when you maybe want to change lanes"" Källenius said.

Screens come and don't go

Automotive industry experts largely agree that Tesla kick-started the trend of large tablet-style infotainment screens in vehicles with the Model S ultra-luxury sedan. It continued the strategy with its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan replacing most conventional buttons with a digital display that can be updated via over-the-air software updates.

In the years since other automakers have begun embracing screens as well.

When it rolled out the redesigned Ram pickup in 2019 Fiat Chrysler equipped the vehicle with a 12-inch touchscreen which is about the size of a laptop.

The 2021 Ram 1500 pickup has a 12-inch touchscreen on its center console.

When it debuted the Toyota Prius Prime in 2017 Toyota began offering a nearly 12-inch screen on upgraded models.

But it's Tesla that's still widely identified with big screens for better or worse. When engineers recently released a software update some Tesla owners complained that buttons were confusingly rearranged.

""Definitely a distracting downgrade – wish I could go back"" one user posted on a Tesla forum message thread titled ""New Display Layout is Horrendous.""

Tesla did not respond to a request seeking comment.

Displays on doors?

Automakers are expanding screen size in large part because customers want to mirror their consumer electronics experience in the vehicle said Stephanie Brinley principal automotive analyst at research firm IHS Markit.

""People like them basically"" she said.

For an automaker like Mercedes-Benz a bigger and better screen might be the most efficient way to grab the attention of potential buyers who have a bevy of other attractive options.

""It’s just not enough to offer cool features anymore because you can get a touchscreen and heated seats in an inexpensive Kia"" said Brian Moody executive editor of car-buying site Autotrader. ""So what's pushing this (trend) is there has to be serious and identifiable differentiators.""

Moody predicted that automakers will go further perhaps even by incorporating screens on the sides of new vehicles.

""Imagine having art or video screens on the door panels"" he said. ""All those things I think are yet to come.""

Automakers are increasingly embracing screens in part because it allows them to update their vehicles over time something that Tesla essentially pioneered.

""As automakers get over-the-air updates even quicker you have the opportunity to make changes to what that (screen) looks like over the life of the vehicle"" Brinley said.

Coronavirus Crisis: Growth Catalyst for Packaging Stocks?

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic when most businesses struggled packaging companies saw huge spikes in sales amid a rise in ecommerce. As businesses shift their focus towards online channels they are recognizing the importance of packaging for brand image customer satisfaction and marketing. According to a survey a majority of sellers think that the use of branded packaging for online orders affects their perception. The COVID-19 pandemic skyrocketed ecommerce sales worldwide as consumers stopped going to physical stores and loaded up on groceries and other items using online channels.

Buy and hold works on indexes like the S&P 500 because these indexes are diversified and contain the future biggest winning stocks. Warren Buffett also recommends this strategy as a way to beat the majority of mutual fund managers and hedge fund managers for returns over 10 year periods of time. Most financial advisers recommend this buy and hold strategy to clients with 10-30 year time frames.

The downside to buy and hold on the S&P 500 index is the financial and mental pain that has to be endured during bear market drawdowns and market crashes. The other issue is that as you accumulate your position and then sell it you are timing the market and if you start buying during a bull market peak or need to exit during bear market bottoms it dramatically changes performance. A buy and hold investor that started buying in March 2000 or January 2008 will not think it is as great a system a few years later as someone that started buying in March of 2003 or March of 2009. Could there be a better way to manage the risk and timing of buy and hold without sacrificing the long term returns? Or better yet increasing the returns and lower the risk?

There is a simple moving average strategy that beat buy and hold investing over the past 20 years. It is not complicated it is a type of trend following system and only takes one action on the last day of the month to execute it. It almost doubled the returns in the S&P 500 index and cut the drawdown of capital by nearly one third of buy and hold. Unlike mutual funds and hedge funds a good systematic moving average strategy can beat the S&P 500 index over time by staying long during bull markets and going to cash during bear markets.

The 200-day simple moving average of prices is one of the most popular stock market signals and backtesting shows since the year 2000 it has worked best as an end of month signal. Below are the results if an investor simply bought the $SPY ETF and held if price ended the month over the 200-day simple moving average but sold and stayed in cash if the $SPY price was under the 200 day SMA on the last day of the month. This is not the Holy Grail of trend trading the SPY ETF it is just math. The 2oo-day SMA is lost during bear markets as price falls below it and price also stays above the 200 day SMA during bull markets as it continues to trade in a range or trend higher.

The end of month signal also avoided all the intra-month false signals when price chops under and over this line. For a swing or position trader the signals will seem like a long time frame but for a buy and hold investor this will seem like an active short term strategy.

The market timing of the trade signals of the below 12 trades does not get much better than this avoiding the three major bear markets of the past 20 years but outperforming the bull market buy and hold profits by almost +200%.

Nitinol-based occluder devices which are presently used to heal Atrial Septal Defect(ASD) or hole in the heart that affects 8 out of every 1000 living babies born are currently imported to meet demands.

Besides currently India does not manufacture flow diverters stents which are needed for diverting blood flow away from an intracranial aneurysm or localized ballooning of arteries in the brain helping reduce chances of its rupture and related stroke.

In order to address the challenges Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) an autonomous institute of the Department of Science & Technology (DST) Govt of India under the Technical Research Centre (TRC) has entered into Technology Transfer Agreements with Pune based Biorad Medisys for two biomedical implant devices— an Atrial Septal Defect Occluder and an Intracranial Flow Diverter Stents developed by the institute in collaboration with National Aerospace Laboratories Bangalore (CSIR-NAL)using superelastic NiTiNOL alloys.

The Technology Transfer Agreements agreements were signed by Dr K Jayakumar Director SCTIMST and Jitendra Hedge Managing Director Biorad Medisys in the presence of Dr Jitendra J Jadhav Director CSIR- NAL through an online meeting on early this week.

The novel ASD occlude developed by SCTIMST promotes better healing of the hole in the heart and also has a softer edge for minimizing the damage to adjacent tissue. The delivery system has a novel release mechanism to enable the smooth release of the device. The device is protected through two Indian patent applications one international patent application and design registration.

The flexible flow diverter stent that allows accurate positioning of the device across the aneurysm developed by SCTIMST is the first one to be manufactured in India. It possesses kink resistance and improved radial strength through a novel braiding pattern making the device flexible and adaptable to the distortion of the vessel boundaries.

The device is also provided with radio-opaque markers for radiographic visibility. The associated delivery system allows accurate positioning of the device across the aneurysm. These features have been protected through two Indian patent applications one international patent application and design registration. The cost of the Chitra Flow Diverter stent is expected to be priced significantly lower than the currently imported ones.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL3N0YXRlcy9rZXJhbGEvMjAyMS9KYW4vMTcvc3JlZS1jaGl0cmFzLWNoZWFwYmlvbWVkLWRldmljZXMtZ2V0LXRlY2gtdHJhbnNmZXItZGVhbC0yMjUxMTcyLmh0bWzSAYkBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3aW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L3N0YXRlcy9rZXJhbGEvMjAyMS9KYW4vMTcvc3JlZS1jaGl0cmFzLWNoZWFwYmlvbWVkLWRldmljZXMtZ2V0LXRlY2gtdHJhbnNmZXItZGVhbC0yMjUxMTcyLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sree Chitra’s cheap biomed devices get tech transfer deal,Flow diverters stents are used for diverting blood flow away from the bulged arteries in brain and thereby reducing the chances of its rupture.

With climate change rewriting core assumptions in modern finance he argued trillions of dollars are at stake. “Sooner than most anticipate there will be a significant reallocation of capital” Fink wrote. “We believe that sustainable investing is the strongest foundation for client portfolios going forward.”

With that the financial industry was put on notice. Climate change is now the lens through which Blackrock and everyone following the world’s largest asset manager will need to assess its next investment. Mindy Lubber CEO of nonprofit Ceres which pushes for climate action in the business community says BlackRock is dragging the rest of the industry with it: “When they move a lot of people follow.”

Now that climate change is looming over Wall Street the trickle of companies announcing commitments to push for emission cuts has swelled to a deluge. BlackRock doesn’t deserve all the credit. It’s just the latest (and biggest) player to shatter the delusions that companies could ignore the climate catastrophe and their role in it. That’s part of a wider shift toward stakeholder capitalism one backed by top CEOs who want the purpose of a corporation to include benefiting “all stakeholders—customers employees suppliers communities and shareholders.”

BlackRock has vowed to prove this is more than rhetoric: It promised to screen all investments against sustainability criteria and to begin divesting from companies such as thermal coal producers. But make no mistake—BlackRock is doing this for money. “Actions that damage society will catch up with a company and destroy shareholder value” Fink wrote last year. “Ultimately purpose is the engine of long-term profitability.”

Doing good paying dividends

BlackRock has been called the “Swiss Army knife” of the financial world. It’s not a bank. But it manages and monitors huge sums of money as an institutional investor money manager and private equity firm. Savvy maneuvering—and perhaps its focus on environment social and governance (ESG) risks—has helped BlackRock eclipse almost every other major asset manager’s stock market performance over the last two years. BlackRock’s market capitalization has soared 80% from the depths of the pandemic-fueled market crash last March (only Schwab recently caught up).

This tracks the superior market performance of ESG investments across the board. Funds screening out bad actors for environment social and governance issues saw four times more cash flow into them in 2020 relative to the same period the previous year. Many outperformed the S&P 500.

A brief history

1988: BlackRock is founded.

1999: The firm goes public with $165 billion in assets and sells access to Aladdin its in-house risk management tool.

2014: BlackRock sets up its first indices that exclude fossil fuels.

Advertisement

2020 (January): Fink pens “A fundamental reshaping of finance” as his annual letter to CEOs. In it he predicts massive climate impacts on the financial sector and joins ClimateAction 100+ a global consortium of investors pushing companies to zero out emissions.

2020 (December): BlackRock’s Aladdin Climate is launched quantifying climate risk for many of the world’s largest pension funds asset managers and other institutional investors. Aladdin monitors $18 trillion in assets for 200 financial firms. BlackRock formally announces it will “be incorporating climate risk across our platform as a critical investment risk like liquidity risk.”

Climate commitments

In 2020 Fink laid out a list of commitments for BlackRock to put “sustainability at the center of our investment approach.” Here are some of the most important:

⛏️ Divest from thermal coal companies.

Advertisement

🌡️ Ask for companies’ climate plans to operate in line with Paris Agreement targets for less than 2°C of warming.

💰 Offer ESG options for all active portfolios and advisory strategies and eventually convert all financial products to include ESG screens.

📆 Move from annual to quarterly voting disclosure with an explanation of decisions.

👁️ Expand the number of companies under climate scrutiny from about 440 companies (of which 191 were put “on watch” for lack of progress in 2020) to more than 1000.

Advertisement

👎 Vote against management that fails to act: “Where we believe companies are not moving with sufficient speed and urgency our most frequent course of action will be to hold directors accountable by voting against their re-election.”

🗣️ Take responsibility for lobbying: “We will now seek confirmation from companies through engagement or disclosure that their corporate political activities are consistent with their public statements on material and strategic policy issues…and to provide an explanation where inconsistencies exist.”

🌎 Start accounting for natural capital: “In January 2021 we will provide a more holistic commentary on our approach to natural capital…[that] will also address how we expect affected companies to manage the scarce water and energy resources on which they depend to avoid negative impacts that could impair their ability to operate.”

Power of the proxy

In 2020 BlackRock held major stakes in more than 90% of S&P 500 companies—its average share was 7.7%—giving the asset manager an outsized say in what companies and executive teams do. A vote against management by BlackRock could easily tip into majority support and BlackRock’s own analysis suggests 94% of companies fully or partially adopt shareholder resolutions when votes exceed 50%.

“BlackRock is unique because of its scale” says Judy Samuelson founder of the Aspen Institute’s Business and Society Program. As a universal owner with $7.8 trillion in assets it holds shares in every major industry across the business world. “They can’t exit a stock” she says. “They have to continue to hold it.”

It’s a level of influence BlackRock says it intends to use. In its 2021 stewardship report (pdf) the company said it would vote against re-electing directors at companies it believes aren’t moving with sufficient urgency. But in the first half of last year BlackRock didn’t live up to its rhetoric: The company actually opposed slightly more environmental shareholder resolutions than it had a year before even as rivals such as JPMorgan tripled their support.

BlackRock says it updated its voting policies in July and was engaging directly with management to fix perceived shortfalls. Indeed: Between July 1 and Dec. 4 the company cast 22 votes on environmental and social shareholder proposals supporting half of them.

ESG investing will soon just be…investing

ESG investing once represented a marginal activity in the financial world but it’s about to move to the center of it. Assets in ESG funds soared to $1 trillion in 2020 according to UBS. More net money flowed into ESG funds between April and July 2020 than the entire previous five years.

Advertisement

Why? Returns are higher and volatility is lower. In a world of negative interest rates cash is racing around the globe chasing higher returns and havens from volatility.

This year BlackRock said all its active portfolios and advisory strategies will account for ESG and it will continue to generate and share more data on companies’ ESG performance (60% of publicly traded firms (pdf) already disclose something about climate risk). “Sustainable investing was once viewed as a trade-off between value and ‘values’” Fink wrote in February 2019. No longer.

BlackRock also recently launched Aladdin Climate software that calculates portfolios’ climate risk by crunching data on a company’s energy carbon emissions waste water and efficiency metrics. Aladdin Climate now allows BlackRock—and its clients—to stress test their portfolio under different scenarios such as net-zero transition under the Paris Agreement.

But as the Aspen Institute’s Samuelson argues (and BlackRock acknowledges) this alone won’t be enough. “ESG funds are not the answer” she says. “They are noise in the system. The goal is to have the financial markets work better. Ultimately this should be about having two classes of good stocks and bad stocks. We need to raise the bar.”

LOOKING TO A BRIGHT FUTURE: Jennifer Severn and Sheamus Gee who live in West Cork were wed at Blackrock Castle in December. Pictures: Dermot Sullivan

They were engaged on the beach down in Ringaskiddy in May 2019. Shortly afterwards Jennifer found out she was pregnant.

“We were overjoyed as we had lost a baby In late 2018. We decided to buy our forever home that year and we now live in Dunmanway West Cork” she said.

FOLLOWING IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS: The happy couple wanted to wed at Blackrock Castle as that is where Jennifer’s parents had their wedding reception more than 30 years ago.

In January 2020 they welcomed their handsome baby boy Shay into the world.

They only decided to get married last August and picked December 18 as their date.

“Blackrock Castle was the only venue I wanted to get married in as my parents had their wedding reception there more than 30 years ago” said Jennifer.

With three months to organise the wedding she booked her photographer Dermot Sullivan immediately sourced her dress in Memories bridal boutique in Cork city while the suits were from Simply Suits on the Kinsale Road Roundabout.

RAISING A GLASS: Due to Covid-19 restrictions they could only have 15 guests in the ceremony and 25 at the meal afterwards.

The cake was bought from Healys bakery in Blackpool — three tiers of deliciousness. Flowers were from Floral creations in Dunmanway.

SAYING I DO: Guests clapped and blew bubbles when the happy couple emerged from the civil ceremony.

Majella from NOVA hair in Dunmanway did hair on the day while Molly a.k.a mollydollymua did make up.

Just 15 people were allowed at the wedding ceremony in the castle and 25 guests at the reception afterwards.

Jennifer’s sisters Katie and Jessica were bridesmaids and Sheamus had his brother Tyrone and best friend Mark as groomsmen.

Sheamus Gee with his best man and grooms man.

“ As we walked out a few friends and all our siblings’ partners greeted us by cheering and blowing bubbles — it was perfect” said Jennifer.

The 25 guests then sat down in Castle café for dinner.

“Everyone was in good spirits and it was clear they were all enjoying a couple of hours of the old normal we all took for granted.

“We ended our wedding by going outside and playing our first dance song Loving You by Paolo Nutini in the courtyard and we danced there by the Christmas tree. It was the perfect end to our perfect day.”

THEIR FIRST DANCE: Jennifer Severn and Sheamus Gee had their first dance on the courtyard under the Christmas tree at Blackrock Castle.

The couple want to give a special mention to her parents Malcolm and Ann Severn who moved to Dunmanway and have been so supportive. Also a special mention to Sheamus’s mother Sue Gee for having the strength and courage to move to Ireland after the death of Sheamus’s Father (Robert Gee) with their six children and start a new life — otherwise the couple would never have met.

“I will be forever grateful to her for making that decision because without her bravery myself and Sheamus would never have met” said Jennifer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYmFyYmFkb3N0b2RheS5iYi8yMDIxLzAxLzE2L2JsYWNrLXJvY2stcG9saWNlLXN0YXRpb24tdGVtcG9yYXJpbHktY2xvc2VkLWR1ZS10by1jb3ZpZC0xOS_SAWVodHRwczovL2JhcmJhZG9zdG9kYXkuYmIvMjAyMS8wMS8xNi9ibGFjay1yb2NrLXBvbGljZS1zdGF0aW9uLXRlbXBvcmFyaWx5LWNsb3NlZC1kdWUtdG8tY292aWQtMTkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Rock Police Station temporarily closed due to COVID-19,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='barbadostoday.bb', port=443): Read timed out.

Blackstone one of the largest investment firms in the world is eyeing a £900m ($1.2bn) stake in Butlins’ owner Bourne Leisure valuing the company at around £3bn.

The US buyout giant is said to be in exclusive discussions to invest in the company which also owns the Haven chain and Warner Leisure Hotels.

Bourne Leisure is the biggest leisure firm in the UK employing around 14000 members of staff. The investment would secure thousands of jobs at Bourne which has suffered since the coronavirus pandemic closed its sites across the country.

Its Butlins sites are currently closed until at least mid-February according to the company’s website as the UK government aims to curb the spread of COVID-19.

A source close to the deal said that talks are not yet in an advanced stage but that they are continuing.

“Blackstone is probably thinking of what has a chance of a good comeback after the pandemic and Bourne Leisure has always been a company with a strong balance sheet” the insider told the Times which first reported the negotiations.

The three families that own Bourne - the Cook Harris and Allen families - will retain a significant stake in the business following a sale the newspaper said. Peter Harris who founded the business in 1964 remains the company’s largest shareholder.

Last month Bourne Leisure announced that it would no longer sell through travel agents and only take direct bookings for its sites saying at the time that it had to make “difficult choices” in recent months.

Blackstone which owns Merlin Entertainments has assets in the UK including the Legoland theme parks Madame Tussauds and the London Eye.

In 2019 the private equity firm took visitor attractions operator Merlin private along with a consortium led by Lego’s founding family in a $7.5bn deal. It bought the NEC Group and its Birmingham arenas for a reported £800m in 2018.

The New York-based firm also acquired IQ Student Accommodation last year for £4.7bn in what was the UK’s biggest property deal at the time.

It agreed to buy a £473m portfolio of warehouses in October in Britain’s largest warehouse investment purchase.

Last month it was in talks to buy London-listed private jet services operator Signature Aviation.

Ryan Tomasich the aerospace giant’s government operations manager joined the Mercer Island Chamber of Commerce on Jan. 14 for an online presentation on how the pandemic has impacted the Puget Sound company and the entire industry and how they’ll strive to weather the storm.

Boeing — which employees 185 workers from Mercer Island — has launched a Confident Travel Initiative in which it will supply leadership in the global effort to provide passengers and crew safe healthy and efficient travel.

Hefty challenges remain at the forefront as the pandemic continues.

“It truly is an unprecedented time as global passenger traffic remains down over 70% or more compared to 2019 levels. Airlines are expected to lose close to $100 billion once we see all the data come out from the end of 2020 and then expect it to incur significant losses this year as well” said Tomasich adding that the downturn in travel is deeper and longer than when passenger traffic was greatly impacted following the 9/11 tragedy.

Tomasich said they’re hopeful that vaccines will aid the industry’s recovery. However they’re forecasting a three- to five-year window before passenger traffic levels will return to what they saw pre-COVID in 2019.

During its “business transformation” over the past eight to 10 months Boeing has been studying its facility and site and enterprise footprints taking into account new remote working opportunities; eyeing its overhead and looking critically at its cost structure and how it operates and is organized; and focusing on safety quality and innovation.

At its Puget Sound facilities — which are home to its greatest number of employees — Boeing’s production numbers will be as follows this year: 777 (will drop from five aircraft a month to two) 747 (expected to remain at half an aircraft per month) and 767 (expected to stay at three aircraft per month). In 2022 Boeing foresees a gradual increase to 31 aircraft per month with the 737 models.

Boeing’s largest drop in production has taken place with its 787s in Charleston South Carolina where numbers will drop from 14 aircraft per month to five this year.

During the pandemic Boeing has taken action to coordinate 11 airlift transport missions to deliver more than 4.5 million units of personal protective equipment (PPE) to health care professionals in the United States. The company also donated and delivered more than 225000 units of PPE including 125000 units to Wuhan China on a U.S. State Department flight.

“Even though the industry is going through a downturn right now we are still making investments in the future of our workforce here in the Puget Sound region in Washington state” said Tomasich adding that Boeing recently received recertification of the 737 Max from the Federal Aviation Administration.

Through its Learning Together program Boeing pays tuition for employees who wish to pursue their college or graduate school education. Currently more than 5500 employees are participating in the program.

Boeing invested money to help develop a Core Plus Aerospace program through a partnership with The Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. The program is designed to prepare high-school students for college or their immediate entrance into the workforce with hands-on manufacturing experience during their junior and senior years. Classes count toward their math science and English credits. Core Plus Aerospace is also linked with skill centers and community and technical college programs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2Vjb2FzdGRhaWx5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxL2JvZWluZy1zdGFybGluZXItaW5zdGFsbHMtbmFzYS1kb2NraW5nLXN5c3RlbS1jb3Zlci1vbi1jc3QtMTAwLXN0YXJsaW5lci1zcGFjZWNyYWZ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing Starliner Installs NASA Docking System Cover On CST-100 Starliner Spacecraft,"Boeing Starliner Installs NASA Docking System Cover On CST-100 Starliner Spacecraft

NASA & SPACE NEWS

BREVARD COUNTY FLORIDA – Boeing teams in the Starliner assembly facility at Kennedy Space Center in Brevard County recently installed and tested a new NASA Docking System cover on the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft that will fly the Orbital Flight Test mission in March.

The NASA Docking System designed and built by Boeing is a standardized mechanism that allows two spacecraft to connect safely with each other autonomously to create a short tunnel so crews can move between the two vehicles.

The new cover will provide additional protection for the automated docking system during atmospheric re-entry where the capsule faces temperatures of about 3000 degrees Fahrenheit prior to landing at one of five potential locations in the western U.S.

The NDS cover is located under the crew module’s semispherical Ascent Cover during launch and is only visible during orbital operations after the Ascent Cover jettisons.

It acts as a hatch on the top of the vehicle that will open for docking with the International Docking Adapters on the ISS and close after undocking.

The NDS cover was installed on the OFT-2 vehicle in December.

A 70-foot-long (21.34-meter-long) LauncherOne rocket was released from beneath the wing of a Boeing 747 carrier aircraft off the coast of Southern California ignited moments later and soared toward space.

The two-stage rocket carried a cluster of very small satellites known as CubeSats developed and built as part of a NASA educational program involving U.S. universities.

The launch occurred after the Boeing 747-400 took off from Mojave Air and Space Port in the desert north of Los Angeles and flew out over the Pacific Ocean to a drop point beyond the Channel Islands.

“According to telemetry LauncherOne has reached orbit!” Virgin Orbit tweeted later. “Everyone on the team who is not in mission control right now is going absolutely bonkers.”

The rocket’s upper stage coasted for a period reignited to circularize the orbit and then deployed the nine CubeSats.

The flight developments were announced on social media. The launch was not publicly livestreamed.

Virgin Orbit based in Long Beach California is part of a wave of companies targeting the launch market for increasingly capable small satellites which may range in sizes comparable to a toaster on up to a home refrigerator.

Competitor Rocket Lab also headquartered in Long Beach has deployed 96 payloads in 17 launches of its Electron rocket from a site in New Zealand. Another of its rockets was nearing launch Sunday.

Virgin Orbit touts the flexibility of its capability to begin its missions by using airports around the globe.

Virgin Orbit attempted its first demonstration launch in May 2020.

The rocket was released and ignited but only briefly flew under power before it stopped thrusting. The lost payload was only a test satellite.

The company later said an investigation determined there was a breach in a high-pressure line carrying cryogenic liquid oxygen to the first-stage combustion chamber.

Virgin Orbit is separate from Virgin Galactic the company founded by Branson to carry passengers on suborbital hops in which they will experience the sensations and sights of spaceflight.

Virgin Galactic expects to begin commercial operations this year in southern New Mexico.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL2JvZWluZy1tYXgtcmV0dXJuLXRvLXNlcnZpY2UtMS41ODcxOTU40gEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL2FtcC8xLjU4NzE5NTg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines face stiff public relations headwind as they prepare Boeing 737 Max for return to passenger service,"As they prepare for the return of the Boeing 737 Max to Canadian skies for the first time in almost two years Canada's two largest airlines are grappling with how to ease passenger wariness about the jet's reputation during a time of heightened anxiety around flying.

""The pandemic compounded people's concern about the Max"" said WestJet's vice-president of communications and chief of staff Richard Bartrem. ""The angst around the pandemic drove their reticence to flying even higher.""

Countries worldwide grounded the Max in March 2019 after two crashes just months apart in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people including 18 Canadians and family that were permanent residents.

Transport Canada hasn't specified the date when Canadian airlines can resume using the 737 Max for passenger flights but said it's imminent. Airlines expect an announcement could come as soon as this week.

A year ago restoring confidence after two fatal crashes would have been a big challenge by itself. Now Air Canada and WestJet are doing that during a pandemic when WestJet's internal research shows travellers are more apprehensive about flying in general — and even more uncomfortable with flying on a Max than before.

The majority surveyed — 64 per cent — said they would avoid flying on the Max altogether according to the latest data the airline shared with CBC News from the fall.

The two crashes exposed serious flaws with the plane's design and certification process.

Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion US after admitting to defrauding and obstructing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in connection with evaluating the plane's flight-control system called MCAS which was found to have pushed the plane's nose down as pilots struggled to right it in the two crashes.

Canada's regulator said it has spent 15000 hours independently verifying changes to the aircraft and ensuring Boeing and the FAA addressed all of its safety concerns. Last month the U.S. became the first country to approve the plane to return to the skies followed by Brazil.

Boeing's 737 Max flown by airlines around the world was grounded for nearly two years after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia raised questions about their safety. Transport Canada recently validated changes to the jets. (Ousama Farag)

75 per cent not comfortable with Max WestJet finds

As WestJet aims to return its fleet to service on Jan. 21 the carrier has been tracking public opinion. The airline conducted a series of surveys with more than 800 Canadian flyers online over an 18-month period.

The results show that pre-pandemic in September 2019 59 per cent of flyers surveyed said they would not be comfortable flying on a Max when it returns to passenger service. As the pandemic wore on that number of wary travellers grew to 75 per cent in October.

Canadian travellers in Western and Atlantic Canada along with business travellers said they were more likely to get back on a 737 Max.

Ruth Adonya flew from Ottawa to Nigeria this week but said she wouldn't have done it on a Max.

""I'm already anxious about flying"" said Adonya when CBC News spoke to her at the Ottawa International Airport. ""I know someone who died from one of the crashes. I'm very nervous about it so I wouldn't get on.""

New opt-out policies

To try and ease that apprehension WestJet has released a new webpage with a safety video and a new policy it says is centred around transparency.

If you're booking on a Max WestJet says it will make it clear that you can opt out at any time and change your flight to another plane free of charge. Notifications will also be sent to customers ahead of their flight reminding them.

""We never want to put anybody in a position where they feel they're being forced to be on that aircraft"" said Bartrem who added that WestJet hasn't decided how long the policy will be in effect.

""If you are at the gate and haven't read any of the emails or didn't notice at the time of booking and you now look out the window and want to talk to a customer service agent [because you] realize it's the Max — if you don't want to get on then we'll certainly book you onto another flight.""

WATCH | Transparent communication around return of 737 Max:

Transparent communication around return of 737 Max Duration 0:50 WestJet vice-president of communications and chief of staff Richard Bartrem said the airline has decided that 'the best way for us to move forward with the Max is to be as open and transparent in our communication as possible.'

'We understand the apprehension': Air Canada VP

Air Canada is aiming to start flying the Max on Feb.1 and said it plans to roll out a similar policy and dedicated webpage to educate the public about the safety of the aircraft.

""The strategy will be very similar"" said Murray Strom vice-president of flight operations. ""We understand the apprehension we have policies in place through our commercial division to alleviate passengers' concerns. We're not going to put a passenger on the airplane who doesn't want to be.""

Strom said he has total confidence in the safety of the Max because Transport Canada has asked the manufacturer and U.S. regulator thousands of questions over the past two years.

""You have to trust the experts that have certified this aircraft"" he said. ""People are skeptical of Boeing. They're not happy with the [Federal Aviation Administration]. But in Canada we have a very strong certification group.""

Sunwing declined CBC's request for an interview about its fleet of the aircraft and has not yet announced its plans to return the Max to service.

Murray Strom vice-president of flight operations said Air Canada is two weeks behind WestJet in returning its fleet of Boeing 737 Max to service because it has more pilots to train in the simulator seen here and planes to bring back. (Ousama Farag/CBC News)

Max more fuel-efficient cuts operating costs

Airlines around the world have a lot riding on the successful return of the Max especially during a time of historic financial losses. In Canada the jet is a top performer in WestJet and Air Canada's fleets.

Air Canada said the Max is a greener aircraft and 20 per cent more fuel efficient compared to other models. It can cut operating costs by 11 per cent ""which is significant"" the airline said in a statement to CBC News.

The Max has a longer range than previous 737 models and is smaller than wide-body aircraft that are more expensive to operate. This allows the carrier to resume non-stop flights to destinations which haven't been profitable during the pandemic because too many seats were empty on larger aircraft to make the trip viable.

Air Canada said it offered flights to Hawaii on bigger jets over the holidays when air traffic was up but it will end them on Jan. 23. It plans to resume flights on the route once the Max is back in service.

Everything that's been necessary to be done has been done double checked triple checked. - Richard Steer Air Canada senior vice-president of operations

The airline said it's ready to start Max flights when Transport Canada gives its approval.

""Everything that's been necessary to be done has been done double checked triple checked"" said Richard Steer the senior vice-president of operations at Air Canada who is responsible for the safe dispatch of the Max fleet.

""We are ready. The aircraft is ready and we are just reintroducing the type that has performed well for us.""

WATCH | Richard Steer on the airworthiness of the 737 Max:

Richard Steer on 737 Max airworthiness Duration 0:53 Richard Steer the vice-president in charge of operations and maintenance for Air Canada says it's human nature for the public to have some trepidation about the 737 Max but he adds that the aircraft is safe and he would put his family onboard.

'You need to disclose disclose disclose'

But the planned PR campaigns don't go far enough for Paul Njoroge. His three children wife and mother-in-law died when a 737 Max went down in Ethiopia just months after the first Max disaster. He wants airlines' websites to mention the crashes.

""If you're going to disclose you need to disclose disclose disclose"" said Njoroge. ""Say 'we're giving you an option to opt out this plane because it killed 346 people.""

Njoroge said he didn't know about the Max crash in Indonesia when he booked his family's plane tickets. If he knew he said he wouldn't have put them on the flight.

""I'm sure some potential passengers will not know why you are telling them it's a 737 Max and they can opt out. You have to remind them ... that way they can make an informed decision.""

Chris and Clariss Moore's daughter also died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash on her way to a UN assembly in Nairobi. They say Danielle was an activist and that if she were alive today she too would be demanding more answers from Transport Canada Boeing and the FAA about the recertification process.

""I don't trust this plane and I never will"" said Clariss Moore.

""We just want to make sure that they've done everything within the rules and the guidelines of the regulations and to satisfy ourselves that it's safe"" said Chris Moore.

WATCH | Chris and Clariss Moore still wary of the 737 Max:

Chris and Clariss Moore still wary of the 737 Max Duration 1:40 Chris and Clariss Moore's daughter Danielle died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash of a 737 Max in 2019. The couple says they don't trust Boeing or the U.S. regulator's assurances that the aircraft is safe after what happened.

Can't brand away issues

Chris Clearfield a pilot of small planes and co-author of Meltdown: Why Our Systems Fail and What We Can Do said he believes airlines ""have a real uphill battle"" ahead to change the public's perception.

He said ValuJet was able to rebrand its airline business after a deadly crash in 1996 in Florida for example but rebranding a widely used jet like the 737 Max is a completely different kind of challenge.

""This is an industry-wide problem"" said Clearfield. ""You can't sort of brand away the issue.""

He said even though the airline industry is certain about the Max's safety now it needs to be honest with passengers and emphasize that there were problems and the industry learned from them. He expects that with time and a clean safety record travellers' uneasiness about this jet will fade.

American Airlines has been flying the plane for about two weeks and has completed more than 100 flights. The airline said so far ""bookings on the Max are comparable to other aircraft and we aren't seeing data to suggest customers don't want to fly on the aircraft.""

WestJet plans to fly the Max commercially on Thursday pending Transport Canada approval. The airline announced it plans to operate three weekly round-trip flights between Calgary and Toronto for the next month as it evaluates adding more routes.

Air Canada has its own Boeing 737 Max simulator where pilots are spending hours retraining on the jet and learning what has changed over the last 22 months. Transport Canada made the retraining mandatory. (Ousama Farag/CBC News)

Arcus’ CD73 inhibitor challenges AZ’s oleclumab at least six others follow in oncology: Data Byte

As Arcus becomes the second company to report clinical data for a CD73 inhibitor in pancreatic cancer behind front-runner AstraZeneca at least six more teams have early-stage clinical programs targeting the immuno-metabolism modulating receptor.

An interim readout from the Phase I/Ib ARC-8 trial showed that a combo including the small molecule CD73 inhibitor AB680 from Arcus Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ:RCUS) led to an overall response rate of 41% with seven partial responses among 17 evaluable patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. One patient converted to a complete response after the Dec. 9 2020 efficacy data cut-off...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZHBhZ2V0b2RheS5jb20vbWVldGluZ2NvdmVyYWdlL21naWNzLzkwNzQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Target to Attack in Stomach Cancer,"This article is a collaboration between MedPage Today and:

Patients with untreated advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer lived longer without disease progression with the addition of a fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor to chemotherapy a randomized trial showed.

Median progression-free survival (PFS) increased from 7.4 months with chemotherapy alone to 9.5 months with bemarituzumab. The size of the PFS benefit increased with levels of FGFR2b expression. Median overall survival (OS) was 12.9 months with chemotherapy and not yet reached in patients who also received the FGFR2b inhibitor.

Adverse events (AEs) that occurred more often with bemarituzumab included stomatitis and ocular effects particularly corneal AEs reported Zev Wainberg MD of the University of California Los Angeles at the Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium virtual meeting.

Wainberg noted that ""[this] is the first study to evaluate targeting the overexpression of FGFR2b in any cancer and the first randomized dataset of any fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor in any malignancy. In our study approximately 30% of patients had a first-line non-HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma overexpressing FGFR by a centrally performed IHC (immunohistochemistry) test.""

""Bemarituzumab added to modified FOLFOX6 chemotherapy led to clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in PFS OS and overall response rate [ORR]. The results support a prospective randomized phase III study in gastric/gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma and the evaluation of bemarituzumab to treat other FGFR2b-positive tumor types"" he stated.

FGFR2b overexpression varies from 3%-60% of gastric cancers depending on tumor stage and assay. FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have proven active in cancers associated with FGFR mutations fusions or translocations.

Bemarituzumab selectively and specifically targets FGFR2b. In a preliminary clinical evaluation the monoclonal antibody demonstrated single-agent activity in heavily treated FGFR2b-positive gastric cancer including an objective response rate of 18%. The results supported continued evaluation in the prospective randomized phase II FIGHT trial.

Investigators in the multicenter trial enrolled patients with untreated unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma and FGFR2b overexpression or gene amplification. Patients were randomized to modified FOLFOX6 paired with bemarituzumab or placebo. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS. Statistical significance defined by two-sided alpha of 0.2 was tested sequentially for PFS OS and ORR.

Data analysis included 155 randomized patients. In 83.2% of patients FGFR2b status was confirmed by IHC 12.9% by IHC and circulating tumor (ct) DNA and 3.9% by ctDNA.

Analysis of the primary endpoint yielded a 32% reduction in the hazard ratio for disease progression or death among patients allocated to bemarituzumab (95% CI 0.44-1.04 P=0.0727). The proportion of patients who were progression free at 9 months was 52.5% with bemarituzumab and 33.8% with placebo.

Subgroup analysis by FGFR2b overexpression showed larger PFS benefits for bemarituzumab: 10.2 versus 7.3 months for IHC 2+/3+ ≥5% (n=148 HR 0.54 95% CI 0.33-0.87) and 14.1 versus 7.3 months for IHC 2+/3+ ≥10% (n=96 95% CI 0.44 95% CI 0.25-0.77).

Median OS was 12.9 months with placebo but not yet reached in the bemarituzumab arm representing a 42% reduction in the HR (95% 0.35-0.95 P=0.0268). ORR was 47% with bemarituzumab and 33% with placebo. Median duration of response was 12.2 versus 7.1 months with the anti-FGFR2b antibody and placebo respectively.

Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurred slightly more often with bemarituzumab (82.9% vs 74.0%) but serious AEs affected similar proportions of patients (31.6% vs 36.4%). More patients in the bemarituzumab arm discontinued any component of chemotherapy because of AEs (46.1% vs 36.4%) and discontinuation of randomized therapy occurred significantly more often with bemarituzumab (34.2% vs 5.2%). Duration of exposure to randomized therapy was similar (24 vs 26 weeks).

Among grade ≥3 TEAEs stomatitis occurred more often in the bemarituzumab arm (9.2% vs 1.3%). Corneal evaluation was required at baseline and every 8 weeks thereafter until the end of treatment. Overall corneal events occurred in 67.1% and 10.4% of the bemarituzumab and placebo arms including grade 3 in 23.7% and 0%.

Wainberg reported that 26.3% of patients in the bemarituzumab arm discontinued treatment because of corneal events while none in the placebo arm did. The condition resolved in 12 of the 20 affected patients.

The results are consistent with those of other trials that have evaluated chemotherapy-antibody combinations for advanced and metastatic gastric/GEJ cancer said invited discussant Rutika Mehta MD of Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa Florida.

""These results mean there is additional biomarker selection beyond HER2"" she said. ""About 30% of patients can be FGFR2b positive; higher expressers get more benefit. However there were more adverse events with bemarituzumab. About a fourth of patients had corneal adverse events and 40% were unresolved.""

""A phase III study is warranted to confirm the findings in a larger population with special attention being paid to minimizing adverse events"" Mehta concluded.

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yd2FyZC5jb20vbmV3cy82MDk1MjYvYnJvd24tdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1hbnRpc2VtaXRpc20tcHJvdGVzdHMtZW5jYW1wbWVudC_SAVhodHRwczovL2ZvcndhcmQuY29tL25ld3MvNjA5NTI2L2Jyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktYW50aXNlbWl0aXNtLXByb3Rlc3RzLWVuY2FtcG1lbnQvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Everyone gets to be uncomfortable’: How Jewish students at Brown kept antisemitism at bay,"By Mira Fox May 3 2024

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9qYW5lbGxlLWJyb3duLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtYmlydGhkYXktdHdvLW1vbnRocy1hZnRlci1zb24tZ2Fycmlzb24tZGVhdGgtODY0NDI3ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Janelle Brown Celebrates 55th Birthday Two Months After Son Garrison's Death,"Janelle Brown is marking a milestone two months after the death of her son Garrison Brown.

The Patriots met with Maye on multiple occasions including a trip to North Carolina for the Tar Heels Pro Day. During that trip Mayo and company spoke with longtime and well-respected coach Mack Brown. Mayo specifically said he received a “glowing recommendation” from the Tar Heels head coach and noted how that conversation eased any nerves about drafting Maye.

Brown a 46-year coaching veteran met with a handful of New England reporters on a video conference Monday and relayed what he told Mayo and company during the pre-draft process.

“I’ve learned that I want the high school coach to tell me the truth in recruiting so I’m very honest with the NFL coaches” Brown said. “This is important to them.

“So with Coach Mayo I knew this is huge for him just starting out in this first year. So I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye. We all put our checks in the mouth of players and that’s what you’re (Mayo) gonna do. And I would rather have Drake Maye than anybody in the country leading my football team.’

I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye.’ Mack Brown on conversations with Jerod Mayo

Brown’s recommendation to Mayo was echoed throughout the pre-draft process and again Monday. Brown praised Maye for his toughness competitiveness and ability to lead a rocker room with his mix of positive reinforcement and constructive criticism.

Brown even spoke to the Maye athletic and authentic family along with the quarterback’s longtime girlfriend. Maye introduced his three brothers and girlfriend to reporters during his introductory press conference at Gillette Stadium.

“He’s an unbelievable person” Brown said. “He’s one of the nicest toughest most competitive young people I’ve ever been around. I’ve said often I would adopt him. He’s that perfect of a kid. It sounds kind of corny but it’s true.”

Brown also relayed a story as to how Maye included other position groups whenever he was approached with an NIL deal. It was one of the many ways Maye proved his worth as a teammate.

“So if they came and said ‘We want you to do this advertisement.’ He said ‘Well the offensive linemen need to be with me and they need to be paid.’ Or ‘Well we want you to get fed through the seafood company for the year.’ And he said ‘That’s great the receivers and their families need to get fed too.'”

But Brown made it clear to New England’s organization the competitor they were getting too.

Story continues below advertisement

“He is not coming to Boston to lose” Brown said.

It seems that message was heard loud and clear throughout the Patriots organization."

Similar to the telecom business the Chinese tech giant has also advanced itself in enterprise solutions CLOUD and other key tech sectors. Furthermore Huawei’s smartphone business has also seen remarkable growth in the past years.

However the company had heavily relied on U.S.-made technologies and after the inclusion in the U.S. Entity List Huawei was barred from accessing important components which also increased some of the big problems such as the lack of chipsets.

According to a new report from NikkeiAsia the Chinese tech giant has sped up efforts to build its own chipsets and engaging with several Chinese chipmakers for possible investments. On the other hand the company keeps polishing its own chip design development skills.

To complete this goal Huawei has taken stakes in 20 semiconductor-related firms over the course of the last one and a half years while half of these deals have been made in the past five months. These investments mainly aim at chipmaking sectors that are currently dominated by tech giants from the U.S. Japan South Korea and Taiwan.

The investment also aims for chip design tools semiconductor materials compound semiconductor and chip production and testing equipment which are essential for producing a complete chip product. These also put a spotlight on Huawei’s aim to free itself from the dependence on U.S. made technologies and lead the tech development by itself.

Furthermore Huawei is also building a small-scale chip manufacturing plant for research purposes in Shenzhen of which reports also emerged last year.

“Broadly speaking the importance of Huawei’s R&D production line in Shenzhen is to help accelerate chip development and to make sure all its designs can later be put into production smoothly” said a source. “Construction of the line began in the latter half of 2020.”

Why Huawei is investing?

In May 2019 the U.S. commerce department added Huawei to the Entity List which is the first ban on Huawei that prohibited the company from purchasing U.S.-made technology or selling its products in the country.

After a year Huawei banned chipset suppliers including TSMC from producing Huawei designed chipsets which increased Huawei’s problems related to semiconductors. Later in September the U.S. completely restricted Huawei’s access to chipsets.

However in May 2019 Huawei also made its first investment and ramp it up in the coming year. Check the image below to learn more.

The Aim:

“The company aims to step into any area that it lacks in chip development from chip production materials and equipment to design software.” said a source to Nikkei.

To increase investment count Huawei is in talks to take part in SiEn Integrated Circuits a chipmaker founded in 2018. With this investment Huawei would access a broad range of integrated chip development services from design and production to packaging and testing.

All of the investment-related work is handled by the Hubble Technology Investment a Huawei subsidiary with a paid-in capital of 2.7 billion yuan ($417 million). Since its establishment in 2019 Hubble has made investments in at least 25 Chinese tech companies of which 20 mainly develop semiconductor products.

Task/Challenge:

Despite all of the experience in chip designing Huawei still needs the equipment to manufacture the chip designs.

From here we need to mention the very recent investment at NineCub a Chinese chip-design toolmaker founded in 2011.

Chip design tools also known as electronic design automation tools are crucial for companies looking to design their own chipsets. The market and experts for the advanced chip design tools are controlled by only limited companies two of which are Synopsys and Cadence Design Systems both of these are American. This led to U.S. dominance in this field and made a big impact after the full restrictions on Huawei.

HiSilicon Huawei’s chip designing subsidiary was China’s biggest chip developer and designed chipsets for Huawei smartphones network gears as well as servers. After the U.S. ban Richard Yu CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group officially informed that the company will stop making Kirin chipset after September 2020.

The report reveals that the investments also target local companies that supply materials for semiconductors such as SICC and Tankblue Semiconductor which make silicon carbide. Chip production equipment makers including Shenzhen Skyverse and Ningbo Allsemi Microelectronics Equipment are also on the list. To be mentioned these fields are also dominated by tech companies from the U.S. and Japan.

This is undoubtedly the advancement of the Chinese tech giant as it is marching ahead with the will to capitalize on this opportunity and to build its own semiconductor.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevada hospitality employees are in the fast lane to receive a COVID-19 vaccine but face a long line before it’s their turn.

In the state’s latest COVID-19 playbook front-line casino and resort workers are in the fourth category of workers eligible for the vaccine through Nevada’s “frontline/essential workforce lane.” Workers in education and agriculture and certain state and local government employees are just a few of the groups ahead of them in line.

Leisure and hospitality employees make up a quarter of the state’s total private workforce. Thousands of these workers have been put face to face with visitors since June when casinos reopened. Gov. Steve Sisolak recently extended into February a 25 percent capacity limit on casinos which the state has previously identified as a source of spread.

“I think (getting hospitality workers vaccinated) is the first step to turning it all around” said one Strip dealer who was granted anonymity to protect her job at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

Vaccinating ‘critical’ workers

The latest vaccination guidelines from the state were announced Monday. Brian Labus an assistant professor of epidemiology at UNLV and a member of the medical team advising Sisolak said the updated playbook largely follows federal recommendations.

“There are local decisions we can make but the basic groups are decided at the federal level and rolled out similarly state to state” he said. But “we want to protect (hospitality workers) because they’re putting themselves in situations where they’re potentially at risk by being around tourists from all around the world.”

As of November there were roughly 301700 leisure and hospitality workers in the state according to data from the Department of Employment Training and Rehabilitation.

Labus said it’s not yet clear when hospitality workers will be eligible for the vaccine. He expects that priority groups will continue to shift as federal guidance is updated.

Virginia Valentine president of the Nevada Resort Association said Monday that Sisolak’s decision to expedite front-line hospitality workers is “welcome and encouraging news.”

“While Nevada’s resorts continue to take responsible actions to protect employees and guests … swift vaccine access will provide another layer of protection for resort employees their families and the public” she said in a statement. “Further protecting the frontline members of Nevada’s economic engine sends a clear message to visitors and meeting and convention organizers that Nevada is the world’s safest travel and tourism destination.”

Culinary Local 226 which represents about 60000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno has been working with Sisolak’s office and the resort association to ensure that hospitality workers have access to the COVID-19 vaccine said Geoconda Argüello-Kline the union’s secretary-treasurer.

“The hospitality industry is critical for the well-being of the entire state of Nevada and the Culinary union is supportive of the governor’s designation of hospitality workers as essential” she said in a statement.

MGM also provided a statement saying the company will make “the necessary resources available to achieve this critical objective” of immunizing workers.

Spokespeople for Las Vegas Sands Corp. Caesars Entertainment Inc. and Boyd Gaming Corp. did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Wynn Resorts Ltd. declined to comment and a spokesman for Red Rock Resorts Inc. referred to the resort association’s statement.

Waiting their turn

The state’s new vaccine rollout plan divides eligible populations into two concurrent lanes: one based on occupation the other based on age underlying health conditions and housing status.

Labus said some hospitality workers will have early access to the vaccine if they fall in a higher age bracket or have underlying health conditions.

“What you’re left with … are people who are younger and healthier to begin with” he said. “We’re not talking about leaving everyone in hospitality until the end. … There may be a large portion already vaccinated by the time we open it to the group of workers.”

Gladis Blanco a guest room attendant of eight years at Bellagio and a Culinary member said hospitality workers are on the front lines of the pandemic interacting with customers from across the world. She thanked Sisolak for “acknowledging that hospitality workers are essential” and said she would feel “peace of mind” that a vaccine could keep her and her family safe.

“I will be first in line for the vaccination when it is my turn” Blanco said through a Culinary spokeswoman statement.

Caesars Palace dealer Tony Pontecorvo said he doesn’t mind hospitality workers’ place in the state’s playbook.

“It’s easy to say we should be higher up but then you have to decide who to move down” he said. “It’s hard to say who I should jump in front of.”

A cook at an MGM property who is being granted anonymity to protect her job said she is comfortable waiting to receive the vaccine.

She acknowledged that vaccination could protect her and others from the coronavirus but she said she is concerned that current vaccine iterations wouldn’t prevent a newly identified more contagious strain. The cook said she already has been exposed to COVID-19; her mom contracted it and suffered “pretty bad” symptoms.

Last month President-elect Joe Biden’s surgeon general nominee Vivek Murthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that there’s “no reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed will not be effective against this virus as well.”

The cook said she was hoping for an “alternative to come into place” with higher efficacy by the time she was eligible though she would take the shot if her employer made vaccination a condition of her job.

“I don’t want to be exposed to something that’s stronger than what I witnessed my mom going through” she said. “It would just depend on the circumstance.”

The Southern Nevada Health District notes that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are after both doses more than 90 percent effective at protecting people from getting sick with COVID-19.

They are the only vaccines currently approved for COVID-19 and they were developed with the same level of U.S. Food and Drug Administration review as vaccines for polio smallpox meningitis and more according to the health district.

The Cosmopolitan dealer said she was ecstatic to learn that casino workers would be included in the prioritization lane.

“It’s going to be exciting to see what’s around the corner (once the vaccine is widely distributed)” she said. “I feel like the whole world is going to come to Vegas.”

There's nothing like going for a night out on the town getting all dressed up and dancing with your friends with a drink or two in your hand.

But it's nearly been a year since we've been able to step foot in a nightclub and it's safe to say some of us miss letting off some steam on the weekend.

Across Devon we've got some incredible clubs that have sadly been closed since March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and it's uncertain when they will be able to re-open to the public once again.

Hopefully at some point in 2021 we get to experience that Friday night feeling once again!

As we miss having a good boogie on the dancefloor we thought we'd look back at some of the best clubs across our county both past and present for a sense of much-loved nostalgia.

What's your favourite nightclub in Devon that's either still around or was once the place to be? Let us know in the comments below!

Torquay

Park Lane

Park Lane is more than likely the first place you go to when you've just turned 18 and live in the Bay.

There's a room for everyone in Park Lane as each room has different types of music to dance to - from club classics to chart hits.

Let's not forget how incredible it is when there is an event at The Foundry next door and the hallway that links the two venues opens.

Once you've had a couple of drinks try not to get lost - as this is an issue I think many of us have had!

Yates

(Image: Colleen Smith)

A place you can enjoy in the day and evening as we see Yates turn from a bar to club.

With a bar upstairs and downstairs you're never waiting too long for a drink before you take to the dance floor for a good dance with your friends.

But we cant forget to mention the stairs you have to climb to get to the dancefloor why are there so many?!

Let's not forget this building was once the scene of a notorious £6 million bank heist.

What do you think of lockdown 3.0? Let us know in our survey here.

Revolution

A slightly smaller venue to go on a weekend but still a great night.

Like Yates you can enjoy Revolution in the day and night especially their bottomless brunches which we're particularly fond of.

We always end up spending way too much money on the photo booth there as well let's be honest no one can resist it really.

Route 66

Although it had its fair share of rebrands over the years Route 66 holds a special place in many peoples hearts.

There was no better place to be on a Sunday night in Torquay which oddly enough were busier than a Saturday as all drinks would be 66p both a good and bad thing for those working Monday mornings!

With two dance floors you never had an issue with getting served quickly as on the first floor the bar took up most of the space.

Under 18s could even enjoy the venue on Friday nights as every month they'd open its doors to their younger audience but that stopped after because the club ran into trouble.

Sadly we said goodbye to Route 66 in 2005 after it re-opened under a new management with the name Play which closed down years later.

Venue

After stopping in Route 66 people often made their way to Venue an extremely popular place to go on a Saturday and Sunday night.

It was known as the place to be if you wanted to sing your heart out to classic pop cheesy tunes and sipping on a jug of Cheeky Vimto (remember those?!)

We can't forget the podiums on the dancefloor and the VIP lounge oh and let's not fail to mention the sticky carpets if you dropped something it was usually best to just leave it.

It was a great place to go for 15 years but sadly closed in 2017 when it got turned into The Foundry which is still a popular place to go now.

Valbonnes

Ah the only nightclub in Torre at the top of town which we all made the walk to in our way too high heels that were hurting our feet before we even got to the door.

Most people probably went here on a Thursday night for their special £12 all you can drink offer.

It closed in 2011 after it was transformed into a play cafe.

Cafe Mambo





Cafe Mambo wasn't a nightclub yet it was definitely more than just your average bar. It had two dancefloors one that played cheesy pop (the dancefloor situated right next to the bar) and one that played R&B and dance music.

Their Wednesday nights were particularly popular with nightclub revellers and their smoking terrace often became overcrowded (if you could find a seat) because it was the only place to escape the sweaty dancefloor and bar.

Cafe Mambo which was owned by the Lifestyle Hospitality Group closed in January 2016. They also closed Tiger Bills Fast Eddie's Pool Hall and Burgerfest.

Claire's/Bohemia

Do you remember it as Claire's or Bohemia? Either way this Torquay nightclub is one that is truly missed.

In May 2007 (yes it was that long ago) Claire's closed and re-opened as Bohemia - where you could hire out a booth for £150.

The club was renowned for hosting guests DJ's over the years including Trevor Nelson and Pendulum as well as boyband Blazin' Squad.

Tiffany's

For those of a certain age the name itself is enough to bring back sweet memories of boogie nights dancing around handbags and... scissors.

For the ‘70s generation ‘Tiffs’ as it was affectionately known was the place to go on Thursday and Saturday nights.

It was the number one night spot in Exeter often with queues which ran three deep all the way round to the Bishop’s Blaize pub.

Many city couples met at the former grocery warehouse down on the Quay.

Some girls would carry scissors to trim their boyfriends hair at the entrance if they were refused entry.

Tiffany’s attracted some of the top bands of the time. David Bowie performed there on October 17 1969 while during the ‘70s Mud performed their hits Dyna-Mite Tiger Feet Lonely This Christmas and KC and the Sunshine Band performed That's The Way I like It and Please Don't Go. Top DJs like Dave Lee Travis also appeared.

Among the music they would have danced to was the smooth tones of Tony Osborne singer with the Big T (for Tiffanys) Band

Talking to the Echo back in 2005 he said: “It was the place to be seen in Exeter. Everybody went there and it was such a wonderful crowd.

“There were no jeans or T-shirts in those days. The men wore suits and ties and even their hair had to be a certain length or they were not let in.

“It got to the point where girlfriends would carry a pair of scissors with them to snip off any hair over the collar to ensure the men got in.

“It worked too because I recall Tiffany’s was voted the second best nightclub in Britain for good behaviour.

“It was great for the band. We were there for 12 years playing all the chart music of the day and we did it with just one rehearsal of two hours from 5pm to 7pm before opening at 7.30.

“In those days the girls always arrived first and were on the dance floor and would dance together around their handbags until the blokes arrived and they all split up.”

In June 1978 police were called to the Quay Club when someone let off a CS canister at 11.30pm causing chaos. Scores of young people ran in panic trampling over each other to escape the fumes. Many ended up outside the club retching and crying.

Ambulances and the fire brigade were called but no one was taken to hospital. It was estimated that there were 200 people in the club at the time including a group of Marines.

Tiffanys was the brainchild of John Portley the man who became known as Exeter’s Mr Entertainment. Exeter born educated at Exeter School and a trained accountant Mr Portley had the happy knack of turning places into sparkling successes.

The story started in the mid-1960s when he took on the lease of the vacant warehouse in Commercial Road.

He made one part of it into the Quay Club Disco and decided to find a sub-tenant for the remaining part to help out with the rent.

Unhappily as it at first appeared then there were no takers — but Mr Portley was not that easily beaten. He decided to turn the drab wing of the warehouse into a glitzy dance paradise and he called it Tiffanys.

It was to become the jewel in an entertainment empire run from Exeter’s Queen Street that also included spin-off Tiffs in Torquay and Plymouth.

Newton Abbot

Jolly Farmer

Ah the folks of Newton Abbot know that this is where the night starts.

No one really stays inside the actual pub as they take to the beer garden outside which turns into some sort of jungle-like club.

There's plenty of seating around the 'dance floor' too for when those feet start to hurt from dancing a bit too much.

Bar 7



Once you've had a couple of drinks in Bar 7 people usually make their way across the road (literally) to Bar 7.

With two rooms because can either enjoy club classics and chart hits or go upstairs for a more old school cheesy feel with the likes of ABBA S-club 7 and Steps.

Outside there is even a room with some arcade games which never fails to make everyone laugh as we try to watch slightly intoxicated people score high on the punch machine - if they can hit it that is!

And of course we can't forget to mention the pole on the first floor that everyone always seems to fight to get to.

Enigma/Rafters

Rafters or Enigma? However you remember it it's safe to say that we were all gutted when we found out the nightclub had closed on New Year's Day.

And it turns out a lot more people met their loved ones in there than I realised whoever thought that Enigma could be the place where relationships blossomed?

Enigma also saw some celebs over the years we saw Tim Westwood Tinchy Strider Joel Corry and Geordie Shore’s James Tindale.

They also hosted hot tub parties UV paint parties foam parties and who remembers the Willy Wonka experience?

There were Umpa Lumpas a chocolate fountain and we even had Willy Wonka bars that contained real golden tickets.

The fridges were always fully stocked with every VK flavour you could wish for and if that wasn't enough you could grab a burger at the end of the night as you made your way out.

Ah those were the days.

Exeter

Fever and Boutique

Once you've braved the enormous queue and actually make it into the club itself Fever is always packed full of people especially students.

Student nights are always rammed full of people as the drinks are a lot cheaper than the weekend.

If you've managed to get yourself a booth in Fever we applaud you and chances are once you claimed it you spent the rest of your night guarding it for when you wanted a dance break!

Timepiece

Timepiece has been a go-to destination for 25 years now and we can see why it's a great place to be.

It's also had some pretty famous names enter the venue such as Will Young Chris Martin from Coldplay and Joss Stone who even celebrated her 18th here.

It's always a good night in timepiece for music dancing and a great choice of alcohol.

Let's not forget about all the clubs that are no more but still hold many incredible memories for a lot of us. From 66p Blue VK's at Route 66 to dancing on podiums.

These are some clubs we miss that we wish were still around today.

Arena

What we now know as Unit 1 used to be the student favourite Arena which even made its way onto a Channel 4 documentary which we all bragged about at the time.

Rosie's/Mosaic

Now this is a club that only closed fairy recently back in August 2019.

Once known as Mosaic it was then turned into Rosie's before being replaced with Zinc Bar & Club.

Rosie's which opened in 2016 following a £750000 revamp announced their closure on their Facebook page.

Tiffany and Mambo





The two clubs and a restaurant extended the offering available away from the main city centre down on the Quay.

Tiffany's gained some publicity for being Exeter's first ‘pole dancing' club although it was described as adult entertainment.

In January 2009 operating company Lifestyle Enterprises announced they were not able to extend their lease with Enterprise Inns the owners. It is now the home of Samuel Jones.

Club Rococo

Club Rococo held its last night on Christmas Eve 2016 much to the dismay of many in Exeter who partied got drunk and even met their future spouses at the venue.

The sudden closure of the Mary Arches street nightclub which opened in 1996 came as a shock to many.

Rococo was famed for its popular Monday nights singles’ nights and large central dance floor.

Among those whose who were reported being sad by the news was Stefan Price reminisced about the time he got so drunk in 1997 he “was found in a telephone box on Christmas morning” by the police and his dad.

And with a point that will unlikely face dispute Maria Taylor said: “Those walls could tell some tales.”

It was reopened as Fever & Boutique in September 2017.

Warehouse Boxes and Boogies

In 2006 it was announced Warehouse Boxes and Boogies on Commercial Road at Exeter Quay had been taken over by Lifestyle Enterprises (UK) Limited after the previous owners went into administration.

The nightclub complex based in a Grade II-listed building was created out of two bombed warehouses originally constructed in the early 1800s.

It reopened as Mambo.

Fever in Exmouth

(Image: Google)

Closing it's doors in August 2019 it was quickly turned into Popworld which is a firm favourite by local clubbers now.

Fever was there for 4 and a half years and was always a great night out at the weekend after a long week at work.

Nightclub revellers were gutted when Sidmouth's only nightclub announced their shock closure.

In 2018 work began on the Fore Street part of the building that has planning permission and the owners envision that the overall site would become a ‘high-quality development’ that would serve ‘the current trend for coffee shops which become wine bars/restaurants in the evening’.

The planning application statement submitted on behalf of Chris Eccles director of Residential Trust Ltd says: “Despite the attempt to make the reduced nightclub area commercially viable trade has continued to decline and as a result the decision was made to close the nightclub and it will not reopen under the current ownership.

“We are aware that since the recent closure announcement local residents have spoken out in support of the nightclub. However that verbal support has not been mirrored by actual use of the club over the past three years.”

Q Club

The nightclub was one of a number of businesses that closed in January 2016 when Lifestyle Hospitality Group ceased trading – before reopening in June later that year only to close again in the last 12 months.

Nightclub revellers have many fond memories of Q Club and many even met their partners in there.

Since it's sudden closure The Q Club in Exmouth on the corner of Manchester Street and Elm Grove has been knocked down to make way for flats.

The plan also includes car parking and cycle storage and has drew the backing of Exmouth town council’s planning committee.

North Devon

Marisco - Woolacombe

One of the oldest nightclubs in the UK was Marisco's in Woolacombe and it defiantly saw some interesting trends across the decades.

First open in 1967 it sadly closed its doors in 2016 after the nightclub manager Joey Dicker announced that after 25 years he was handing over the 'reins' to the club.

Tommy Deaves and Jenny Beardshall from Westward Ho! took over the club from Joey.

Zenaxis - Barnstaple

Ah Zenaxis where you'd keep on dancing until the music quite literally stopped.

It used to be on the Strand in Barnstaple but sadly closed many years ago.

It's since been replaces by the Water Gate Wetherspoons.

Kaos- Barnstaple

This iconic venue had many different names over the years.

Whether you remember it as The Worx Babylon Club Tropicana or most commonly Kaos when it reached peak popularity in the 90s- it hold memories for most of us.

It had enough space to fill 825 people with three bars cloakrooms and two dance floors it was always a good night!

The building went up for sale in 2019 for £225000.

This super club has been well and truly missed since shutting its doors for the final time in 2005.

Who can forget the huge gold statue of Colossus inside with gold horses leaping off the walls.

Fever - Barnstaple

Some of you may remember this place as Bar Toko but it's been Fever now for a few years.

It's often the place you end up in at the end of the night to enjoy a VK or two.

The club briefly reopened last year and operated as a bar with full table service.

But being in there and seeing we couldn't use the dancefloor just brought memories of good nights and reminded us on what we were missing out on!

Caesars Palace - Bideford





We know that Caesars Palace quite literally had the best sign ever but when it got rebranded as just 'Palace' it changed to a more simplistic look.

With two dance floors having different music there's something for everyone. Whether you like throwbacks from the noughties or more chart music Palace has you covered.

They even open their doors for the first Tuesday of every month for adults with learning and other disabilities so they are also able to enjoy the taste of nightlife.

Despite its new name Bidefordians will always remember it as Cheesers.",,,,,,

Capital One (COF) admitted that it had deliberately failed to implement and maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program with it also not reporting thousands of suspicious currency transactions.

The violations are believed to have occurred from at least 2008 through 2014 and relate to Capital One’s Check Cashing Group.

Capital One also acknowledged that it failed to report suspicious transactions by convicted money launderer Domenick Pucillo an associate of the Genovese organized crime family.

Despite being informed about Pucillo’s association with criminal activity in 2013 Capital One continued to process over 20000 transactions valued at approximately $160 million.

FinCEN’s Director Kenneth Blanco called the violations “egregious” adding that Capital One’s behavior “puts our nation and our people at risk” by depriving law enforcement of this information. (See COF stock analysis on TipRanks)

RBC Capital analyst Jon Arfstrom reiterated his Hold rating on COF three days ago and set a price target of $120. (7% upside potential).

Capital One will report earnings on January 26 and Arfstrom expects first quarter earnings per share (EPS) to come in at around $5.07.

Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 12 Buys and 2 Holds. The average price target of $115.31 suggests that COF shares are almost fully priced with minimal upside potential of around 2% over the next 12 months.

COF scores a 9 out of 10 on Tipranks’ Smart Score rating indicating that it has a strong chance of beating market expectations.

As Democrats railed against the insurrectionists some Republicans repeatedly drew comparisons between last summer's Black Lives Matter protests and the Capitol siege of Jan. 6.

Comparisons between Black Lives Matter and what happened on Capitol Hill are false equivalencies said several experts and advocates who spoke with ABC News.

'They lit actual flames!'

During Wednesday's hearing several Congress members made impassioned cases for and against impeaching President Trump. During these speeches some lawmakers denounced what they called the white supremacy among the Capitol rioters while others accused Democrats of hypocrisy by supporting Black Lives Matter protests but condemning Trump supporters.

""If we fail to remove a White supremacist president who incited a white supremacist insurrection it's communities like Missouri's first district that suffer the most"" said Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri during her speech in support of impeachment. ""The 117th Congress must understand that we have a mandate to legislate in defense of Black lives the first step in that process is to root out white supremacy starting with impeaching the White supremacist in chief.""

Rep. Bush made history as the first Black Congresswoman to be elected in the state. Missouri’s first district has a majority Black population and usually leans blue according to an election website.

In her speech during the hearing Rep. Maxine Waters D-Calif. condemned the president for ""radicalizing his supporters"" and ""inciting them to willingly join with White supremacists Neo-Nazis and para-military extremists in a siege of the United States Capitol building.""

In a video statement released following the vote the president condemned last week's violence but did not take responsibility for his role in the events. In the past the president has denied accusations of racism. During the final presidential debate on Oct. 22 when moderator Kristen Welker asked the president about racial strife and hate in America he answered by saying he is the ""least racist person in this room.""

Instead of rebuking the president for any role in inciting the riot some Republicans drew comparisons between the Capitol siege and the Black Lives Matter protests that swept across the nation last year following the deaths of George Floyd Breonna Taylor and several victims of police brutality.

Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida defended Trump saying ""some have cited the metaphor that the president lit the flames... Well they lit actual flames!"" accusing Democrats of enabling civil unrest that ensued in some cities during the BLM protests.

The unrest in some cities after some Black Lives Matter protests included vandalism and looting; however many of these events were rooted in confrontations with police after peaceful protesters left. The vast majority of demonstrations were peaceful and leading BLM activists repeatedly distanced themselves from agent provocateurs and instigators.

BLM and the failed Capitol insurrection cannot be compared according to Cynthia Miller-Idriss professor of education and sociology at American University and author of ""Hate in the Homeland: The New Global Far Right.""

""I don't see a parallel between the two"" said Miller-Idriss. ""I think making a connection that there was actually incitement of violence or that there's any equivalence in the violence itself is just absurd.""

“What happened at the Capitol you can't call that a protest anymore” said Miller-Idriss. “That was a riot it was sedition it was an insurrection a siege...it was a domestic terrorist attack.”

Stark differences have been pointed out between the protests for racial justice and the riot stoked by unfounded claims of a stolen presidential election.

2 sets of rules?

The majority white ""Stop the Steal"" mob that stormed the nation's Capitol building was a mix of several right-wing extremist groups according to Larry Rosenthal chair and lead researcher of the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies.

Some were members of far-right armed militias. Others were right-wing populists whom he described as ""rally-goers"" who are ""fanatical about Donald Trump and his presidency.""

Rosenthal also described two subsets within the extremist groups. One is comprised of anti-government militias whom he referred to as ""people who don't recognize the legitimacy"" of government on both state and local levels and often deem themselves ""sovereign citizens."" The other includes white nationalists those he said are ""electrified and mobilize[d] going on the streets to stand up to Black Lives Matter and the fantasy of Antifa"".

""Donald Trump asserts his role as the leader of the right-wing militias"" said Rosenthal. ""Those people who call themselves 'patriots' they have lived with the idea of a spark that would lead to the civil war ... it's been in their largely fantasy world for four decades. And suddenly there is this summons from the president of the United States.""

There was a ""stark difference"" in the makeup of the Black Lives Matter protests and the Capitol riots according to professor Mark Anthony Neal chair of the Department of African and African American Studies at Duke University.

Neal described the Black Lives Matter protests last year as ""a multi-racial social justice movement much like the civil rights movement in the 1960s.""

""Many people of color Black folks are killed doing mundane things … just literally sleeping in their home walking down the block"" Neal told ABC News. ""What Black Lives Matter was trying to bring to the forefront was the ways in which Black and people of color are always over-policed.""

Non-violent protesters during the summer faced brute force from federal officers but rioters were met with minimal federal response.

""[Rioters] acted with an extraordinary sense of impunity"" said Rosenthal. ""Like nothing was going to happen to them.""

Federal authorities launched an active investigation into the attack on the Capitol and there are over 275 open investigations Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin told reporters on a conference call Friday. As of 8 a.m. Friday morning the Department of Justice opened 98 criminal cases -- a majority of which are federal felony cases Sherwin said.

Marc Morial president and CEO of the National Urban League said the double standard in policing is ""a long-standing issue of both covert and overt racism and how law enforcement reacts to protest. When Black people are protesting ... there's an over-militarization of communities. ""

""It was as though two sets of rules apply"" Morial said. ""One set for these [pro-Trump] protesters and another set for not just Black Lives Matter but also civil rights protests.""

Motivation behind the movements

Rioters that led the insurrection on the Capitol were a mix of ""far-right extremists"" and self-proclaimed patriots who believe they were called to defend democracy according to Miller-Idriss. She described how some were ""intentional in their planning"" and arrived ""tactically prepared to storm the Capitol"" carrying weapons cuffs and mace.

These far-right extremist groups were united by ""a commitment to a tremendous set of disinformation about the election"" citing unfounded claims of massive voter fraud and an illegitimate election Miller-Idriss said.

President-elect Joe Biden won the election by more than 70 electoral votes. His victory was certified when Congress convened to ratify the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6. However weeks after the election Trump continuously pushed false claims and baseless theories of a rigged election leading some to argue that it incited his followers and contributed to the siege of the Capitol.

The rioters also displayed symbols of white supremacist extremism including a noose stationed across the Capitol which according to Miller-Idriss ""symbolizes the horrific history of lynching"" but also refers to a white supremacy code that signals a ""day of reckoning when traitors will be hung in the streets.""

These groups were motivated by a sense of threat Miller-Idriss said -- a ""precarity"" or ""fear of something being taken away"" they believed they deserve is what signaled the attacks on the Capitol which she said is different from disenfranchisement felt by those supporting Black Lives Matter.

The Black Lives Matter movement was founded in 2013 after the verdict in the murder trial for the killing of Trayvon Martin a Black teenager who was killed while walking home in Florida.

Amid a racial reckoning in 2020 BLM protests across the country fought against racial injustice police brutality and advocated for numerous Black Americans that had been violently killed.

Neil said it's important to make the distinction between the Black Lives Matter movement and the Capitol siege.

""One movement in the case of Black Lives Matter is really a critique an attempt to undermine white supremacy. In the latter case what happened at the Capitol in January was an attempt to buttress white supremacy.""

The man’s smartphone camera pans the crowd on the east side of the U.S. Capitol. It’s smaller than what had amassed on the west side but still an impressive sight. As he pans from atop the steps he gives a front-line dispatch at 2:10 p.m. an hour after President Donald Trump had finished his remarks goading on the thousands of supporters who had come to Washington to protest the official certification of his electoral defeat.

“The cops were shooting us for a while then they stopped” the man says referring to an earlier series of flash-bang grenades. “We’re up on the Capitol. I think they’re going to breach the doors. It’s getting serious. Someone’s going to die today. It’s not good at all.”

He was right. Someone did die during the assault on the Capitol — not just one but five people not counting the Capitol Police officer who took his own life three days later. And no it was not good at all. It was an ignominious catastrophe the likes of which the country had never seen before.

But there was something else that set the attack apart: Not only had we not seen something like this but we had never been able to see any major civil clash in the way we did this one thanks to a seemingly limitless trove of video documentation. The internet has been awash with viral clips taken by participants and members of the news media — of one police officer being brutally beaten in the crush of a mob of another officer leading attackers away from the Senate chamber of outlandishly dressed invaders in the Capitol.

In fact there is vastly more video to examine because of the circumstances of this protest-turned-invasion. Not only were a great number of the participants using their smartphones to document themselves and their compatriots as they launched the attack but many of them in turn shared the footage on Parler. That social media service had of late become the right’s chosen alternative to “Fascist-book” as one participant at the Capitol referred to Facebook. Parler’s failure to “effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others” led Amazon to expel the site from its cloud-hosting servers.

Some people managed to grab the material before Parler went down and one of them shared a trove of videos with ProPublica. We culled the collection to some 500 videos uploaded to Parler by people in the vicinity of the White House and Capitol on Jan. 6 and sorted them by time and location thus giving the public an immersive experience that would previously have been impossible to achieve without being there amid the clouds of tear gas and pepper spray and the crush of bodies pressing toward their goal.

The videos are certainly not the last word on the subject but taken together they do help us answer two key questions about the mob: Who were they and what were their motivations? In a decade historians will still be writing doctoral dissertations about these questions just as they did about the crowd that stormed the Bastille on July 14 1789 or the mob in Adolf Hitler’s beer hall putsch. But these Parler videos deepen our understanding and take us beyond the glimpses visible so far from the relatively small number of people who have been charged with crimes.

Interactive: See the Videos What Parler Saw During the Attack on the Capitol ProPublica sifted through thousands of videos taken by Parler users to create an immersive first-person view of the Capitol riot.

To watch most of these videos as I sought to do in recent days and see the seat of our representative government turned into the object of a violent attack by fellow Americans is overwhelming. And what struck me most about them is just how much this assemblage of people assaulting the Capitol reminded me of people I had seen and spoken with over the years at regular Republican campaign events going all the way back to Sarah Palin’s electric appearances in 2008. At my first Trump rally in 2016 at an airplane hangar outside Dayton Ohio I had been amazed by the cross section on display: There were husbands in golf caps with well-manicured wives frat boys fathers with sons. All of them all that year had thrilled to Trump’s toxic rambles about heroin-toting Mexicans Democratic voter fraud (a theme he had picked up from plenty of more conventional Republican politicians) and “the swamp” in Congress. Never mind that the Republican Party controlled the lower chamber of the legislature for eight years of the decade and the upper chamber for six.

And now here were many of the same people or at least the ones with the means and will to make the trip a sort of travel-team self-selection of the usual crowds combined with ranks of the white-supremacist warriors who had descended on Charlottesville Virginia in 2017. As at all those rallies there were the rootless young men spoiling for a fight and there was also a huge range of more bourgeois sorts — from people who presented as suburban dads to one real estate agent who flew in by private plane announcing her plans to “storm the capitol” on Facebook — eager for a spectacle or something more. And they were saying the same things I’d been hearing from them for years.

Except there was one difference: They were actually there in Washington at the Capitol — the very targets of their rhetorical fury all those years. And one way of looking at the videos is that they are the story of thousands of people discovering the connection between the rhetoric and the fact of their presence there at the actual building. Some are so stunned by the connection that they don’t really know what to do about it and mostly hang back. Many others respond to the sudden proximity as if a forgotten dust-covered cord had been plugged into a power source. They feel the inexorable surge and they advance.

The view from atop the inaugural stands. “We took it over” says the man with the phone. “This is our house.”

Another man is panning with his camera from atop the inaugural stands on the west side of the Capitol. “They’re firing their tear gas at us the flash-bang grenades but there’s nothing they can do” he says. “And we said screw it you’ve only got so much tear gas. They shot it all and now look we took it over. This is our house. This is not their house. Our tax money pays for their salaries our tax money pays for everything. It pays for their freaking $40000 furniture allotment for their offices while we have families starving in the street.”

Our house. It is the most dominant phrase of any of the chants shouted by the mob as it presses into the Capitol. It is an expression of entitlement — white nativist entitlement as many have noted: This is our house our country. It’s the entitlement that leads one invader to pick up a phone in a Capitol corridor in one video and say: “Can I speak with Pelosi? Yeah we’re coming for you bitch. Mike Pence? We’re coming for you too fucking traitor.”

What is striking about the videos though is how often this entitlement is laced with insecurity. The attackers profess ownership of this house but so much of their commentary betrays discomfort and alienation within it bordering on a sort of provincial awe. “This is the state Capitol” a man says to his young female companion inside the visitor center his struggle to grasp the grandeur of the place encapsulated in his incorrect terminology. “It’s amazing” she says as a man dressed as a Roman centurion complete with sandals wanders by.

Read More Why We Published More Than 500 Videos Taken by Parler Users of the Capitol Riot This collection of clips from the insurrection while incomplete offers a unique experience of the historic event through hundreds of participants' eyes.

Upstairs an invader rushes into the Capitol Rotunda with the mob but then he can’t help himself. He turns astonished tourist as his camera sweeps up to the dome. Outside a young man in the crowd pressing past the inaugural stands’ scaffolding shouts out to no one in particular: “All these fucking years I couldn’t see in here. I’m going to see it today!” Nothing in fact had ever kept him from seeing this public building. But in his mind he had been barred.

The uncertainty of the claim to possession of the house manifests itself in the mob’s ambivalence about whether to trash it. Again and again various people in the crowd decry those who are actually trying to do the violent work of breaching the building that the mob is pushing to enter. When a pudgy-cheeked young man jumps up onto the sill of a large window on the east face and smashes in four panes with his fists and feet and several cops rush over to tackle him an onlooker shouts out: “The police are just doing their job. He’s breaking the law!” When a middle-aged man climbs up to one of the arched windows over the West Terrace doors that would become the site of the most violent clashes and starts trying to smash it in with a heavy tool many in the crowd lash out at him as others pull him down. “Oh God no stop! Stop!” “What the fuck is wrong with him?” “He’s Antifa!”

And when two men who have to great applause climbed up onto a painter’s rig dangling in front of the building start trying to break the windows the crowd turns on them. “Don’t break my house!” someone shouts. “No no no.” It’s not hard to imagine the perplexity on the part of those attempting the violent break-in: Are you all trying to invade this building or aren’t you?

The shakiness of the claim of ownership is also apparent in the now-famous moment of Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman shrewdly leading the invaders up the stairs and away from the Senate chamber which one of the Parler videos shows from the perspective of the mob. They might as well be Visigoths sacking Rome so out of place are the trespassers here. (Driving home the barbarian comparison is the cry of another attacker: “Where are the fucking traitors? Drag them out by their fucking hair.”) The invaders’ disorientation is plain as they follow Goodman up the stairs haplessly dependent on his guidance even as they threaten him. “Where’s the meeting at?” one calls out. “Where do they count the fucking votes?”

Soon afterward some marauders do reach the Senate but it is by this time emptied of senators. They stand aimlessly in the balcony. “Where did you go?” one of them calls out. Another shouts to no one in particular “This is our house.” But there is less conviction than ever behind the declaration. If it was indeed their house would they have been stood up like this?

As the crowd advances west of the Capitol police fire flash-bang grenades and the crowd hollers in anger.

The flash-bang grenades sail into the crowd on the west side of the Capitol. “Fuck you fucking traitors” shouts someone as they explode. “Fuck you!”

The traitors are in this instance the police. If the mob’s bewilderment over the great building before them is one dominant feature of the day — whether to trash it or venerate it — its bewilderment over the police is even greater. Watching hundreds of Parler videos shows that the disturbing ones that first surfaced publicly of officers taking selfies with protesters and otherwise laying down for the attackers offered a picture that was far from complete.

The police visible in the videos fought tenaciously and the resulting sense of betrayal in the crowd is palpable. All summer as the police had battled with Black Lives Matter protesters and rioters the American right had defended them as guardians of law and order. And this the Capitol protesters seemed to be saying is how we’re rewarded — with billowing tear gas and blows from batons? “You motherfuckers” shouts a middle-aged woman in a wool pullover and a “Spread Love” cap as another tear-gas canister whistles down.

Also on the west side of the building another woman shouts: “We’re done with the police. You’re going to have Antifa Black Lives Matter and the Republicans all hating you guys!” Nearby a man joins in: “You’re on the wrong side of history guys.”

The cries echo for hours:

“Oath over your paychecks! Fuck you guys. You can’t even call yourselves Americans. You broke your fucking oath today. 1776 bitch.”

“You should be ashamed fucking pansies.”

“They’ll play like your friend then stab you in the back.”

“You serve us.”

“They don’t treat Antifa like this.”

“They’re gonna fire on Americans these bastards. You treat us like China. This isn’t China.”

Here and there there are glimpses of invaders still assuming the police must be on their side such as the man who describing the fatal police shooting of Ashli Babbitt inside the Capitol minutes earlier to people on the outside says that two other cops at the scene were opposed to the shooting. “I feel sorry for these two guys because they were just like ‘Why did you do that?’” As reinforcements file into the Capitol one of the invaders shouts out: “Back the blue. We love you!” as if the cops were there for some reason other than her and her mates.

And here and there there are glimpses of people trying to restrain others. “Do not throw shit at the police” a man says through a bullhorn on the west side. “Do not engage with the police.” “Do not hurt the cops!” shouts another. But this does nothing to prevent the coming clashes including the extraordinary melee after the mob breaks across the terrace on the west side and one man lurches forward with a nasty blind-side body-blow against an officer toppling him over a barrier and another man rushes forward to hurl a fire extinguisher hitting an officer in the head. (This was separate from the attack in which a fire extinguisher was used to strike Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick in another of the day’s fatalities.)

It is hard not to notice that the tension appears especially intense in the crowd’s encounters with Washington’s municipal police which include a visibly higher share of Black officers than the Capitol Police as in one moment where the cops strain especially hard to hold their line outside the Capitol or when some new reinforcements march in on the periphery. “Trick or treat trick or treat! What is this fucking Halloween?” shouts one man mocking their riot gear before pivoting to mocking some of them for being out of shape: “1-800-Jenny Craig! Call Jenny Craig. She can help you assholes.”

More representative though for its sheer contradiction is the scene as another group of cops arrives near the Senate office buildings along Delaware Avenue.

A woman walking in the opposite direction with her camera out tells them: “God Bless. Thank you.”

A man walking with her tells the cops: “Don’t kill no more of our patriots. You guys won’t kill Black Lives Matter but you’ll shoot us.”

“God Bless” she tells them.

“Remember your oath” he tells them.

“Stay safe” she tells them.

The view from inside an office suite on the first floor of the Capitol that the marauders have taken over.

Inside the Capitol in a stately high-ceilinged office suite marauders mill around grabbing things off the desks knocking things over. “Don’t break stuff!” a young woman hollers at them. “Stop! That’s not why we’re here.”

But why are they there? The more videos one watches the more overwhelmed one is by the variety of motivations and profiles. Seen one way this is one of the most homogenous large crowds one could ever find in America 2021 so heavily white is it. Seen another way it is a hodgepodge a cross section of America that includes hardcore white supremacists and people you might run into at a mall or a country club.

It is mostly men but there are also many women. There are young women who look like they could have come straight from a college campus in puffy jackets and pompom hats. One watching the invaders scale the lower Capitol walls on the west side tells her friends: “They are climbing the walls! I mean I wish I could but I didn’t bring the shoes for it.”

There are many middle-aged and older women too. Some keep warm by wrapping themselves in the Stars and Stripes like marathon runners with their tinfoil sheets. Others are draped in wool scarves and nice blankets presenting a far more conventional and even upper-class vibe than the viral images of young men costumed with animal horns and pelts. Some of these women even enter the building.

There are so many older men. Some of them are walking with canes or in wheelchairs or scooters. And some of them are at the front lines. Here two sixtyish men bashing in an ornamental wooden window box one using a flagpole. There a white-haired man easily 70 engaged in some of the most violent brawling at one of the east-side entrances.

There are men older and younger who slide gleefully into war-reenactor mode tossing off battle lingo as if they are at Antietam or the Ardennes. “OK what’s happening is at the front we’re pushing forward as hard as we can” one paunchy man with a white beard and white MAGA hat recounts. “While we’re pushing forward they’re shooting us with percussion grenades. They’re also pepper-spraying us. They’re bull-spraying us.” He takes his cap off to show off the brown pepper-spray stain on the back. “We’re not going to stop. We’re going to push forward.” One young man barely out of boyhood clambers up the inaugural scaffolding wearing a full GI Joe getup of fatigues and vintage-style M1 helmet.

And here and there are glimpses of the men who fancy themselves closer to actual warriors like the twentysomething ones furtively removing their black tactical gear under the cover of a tree outside the Capitol as the action is subsiding and pulling on red MAGA sweatshirts to pass as mere Trump supporters. But there are actually few such ominous glimpses in all these videos — perhaps because these men are too discreet to be caught on camera or possibly because there were actually relatively few such organized elements in the mix. If the latter it would help explain why there was not more violence done within the Capitol itself or why there was such chaos on display that at one point a man was left hollering hopelessly at a motley crew of invaders inside a Capitol corridor like a nursery school teacher before naptime: “Quiet! Quiet! Calmly and quietly sit down in this room.”

More typical in the videos than the furtive crew under the tree are characters like the young bearded man who speaks to the phone he is holding just outside the building while brandishing a Capitol Police shield. “All right guys we are at the Capitol right now. We are going to go back in” he says and then comes the deadpan boast. “I’m the only one with a shield. I don’t know why no one else brought a shield but I brought one just in case they start shooting. Make sure if you ever take over the Capitol or take over any other big place you bring a shield.” He pauses for comic effect. “You can’t get one any place except out of a cop’s hands.” He grins. “OK guys thanks for watching.”

There are so many flags — mostly American but also Confederate Gadsden Canadian Israeli Romanian. One young woman accidentally whacks a young man with her flag and apologizes profusely. “Oh my goodness you’re fine” he responds smiling. “What better flag to be hit with?”

There are many such snatches of fellowship in the videos: strangers advising each other on how to get the pepper spray out of their eyes or sharing news updates from the Electoral College proceedings inside the Senate before the senators fled to safety. Watching these moments of cooperation and social warmth the same thought crossed my mind as did in watching last year’s mass protests over the police killing of George Floyd: that these events were grounded in political anger but intensified by the social dislocation of a pandemic and its associated lockdowns which had left so many hungering for human contact and stimulation more than they themselves probably even realized.

A young man leaving the Capitol is eager to show off video of himself and others being pepper-sprayed.

As the assault is winding down an older man stands on the west side of the Capitol recording people as they walk away from the building. “Good job patriots. Whoo! Good job man. Real Americans right here. Americans! Women. Look at the women. Went up there. Good-looking guys. Nobody feared.”

An older woman walking by stops and interrupts his encomiums. “You know they shot and killed a girl up there don’t you?”

“No!”

She tells him about the fatal shooting of Ashli Babbitt. At that moment a young man marches up to the older man. He is wearing an expensive-looking winter coat and a MAGA cap clipped to his backpack and he is full of bravado over his hijinks during the Capitol takeover. He wants to share them with a random stranger.

“I got pepper-sprayed” he tells the man proudly. “Not me but the people in front of me in the crowd and the wind came and hit me. Dude you got to check out this video I got.” He reaches around to his back pocket for his phone but the older man breaks in.

“They said a girl got killed in the House” he says somberly.

“How?” asks the young man.

“In the House. She went in the House and they told her to stop three times and they shot her in the neck.”

The news of this death doesn’t faze the young man at all. Still smiling coolly he wants to pick right back up with the story of his adventure storming the Capitol. “See I went all the way up there underneath the scaffolding. … I climbed up it. … Everyone was like push-push-push and the cops started pepper-spraying. … You got to look at this — ”

“They killed an American girl” the older man says trying to get him to focus on that fact. But it’s no use. The young man keeps trying to show him his video clip of the pepper spray.

At almost exactly the same time a man standing outside near the northwest corner of the Capitol — middle-aged professorial-looking with glasses and a face mask dangling below his chin — speaks into his camera for a sober-minded report on the day. “Well we were here” he says. “Until they can run free and fair elections in this country and make people believe it we’re going to have problems. They just have to figure out how to get these elections to work properly so there aren’t all these irregularities and things that appear to be cheating even if they’re not. They just got to figure it out.”

The man goes on. “I’m usually a pretty even-keeled level-headed kind of guy but all you’ve got to do is look at some of the videos to realize there was some shit that was really fucked up about the election.” He pauses. “Clearly there’s millions of people in town today. There’s people packed like sardines from the White House to the Washington Monument today. For the first time as far I’m aware in history they broke the perimeters at the Capitol. I mean they’re pissed. I’m not keen on violence and breaking doors. But outside of that there seemed to be no violence and after hearing all summer long about city after city getting burned down this was a mostly peaceful protest. This was what a mostly peaceful protest looks like.”

He didn’t appear to know about the deaths and extent of the violence. He had only his vantage point. But we now have many more vantages. And they give us the picture of what happens when something that was gathering across the land for years and recklessly and cynically fomented by those who knew better reached a culmination. There undoubtedly were some dangerous organized elements within the mob that attacked the Capitol. But what is scariest about these videos is that they show the damage that can be done by a crowd of unorganized Americans goaded and abetted by the leaders of an organized political party. The radical fringe is a cause for concern. The thousands of regular people whipped into a murderous rage is the real nightmare.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL25vdmFjYXBzZmFucy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9kYW5pZWwtc3Byb25nLXRvLW1ha2UtY2FwaXRhbHMtZGVidXQtdnMtcGVuZ3VpbnMtY29ub3Itc2hlYXJ5LXNjcmF0Y2hlZC1hZ2FpbnN0LWZvcm1lci10ZWFtLWlseWEtc2Ftc29ub3YtaW4tbmV0L9IBmQFodHRwczovL25vdmFjYXBzZmFucy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9kYW5pZWwtc3Byb25nLXRvLW1ha2UtY2FwaXRhbHMtZGVidXQtdnMtcGVuZ3VpbnMtY29ub3Itc2hlYXJ5LXNjcmF0Y2hlZC1hZ2FpbnN0LWZvcm1lci10ZWFtLWlseWEtc2Ftc29ub3YtaW4tbmV0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Daniel Sprong To Make Capitals’ Debut vs. Penguins Conor Sheary Scratched Against Former Team; Ilya Samsonov In Net,"Washington Capitals head coach Peter Laviolette announced that forward Daniel Sprong will get a chance and come into the lineup in favor of forward Conor Sheary against the Pittsburgh Penguins on Sunday (12 PM ET NBC).

This will be Sprong’s first game with the Capitals who acquired him in a trade with the Anaheim Ducks that sent defenseman Christian Djoos to Southern California on February 24.

The 23-year-old was traded to the Ducks by the Penguins in exchange for defenseman Marcus Pettersson on December 3 2018. The Penguins selected Sprong 46th overall at the 2015 NHL Draft.

In 97 career NHL games with the Ducks and Penguins Sprong has recorded 19 goals 30 points and a -17 rating. After getting traded to the Ducks in the 2018-19 season Sprong finished the year with 14 goals and 19 points in 47 games with the team.

Sprong is expected to play on center Lars Eller’s right-wing.

Sheary 28 was signed by the Capitals on December 23. In 325 career games with the Penguins and Buffalo Sabres the 28-year-old has posted 72 goals 150 points and a +2 rating. He won two Stanley Cups with the Penguins in 2016 and 2017.

After getting dealt by the Penguins to the Sabres in June 2018 the Penguins re-acquired him on February 24 but did not re-sign him before he hit unrestricted free agency.

In 327 career NHL games with the Penguins Sabres and Capitals Sheary has recorded 72 goals 151 points and a +2 rating. He earned his first point as a Capital in Thursday’s 6-4 win over the Sabres.

Goaltender Ilya Samsonov who made 22 saves on 26 shots in Thursday’s game will start against the Penguins. Samsonov stopped 29 of 33 shots in his lone career start against the Penguins a 4-3 loss at Capital One Arena on February 2.

On the Penguins’ side goaltender Casey DeSmith who allowed one goal in 13 shots after replacing starter Tristan Jarry in Friday’s 5-2 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers will start on Sunday. The 29-year-old stopped 20 of 22 shots in his lone career start against the Capitals a 2-1 loss at Capital One Arena on November 7 2018.

Forward Kasperi Kapanen skated with the Penguins for the first time this morning after getting acquired from the Toronto Maple Leafs on August 25 but will not play on Sunday. He had immigration issues so he was unable to participate in training camp or play vs. the Flyers.

Photo: Yucatan Ministry of Tourism

Progreso’s most frequently spotted cruise line isn’t planning to return to the Yucatán port until November.

An updated list of Carnival’s 2021 ports of call named Costa Maya and Cozumel on the Caribbean side of the Peninsula but it won’t dock in Progreso until Nov. 1 — if at all.

The pandemic halted cruise-ship travel in April leaving Yucatán’s tourist sector without a huge chunk of its revenue. Cruise lines had planned for a busy 2020 until coronavirus made such travel problematic.

A tentative schedule issued by Carnival Cruise Line has as many as 17 ships back in service as soon as April 1 when the Ecstasy takes a four-night trip from Florida to Nassau and Freeport. On April 3 the Carnival Sensation leaves Mobile Alabama for a five-night cruise with stops in Cozumel and Costa Maya.

Carnival would send back an old friend — the Valor — if conditions warrant this fall. Its sister ship the Fantasy was the last to pull into port last March.

The Valor made headlines at the time when a passenger who had passed through Yucatán returned home to Ohio and tested positive for coronavirus a week later. Fellow passengers were urged to get tested.

If all these itineraries are eventually ditched it won’t be the first time.

The cruise industry was filled with optimism in November. Not only did the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention lift its no-sail order but test cruises were planned for a January restart of seafaring travel.

More than 150000 people signed up for the test cruises onboard Royal Caribbean ships while a related Facebook page quickly gained 63000 followers.

But as of mid-January there was no sign of any ships even preparing to sail on test cruises.

Carnival CEO Arnold Donald told investors this week that the company has weekly calls with the CDC. But the agency has not provided cruise operators with guidelines on the test sailings has so far delayed proceedings.

The second wave of COVID-19 infections further puts the 2021 cruises in doubt. Even ships sailing for many months have stopped operating in Europe and are not expected to start again until the end of January according to Cruise Hive.

The trade site speculated that the CDC is waiting to see what President-elect Joe Biden does after already stating that he will be extremely tough on how he will deal with the virus especially for the first 100 days of his presidency.

“Why would the CDC allow test cruises now if they might just be canceled again later?” Cruise Hive wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2NydWlzZS1oaXZlLXdlZWtseS1uZXdzLWphbnVhcnktMTYtMjAyMS80NTk2NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise Hive Weekly News: January 16 2021,"It’s been a busy week of cruise news and somewhere in all that bad and sad news coverage there have been some good things to look forward to later in the year.

We’re here once again to make sure you’re all updated on some of the most impactful cruise headlines of the week. We’ll go into the further cancellations by some of the major cruise lines there’s been a fair amount of sad news about cruise ships being scrapped Royal Caribbean to homeport from Barbados for the first and more.

Costa Toscana Floats Out at Shipyard

The float-out ceremony was held for the Costa Toscana cruise ship on Friday morning at the Meyer Turku shipyard in Finland. This is a major milestone for the vessel and Costa Cruises as the ship touched the water for the first time. The basin was flooded under cold temperatures and the ship will remain floated until she is delivered in December 2021.

The shipyard released new photos of the Costa Toscana float out. Even during the icy conditions. You can take a look at the photos over on cruisehive.com.

Once completed Costa Toscana will be an impressive 185000 gross tons with a maximum guest capacity of 6730. She will be in the top 10 largest cruise ships in the world.

The ship will debut in Brazil kicking off with an inaugural New Year’s Eve cruise that will depart from Santos on December 26 2021. The ship will sail a week-long itinerary from Santos through April 10 2022. Costa Toscana will eventually depart back to Italy from Santos on April 17 2022.

Royal Caribbean Extends Suspension

As the new round of cancellations continues to be announced from major cruise lines around the world Royal Caribbean has now joined the list. The cruise has extended its suspension in the U.S. through April 30 2021 with the first sailings from the country now planned for May.

The cruise line was previously planning on returning in March but now that won’t be the case. Spectrum of the Seas sailings are canceled through February 28. And the new update excludes Quantum of the Seas as that ship has already resumed operations with cruises to nowhere out of Singapore.

Celebrity Cruises which is part of Royal Caribbean Group has also canceled sailings until the start of May 2021. This includes the cancellation of the Celebrity Apex May 1st transatlantic voyage. Celebrity Edge and Celebrity Constellation European and transatlantic voyages through October 2021 are also now canceled.

MSC Cruises Extends Suspension

MSC Cruises has become another major cruise line that’s decided to extend its suspension on U.S. operations. The cruise line is now aiming to resume cruises from April 2021.

The further setback impacts four MSC cruise ships that were set to sail out of two popular Florida homeports. MSC Seaside and MSC Divina sailings out of Port Canaveral are now canceled along with cruises for MSC Meraviglia and MSC Armonia out of PortMiami.

There will now be many guests disappointed by the further cancellations but it doesn’t come as a surprise during these difficult times. Those who have already paid their booking in full will be offered a 125 percent future cruise credit (FCC). Guests can choose to transfer their booking to any future sailing through April 30 2022.

Guests who no longer want to take a cruise with MSC in the future can also request a full refund.

Grandeur of the Seas to Sail from Barbados

Royal Caribbean has announced that Grandeur of the Seas will make a comeback and be deployed out of Barbados. The island nation will become a new homeport for the cruise line and itineraries will include three new ports of call.

The Royal Caribbean cruise ship will begin sailing from Bridgetown Barbados in December 2021 for the winter season. The ship will make calls at Tobago Trinidad and St. Vincent for the first time which is part of an enticing Caribbean offering.

MS Marco Polo Beached in India

The Iconic MS Marco Polo vessel has reached the end and completed her final journey at the ship-breaking facility in Alang India. We already knew she was to be scrapped but now that’s become a reality after photos show her beached ready for scrapping.

We first reported that the ship was set to be scrapped earlier in January. She had already set a course for the ship-breaking facility on January 4 and arrived off the coast of Alang on January 6.

Just like many other older cruise ships she became a victim of the global pandemic and the suspension of operations. The 55-year-old vessel was previously part of the Cruise & Maritime Voyages (CMV) fleet but unfortunately the British cruise line went into administration in Summer 2020 and the fleet went up for auction.

Marco Polo was auctioned off by CW Kellock & Co. There was hope she would sail for Offshore Solutions Unlimited but has since been removed from their web site and beached. Four other former CMV vessels were also put up for auction and have now been sold to another line or for scrap.

Grand Celebration Beached for Scrapping

Grand Celebration has been beached at the shipbreaking yard in Alang India. While we reported already in November this might be coming the vessel was seen on Thursday morning beached ready for scrapping.

A fan favorite for short breaks to the Bahamas from Florida the vessel had been sailing for Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line since 2014. As early as September 2020 the cruise line announced that the vessel would return to sailing on November 4 2020. While that date never happened due to the CDC’s no-sail-order it is staggering to think how fast these things can change.

This makes the Grand Celebration the next in a long line of cruise ships that have been beached this year and the previous. Named Celebration she sailed for Carnival Cruise Line between 1987 and 2008. She was one of three Holiday class ships the first set of new-builds by Carnival Cruise Line.

We also reported yesterday that her sister ship and the first in the class formerly named Holiday could also be heading for the scrapyard. You can read that article on the site and all the latest developments on which cruise ships are being sold and scrapped.

Costa Victoria Heading for Scrapyard

The former Costa cruise ship Costa Victoria that was set to become accommodation for workers is now heading for the scrapyard in Turkey.

Costa Cruises and Carnival Corporation had sold the vessel in the summer of 2020. There were some doubts about whether the ship would be scrapped where it would be scrapped and if she would become a hotel ship. Scrapping is the preferred choice it now seems.

Costa Victoria was handed over to Costa Cruises in July 1996. The ship was built to carry 2394 passengers is 252 meters long and weighs 75166 gross tons. It is currently not known when she will be beached.

During the report of the results of the company in the fourth quarter of 2020 its CEO Arnold Donald recalled that Cuba was a “focal point” for the Obama administration. “We’ll see what happens with the incoming administration” said the executive quoted by Prensa Latina.

The CEO underlined that they will obviously be well prepared to operate in “whatever the guidelines rules and regulations” quoted the source.

As a result of licensing by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Barack Obama administration cruise trips to Cuba were allowed after a more than 50 years.

The Adonia ship operated by a Carnival brand was the first to set sail from the port of Miami to Havana in 2016 the source pointed out.

“We’ll be prepared to again help people who really want to go to Cuba in the best way we feel which is to get to the cruise and then experience what that country has to offer” Donald explained.

In June 2019 the President Donald Trump administration banned cruise ship trips to Cuba as part of an extensive list of measures to tighten the economic commercial and financial embargo against the island.

U.S. President-elect Joe Biden who served as vice president during Obama’s term claimed during his campaign that he will reverse Trump’s Cuba policy calling it failed and that it “inflicted harm on Cubans and their families.”

Likewise Vice President-elect Kamala Harris affirmed in an interview with EFE that they will repeal the restrictions that Donald Trump has imposed on the island although the end of the blockade will not occur “soon.”

“We” she explained “will backtrack on Trump’s failed policies. And as he did previously as vice president Joe Biden will also demand the release of political prisoners and will make human rights a centerpiece in diplomatic relations.”

The U.S. government further tightened sanctions on Chinese businesses by issuing new sanctions against several companies during President Donald Trump’s final week in office.

The U.S. Department of Defense Thursday blacklisted nine companies with alleged links to the China military. They include three of China’s state-owned aviation majors — Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (Comac) China National Aviation Holding (CNAH) and Grand China Air (GCAC) Co. Ltd. — along with private smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp.

The blacklist mainly restricts securities transactions of affected companies. The list was created in June 2020 under the annual National Defense Authorization Act which defines “Communist Chinese military companies” as being owned or controlled by the People’s Liberation Army or “engaged in providing (it) commercial services manufacturing producing or exporting.”

The move threatens to cripple China’s long-sought ambition to build its own aircraft to compete with Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. Chinese commercial airline manufacturers have relied heavily on U.S. imports for key aircraft components such as engines and airborne equipment.

The Pentagon listed the first tranche of 31 companies in August — including telecom giant Huawei surveillance-gear maker Hikvision Digital Technology Co. Ltd. and a litany of aerospace and telecom firms. It has added more since including top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and oil giant CNOOC Ltd. in December.

A Nov. 12 Trump executive order banned Americans from trading shares in companies starting 60 days after they are placed on the list. The order also bars such companies’ securities from being traded on U.S. bourses after 365 days.

Following the news Air China CNAH’s main business unit tumbled 3.7% in Hong Kong. The flag carrier’s Shanghai-listed shares also dropped 0.7%.

Grand China Air-controlled Hainan Airlines Co. dropped 0.71% in Shanghai. Comac the state-owned aerospace manufacturer is not listed.

The three companies didn’t comment in response to Caixin inquiries.

Separately the U.S. Department of Commerce Thursday also imposed additional license requirements on companies on its “Military End-User” (MEU) list. The list mainly restricts the export re-export and transfer of products and technologies by enterprises. A total of 59 Chinese entities are on the MEU including the latest addition Beijing Skyrizon Aviation Industry Investment Co. Ltd.

Changes on the MEU list will affect two subsidiaries of Comac —Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co. (SAMC) and Shanghai Aircraft Design and Research Institute (SADRI) subjecting them to stricter restrictions on purchasing American products and technologies. Both companies were added to the list in December.

Comac’s C919 a narrow-body alternative to Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 is in testing. About 60% of the main suppliers to the C919 are American companies such as General Electric Honeywell and Eaton Corp. according to a report by the Center for Strategic & International Studies a Washington-based think tank.

Comac has so far produced six C919 prototype airplanes for testing across China. The plane is still in the process of obtaining airworthiness certification and has not yet gone into mass production.

Each year sees a small number of airlines close up shop for any number of reasons but last year had the pandemic to speed some along.

A surprise announcement in February that the promising Qatar Airways-backed Air Italy would be liquidated set the stage for a year of losses even before lockdowns grounded the world's airlines. And while the coronavirus was well-known by then its destructive power in the airline industry was still yet to be realized.

In the US all 11 major airlines remained intact but smaller regional carriers folded amid an unprecedented drop in passengers that remains low even into the new year. Three carriers operating flights on behalf of larger carriers both closed up shop after their services were no longer required by the majors costing thousands of jobs in the industry amid an already grim period of furloughs.

Brett Snyder of the aviation blog CrankyFlyer's yearly list of ""airlines we lost"" that reveals just how many didn't live to see the new year.

The series — which is The Rock’s true-life story — will follow young Dwayne’s childhood where he was inspired to become an athlete by his pro wrestler father Rocky Johnson. “When you dream big the sky’s the limit” Rocky tells his young son in the clip. And while Dwayne would eventually become a wrestling legend as the cocky trash-talking WWE champion known as The Rock he had his fair share of awkward moments like when he told a girl in high school that his name was Tomas because he thought “it sounds way cooler than Dwayne.”

In his tweet showing off the teaser Johnson dedicated the show to his late father who died a year ago. Rocky Johnson (played by Joseph Lee Anderson in the series) became a WWF Tag Team Champion in the 1980s while marrying Ata Maivia the daughter of Samoan wrestler Peter Maivia. Despite worries about his son becoming a wrestler Johnson agreed to Dwayne’s request to train him leading him to become one of the biggest stars in the history of wrestling.

By Park Jae-hyuk



Hankook Tire & Technology Senior Vice President Suh Ho-sung has emerged as the top candidate to possibly lead K bank succeeding the internet-only bank's former head Lee Mun-whan who abruptly resigned earlier this month citing personal reasons less than a year after his appointment.



The bank's executive recommendation committee interviewed Suh last week and nominated him as the sole candidate to replace Lee according to industry sources Sunday. K bank Executive Vice President Chung Woon-ki who is serving as the interim CEO reportedly declined to take on the post permanently.



Suh's appointment will be finalized after a board and general shareholders' meeting scheduled Feb. 1.



""The appointment of the next CEO is underway and we will make an announcement when the process is concluded"" a K bank spokesman said.



If appointed to the position Suh will be the first K bank CEO who has not worked at KT. Both Lee and his predecessor Shim Sung-hoon worked for the telecom giant which is the bank's top shareholder.



Given KT's long-standing preference for appointing insiders to the top spot market observers earlier expected K bank would not name an outside expert as the next chief. However sources said the mobile carrier recommended Suh as part of efforts to revamp the lender.



After majoring in economics at Seoul National University and receiving an MBA at Carnegie Mellon University Suh worked for Hyundai Motor Group's financial services units ― Hyundai Card Hyundai Motor Securities and Fubon Hyundai Life Insurance.



He joined Hankook Tire in 2015 to support the tiremaker's global expansion. He was promoted to senior executive vice president in an executive reshuffle late last year.



K bank hopes Suh's track record in strategy and marketing will help the internet-only bank attract additional investments from global investors so it can catch up with the leading player Kakao Bank and outperform Toss Bank another digital bank that will open this year.



It seeks to raise 400 billion won ($362 million) in capital this year mainly from global and local private equity firms (PEFs). Last year the bank selected Bank of America Merrill Lynch as the main financial advisor for the fundraising plan.

“The sectors right now that have continued to outperform have been housing industrial and anything medical related. These sectors for the most part have been shielded from the impact of the pandemic” said Shlomi Ronen principal at Century City-based Dekel Capital Inc.



“People are still living getting sick and needing medical attention. The users of the space have continued to utilize the space and in certain areas grow” added Ronen who has arranged financing for medical sites.



CBRE Group Inc.’s Dana Nialis who specializes in health care real estate added that the sector fared “very well relatively speaking in 2020 which can’t be said about the rest of the market.”



While activity in the medical category slowed for a few months when Covid-19 arrived she added for the most part that market sector has performed well.

“As a whole we continue to see deals moving forward deals getting done. People are moving and expanding. We had a slowdown but we are seeing activity in the market” Nialis said.



Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.’s Chris Isola agreed that there was some uncertainty in the spring especially when elective procedures were put on hold but he said things have bounced back.



“The necessity to get in and see your doctor has remained and the need for physical medical space is still there” he said.



Last year a few prominent medical office and hospital assets were sold.



In April Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased St. Vincent Medical Center in Westlake for $135 million from Verity Health System. The purchase included a 381-bed hospital medical office buildings an adjacent school and a retail building.



Isola was not involved in the sale but is working on leasing the roughly 7.5-acre property.



Part of the campus will be used as traditional medical office space. The hospital and another building could become a rehab hospital behavioral health site or something entirely different such as a media campus he said.



Isola said the hope was to find a single tenant for the property.



To the east Irvine-based IRA Capital purchased a 64000-square-foot medical office building in Covina for $40 million from DaVita Inc. It is fully leased to Magan Medical Clinic Inc.



And Crescent Heights purchased the Wilshire Medical Center at 6200 Wilshire Blvd. from Wilshire Center Building for $54.3 million in January 2020. The buyer plans to renovate the site.



“The (sales) volume is pretty similar to a typical year” Isola said.



‘Long-term believer’

Developers are interested in creating new health care and medical office buildings.



Downtown-based Inception Property Group has filed plans for a 151000-square-foot outpatient medical office and senior living facility at 1334-1356 S. Flower St.



Farther west Westwood-based Stockdale Capital Partners is working on a 145000-square-foot medical office building at 656 S. San Vicente Blvd. near Beverly Hills.



“We’ve been targeting the asset class for the better part of the last six-plus years. We’ve always been a long-term believer in the space” said Stockdale Capital Vice President of Asset Management Andrew Saba citing an aging population and an increasing need for people to be closer to medical offices.



Saba added that the cost of creating inpatient space “is requiring health care systems to push more and more systems that were inside a hospital to the outpatient space” leading to more medical office demand.



In addition technology and improvements in recovery time have allowed for more to be done in a nonacute setting he added.



Saba said this has remained true during the pandemic as people don’t want to be in ICUs and emergency room areas for basic check-ups and nonemergencies.



Saba said the project on San Vicente was still in the entitlement phase and Stockdale has spoken with some providers about leasing the space.



Last year the company secured $550 million for a fund that originally was targeting $300 million and is now looking at new opportunities in assets including office health care and life sciences.



Continental Development Corp. is another big believer in medical office space.

Skypark a 500000-square-foot medical and office center in Torrance was its first foray into the sector.



When Continental first took over the property it was only 15-20% medical office. It is now comprised of 80-85% medical office tenants.



Other projects Continental is working on now including Nash Street Exchange will include a medical office component.



Continental is also advising the Lundquist Institute which recently received approval for a 15-acre biotech park near Torrance.



“It will be the only location in the region that will be able to take diseases from the bedside transfer it to the Lundquist Institute for discovery of a cure or instruments required and then move that to the bioscience park for development which then returns to the bedside to cure the patient. There’s nothing like that anywhere else” said Richard Lundquist who is president Continental and sits on the Lundquist Institute’s board.



Rents remain steady

Despite the pandemic medical office leasing has gone fairly smoothly.

“The sector has fared very positively” CBRE’s Angie Weber said.



She added that she has not seen a high amount of rent deferral in the sector and rents have remained steady.



Weber’s colleague Nialis added that in the last few months she has seen both lease renewals and new deals being signed. But some older physicians she said prefer short-term renewals.



Isola said smaller tenants usually stay in one place rather than moving around because of the high cost of medical office construction. Their office spaces he said can cost $150 a foot to build out whereas traditional office space can be closer to $100-$110 a square foot.



Lundquist agreed that medical office tenants usually stay for the long haul because they spend a lot of money to customize the space which often requires plumbing and specialized machinery.



“They’re reluctant to relocate and start that process over again. You tend to have a very stable tenancy” he said.



Isola added that medical office owners can generate new leasing activity if they’re willing to give tenant improvement allowances or build out space on a speculative basis.

Wednesday Dec. 9 2020.

Vacancies in Calgary's downtown office towers have risen to record levels and there's no landlord relief in sight with almost one in three offices sitting empty and sublets accounting for a quarter of available spaces on the market.

The city's glut of empty office space has previously been linked to overbuilding but two commercial real estate reports released this past week show that downtown vacancy rates in Canada's oil and gas capital are the highest in the country and growing — despite no major new towers opening in the past two years.

Vacancies are likely to go even higher both reports note driven by short-term factors including layoffs resulting from the takeover of Husky Energy Inc. by Cenovus Energy Inc. and longer-term job losses from cost-cutting and mergers in the oil and gas sector.

In its report released Thursday real estate firm CBRE says the equivalent of four CFL football fields in downtown office space was emptied in the last quarter of 2020.

The net reduction of 355000 square feet (32000 square metres) took the vacancy rate to a record high of 29.5 per cent compared with 27.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019.

""The negative absorption is due to the oilpatch not COVID-19"" said Greg Kwong Calgary-based regional managing director for CBRE.

""People may not be going back to work because of the lockdowns but these companies still have leases in place and have to pay the rent. It's not considered vacated space.""

CBRE found that 23.7 per cent of the available downtown office space in Calgary is being sublet by the lease holder.

In a separate report using different calculation methods Avison Young pegged the downtown office vacancy rate at a record 26.9 per cent in the fourth quarter up from 24.2 per cent in the year-earlier period.

Under an optimistic scenario Avison Young predicts the vacancy rate will rise to 28.6 per cent by the end of 2023; in its pessimistic forecast it foresees a rate of 32.9 per cent.

The merger of Cenovus and Husky offices in 2021 is projected to result in between 36000 and 54000 square metres of downtown space being vacated later this year said Todd Throndson managing director for Avison Young's Calgary office. That's around one per cent of the total inventory of 4.16 million square metres.

""We have a very difficult marketplace and there's no quick solutions to solving that problem"" he said. ""The next 12 to 24 months are going to be a challenging time for there to be any growth in our marketplace.""

Cenovus and Husky have said their merger will result in a reduction of between 20 and 25 per cent of the 8600 combined employees and contractors — potentially more than 2000 workers.

The two companies have about 300000 square metres of lease commitments in Calgary with some of it already being sublet to other tenants said Cenovus spokesman Reg Curren. More space is expected to be sublet going forward he said declining to give specifics.

""Once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and we determine our plan to return to the workplace Brookfield Place will be the head office of the combined company"" he said referring to the 56-storey glass and steel tower opened in 2017 that Cenovus calls home.

Husky's head office is a few blocks west in the much older Western Canadian Place.

It's not hard to find other Calgary companies reducing staff and their need for office space.

Suncor Energy Inc. announced in October it would reduce total staff by 10 to 15 per cent over 18 months cutting as many as 1930 jobs. Those cuts will be offset by the relocation of its Petro-Canada head office and most of its 700 jobs from Ontario to Calgary.

Imperial Oil Ltd. announced in November it would lay off 200 staff.

Meanwhile office space held by Equinor Canada at Jamieson Place in downtown Calgary is on the sublet market after the Norwegian oil company decided to consolidate its Canadian operations in St. John's N.L.

Lower staff counts are also expected with the close of a handful of smaller oil and gas producer corporate mergers announced late last year.

Calgary's office buildings have lost an overall 13 per cent of value about $2.3 billion over the past year due to higher vacancy rates and lower rents the city said Thursday as it issued its 2021 property assessment notices.

Declines in recent years have pushed more of the municipal tax burden to residential and other business ratepayers.

Economic Development Calgary is using the city's abundance of discounted office space as a ""huge selling feature"" in attracting Calgary employers in new sectors like technology and renewable energy said CEO Mary Moran but she concedes those new tenants haven't replaced the oil and gas losses.

""I think long-term we know that the energy industry is not going to be the job creator"" she said. ""It's a jobless recovery in oil and gas.""",,,,,,

While attending St. Cloud Technical and Community College for business management Fitzthum started working at North American Van Lines. It started as just another job but Fitzthum discovered he enjoyed it.

The C.H. Robinson office was across the parking lot. So when his father-in-law sold the business Fitzthum said ""that became the entrance point for me into C.H. Robinson"" in 2007.

He worked his way up and is now director of strategic accounts for the shipping logistics firm. He will move into a new leadership position within the company in 2021. Fitzthum is also the mayor of Sartell.

His job means overseeing a team of people across the Midwest.

His initial plan was to get a four-year degree. Fitzthum alternates between wishing he had done that and being proud of what he's accomplished with the education he has.

""I've found a way to be successful by working hard and leveraging what I've learned in business as well as some niche coursework from local universities and professional organizations ... to further my success"" he said.

Fitzthum Fitzthum is one of the 2020 SC Times 5 under 40 award-winners.

Creative problem solving

C.H. Robinson is a third-party shipping logistics company. For instance if a client manufactures ceiling fans C.H. Robinson can help bring parts to the manufacturer and then help deliver the finished product to the manufacturer's consumer networks.

The pandemic — and America's response to it — changed many industries in 2020 and shipping was no exception.

Fitzthum's job has always required creativity he said. C.H. Robinson has worked with clients moving an entire manufacturing facility from one state or country to another. Fitzthum once helped plan the move of a massive coal-mining machine from Germany to Montana. He said you could park two full-size pickups in the bucket of the machine. How do you then move that — even in pieces — across and ocean and then the U.S. factoring in bridges and electrical lines?

That the type of strategic thinking and process visualization his job requires.

""How can you not be energized by solving those problems?"" Fitzthum said.

That creativity was a 2020 necessity when something as simple as shipping toilet paper became a big deal and crucial vaccines need to be shipped and stored at subzero temperatures.

""Let's all creatively come together and find the solution to how we do this versus just ship something from A to B and repeat that process"" Fitzthum said.. .""... Everything is new and everything's exciting and creativity can really flow.... In a nutshell that's my entire job is to creatively find solutions to my customers' problems for transportation.""

When he started at C.H. Robinson Fitzthum worked with flatbed carriers. Within the year he said he took on a supervisory role and then in 2009 transitioned to the client side of the business and started taking on account management responsibilities.

""It's really cool seeing him climb the ladder and going through that process"" said BCI Construction Inc. President and CEO Ryan Cross who nominated Fitzthum for the award.

Fitzthum said his passion for the field grew as he learned more about the industry.

""Anything in your house in the community everything had to be transported at some point in time"" Fitzthum said. ""And so it's really critical to how industry happens to how we all live our lives and I think once I was hooked on turned onto that it just became such a draw.""

Central Minnesota plays an important role in the industry Fitzthum said. It's a region recognized nationally and in some ways globally for its transportation services.

""It's pretty cool"" Fitzthum said. ""And as you learn about transportation next thing you recognize you're at a social event there's someone there that's tied to transportation in some element in Central Minnesota.""

Building community in his hometown

Fitzthum was born and raised in Sartell. His wife Cindy was his high school sweetheart. At 18 they bought a lot in Sartell with plans to build a house on it eventually. They knew it was where they wanted to raise their own kids.

""While a lot of other friends were thinking about how they were going to pay their next bar tab we were buying property for a future house"" Fitzthum said.

To Cross this is a prime example of Fitzthum's vision.

""He's from this area and he believes in this area"" Cross said. ""I mean I think he thinks not five years ahead of time; I don't think he's thinking two years or 10 years. I think he's thinking 30 and 40 years. He's thinking about his kids' kids.""

Fitzthum said he wants to see the area retaining young talent who come to the St. Cloud area for higher education. It's a focal point of the Greater St. Cloud Development Corp.'s Young Leaders Initiative which Fitzthum leads as well as other community intiatives. He firmly believes that once someone is involved in the community they tend to stay.

Fitzthum would like to see nonprofits bring younger members onto their boards for the same reason.

""I look at our different boards and the average age of our board leaders today is not 35 years old"" Fitzthum said. ""... It's a blind spot that a lot of organizations don't have unless they've engaged some level of youth in the decision-making and leadership process. And I think that's a meaningful and impactful way the next generation of leaders in our community will get engaged and can get engaged and stay in our community and prosper here.""

About a year after he started at C.H. Robinson Fitzthum joined the Sartell Fire Department. His father had also served with the department and as a child he saw his father's commitment to the community.

The Sartell Fire Department is also where Fitzthum believes he learned a lot about servant leadership.

The pandemic has also provided its own leadership lessons.

""I think ... empathetic leadership was thrown to the forefront and it likely should have been there to begin with"" Fitzthum said. ""But it forced every leader to truly embrace some empathetic styles and understand that there's a lot going on for all of our employees at this point and that we need to support them.""

Fitzthum's work with the fire department progressed into serving on the city's planning commission and then he was asked whether he had interes in running for City Council. After two years on City Council the mayoral election came around Fitzthum said.

""The natural progression of wanting to be involved and engaged is really what took course there"" Fitzthum said.

Cross said he appreciates that Fitzthum is ""just rolling up his sleeves and getting to work.""

""I think he's very calm very level-headed very thoughtful in his approach"" Cross said. ""He does a nice job at going through the managerial processes of assigning a champion and then disappearing so people can get their job done and work efficiently and effectively.""

Fitzthum said it was easy for him and his wife to stay in Sartell and raise their children. As a result ""I need to be active and make sure that Sartell is the best community possible for my three daughters to grow up in"" Fitzthum said.

The big dream? That maybe when they and their classmates grow up they'll see Sartell as a great place to raise their children too.

Part of creating that atmosphere is a focus on equity he said a need brought to light for him by the unrest and calls to action that took the national stage in 2020. Fitzthum said he believes creating equity is something every organization and leader is trying to understand.

""I'm certainly still doing that and trying to understand it from both a professional side at C.H. Robinson as well as on the city side and community side"" Fitzthum said.

In 2017 when Fitzthum started running for mayor he couldn't have known where the city would be in 2020 in the midst of a pandemic that has crippled many businesses. But he said he couldn't be happier or more proud than to be in a position to use his business experience knowledge and relationship with the community to support people through it.

""I can't imagine what I would be doing right now if I was sitting on the sidelines watching this unfold rather than being in the middle of it."" Fitzthum said.

In the first quarter of 2020 major brokerages like Charles Schwab TD Ameritrade and E-Trade saw the number of new accounts double from the same period in 2019. However many users from the younger digitally native generation ended up flocking to Robinhood.

The Silicon Valley-based company that pioneered mobile-based zero-charge trading added over 3 million users in early 2020 but has encountered a slew of challenges. Besides pressure from regulators to make their app less like a video game and more like a professional financial tool Robinhood has also suffered from service outages and lackluster customer service providing an opportunity for other players.

Webull which is headquartered in New York in the heart of Wall Street and presents a more sophisticated and serious product to users has gained a significant foothold in the US retail trading market. It competes against the likes of other no-fee investment platforms including sector leader Robinhood M1 Finance and Public.

Up against cash-rich would-be competitors in the finance industry Webull has maintained a low profile since its launch in 2017. Its marketing strategy takes a page out of the playbook of many Chinese platforms—the platform uses low-cost authentic KOL-powered campaigns to lure users.

Robinhood’s launch in 2013 predates Webull and provided vital market education for novice investors who were new to commission-free trading. In the years spent on Robinhood some beginner investors have built up their knowledge while the company’s strategy of aggressive user acquisition has led the firm to cater its features to beginners instead of its existing user base.

Webull provides the next step in zero-fee amateur trading platforms with a more professional and data-heavy approach to trading that seasoned investors are after. This includes in-depth charts and technical indicators that are nowhere to be found on Robinhood. Webull also supports a desktop version—which makes multiscreen viewing possible—while Robinhood is entirely mobile-based.

Webull also differentiates itself through its live customer service during US trading hours while Robinhood’s customer service functions through email and takes 24 to 72 hours to respond to requests and complaints.

This distinction matters. Investors panicked when Robinhood experienced widespread outages in March and April in 2020 with no way to immediately get in touch with the company. Those occurrences at a time of high market volatility prompted a probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The investigation is still ongoing.

Webull’s user base has grown tenfold in 2020 to over 2 million still paling in comparison with Robinhood’s user base of around 13 million but Webull is gaining ground.

Although Robinhood points to a 260% year-on-year increase in visits to its app the SEC charged the company with misleading investors about the platform’s order execution quality forcing the company to settle the suit by paying a fine of USD 65 million. And in December Massachusetts securities regulators lodged their own complaint against Robinhood claiming the app exposed investors to “unnecessary trading risks” through its “gamification” of investing.

Webull has successfully distanced itself from Robinhood’s animated attention-grabbing user interface.

Flying under the regulatory radar

Despite harsh scrutiny from the Trump administration toward Chinese-owned companies accessing US user data Webull has largely flown under the radar. And that is no accident.

In 2020 the company proactively requested a review from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States or CFIUS. After gathering materials from the company the committee ruled in December that it would not proceed with a formal review despite Webull’s ownership ties to Alibaba.

“The Trump administration has unjustifiably talked about Alibaba as a military-linked company—but it is not undertaking a CFIUS review of an Alibaba unit holding financial data of Americans? There’s an inconsistency there” said Derek Scissors a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

While CFIUS is broadcasting mixed messages on companies of Chinese ownership handling American user data Webull has found an opportunity to grow as Robinhood encounters regulatory hurdles. And the window isn’t closing anytime soon.

“An incoming Biden team will largely focus on its domestic agenda in the early months of the new administration with China-related topics likely pushed down the line” said Scissors.

A shining example of data compliance?

Perhaps CFIUS’s decision not to proceed with a review in December was because Webull proved to be a shining example of data compliance. If that was the case CFIUS should have initiated a review to then extol Webull as an example for other foreign-owned companies to follow argues Scissors.

The company stores its data locally a move that ByteDance-owned TikTok was pressured into making in Europe India and the US. However this act does not exempt the firm from a CFIUS review of the firm’s data compliance practices.

Instead it seems that Webull’s low-key profile continues to pay dividends in more ways than one. Webull casts itself as a more mature more stable counterpart to Robinhood: The gamification strategy deployed by Robinhood is causing the Silicon Valley-based firm plenty of headaches. Robinhood traders executed 40 times as many trades and bought and sold 88 times as many high-risk options as Charles Schwab customers per a report from research firm Alphacution.

Meanwhile Webull continues to gain momentum launching Webull Crypto in November 2020 and a tablet version soon after. As Robinhood continues to contend with the perils of its novice-centric app Webull’s no-frills approach with greater depth of information has enabled the platform to carve out an increasingly large market share in the app-based trading game.",,,,,,,,,,,,

JPMorgan Chase on Friday beat analysts’ estimates for fourth-quarter profit on record trading results and a boost from releasing money previously set aside for loan losses. The sell-off was part of a price slide in the banking sector led by weakness in Wells Fargo and Citigroup.

Shares of Exxon slipped more than 5% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation into the oil giant over how it valued a key asset in the oil-rich Permian Basin. The bad news quickly spread to other stocks in the energy sector including Chevron. Lower oil prices also weighed on the stock.

Daily March E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average

Daily Swing Chart Technical Analysis

The main trend turned down on the daily swing chart on Friday when buyers took out 30638 breaking a higher-top higher-bottom chart pattern that had been intact since January 4. The main trend will change to up on a move through 31116. Taking out 31148 will reaffirm the uptrend. The downtrend will be reaffirmed on a trade through 29318.

The first minor range is 31148 to 30506. Its 50% level at 30827 is potential resistance.

The second minor range is 29760 to 31148. Its 50% level at 30454 is the first potential support level.

The short-term range is 29318 to 31148. Its 50% level at 30233 is the most important support level. It’s the last potential support level before the 23918 main bottom.

The main range is 25872 to 31148. Its retracement zone at 28510 to 27887 is controlling the near-term direction of the Dow.

Short-Term Outlook

Given the close at 30720 we’re looking for an upside bias to develop on a trade over 30827 and for the downside bias to resume on a trade through 30454.

Bullish Scenario

A sustained move over 30827 will indicate the presence of buyers. This could lead to a test of the pair of tops at 31116 and 31148. Taking out these levels will signal a resumption of the uptrend.

Bearish Scenario

A sustained move under 30454 will signal the presence of sellers. This could trigger a break into 30233. Buyers could come in on the first test of this zone but if it fails be prepared for an acceleration into a minor bottom at 29760.

The main bottom at 29318 is the last potential support before the 28510 – 27887 retracement zone. This area is controlling the near-term direction of the Dow.

Total said it would not renew its 2021 membership with the American Petroleum Institute (API) following a review of the lobby’s climate positions describing them as being only “partially aligned” with its own.

The high-profile departure from the most powerful energy lobby comes ahead of sweeping changes in policy direction in the United States with incoming President Joe Biden promising to tackle climate change and bring the country to net-zero emissions by 2050.

“As part of our climate ambition made public in May 2020 we are committed to ensuring in a transparent manner that the industry associations of which we are a member adopt positions and messages that are aligned with those of the Group in the fight against climate change” Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanné said.

The withdrawal highlights a widening rift between Europe’s top energy companies which over the past year accelerated plans to cut emissions and build large renewable energy businesses and their U.S. rivals Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp that have largely resisted growing investor pressure to diversify.

Chevron has no plans to leave the API company spokesman Sean Comey said. Exxon was not immediately available for comment.

The announcement puts pressure on Total’s European rivals BP and Royal Dutch Shell to follow suit after resisting the move in recent years.

BP Shell and Norway’s Equinor on Friday said they are reviewing memberships in trade organizations and how they align on climate-related issues. Shell spokesman Curtis Moore said “API is moving closer to Shell’s own stated views” on climate change.",,,

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

WEST COLUMBIA S.C. — Members of the Suburban Baptist Church in West Columbia are spreading a message of love after their building was vandalized on Friday.

Sunday's sermon from Suburban Baptist Church Associate Pastor Elijah Smalls was a message of forgiveness and love to the people who spray-painted parts of the church's exterior and ministry home across the street.

""The same way they spray-painted our door it'll be the same door that will open up to show them love"" he says.

The graffiti ranged from messages such as ""Save Gaza"" and ""Welcome to Hell"" to various obscene depictions. West Columbia District 5 Councilman Mickey Pringle said he was heartbroken to see this happen to a staple in the community.

""I was totally shocked because Suburban has been a part of this community forever and all of the good things they do; serving the people of this community. I was like 'Who would even do something like that"" he says.

Sunday was a different scene with the doors painted white and the church sign covered by a poster board. Pastor Tracy Mcgee said a member of the West Columbia Police Department came to their aid and provided the temporary fixes.

""He called and he said 'I got to get those doors with the pornography on them painted; you can't walk through church doors like that'"" McGee said. ""We're blessed; we have a professional crew coming out the early part of next week. We had an outside individual that really wanted to pay for that. The one that wanted to do that is a Palestinian-American.”

According to West Columbia Mayor Tem Miles who was sitting in a pew during Sunday’s service the city is working to find those responsible. He adds that the vandals also damaged other parts of the neighborhood.

“Some homes around here were vandalized; some public property street signs were vandalized” he said. ""We got folks who are working to figure out who it is within our community or outside of our community; came here and did these things. We're going to make sure they receive the attention they deserve.""

Mayor Miles said the city is still looking for the suspects and had no updates on their investigation.

During Sunday's sermon Pastor McGee spent nearly 30 minutes addressing the crime and reminding the church about grace but also consequences.

""God never said 'I'll take the circumstances away.' He simply said 'I will still love you and I can forgive you of your sins but He paid a price"" McGee said.

Pastor McGee said the community response has been overwhelming with calls from around the country.

""From Canada Texas all over the Carolinas - calling and pledging and wanting to do what they can do for the church"" he said. ""We're a very humble church a very small church so God has sat there and said 'I've got you; I've got you covered.""

Councilman Pringle said he hopes this will bring West Columbia together.

""Pastor Tracy he's been a part of this community for a long time and hopefully everybody will rally to their support and give them the support they need"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3bnl0di5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNi93YXRlcnRvd24tY2h1cmNoLXRha2VzLXdlZWtlbmQtZ2l2ZS1iYWNrLWNvbW11bml0eS_SAWRodHRwczovL3d3dy53d255dHYuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvd2F0ZXJ0b3duLWNodXJjaC10YWtlcy13ZWVrZW5kLWdpdmUtYmFjay1jb21tdW5pdHkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watertown church takes the weekend to give back to the community,"WATERTOWN New York (WWNY) - On a Sunday it’s typically hard to find parking at New Life Church in Watertown.

This Sunday the lot is empty. Still people that go here did meet but instead of meeting up for a sermon they went out to serve the community all across Jefferson County.

Austin Johnson is in the kitchen of a fire station in Watertown pulling pork.

Johnson and his team put a BBQ together for city firefighters. He says serving is something we should all put into practice.

“We are led to serve just like Jesus served us as he walked on this earth and so we want to be like Jesus and do what Jesus does and one of those big things is serving and serving your community and helping others” said Johnson.

After a quick prayer it was time to dig in. The church team made enough food for both the day and night side shifts at the fire hall.

“It’s been fantastic to see some people in the community come in the food has been awesome we had great BBQ” said Watertown City Firefighter Chad Crosby.

Kids were also part of this team and got to interact with the fire engines.

Crosby says what he appreciated the most:

“For coming in and spending their time with us the food was wonderful met some great people heard some cool stories people as far way as Africa Alaska from California from Texas.”

Around 15 groups like this one served Jefferson County throughout the weekend at places like homes schools and fire stations.

Do not read on unless you have watched season eight episodes five and six.

The laundromat murder

The plot swerves all over the place this week and everyone gets a shock when Laure’s and Brémont’s cases collide. Tailing Maria’s cousin leads CID to one Fernando Sabayo AKA the Alsatian who seems to be heading up the drug-trafficking operation. When Beckriche starts sniffing around Brémont tells him the Alsatian is a protected species – strictly off-limits. It’s an unconscionable bind but the tracker on the Alsatian’s Mercedes (apparently placed there by Amin) offers a priceless break. Apart from giving the Alsatian an alibi for Amin’s death it places one of the four phone numbers regularly checking the tracker in Amin’s vicinity on the night he died. Once they trace the phones to Cisco’s crew they have a long list of questions and some new prime suspects for the murder.

Laure

Professionally Laure is killing it at the moment. She uncovers the Aubervilliers hotel isn’t above doing some surveillance grunt work on the Alsatian and coordinates the tracker operation like a boss. Personally though she is a wreck after a nasty one-two of surprises. Beckriche lets slip that Ali is leaving and it clearly devastates her. As mother of the CID family she takes every loss personally. Worse follows when she clocks Gilou holding court at a barbecue with Cisco’s gang. He dumped her for this? “Fuck’s sake Gilou!” doesn’t begin to cover it but it’s the best she can offer at short notice. She instinctively covers for him which is a good job as atypically he’s slumming it with wrong ’uns under official sanction. The sooner she finds that out the better.

Joséphine

You play the hand you’re dealt and Joséphine starts out with a kidnapped child a stubborn drug mule a sleazy former boss and a sulking former prison pal. Most would fold not hold in the circumstances but she manages to turn the unpromising combo into an impressive outcome. She gets Maria a lenient sentence to be served back home secures Souleymane’s release and persuades Edelman to represent Lola. Even her powers have their limits though. After she sets Souleymane up with a foster family the young tyke heads back to the streets to make the money he’ll need to get his little brother to join him in France. Joséphine finds the life of a do-gooder exasperating. Being a baddie is so much simpler.

Gilou

Just ask Gilou. He takes to the thug life like he’s been doing it for years which to be fair he kind of has. A suspicious Titi tries to test his gangster mettle but Gilou passes with distinction bumping coke and racing stolen cars like he’s on a hidden level of Grand Theft Auto. Back at the club he expels the hated Jankos buying himself priceless credibility and gaining entrance into Cisco’s inner circle – a real crème de la crud of the Paris underworld. When you’re a natural you don’t need to fake it.



Back in the boring day job he delivers the stolen Audi to Brémont so his boss can bug it. Brémont becomes agitated all “stop the steal!” He worries that Gilou’s enjoying the low life too much – exactly the kind of nagging you’d expect from a cop. Oh your boy’s just getting started Vincent. It turns out he’s the getaway driver on Cisco’s next caper. They’re fixing to rip off a ruthless drug dealer – some guy called the Alsatian? I feel like a nark for pointing out that Gilou is still on probation. It’s got disaster written all over it. Count me in.

Notes and observations

Stolen glances furtive drinks and breathless scooter rides raise the sexual tension between Beckriche and Lucie to critical levels. Something has to give. The judge makes her ruling: she finds Beckriche guilty of being an eligible fitty in the City of Lights. After a brief but intense makeout it’s back to hers for “pasta”. I think I know what dessert is.

Say what you will about Titi – that he lacks finesse smarts or looks – but he is the only one showing the requisite suspicion of Gilou. Donnie Brasco was six years undercover. Gilou’s been under about six days and he’s practically a made man.

“Scooter girl must be his bird – his Alsatian bitch!” It may be a rough time for Laure but she’s still got sass.

With the Jankos looking more like parasites than partners it seems unlikely that they killed Darmon who was willing to make a deal just to get them off his back. Gilou’s suspicion that Cisco sent someone to kill him is looking like a safe bet.

Joséphine going in to bat for Souleymane is authentically heartwarming particularly as he seems totally baffled by it. No one has ever fought for him like this before and it’s obvious he has no idea how to handle it.

With Titi revealed as a regular customer at Kingtel it’s looking like Bilal’s outfit is your one-stop shop for stolen phones burners and trackers. It’s probably best for his business and his health that no one figures out he’s talking to the police.

Who killed Amin? Are Lucie and Beckriche the real thing? Can the Alsatian be tamed?

He tells TOFARATI IGE about the experience of running his business

What is your educational qualification?

I have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Nanchang University China. I speak Chinese language fluently. I also have a certificate in Hanyu Shuipin Kaoshi (HSK level four) translating Chinese Proficiency Test. I am a Cisco certified Network Associate and Cisco Certified Network Professional.

When and why did you set up Buy Bata?

We started operations fully on December 27 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic started. The major reason behind the company is my passion to create a platform for shoe makers and vendors to showcase their products.

Before starting the company we did a lot of research both locally and internationally and our findings showed that there was a huge gap in the area of e-commerce websites that catered for shoes alone. The common things were companies or individuals selling their products alone. Others dealt in different products such as clothes wristwatches and shoes. The company was created to bridge that gap.

What do you aim to achieve with the company?

The major aim of the company is to be the first platform where customers can get quality affordable and original shoes of all types and sizes with ease. So far we have been doing this by ensuring quality control. We do not just post vendors’ shoes on our website we verify and approve the image of any product sent to us before posting them.

Even when a vendor has posted on our website we still have to go through what the vendor posted before final approval is granted.

Secondly we aim to be the go-to website for all shoe vendors and shoemakers in Nigeria and beyond especially those who deal in quality products. We hope to continue providing the best opportunity for vendors with different products who would in turn cater for the needs of our numerous customers.

What are your highlights so far with the company?

As a company we have been able to achieve a lot in the space of a year in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have grown our customer base and have got a bunch of vendors and shoemakers to collaborate with us in our quest to be the number one shoe platform in the world.

In addition we had the opportunity to showcase ourselves at the Lagos Social Media Week which was a feat we are very proud of.

What are some of the challenges you encounter in the course of running the business and how do you solve them?

It is no longer news that running a start-up business in Nigeria is a herculean task. We have faced daunting challenges ranging from logistics to disappointment from customers and getting more vendors.

As a business we have had a lot of logistics issues. An example was when one of our regular dispatch riders ran away with our products and all efforts to get him proved abortive.

Also we love our customers and take their orders very seriously but we have had several examples where customers would order shoes from the website and when called for confirmation they would say they are no longer interested except they are allowed to be pay in instalments.

There was a time one of our dispatch riders called a customer that he was on his way to deliver an order and they both agreed on where to meet. But when he got to the agreed place the customer refused to pick his call. To reduce issues like this we had to disable the pay-on-delivery option on our website.

Another challenge is getting more vendors to display their products on our website because some of them do not really understand how it works. They don’t know that registration on the website is free. However we are seriously working on that.

Has the purpose for the creation for the company being fulfilled?

Yes I would say it has to an extent. Our vendors have started selling on our website and customers are giving us positive feedback on prices quality and the simplicity of the site.

We have not got to our destination but we are working assiduously to get there.

How does your company empower youths?

All our employees are young Nigerians. Some of our vendors are youths as well.

In the nearest future we hope to give room for more youths to express their creativity by creating and designing shoes that would be the talk of the town.

What impact has COVID-19 had on your business?

The economic issues brought about by the pandemic affected a lot of business owners including us. Some of the events we planned to host during the year could not hold. Also funds did not come in as expected due to low patronage.

What is your work experience?

While I was still studying in China I helped people to source for goods which they would sell in Nigeria. When I came back to the country after my study in 2013 I joined a firm as an IT coordinator.

What do you love most about your job?

I love the fact that I am able to satisfy our customers. It makes me fulfilled.

What is your staff strength?

Our operations are largely digital so at the moment we have just two employees.

What are some of the most important business lessons you have learnt over the years?

I have learnt that human relationship is very important. If one cannot effectively manage people it would be difficult for one to succeed in any business.

What personal qualities have helped you to succeed in your career?

That would be my perseverance and tenacity in the midst of challenges and the fact that I am hardworking.

What are your other interests?

I love sports and travelling.

Who are your role models and how have they shaped your career growth?

My elder brother is my role model. He might not want me to mention his name but I like his work ethic and his dedication to work.

What advice do you have for youths in terms of achieving success in their careers?

Success only comes to people who truly desire it and make efforts to achieve it. Do not look at your background or what you do not have. Rather focus on the things you have and start with them.

You should also be focused on whatever you are doing. If you are hardworking and not focused achieving your dream would be almost impossible. Also know that there is no overnight success. Perseverance is vital on your journey to success.

Do you socialise?

I would not describe myself as social person. I spend most of my leisure time with my family and I hang out occasionally with friends.

How do you relax?

I watch football and read online newspapers.

What are the most common mistakes youths make as regards career advancement?

Most youths do not have mentors. A mentor is expected to guide one through the different phases of life.

Various governments across the world imposed their respective lockdowns to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

In the Philippines all types of on-site social gathering which include work and class were strictly prohibited.

While travel restrictions have recently eased the general public seemed to have gotten used to conducting their activities including banking shopping and work via digital platforms.

In line with this the national government is currently pushing to adopt smart city technologies in the future.

Baguio the New Clark City in Pampanga Davao Cebu and Manila are among the places in the country that had laid the groundwork to develop their areas into smart cities.

A Smart City is a place that uses different types of electronic methods and sensors to collect data.

E-governance solutions

Vertiv a global provider of critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions said the digital transformation and e-governance initiatives of all the cities in the country just like the other smart cities across the globe provide an opportunity to make the entire Philippines more resilient challenges like the current public health crisis or natural calamities.

“Following this devastation preparedness for typhoons and other calamities has never been more important for instance in getting necessary data where they can draw insights to efficiently conduct pre-evacuation of residents in flood-prone and vulnerable areas. And as IT becomes integral government agencies must have a ready infrastructure in place to ensure that services go on unhampered and citizens have access to services they need” Jason Lim country manager of Vertiv Philippines said.

Lim added that governments are also turning to Artificial Intelligence and analytics in their technology initiatives. These are seen to enable the no-collar workforce or the increased use of cognitive assets bots and other technologies to support the existing workforce.

“Instead of replacing people technology will augment the existing labor force in the drive to become a sustainable hyperconnected society” the firm said.

It added that it is integral for governments to rethink their strategy to include data sovereignty and protection as part of their e-governance solutions to make its services more efficient and secure amid the increasing use of online applications to connect citizens and businesses.

With the heavy reliance on information technology the firm provides E-Governance Solutions “to ensure uninterrupted operations optimal performance and scalability of data centers communication networks and other critical IT facilities needed in creating smarter and more resilient cities.”

“The IT infrastructure should be designed not only to support critical operations but it must also have robust monitoring and management framework for secure operations intelligent notifications and alerts to enable immediate action in case of emergencies” Lim said.

In line with this Department of Information and Communications Technology the country’s primary agency promoting the adoption of eGovernment Services has already developed the E-Government Masterplan 2022.

It aims to create a networked and collaborative environment for improved public service delivery.

Digital innovations in banking and finance

Given the digital shift banking firm PBCom technology firm Cisco and mobile wallet app GCash said that their online users or clients also grew following the travel restrictions imposed in March.

In a webinar webinar series titled “New Normal Trends & Opportunities for the Philippine Financial Services” PBCom and GCash said that their digital systems have been using technologies from Cisco when the lockdown or enhanced community quarantine was implemented.

Ariel Roda chief information officer of PBCom cited the usage of Cisco Webex a videoconferencing application as among the tools for the local bank’s push for digitization.

“Months prior to the pandemic we’ve been able to set up a lot of alternative channels digital and self-service by which our customers consumers and corporates would continue receiving our services” Roda said adding that the videoconferencing application helped them continue relationship with their customers.

Roda also highlighted the convenience of opening a bank account for 15 minutes only compared to the hassle of personally filling out physical forms.

She also noted that the bank recently made an investment to improve the security of its customers such as “upgrades to its firewalls for improved monitoring of transactions and self-service tools such as its social media and customer hotline.”

GCash on the other hand had been among the digital payment services widely used during the past year for purchases and other financial obligations.

Ana Pascual vice President for Key Merchants and Acquirers of the mobile wallet app disclosed that they currently have over 27 million registered users.

“Everyone learned how to buy their essentials online pay their bills online and all of those shifts. Thankfully we have developed these products for the convenience of people not leaving their homes to do things and in this particular situation that’s exactly what was called for” she said.

Sharoakh Charna Industry Lead for FSI of Cisco APJC cited a recent study that in Southeast Asia there are 40 million users who connected to the internet in 2020. This was four times more than in 2019.

Charna projects that such inclusive and phenomenal expansion will grow ten times more by 2024.

She considers the pandemic as an opportunity that “allowed us to realize all the transformations that we wanted to do or were holding back to do. The transition towards the better normal helped move the banking industry forward.”

Improved remote working conditions

Just like the governments and financial institutions companies also adopted remote work.

In view of this global cybersecurity firm Kaspersky asked independent research firm Censuswide to conduct a global study of how employees’ habits have changed how they imagine the ideal workplace might function and their view of new remote-working technologies

The study covered interview with over 8000 people at small and medium-size businesses (with no more than 250 employees) in Brazil Belgium China France Germany Italy Japan Luxembourg Malaysia Mexico the Netherlands Russia Spain South Africa Turkey the UAE the UK and the US.

Of these 37% respondents revealed that they want a flexible working structure moving forward where they continue to

work mostly from home but also visit the office regularly.

Nearly half of the respondents (47%) shared that spending more time with loved ones is the top benefit of working from home followed by saving money (41%) and working

remotely (32%).

“The results show that most employees want change. When asked which established processes they don’t want to go back to only a quarter of respondents said they were generally satisfied with how everything was before” the cybersecurity firm said.

“Others want more flexibility: no more fixed hours or five-day work week options to work remotely and so on. They want to tailor their working hours to their personal needs — without sacrificing performance” it added.

Because of this Kaspersky suggested various ways on how the companies and businesses can successfully facilitate remote work amid the new normal. These are also the practices seen in workplaces this year.

Among them is the formation of human resource and IT communication channels where employees and the whole company can solve their issues. This can be done through webinars or group calls.

The firm also recommended educating of employees “to use basic security practices when working remotely such as how to avoid becoming a victim of email or web phishing or how to manage accounts and passwords.”

It also suggested for the companies to adopt a cloud-based security solution.

“Even small companies should protect themselves from cyberthreats regardless of whether employees work on corporate or personal devices. Kaspersky Small Office Security can be installed remotely and managed from the cloud; it doesn’t require much time resources or specific knowledge for deployment and management” the cybersecurity firm said.",,,

With the rollout of vaccines underway and a new round of economic stimulus landing soon JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup each said on Friday that they had begun to pare back the enormous reserves they had socked away in case of an economic disaster.

Citigroup’s chief financial officer Mark Mason cited the vaccines the most recent round of stimulus and the election outcome — which is likely to result in a bigger stimulus package — as drivers of the bank’s decision to raise its economic forecast lower its expectations for the unemployment rate in 2021 and release some rainy-day funds.

“There are a lot of favorable indicators that support the direction of the variables and make for a more positive outlook in 2021” Mr. Mason said on a call with journalists to discuss the bank’s results adding that things had improved even more since Citi had closed its books after calculating its fourth-quarter performance and its economic forecast this month.

Some of the changes that banks are making to their forecasts could be temporary. New accounting rules force them to tweak their reserves and their forecasts more frequently to keep up with changes to conditions in the financial markets and the economy. But their brighter outlook was not just confined to the paper on which their quarterly results were printed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2UtbWluaS1kb3ctam9uZXMtaW5kdXN0cmlhbC0wODMyNTc4NzMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM) Futures Technical Analysis – Potential for Steep Break Under 30233,"March E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures finished lower on Friday with Dow component JPMorgan Chase & Co weighing on prices and weakness in Exxon Mobil Corp dragging down constituent Chevron.

JPMorgan Chase on Friday beat analysts’ estimates for fourth-quarter profit on record trading results and a boost from releasing money previously set aside for loan losses. The sell-off was part of a price slide in the banking sector led by weakness in Wells Fargo and Citigroup.

Shares of Exxon slipped more than 5% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation into the oil giant over how it valued a key asset in the oil-rich Permian Basin. The bad news quickly spread to other stocks in the energy sector including Chevron. Lower oil prices also weighed on the stock.

Daily March E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average

Daily Swing Chart Technical Analysis

The main trend turned down on the daily swing chart on Friday when buyers took out 30638 breaking a higher-top higher-bottom chart pattern that had been intact since January 4. The main trend will change to up on a move through 31116. Taking out 31148 will reaffirm the uptrend. The downtrend will be reaffirmed on a trade through 29318.

The first minor range is 31148 to 30506. Its 50% level at 30827 is potential resistance.

The second minor range is 29760 to 31148. Its 50% level at 30454 is the first potential support level.

The short-term range is 29318 to 31148. Its 50% level at 30233 is the most important support level. It’s the last potential support level before the 23918 main bottom.

The main range is 25872 to 31148. Its retracement zone at 28510 to 27887 is controlling the near-term direction of the Dow.

Short-Term Outlook

Given the close at 30720 we’re looking for an upside bias to develop on a trade over 30827 and for the downside bias to resume on a trade through 30454.

Bullish Scenario

A sustained move over 30827 will indicate the presence of buyers. This could lead to a test of the pair of tops at 31116 and 31148. Taking out these levels will signal a resumption of the uptrend.

Bearish Scenario

A sustained move under 30454 will signal the presence of sellers. This could trigger a break into 30233. Buyers could come in on the first test of this zone but if it fails be prepared for an acceleration into a minor bottom at 29760.

The main bottom at 29318 is the last potential support before the 28510 – 27887 retracement zone. This area is controlling the near-term direction of the Dow.

Households that have been identified as “poor” and “very poor” through a Well-Being Analysis participate in the Leaking Pot exercise. This visual balance sheet through the image of a pot (representing a livelihood pot) allows households to understand why the pot is always empty because of “leaking” expenses.

The financial inputs and leaks are then analyzed to define their main sources of income as well as expenditures related to key life events (e.g. weddings funerals). The analysis requires participants to outline the expenditures that create particular hardships for the future and consider how to stop the leaks so that the pot will not be empty.

In Afghan communities weddings funerals and other traditions require a large percentage of the family’s income. One of the successful outcomes of the Leaking Pot exercise was reducing these expenses. This was one of the actions taken by households in Keenjabuy village in the Khulm district of Balkh province to curb excessive expenditures.

As with most rural villages poor households in Keenjabuy village struggle with finances.

Nonetheless the exercise sparked a community debate and helped many like day laborer Merabuddin who recently married realize that far too much money was being spent on traditional ceremonies like weddings. Merabuddin’s family spent 120000 afghanis ($1560) on his wedding.

The Leaking Pot exercise provides equal opportunities to men and women in rural areas of Afghanistan to discuss the negative impacts of costly traditions on their lives and agree on methods to reduce these costs. Photo credit: World Bank

Consequently the Leaking Pot exercise enabled the community through its CDC to sign an agreement that includes reducing the number of wedding guests from 600 to 300 for each event.

Through these efforts village elders representing communities throughout entire valleys have come together to collectively lower ceremonial expenses to support their community’s efforts to promote financial responsibility. For example following the Leaking Pot exercise the Miranshah village in Anaba district in Panshir province came together to develop a 26-article agreement to reduce expenditures for ceremonies such as engagements weddings funerals the new year among others. CDC leaders and village elders also agreed to establish a literacy course for women and founded a grain bank to support the most vulnerable households in their community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdGl6ZW5zdm9pY2UuY29tL25ld3MvY291cnQtbm90ZXMvY291cnQtbm90ZXMtMS0xOS0yMS9hcnRpY2xlX2E1NTI0ZWY4LTBiNTQtNWVlNC04ZTY3LTU2MjlmYzUzNWZlOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Court notes 1/19/21 | Court-notes | citizensvoice.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Kolkata: In a bid to popularise solar energy in the state the West Bengal government has allowed net metering for individual household rooftop solar panels starting from 1 KW an official said.Earlier institutional commercial industrial and cooperative housing were only allowed the benefit of net metering and that too for 5 KW capacity onward.The West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission in its recent amendments to the Cogeneration and Electricity Generation from Renewable Sources Regulations 2013 had allowed net metering for individual households from 1 KW but had restricted it to 5 KW a top official told PTI.""To boost renewable energy use we have allowed net- metering of solar power installation from 1 KW to 5 KW. Now there is no restriction and anyone can install rooftop solar panel. Earlier regulations did not allow net metering for common households"" a WBERC official said.However a consumer cannot install solar panels more than its own load. That means if a household has an existing electricity load of 2 KW then his installation cannot be higher than 2 KW even if he has space and interest a WBERC official said.The net metering concept allows to set-off the number of units produced from the total consumption and the consumer pays electricity charges of only what he had derived from the grid or distribution company.The regulation allows set-off of up to 90 per cent of his solar power generation for any monthThe new amendment mandates "" gross metering "" facilities for solar system installation capacities above 5 KW.The commercial benefit for a consumer is far less in case of gross-metering compared to net-metering thus making adoption less commercially attractive.The Union Power ministry in its model regulation had provided gross metering over 10 KW solar installations the official added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9saWZlLXN0eWxlL3JlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHMvd2ViLXN0b3JpZXMvZ2V0LXJpZC1vZi10aGVzZS10b3hpYy1oYWJpdHMtZm9yLWJldHRlci1xdWFsaXR5LWxpZmUvcGhvdG9zdG9yeS84MDI4NzA0Ny5jbXPSAZYBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbGlmZS1zdHlsZS9yZWxhdGlvbnNoaXBzL3dlYi1zdG9yaWVzL2dldC1yaWQtb2YtdGhlc2UtdG94aWMtaGFiaXRzLWZvci1iZXR0ZXItcXVhbGl0eS1saWZlL3Bob3Rvc3RvcnkvODAyODcwNDcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get rid of these toxic habits for better quality life,"Not seeking help

NEW DELHI: Hyatt Regency Delhi has been dragged to bankruptcy by Continuum Energy  a Morgan Stanley-owned renewable energy company that claims the hotel defaulted on a power purchase agreement that the two sides had entered.Continuum Energy has claimed at the National Company Law Tribunal that the deluxe south Delhi hotel entered a contract to buy clean energy from it two years ago.As part of the contract the hotel was obliged to draw electricity from a Continuum hydro power plant located in Himachal Pradesh.The energy supplier claimed in court filings that the hotel failed to procure an open access licence from the electricity regulator to allow it to draw power during the tenure of the agreement.Continuum subsequently terminated the power purchase agreement on March 13.Hyatt owes the energy company Rs 2.5 crore as per court filings.Continuum Energy’s chief executive officer Arvind Bansal confirmed the bankruptcy filing against Hyatt Regency Delhi.Hyatt Regency Delhi termed Continuum’s application as “frivolous” in an emailed response.The company noted that it had made a strategic investment in Continuum's power plant which is housed in a special purpose vehicle Sandhya Hydro Power to meet regulatory guidelines for group captive plants.The guidelines stipulate that plants for captive consumption should be atleast 26%-owned by the group of customers who are drawing electricity from it.""Regrettably Sandhya Hydro company has not honoured on several counts having executed the agreement including terms of supply & on aspects of captive compliance(s). Despite our claims of amounts owed Sandhya Hydro without assigning any plausible reason stopped power supply to our company which has prompted an appropriate civil action from our side"" said an email from the office of Shiv Jatia managing director of Asian Hotels North in response to ET’s queries.Hyatt Regency is owned by Asian Hotels North a listed company with a market capitalisation of Rs 144 crore as on January 15.The company is undergoing financial distress and informed stock exchanges in November that it is seeking a relief package from its lenders.It has borrowings of around Rs 1100 crore.“In the wake of the prevailing Covid-19 situation performance of the company has been impacted substantially and has resulted in cash flow constraints. Therefore the company has proposed for one-time restructuring under Covid-19 related stress circular of Reserve Bank of India dated 6th August 2020” Jatia said in a stock exchange filing on November 13.The government has announced a one-year moratorium on insolvency proceedings for all defaults occurring post March 25 2020 as a relief measure for Covid impacted businesses. However defaults occurring prior to that period are not covered by the moratorium."
KO,Coca-Cola Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzE2L2JldHRlci1idXktbWNkb25hbGRzLXZzLWNvY2EtY29sYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: McDonald's vs. Coca-Cola,"Only one of these companies seems to be working with its most important partners while the other appears to be working against them.

The two companies clearly sport similarities. McDonald's (MCD -0.38%) is a fast-food giant while Coca-Cola (KO 0.29%) is a beverage powerhouse. But both outfits continually cater to retail consumers in an effort to make them repeat customers. McDonald's restaurants even offer Coca-Cola products to their patrons.

But the similarities of these two organizations goes well beyond what one can see on the surface. Neither Coca-Cola nor McDonald's is heavily involved in the businesses they seem to be in. Rather both companies are major franchisers licensing the right to sell their products to third parties who in turn pay royalties to the parent organization. Both Coca-Cola and McDonald's in fact have spent the last few years selling bottling and restaurant management operations (respectively) back to bottlers and restaurant franchisees. As it turns out there's more profit to be made in licensing popular brand names than there is in dealing directly with the public.

Ergo the question of which name is the better buy is ultimately a question of which of these two companies is the better franchiser.

Right now -- and for the foreseeable future -- that's Coca-Cola. McDonald's franchisee partners are growing increasingly frustrated with the parent company's heavy demands. An outright revolt may be on the horizon.

Dissension in the ranks

For perspective as of the end of September only 2658 of the world's 39096 McDonald's were actually owned by the parent company. The other 36438 were franchisee-owned. That's a relatively big change from the shape of things five years ago when only 29851 of the 36405 McDonald's stores open at the time were owned by franchisees. McDonald's has been steering away from the restaurant ownership game offloading a few thousand of its once-owned units in search of more profits even if it meant less revenue.

In retrospect one can't help but wonder if the company knew it would be raising the fiscal bar for its franchisees soon thereafter. The first of what would be several new or raised costs after all materialized in early 2015 which was right around the time McDonald's began the refranchising effort. Namely the parent upped its minimum hourly pay at company-owned stores to $10 leaving many franchisees fearful they would eventually have to follow suit (which many did).

However the ever-increasing costs of running a franchised store aren't limited to employee pay. Although the parent company helps pay some of the costs many of the store remodels customers may have seen in recent years were compulsory meaning the restaurant owner was forced to cough up the cash to finance their end of the upgrade.

Also largely overlooked is the fact that franchisees don't actually own their building. That's real estate owned by the parent company and rented by the operator at a price established by -- you guessed it -- the McDonald's company.

The seemingly unchecked cost increases for franchisees ultimately led to the creation of a National Owners Association in 2018 which unofficially lets restaurant owners work together to prevent McDonald's itself from making unreasonable demands. Think of it as an employee union that has enough collective clout to push back on an employer.

The fact that McDonald's franchisees saw the need to organize is in and of itself an indication of their frustration though it arguably understates just how contentious the franchiser/franchisee relationship has become in just the past few years.

Now fast-forward to last month. That's when the parent company informed franchisees of changes that would collectively cost them an additional $170 million in 2021 according to a report from Restaurant Business. In protest 95% of the franchisees surveyed indicated they would refrain from any and all ""non-essential communication with the home company until a more palatable agreement could be found."" Some franchisees say they've never seen anything quite like this standoff within the McDonald's system.

It may all end amicably. But franchisee/franchiser tensions have been building for years -- if they were going to fade they should have done so by now. If anything this dissension among McDonald's store operators seems to be worsening rather than abating growing into a liability that not even investors can afford to overlook. As fellow Motley Fool writer Brett Schafer put it in December ""Optimizing for short-term profits and angering the people who interact with its customers millions of times a day during a pandemic is playing with fire and the company is almost asking for franchisees to revolt."" He adds ""It also may cause McDonald's to lose quality owners to competitors.""

Bottom line

You don't necessarily have to jump to an extreme conclusion on the call. McDonald's still does plenty of things right and Coca-Cola can still stumble. The fast-food giant has mastered the art of marketing and branding while the beverage brand is grappling with changing consumer tastes. Sugary soda is losing its appeal and people are trying out more niche drinks. Coke's big fountain/syrup business has also proven vulnerable to COVID-related shutdowns of sporting events concerts and the like.

Still Coca-Cola and its bottlers are maintaining a healthy symbiosis. For instance Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey commented during the company's third-quarter earnings call that some drinks are being dropped from the portfolio but added ""We have begun the work with our bottlers to quickly sunset or thoughtfully transition them to one of the growth brands over the next year."" This sort of relationship is in contrast with the one McDonald's currently has with its franchisees.

Only time will tell how it all shakes out for the king of the fast-food scene. For investors this sheer uncertainty makes McDonald's the tougher of the two names to own right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZ3VhcmRpYW5sdi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS9zdXBlci1ib3dsLWFkdmVydGlzZW1lbnRzLXdpbGwtbm90LWluY2x1ZGUtcGVwc2ktb3ItY29jYS1jb2xhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Super Bowl Advertisements Will Not Include Pepsi or Coca-Cola,"For many decades companies have wanted to have their products to be advertised during the Super Bowl. That’s when so many people tune into the TV to see who wins the championship ring. On Jan. 15 2021 Pepsi and Coca-Cola announced they will be foregoing this tradition.

Pepsi decided instead that they will be using their traditional time slot for a new campaign. This campaign will lead to The Weeknd’s halftime show. This will be the 10th year that Pepsi has sponsored the Super Bowl’s halftime show.

However Frito-Lay and Mountian Dew — both owned by PepsiCo — have plans to advertise during the game. Coca-Cola stated they will be on the sidelines toasting other brands this year. according to spokesperson Kate Hartman.

This difficult choice was made to ensure we are investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times.

Two years ago Coca-Cola decided to run their ad before the Super Bowl instead of during the game. The COVID-19 pandemic has the company staggering in sales. During the first nine months of 2020 Coca-Cola’s revenue fell a whopping 13 percent. By the end of 2020 Coke’s shares fell 14 percent.

Due to PepsiCo receiving a small portion of their sales from away-from-home sales they managed to raise two percent in sales. This gave the company’s stock a market value of $197 billion.

This year Super Bowl LV will be held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida on Feb. 7 2021. Usually before the Super Bowl is the Pro Bowl game. Due to the pandemic the NFL has canceled this game and plan to replace it with virtual activities this year.

The Pro Bowl was supposed to be played in Las Vegas on Jan. 31 2021. Football fans were very disappointed to hear that it was canceled. However they were happy to hear they had not canceled the Super Bowl.

However its success goes beyond the subcontinent’s borders.

The North American market highly values the variety produced in Mexico.

Fifteen years ago the glass-bottled and Spanish-labeled Mexican Coca-Cola entered the southwestern United States’ market with Mexican consumers as its top buyers. The Mexican Coke unleashed such euphoria that consumers today pay twice as much for a bottle in cities such as Los Angeles and New York.

What makes the Mexican Coke unique?

People attribute Mexi-Coke’s success to its ingredients: Mexican bottling plants use sugar and syrup while Americans sweeten their Coke with corn syrup. People point out that Mexican Coke has a “more complete” and addictive taste.

The Coca-Cola Company in the United States began using corn syrup instead of sugar in the 1980s. In America corn is cheaper than sugar due to government subsidies. Except for the sweeteners the Coca-Cola formula remains the same.

Another difference between both drinks is the packaging.

American Coca-Cola comes in a plastic bottle or a can while the Mexican variety travels in glass. Nostalgia plays a role in the package choice as glass-bottled Coca-Cola left the U.S. market decades ago.

“In my business we sell Coca-Cola in different sizes from individual bottles to three-litter ones. Glass-bottled Coca-Cola has a distinctive flavor. Many people may not notice the difference. However it is quite sought-after in the hot season. It is up to each of us I guess. However if you tell me that a 600-milliliter Coke tastes the same as the half-liter glass Coca-Cola I could say that it does not” said Marcos Landa Hernández a convenience store owner.

“The taste that the bottle imparts on the drink is significant to me. Like it or not plastic changes Coke’s flavor especially when kept at certain temperatures but glass leaves the flavor untouched.The Coca-Cola formula is the same everywhere. I do not think that the difference lies in the ingredients” said Landa Hernández.

After learning that Hispanic immigrants brought Mexican Coca-Cola informally and in small quantities to the U.S. Arca bottling company began selling it in America in 2005. Arca is the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America and in 2019 33% of its sales came from the U.S. Arca has found a way to position Mexican Coca-Cola in the U.S. market providing consumers with a delicious taste of nostalgia.

The interception return came with Baltimore facing third-and-goal from Buffalo's 9 where Johnson stepped in front of Lamar Jackson's pass intended for tight end Mark Andrews with 41 seconds left in the third quarter.

Jackson did not return after sustaining a head injury on the final play of the third quarter when he was sacked while chasing down an errant snap.

Buffalo limited the NFL's top running offense to 150 yards on 32 carries.

Jackson left the game with a concussion after being tackled near the end zone following a bad snap in the AFC divisional playoff game against Buffalo.

Facing second-and-10 at the Baltimore 25 center Patrick Mekari snapped the ball over Jackson's head. The quarterback turned and chased the bouncing ball down inside the 5 turned and quickly threw it away as linebacker Tremaine Edmunds had him by the legs and Trent Murphy down on top of him.

Jackson who was penalized for grounding was flat on his back in the end zone where he was attended to by the Ravens' medical staff.

The team said he was ruled out for the rest of the game.",,,,,,,,,

No deal with Comcast or Dish. Avalanche Nuggets fans on the outside,"The stalemate has gotten worse for Avalanche and Nuggets fans. Many still cannot regularly watch their team on television and now all home games at Ball Arena are played before empty seats.

With both Kroenke Sports & Entertainment franchises’ seasons now underway the regional sports network (RSN) that carries their games Altitude TV remains unavailable to Comcast and Dish Network subscribers.

There does not appear to be an end in sight to the 17-month long impasse either with no new developments in negotiations according to Ken Miller Altitude’s executive vice president and executive producer.

In the case of the Avalanche Altitude is scheduled to exclusively broadcast 50 of 56 games this season with NBC Sports carrying the other six.

Altitude’s previous contracts with DirecTV Comcast and Dish expired within a week of each other in August 2019. DirecTV reached an agreement to re-launch with Altitude on Oct. 31 2019 but the other two remain in a stalemate.

RELATED: Why Altitude TV went all-in on sports betting as embattled network endures pandemic

“I have Comcast and I’m considering moving to DirecTV” Avalanche fan John Wegener of Highlands Ranch said. “It is ridiculous. I find it very annoying that these two companies cannot meet in the middle somewhere.”

The Altitude situation is currently at its worst because most restaurants and bars have limited indoor dining service due to Colorado’s recent COVID-19 spike. So the options for Comcast or Dish subscribers are limited.

“Given the way that all sports are hurting and hemorrhaging money combined with all the rest of us feeling like we’ve been repeatedly clubbed over the head for the past year if not four years it seems absurd that these billionaires can’t find a way to throw us a few crumbs while benefiting themselves as well” Avs fan Cary Wolfson of Boulder said. “We have two potential championship teams that nobody can watch. How is that supposed to build fan loyalty?”

Altitude filed a lawsuit against Comcast last year alleging illegal business tactics but the final pretrial conference won’t come until April 4 2022.

Altitude argues that Comcast’s negotiations “make no economic sense” and are part of a plot to buy or eliminate the RSN. Comcast contends Altitude is conflating a “routine commercial disagreement” with a violation of antitrust laws.

U.S. District Judge William Martinez partially denied Comcast’s request to dismiss the case per online court records allowing it to proceed as both sides produce evidence in the discovery phase. Martinez dismissed several Altitude claims within its lawsuit but he wrote that it “has alleged facts sufficient to show that its allegations of anticompetitive conduct are plausible” against Comcast.

Unofficial Avalanche owner Stan Kroenke (his wife is listed as the club’s owner under KSE) has a 2020 net worth of $8.3 billion according to Forbes. Brian L. Roberts is the majority owner of Comcast and worth $1.9 billion. And Dish Network chairman Charlie Ergen has a net worth of $9.1 billion on the same Forbes report.

They didn’t create their wealth by making bad business decisions. But can’t they find a way to make a deal that benefits Avalanche and Nuggets fans?

Rider Jensen from Denver is an Avalanche season-ticket holder since the team arrived in Colorado in 1995. He has DirecTV and pays a $40 premium during the NHL season to watch the Avs when they play on the road — and on the rare occasion he doesn’t attend a home game. Jensen said Altitude is not provided on his basic service but he’s willing to pay the extra charge.

But Jensen still has a beef with Altitude’s inability to find a way to reach Comcast and Dish subscribers. He’s tired of the various Kroenke-led advertisements bashing Comcast and Dish that encourage fans to complain to the providers.

“I’m not looking for a part-time job to protest something and I’m kind of lucky because I have DirecTV and I can get Altitude” Jensen said. “But cable is hurting. Streaming is taking over — the Netflix Hulu. Cable is hurting. I don’t think they can’t afford to pay Altitude what they used to. And if the Avs started their own streaming service they probably wouldn’t survive.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21pY2hpZ2FuLzIwMjEvMDEvMTYvMjAyMS1tYXJ0aW4tbHV0aGVyLWtpbmctanItZGF5LXZpcnR1YWwtZXZlbnRzLzQxODQwMzUwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day virtual events,"In an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19 several annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day events will go virtual for 2021.

From a business standpoint though Altitude TV enters 2021 mostly unscathed.

The independent regional sports network (RSN) still at legal odds with Comcast says it has not laid off or furloughed any of its more than 100 full-time employees over the past year due to the economic strain of the coronavirus pandemic. Altitude’s financial resilience — with DirecTV/AT&T as its only carriage option — is a reflection of owner Stan Kroenke’s estimated net worth of $8.3 billion.

“We have such good staff and employees across all of our companies and it was very important to maintain that family” Matt Hutchings COO of Kroenke Sports and Entertainment (KSE) said in an interview with The Denver Post. “Appointment television it all changed. … The good news is the one thing we know is that people love sports fans love sports and fans are always going to want to come back and stay connected to their favorite teams and to feel a part of something.”

While Altitude projects confidence evolving sports viewership habits accelerated by the pandemic should concern RSNs across the country with the need to tap into new revenue streams — such as capitalizing on legalized sports gambling — growing.

Upon the re-start of professional sports in 2020 the first batch of Nielsen Ratings showed a national TV viewership annual decline of 32% for the World Series 61% for the Stanley Cup Playoffs and nearly 50% for the NBA Finals. The potential causes for that freefall range from oversaturation of sports returning all at once to a contentious election year to fan lifestyle changes.

Maintaining local interest in the Avalanche and Nuggets might prove difficult in 2021 with attendance prohibited at Ball Arena and the majority of Denver-area cable subscribers unable to watch from home due to Altitude’s dispute with Comcast.

“I think the sports that are really in for a struggle are the MLB NHL and NBA; where primarily most of their viewership is local on RSNs” said Jason Gurwin co-founder of thestreamable.com which has tracked industry trends since 2017. “As costs of RSNs and cable bundles go up these streaming services no longer want to carry RSNs because it’s the most expensive part of the bundle that a very small proportion of their viewers watch. At some point there is going to be this downward cycle.

“RSNs as a whole are kind of in a death spiral right now.”

Place your bets

Altitude which does not publicize its Nielsen data is countering the viewership challenge by joining an industry-wide RSN trend: Going all-in on sports betting.

“The money in sports gambling is going to be there and somebody is going to make it. Why wouldn’t you want to participate in that revenue stream?” said Jim Martin former KSE president and CEO who retired at the end of 2019 several months before Colorado legalized sports wagering. “As it opens up and becomes legal in more states there will be more opportunity and less stigma with doing it.”

The sportsbook PointsBet with its U.S. headquarters based in Denver signed a contract with KSE that made it the exclusive betting partner of the Avalanche Nuggets and Ball Arena. Fans watching games on Altitude can expect a heavy dose of analysis driven by point spreads over/unders and prop bets. But the NBA and NHL also place limits on the amount of sportsbook advertising in each game broadcast.

“Our goal is to be involved pregame in-game and postgame” PointsBet’s U.S. COO Eric Foote told The Denver Post. “It’s how we weave a contextual story or message that enhances the experience of the consumer into what they call ‘wager-tainment.’ We want to give the viewer a better experience to learn and be educated on sports wagering but secondly have the talent at Altitude talking about it.”

Altitude isn’t alone in its commitment to sports betting. In November the Sinclair Broadcast Group announced it sold the naming rights for 21 of its RSNs to the sportsbook Bally’s. The deal will reportedly net Sinclair $85 million over the next 10 years. It leads to an interesting question for Colorado sports viewers: Is PointsBet TV on the horizon?

A single naming-rights deal replacing Altitude would not come close to the Sinclair-Bally’s contract but PointsBet has expressed interest in expanding its partnerships with Kroenke Sports. PointsBet is currently a primary sponsor for Altitude but the sportsbook does not have exclusive media rights for game broadcasts.

“We would never rule anything out” Foote said. “Those (naming-rights) discussions have not come up with the Kroenkes to date.”

Hutchings said there are no imminent plans to rebrand Altitude TV but added: “There are a lot of folks (in sports media) doing a lot of unique and very cutting-edge ideas. In any business you’ve got to be smart and you’ve got to always look and see what opportunities are out there.”

PointsBet is also a keen observer of the Altitude/Comcast legal dispute as the burgeoning U.S. sportsbook currently has partnerships with eight different NBC RSNs (owned by Comcast). The PointsBet footprint in the Denver area would certainly grow faster with resolution and more fans watching games on TV.

“We’re obviously aware of what’s going on having conversations not only with the Kroenkes but also with our relationship with Comcast NBC” Foote said. “Those discussions are strictly between the Kroenkes and Comcast directly. We’re optimistic those will get ironed out and that will increase the distribution.

“What we’re working on with the Kroenkes is: Are there other means of distribution for live content?”

Direct to consumer

Streaming service giants like Netflix Hulu and Disney Plus reaped the benefits of a global pandemic and strict public health orders in 2020 with a combined 50% annual increase of U.S. subscribers according to the Wall Street Journal with “cord-cutting” from cable or satellite TV packages growing in popularity.

A common refrain from frustrated Avalanche and Nuggets fans is the lack of streaming options to watch games on Altitude. It wasn’t until last August one year into the Comcast blackout that Altitude announced its partnership with AT&T to stream live games without a cable or satellite package.

But it doesn’t come cheap. Altitude is available on AT&T TV NOW Max for $80/month or AT&T TV Choice for $65/month per thestreamable.com. Hutchings said Altitude continues to seek more nontraditional options to broadcast games.

“Fans have so many different ways that they can consume and watch their favorite games and there are so many different platforms” he said. “That technology is exponential. It changes on a daily basis. That’s something we stay very very close to and we keep an eye on the newest technology. … We continue to try to answer the call to our fans in how they want to consume (sports) and how they can get connected to their teams.”

Bob Thompson spent nearly three decades in the sports television industry before retiring in 2009 as the president of Fox Sports Networks. He does not believe the traditional distribution method for Altitude packaged with cable or satellite bundles is over.

“The bundle might be having some rehabilitative surgery but it’s not dead” Thompson said. “If we get to this point down the road and ratings are still well below where they were in previous years then I think you have to take a real hard look at the whole model and see if there is something wrong there.

“Everybody is going to have a little bit of tempering of expectations. Whether that be the team owners the RSN owners or (TV) distributors. It’s a model that worked brilliantly for years and maybe some things got out of whack.”

It appears Altitude is uniquely positioned to withstand the financial downturn of the pandemic while being carried by only one major television distributor. The Comcast blackout is likely to continue into the foreseeable future after a federal judge partially denied a motion to dismiss Altitude’s antitrust lawsuit — with the final pretrial conference not set until April 4 2022. But industry precedent suggests a jury trial is unlikely.

It all sets up for another disappointing season for local Avalanche and Nuggets fans subscribed to Comcast for their TV service.

“Networks should be and are looking at new avenues for distribution and revenue streams — not just the gambling — but streaming and other models” said Martin the retired KSE president and CEO. “The world has changed and there are competitive distribution models and broader platforms. Regional sports and sports in general have to learn to adapt to that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcmVnb25saXZlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wMS9zcG9ydHMtb24tdHYtamFudWFyeS0xOC0yNC1uZmwtcGxheW9mZnMtbmJhLW5obC1nb2xmLXNvY2Nlci1jb2xsZWdlLWJhc2tldGJhbGwtYW5kLW1vcmUuaHRtbNIBlQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcmVnb25saXZlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wMS9zcG9ydHMtb24tdHYtamFudWFyeS0xOC0yNC1uZmwtcGxheW9mZnMtbmJhLW5obC1nb2xmLXNvY2Nlci1jb2xsZWdlLWJhc2tldGJhbGwtYW5kLW1vcmUuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sports on TV January 18-24: NFL playoffs NBA NHL golf soccer college basketball and more,"The following is a glance at sports on TV including channels radio listings and game times for local games and national sporting events for January 18-24 2021.

When was the last time you left a convenience store without a Slim Jim in your hand? We know we can’t think that far back either. Slim Jim is a staple on-the-go snack we can always count on but that beefy flavor is going to taste a little different if you choose it that is because the brand has partnered with SONIC Drive-In to create a new flavor.

The SONIC Chili Cheese Coney flavored Slim Jim was inspired by the Chili Cheese Coney at the fast food spot. It consists of a grilled beef hot dog topped with warm chili and melty cheddar cheese in a soft warm bakery bun. Somehow all those elements have been combined into beef sticks to create a taste reminiscent of the real thing.

“For the first time ever we’re taking a beloved entrée flavor the Chili Cheese Coney and creating a tasty craveable snack” Lori Abou Habib chief marketing officer for SONIC said in a press release.

Each Slim Jim is individually wrapped and Monster-sized (1.94 ounces) which means it’s twice the size of a Giant Slim Jim so it’s quite the bite. The Chili Cheese Coney-flavored sticks are rolling out at select convenience stores and retailers nationwide and will have increased availability throughout the year.

“Our fans expect bold flavor when they snap into a Slim Jim” said Spencer Fivelson brand director Conagra Brands. “An innovative partner such as SONIC was perfect for a new addition to our line of Monster sticks delivering the iconic taste of their Chili Cheese Coney in an exciting new way.”

Slim Jim already has a range of flavors and sizes but none quite like what a partnership with SONIC would lead to. It’ll add a whole new experience to your road trip snacking.

Marathon Petroleum Occidental Petroleum and the employee political action committees for ConocoPhillips and BP temporarily froze their contributions. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are reviewing their donations. Even energy industry association spokespersons for the American Petroleum Institute the Independent Petroleum Association of America the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers as well as a leader of the Koch network said the attack on the Capitol will factor into their future giving.

Those who have spent years confronting fossil fuel industry-funded disinformation campaigns raising alarms about the climate crisis are unimpressed with the moves. The origin of the storming of the Capitol was a series of lies and there is no indication that the fossil fuel industry is taking a meaningful stance against high-risk deceit.

“They have been funding disinformation and anti-climate politicians for a very long time.”

In many ways fossil fuel companies laid the groundwork for the widespread acceptance of lies big enough to cause an existential threat to democracy’s survival — even humanity’s. “Lying has become a habit” said science historian Naomi Oreskes whose book with Eric Conway “Merchants of Doubt” documents how veterans of the tobacco industry’s misinformation efforts seeded climate denial among the media and lawmakers.

“They have been funding disinformation and anti-climate politicians for a very long time” she said over email of the fossil fuel industry. Oreskes said reconsidering political donations for election misinformation is a belated gesture: “A day late and a dollar short. Or rather three decades late and hundreds of millions of dollars short.”

Meanwhile the industry still has not come close to fully divesting from nor making amends for their spread of lethal climate disinformation.

To climate scientist Michael Mann the fossil fuel groups’ announcements that they will review political giving serves to evade attention from the fact that during the Trump administration the oil and gas agenda was supercharged by the racist rhetoric and lies that swayed elections in the direction of their favored candidates. Indeed never has the fossil fuel industry’s agenda been carried to fruition so completely as it was over the past four years achieved using what Mann described to The Intercept as “red meat” thrown out for the racist right including election disinformation.

“It is the fossil fuel industry the front groups that they fund along with plutocrats like the Koch brothers — these are the groups that have been pulling the strings that have been throwing out the red meat that have been instigating this racially motivated treasonous rebellion by the disaffected base of the Republican Party” said Mann. “They’re playing with fire and it’s almost like they don’t really care about democracy.”

Links To Election Deniers

The fossil fuel companies will presumably be reexamining donations to politicians who supported the “Stop the Steal” movement to overturn election results. Some 139 U.S. representatives and eight senators voted against certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s win including lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas who has received extensive contributions from some of the oil and gas companies now denouncing the Capitol attack. Perhaps they will also reconsider future contributions to President Donald Trump himself who incited the insurrection and received $14696347 from the oil and gas industry for the 2020 election cycle according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Many more individuals and groups would have to be included in a comprehensive audit of the fossil fuel industry’s involvement in the events leading up to the storming of the Capitol. Among those listed as coalition partners on the March to Save America website which called on Trump supporters to defend the president was the Rule of Law Defense Fund a dark-money group started by the Republican Attorneys General Association.

Fossil fuel companies like Koch Industries and Exxon have donated to the attorneys general association and groups backed by the industry — like the Koch brothers’ Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and the Edison Electric Institute — have directly contributed to the Rule of Law Defense Fund. The Rule of Law Defense Fund even went so far as to put out robocalls promoting the march as Documented reported.

Also listed on the march’s website was Turning Point USA which recently entered into a partnership with the Koch-backed American Legislative Exchange Council. ALEC as the group is known brings together lobbyists and lawmakers to promote industry friendly legislation at the state level. Turning Point and ALEC are working together to place right-wing students on university boards of regents according to reporting by the Center for Media and Democracy. Koch-linked groups also helped mobilize this summer’s reopen protests — a movement that significantly overlapped with Stop the Steal.

Meanwhile the Twitter account for the climate denial website Climate Depot tweeted on January 6: “Striking fear in politicians is not a bad thing.” A subsequent tweet said “Thomas Jefferson: ‘The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” Climate Depot is run by the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow a think tank that the fossil fuel industry has funded in the past. Its Twitter was just one among several climate denier accounts that DeSmog documented supporting the Stop the Steal movement or spreading disinformation in the aftermath of the Capitol attack.

Big Lie of Climate Denial

Mann the climate scientist pointed to parallels between the industry’s attempt to distance itself from election misinformation and its recent move to steer away from all-out climate denial. “They’ve done the same thing with climate denialism as it has become untenable to deny that climate change is real and happening” he said.

The story of the climate lie goes back to the 1980s. In the early part of the decade a task force of fossil fuel industry representatives was meeting regularly to talk about the emerging climate science they were helping produce. Just as the science was becoming clear the American Petroleum Institute and companies like Exxon Mobil began pouring money into disinformation. To cast doubt on climate science the industry lobbied funded new organizations published ads paid for studies bought scientists who would act as media pundits and of course lavished millions of dollars on politicians who would advance their cause.

As a young scientist and author of a key study showing that recent high temperatures were aberrations in the historical record Mann became a target of the industry’s denial machine. Media pundits and politicians attempted to smear his credibility. He received death threats.

Sen. Jim Inhofe R-Okla. who is among the politicians who have received the highest donations from the fossil fuel industry went so far as to call for Mann to be investigated as a criminal.

By the mid-aughts under pressure from scientists environmentalists civil society and shareholders the industry began to distance itself from denial. But the lies were well rooted by then in part because of how well they fit into dreams of unfettered capitalism championed by the right. (Oreskes the science historian and her co-author Conway have a forthcoming book “The Magic of the Marketplace: The True History of a False Idea” which will focus on how ideas about free market fundamentalism helped normalize misinformation.)

Meanwhile the fossil fuel industry continued to donate money to politicians who purveyed climate lies. A 2019 analysis by the Center for American Progress Action Fund of the outgoing 116th Congress counted 150 Republican members who did not believe that human activity causes climate change. They’d collectively accepted $68 million in donations from the fossil fuel industry.

“They haven’t given up in their effort to block the clean energy transition and keep us addicted to fossil fuels. They just changed their tactics.”

And Trump himself perhaps fossil fuel firms’ all-time biggest champion accepted more than $14 million from the oil and gas industry for his reelection campaign. Over the course of his administration Trump dismantled much of the existing government infrastructure for confronting the climate crisis and promoted outright deniers to positions of power.

Mann’s book “The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet” published this week argues that the industry never truly quit promoting climate disinformation. “They haven’t given up in their effort to block the clean energy transition and keep us addicted to fossil fuels” he said. “They just changed their tactics to tactics they think they can get away with.” He pointed to fossil fuel industry efforts to derail state-level policies to incentivize renewable energy development bolster false solutions like geoengineering spread the idea that the climate problem is about individual lifestyle choices and promote a sense of doom that nothing can really be done about the climate crisis — which Mann argues is simply untrue.

What should the industry do if it truly wants to make amends for sowing chaos? “That’s easy” said Oreskes. “Stop funding and fomenting disinformation stop exploring for new oil gas and coal reserves and start working on a new business model that shifts to renewable energy or something else entirely.”

“I think it is tragic that it took an insurrection for them to rethink their strategy” she said. “I hope this will prompt a deeper self-examination. An awful lot is at stake here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZW5lcmdldGljY2l0eS5jYS8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L2EtY2hyb25vbG9naWNhbC1oaXN0b3J5LW9mLXRoZS1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLWtleXN0b25lLXhsLXBpcGVsaW5lLXByb2plY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A chronological history of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project,"Your Community Your News

Ross recently inked to a minor-league contract with the Detroit Tigers picked up all six of his career saves that September and tied for second on the team with 12 holds. He had a 3.86 ERA 53 strikeouts and 23 walks through 54 games (60⅔ innings) out of the bullpen.

The Tigers notice his bounce-back potential even if it's best used as organizational depth. Ross 31 was one of four players signed Saturday to a minor-league deal along with infielder Yariel Gonzalez right-hander Andrew Moore and first baseman Aderlin Rodriguez.

INTERNATIONAL: Tigers sign international prospects Cristian Santana Abel Bastidas among others

Ross returned to the Red Sox in 2016 firing 56 strikeouts (with 23 walks) in 55⅓ innings across 54 games. He had a 3.25 ERA but didn't pitch in save situations.

Since then however he has just nine innings in the majors. A back injury shortened his 2017 season to eight appearances and he was outrighted from the big-league roster before electing to enter free agency. He underwent back surgery that August.

FETTER'S EMAIL: Why Tigers' Daniel Norris believes pitching coach Chris Fetter 'beyond incredible'

During his six-year MLB career Ross pitched 266 games and 330⅔ innings between the Texas Rangers (2012-14) and Red Sox (2015-17) registering a 3.92 ERA 1.38 WHIP 274 strikeouts and 120 walks. The Rangers selected him in the second round of the 2008 draft out of high school.

He signed minor-league deals with the Chicago White Sox (2018) and Pittsburgh Pirates (2019) but was released both times. In June 2019 he joined the Sugar Land Skeeters an independent team in the Atlantic League. One month later after having an 8.64 ERA in 8⅓ innings he was released.

Hawks swimmers and divers broke or tied seven school or Corning pool records in the triumph to improve to 2-0.

Corning junior Ryan McNutt broke the pool record in the 200 freestyle with a winning time of 1:43.73 eclipsing the record of 1:45.44 held by Ithaca's Alex Meyer since 2006. McNutt's time broke his own school record of 1:44.62 set in a 106-66 win at Johnson City on Tuesday.

To close Friday's meet McNutt broke the 100 freestyle pool record set in 1980 by Horseheads' Shawn Toffolo with his leadoff time of 47.99 in the 400 freestyle relay. Toffolo's time was 48.57.

Corning senior Nick Jubilee set a six-dive pool record with his winning score of 312.65 breaking a mark of 294.95 set in 2013 by Binghamton's Deyon Godbay. Jubilee's score broke his own school record of 300.20 set last year.

Hawks senior Cal Bartone won the 200 individual medley in 1:58.78 to break the pool record of 2:00.88 set in 2019 by Horseheads' Shoonhsin Li. Bartone tied his own pool record in the 100 breaststroke with a winning time of 59.36.

Because of COVID-19 considerations Corning competed at its own pool and M-E competed at its home pool.

McNutt Jubilee and Bartone all competed at last year's state championship meet. Because of the pandemic there will be no state meet this season.

Quotable

Said Corning coach Alyssa Helsing: ""We did not have our full team and the boys really stepped up. We could not have won without the outstanding effort from our younger swimmers.""

State rankings

Bartone ranks first in the New York state rankings in the 100 breaststroke and 200 individual medley. McNutt is ranked No. 1 in the state in the 100 freestyle second in the 200 freestyle and fifth in the 500 freestyle. Jubilee's score gives him a No. 4 state ranking for six dives.

Editor’s note: In observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day the Forward is resurfacing some of our recent coverage related to the Black-Jewish experience and racial justice. This article originally appeared in July 2020.

If you want to come to grips with the way race injustice and real estate intertwine in America today a good place to start is on Corning Street a few hundred feet away from the 10 Freeway on the edge of the Westside of Los Angeles.

Corning Street looks and feels like it hasn’t changed since the 1950s. Boxy apartment buildings with names like Desert Sands. Humble Spanish-style bungalows with stained-glass bay windows. An alley behind them claimed as a pedestrian thoroughfare by working moms. A tamale cart competing fruit stands and an omnipresent produce truck that jingles “La Cucaracha” as it rounds the corner.

When I signed a lease on an apartment on Corning in 2018 I couldn’t believe my luck. The location couldn’t be beaten — 15 minutes from the beach 20 from Downtown a stone’s throw from Beverly Hills — yet I could afford it on a writer’s salary. Moreover at a moment when I felt ambivalent about Orthodox Judaism I could observe as I pleased. Most of the block’s residents were of Mexican descent as was my new roommate a stranger who had posted on Craigslist. But the neighborhood was adjacent to the heavily Orthodox Pico-Robertson area where I grew up and I could walk to my parents’ for Shabbat dinner.

What I did not then understand was that the neighborhood the very block had changed a lot over the past 60-plus years. My good fortune had actually come at the tail end of a decades-long process of race-based discrimination. The Jewish revival of La Cienega Heights as the neighborhood has been known since 2003 has not quite happened at the expense of Black life. But the trajectory of these 18 square blocks underscores the subtle ways in which American Jews including myself often benefit from structural anti-Black racism without realizing it.

First as vacant land not bound by race covenants then as a pocket of affordable homes on the city’s upscale Westside and now as an oasis of rent-controlled units near enough to synagogues and kosher restaurants La Cienega Heights has always been a source of economic optimism for its residents.

But while it has served as a launchpad for upwardly mobile Jews and Latinos the neighborhood was a spiteful trap for Blacks. In 1987 a policing experiment whose constitutionality has been challenged the now-ubiquitous civil gang injunction designated this neighborhood a “safety zone” effectively making Black men subject to an oppressive regime within its boundaries. What lurks behind the buoyant bustling community I joined two years ago is the legacy of that injunction a signature tool of racial profiling and a singular menace to communities of color all over the country.

Jews from across the United States flocked to the area after the Great Depression and over the following decades became filmmakers real-estate developers and business owners — the Westside’s upper-middle class. La Cienega Heights stayed predominantly white and Jewish through the 1950s.

Then in 1967 came the first seeds of integration. That was the year the original cohort of Black students from South Los Angeles was bused to Alexander Hamilton High School a mile from Corning Street. By 1972 half the school’s students were Black; by the 1980 census 60% of La Cienega Heights residents were Black. Many of the area’s white residents including most of its Jewish population had moved out.

La Cienega Heights was not spared the introduction of rock cocaine into Black communities or the emergence of street gangs during the 1980s. Wrought-iron window bars and barbed wire went up around the neighborhood as a homegrown gang the Playboy Gangster Crips sold crack on Corning Street and controlled the surrounding blocks. The 1987 injunction developed to stop that gang the first of its kind in the country was the first of a series of crackdowns on crime in the neighborhood; what followed over the next 30 years was a gradual outflow of the neighborhood’s Black residents and an influx of Latino immigrants who took their place.

Today but a fraction of the once majority-Black population remains in La Cienega Heights and Jews pushed beyond the boundaries of Pico-Robertson by steep rents and a housing shortage have begun to resettle there. The American Community Survey found that between 2014 and 2018 La Cienega Heights — the area bound by Robertson and La Cienega boulevards between Sawyer Street and Cadillac Avenue and to be clear a place with no heights to speak of — is now roughly 20% Black and 50% Latino.

“I think what we’ve seen historically is arresting people and pushing people out does not create safety” said Josh Green an attorney who is director of criminal justice programs at the Urban Peace Institute. “At least not for the community that was there.”

The departure of Black residents from La Cienega Heights reflects a broader trend of Black migration out of L.A.’s core. But the suppressive policing strategy that originated here as exemplified by injunctions gang databases and sentencing enhancement has also left a particular indelible mark on this place. Barbed wire still wraps some fencing. Some alleys are still padlocked. Cops still patrol the one behind my apartment.

The 1987 injunction started with a few dozen people but its legacy includes the California gang database which contains the names of nearly 80000 state residents most of them people of color and many with no knowledge of their inclusion. On July 14 amid a growing scandal around false gang identifications by cops from the Los Angeles Police Department state attorney general Xavier Becerra revoked access to CalGang records created by LAPD essentially invalidating them. The decision which affects about a quarter of the database granted a victory that criminal-justice reform advocates had sought for decades. Meanwhile La Cienega Heights has sprouted a kollel (an institution that supports full-time Torah scholars) more sukkahs crop up every fall and I see as many yarmulkes as pet dogs on the walk to shul. The Black community does not seem likely to return to its previous numbers.

From Jewish to Black

Louis Thompson moved to Corning Street with his roommate in 1978 for the same reason Esperanza Ramirez did in 2001 and Gina Cardarella the year after that. “It was just about what I could afford” Thompson 82 said speaking through the iron-grated front door of his Spanish-style house. (A pandemic was raging outside and he was playing it safe.) Back then Thompson recalled the houses on Corning were mostly occupied by white Jewish homeowners the apartment buildings by Black renters. But Thompson had a mortgage on the corner house.

If housing affordability is the story of post-redlining migration in Los Angeles La Cienega Heights offers a fine case study. It took shape in the 1940s and 1950s when an influx of upwardly mobile Jews from other L.A. neighborhoods and out of town moved into small houses on previously undeveloped parcels. Across the street from Thompson’s house now the site of a shopping plaza with a Dollar Tree and a Coffee Bean was a dairy farm.

In her 2015 book “Police Power and the Production of Racial Boundaries” which contains a historical ethnography of La Cienega Heights Ana Muñiz a professor of criminology law and society at the University of California-Irvine writes that one resident estimated the neighborhood was 80% Jewish in the 1950s. As they found professional success those Jews sent their children to Hamilton one of the top public high schools in the city. They got zoning laws changed so they could put up apartments in their backyards.

Then came busing.

The desegregation of public schools after the landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education set in motion a demographic shift throughout the city. When a pilot program in the Los Angeles Unified School District designated 10 public high schools for voluntary busing in 1967 Hamilton enrolled 75 Black students. Soon upwardly mobile Black families looking for housing on the Westside found the area around the school more affordable especially La Cienega Heights and moved here en masse. Thompson was one of them.

Six years after the pilot program began Hamilton had 800 Black students only 40 of whom were bused from outside the neighborhood.

Jewish groups — and Hamilton’s Jewish students — had supported desegregation even joining a hunger strike with the Congress of Racial Equality outside a Board of Education meeting in 1963. But Jewish families fled La Cienega Heights to the adjacent Jewish neighborhoods following the high school’s integration. La Cienega Heights went from 98% white in 1970 to 25% white and 60% Black in 1980. The areas surrounding it — Beverlywood Pico-Robertson and Crestview — remained predominantly white Jewish and upper-middle-class Muñiz writes as La Cienega Heights “became an increasingly working-class African-American island.”

Jews had not only left La Cienega Heights; they had also sold their buildings to property-management companies which filled units with Section 8 tenants and lowered rents across the board. Toward the end of the decade the passage of California Proposition 13 which froze property taxes at 1976 assessed values throttled state and municipal revenue streams causing a decline in public services and employment and pushing industries that employed working-class people out of state. The resulting collapse of opportunity coupled with the introduction of crack cocaine into the inner city fueled the rise of gang-related crime.

‘We need to abate the gang’

That’s when things got rough.

The Playboy Gangster Crips a Black street gang was born in 1979 in the alley behind my apartment initially as a merger of rival break-dancing groups. As crack cocaine hit the drug market in the 1980s the gang used Corning — nicknamed ‘C Street’ — to sell the drug often to clients from the affluent predominantly white adjacent areas. The distribution system involved pagers hand signals and lookouts posted on bicycles and perched on rooftops. When the cops showed up the crews would disappear into the alleys to evade arrest.

Thompson remembers teenagers from the gang dealing in broad daylight from beneath a tree on his front lawn. He never called the cops. “I guess the fear” he explained. Intimidation of residents was a major factor.

“Nobody could go outside literally” said Robert Ferber a deputy city attorney at the time.

Ferber was tasked with stopping crime in La Cienega Heights in 1986 around the time Jeremy Steven Heading a white 16-year-old was killed on C Street in a drug deal gone wrong. The neighborhood known back then as “Cadillac-Corning” for its most dangerous corner was not the worst in Los Angeles at the time — violent-crime statistics were much higher in several pockets of South Central. But its proximity to white upper-class areas garnered Cadillac-Corning special attention.

When Ferber first took the case the gang whose name was shorthanded as the PBGs had taken over the neighborhood. A gas station on Cadillac and La Cienega was robbed so many times it closed. Landlords had ceased collecting rent entirely. Even police officers had to call into the station before driving down Corning. And while most of the drug trade occurred on C Street home break-ins car theft and muggings were commonplace on the surrounding blocks.

“This was a neighborhood version of organized crime” Ferber recalled in a recent interview. At the same time services were lacking — trash collection he said was erratic the parks weren’t safe and graffiti in public spaces seldom got painted over.

No matter how many gang leaders were thrown in jail there was always another person ready to take their place. Ferber had faced a similar conundrum in the vice unit where he was charged with cracking down on street prostitution. The only way he’d managed to make a dent was by filing nuisance abatements against the motels where sex workers brought clientele.

“We jokingly talked about what we need to do is abate the gang” Ferber said. “We ended up filing a lawsuit that was considered the wackiest thing in the court system.”

Ferber sued on behalf of community members claiming the PBGs were a public nuisance and asking the court to stop the gang from doing things that helped it operate. People identified by residents and police as gang members (a dozen or so on the original list which eventually grew to about 40) were summarily banned from a range of activities — carrying pagers wearing blue standing on rooftops approaching vehicles and congregating in public in groups of two or more.

Instead of handing out hefty sentences for dealing drugs the longest jail sentence one could get for violating the injunction was five days Ferber said. Still if your name was on the list you could go to jail for carrying a pager in Cadillac-Corning.

The American Civil Liberties Union challenged the injunction and won the removal of some terms such as a curfew after 7 p.m. But Ferber’s project eventually made it through the courts and later injunctions used the original as a template.

The early results surpassed the community’s wildest expectations. Gang members weren’t running from the cops — they were running from process servers Ferber recalled. “We had literally pushed the gang out of the neighborhood” he said. “They couldn’t get to the point of consummating a sale.” Ferber would tip off local stations before police roundups and the injunction’s apparent success became a national news story. Los Angeles City Attorney James Hahn and Police Chief Daryl Gates rushed to expand its use.

But Ferber admitted the injunction failed to keep the crime or the gang out of Cadillac-Corning for long. A case-study available online shows another police crackdown on the Playboy Gangster Crips in the neighborhood beginning in 1997. Gina Cardarella said that when she moved to Corning Street in 2001 a driver delivering her pizza would not leave his car to drop off her order. Another resident recalled drive-by shootings on Corning in the same period.

According to Green the Urban Peace Institute attorney gang injunctions failed to stop crime because they punished symptoms of disenfranchisement rather than address them. “The root causes of the violence were not that law enforcement didn’t have enough weapons or tools at its disposal” he said. “The root causes were the disinvestment from the communities.”

‘A Terrifying Tool For Abuse’

The Cadillac-Corning injunction the first served to an entire gang opened a Pandora’s box of surveillance policing and criminalization. Injunctions were spirited through courts and became bigger broader and more punitive. The Cadillac-Corning injunction spanned 26 square blocks. A 2011 injunction east of Downtown Los Angeles spanned 16 square miles — more than 60 times the size of the original. Whereas residents worked with law enforcement to identify the gang members on Ferber’s injunction later injunctions listed John Does enabling cops to decide afterward who warranted the restrictions. From 2000 to 2018 the city of L.A. added 8900 people from 79 gangs to injunctions according to the city attorney’s office.

Gang injunctions have been used almost exclusively in neighborhoods whose populations are overwhelmingly nonwhite. And while these injunctions never discuss race explicitly “the actual application of the document is clearly racialized” said Green.

Injunctions have offered a pretext for thousands of Black men to be added to the CalGang database without knowing it and with little recourse. Factor in laws that escalate penalties for identified gang members and a regime aimed at crime suppression has been a potent accelerant of mass incarceration. The American prison system now has more than 2 million Black people behind bars.

Ferber who left the gang unit in 1993 defended his injunction’s intent. But he worried as he saw it sweep the nation. “I started to see anybody who is walking with a gang member is now a gang member” he said. “I thought ‘My baby is turning into a terrible tool for abuse.’”

The Black residents of La Cienega Heights attest to that abuse. Esperanza Ramirez who raised two Black sons on Corning Street after moving there in 2001 does not live in fear of gang violence. But she does not live in peace either. She described her eldest Donovan being thrown against a wall and searched by police officers on their street a few years ago. More recently Benjamin her teenager was detained for jaywalking on his way out of basketball practice.

Crime in the neighborhood has diminished in recent years she said but zealous policing has not. “If you have a kid who’s a minority that trauma doesn’t go away” Ramirez said. “Your mind can’t relax because you always have that worry. It’s like ‘When am I going to be happy?’”

Home sweet home for some

There’s a way in which the Latino spirit of La Cienega Heights can give it the feeling of an old Jewish shtetl: the melody of everyday life the primacy of walking; front-yard birthday parties kids chasing the ice-cream truck. The pushcart a bygone symbol of Jewish hustle now represents entrepreneurship for immigrant Angelenos; in La Cienega Heights they dish out elotes tamales and snow cones. But it seems like only a matter of time before this place stops feeling like an old Jewish shtetl and starts feeling like a new one.

Corning Street got its first luxury housing this year on the same corner where Jeremy Steven Heading was shot in 1986. A few blocks west but still in the neighborhood boundaries luxury condos rent for $9500 a month. The kollel’s resident scholars have moved into an older building a block over. One real-estate agent told me he expects most of the neighborhood to flip Jewish in the next decade. Only rent control on these old apartment buildings will make it take that long.

So for the moment it remains predominantly Latino reflecting a decades-long trend of L.A.’s Black neighborhoods turning brown. Latinos — many of them immigrants — now make up the overwhelming majority of residents in South Los Angeles the historic core of Black life in Southern California and about half of the population of La Cienega Heights. Blacks seeking areas with lower crime and more affordable housing have spread to outer suburbs like Palmdale and Lancaster some 40 miles from the city center.

But while Latinos can still feel the brunt of aggressive policing most Jewish people could move to an area under a gang injunction and never be the wiser. In the case of La Cienega Heights they can rush out of a neighborhood when Blacks move in and trickle back after Black residents are pushed or priced out. Where a gang injunction criminalizes geography for people of color it does just the opposite for whites enhancing their mobility enabling them to move into new neighborhoods. And in my neighborhood today Jews are among the beneficiaries.

While there is no longer a gang injunction over La Cienega Heights scores of injunctions remain across Los Angeles County elsewhere in California and in communities of color all over the United States. The shadow of oppressive policing that stretches from this neighborhood is impossible to measure.

Being white and Jewish in La Cienega Heights means that shadow will never affect me. It means that I’ll never be stalked by a patrol car or asked to show my ID going from a walk at night. It means I can ride a bike or stand on a roof or hang with my friends without drawing suspicion. My presence in this neighborhood won’t make adjacent areas uncomfortable. Nearly two years into living here Corning Street feels like home. I banter with the driver as I buy produce from the La Cucaracha truck. An old shul nearby is experiencing a revival and new kosher restaurants have opened alongside it.

But I think I will struggle with the history of the place as long as I live here. Every time a new family moves in — presumably for the same reason Louis Thompson did in 1978 the same reason I did in 2018 — it will be coasting on those errant facts of life almost certainly without knowing it. A woman will cry tamale into the twilight air. Teenagers headed to after-school jobs will bike down the alleys. And when they no longer do I’ll know it’s time for me to leave.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvZGVib3JhaC1ib3N3ZWxsLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTc1NzY3NDPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deborah Boswell Obituary (2021) - Omaha NE - Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/wcfcourier/name/deborah-boswell-obituary?id=7576743 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvZGVib3JhaC1ib3N3ZWxsLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTc1NzY3NDPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYWRnZXRzbm93LmNvbS9zbGlkZXNob3dzL3ZhcmlhYmxlLXJlZnJlc2gtcmF0ZS1kaXNwbGF5LXMtcGVuLXN1cHBvcnQtdG9wLWZlYXR1cmVzLW9mLXNhbXN1bmdzLW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLWdhbGF4eS1zLXBob25lL3Bob3RvbGlzdC84MDMwOTI4MC5jbXPSAaMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FkZ2V0c25vdy5jb20vYW1wL3NsaWRlc2hvd3MvdmFyaWFibGUtcmVmcmVzaC1yYXRlLWRpc3BsYXktcy1wZW4tc3VwcG9ydC10b3AtZmVhdHVyZXMtb2Ytc2Ftc3VuZ3MtbW9zdC1leHBlbnNpdmUtZ2FsYXh5LXMtcGhvbmUvcGhvdG9saXN0LzgwMzA5MjgwLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Variable refresh rate display S-Pen support: Top features of Samsung’s most expensive Galaxy S phone,"The S21 Ultra has a quad camera setup with 12MP Dual Pixel A/F Ultra wide Phase Detection A/F F1.8 wide and two telephoto lenses of 10MP each with 3X and 10X optical zoom respectively.

In the background was the imposing gray-and-white facade of historic Television City with its CBS sign and eyeball logo.



“It was hard to ignore the way our studio was thrust into the spotlight of the demonstrations” said Zach Sokoloff an asset manager with Hackman Capital Partners a Culver City-based real estate company that owns and operates the production hub. (Hackman had allowed the L.A. Police Department to use the studio complex as a staging site during the protests a decision that was heavily criticized).



After seeing the photo Sokoloff quickly gathered with Hackman executives. “We held up a mirror and asked ourselves: ‘How can we as a studio be a responsible community stakeholder and do our part to help folks in the most need?’”

Their solution was two-fold: Give money and time.

H ackman pledged $1 million to local organizations like the Midtown Los Angeles Homeless Coalition and another $1 million to help diversify the film industry.

For the volunteer component Hackman partnered with Good City Mentors a nonprofit that enlists executives from high-profile companies that are either based in L.A. or have a large presence here (think Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. Google and Capital Group) to mentor students at underserved Los Angeles Unified School District high schools.

“It was important for us not to only speak about change but be part of the change and to do it at a level that could far exceed what one individual could do on their own” Sokoloff said.

Founded in 2015 by Brian Larrabee a former commercial actor (he played the dad in a “choosy moms and dads choose Jiff” spot among others) Good City Mentors puts students and mentors together weekly in small group settings to talk for an hour about themes centered on personal leadership skills like trust gratitude and love.

Since launching its Mentor L.A. initiative to focus on giving students in Black communities access to entertainment companies Good City Mentors has grown its volunteer base to 334 members and more than doubled the number of campuses where it works to a total of 15.

Access can happen naturally Larrabee said when students have the opportunity to make personal connections.

“The fabric of our city is the entertainment industry. A lot of our students don’t have access to it unless they can meet someone from those companies” Larrabee said.

Invested in success

When mentors show up week after week or offer to talk about their careers it shows students who might have a hard time trusting adults or have a negative neighborhood environment that someone is invested in their success according to SpringHill Entertainment executive Ty Cameron.

“I grew up in West Philadelphia. I was also considered an at-risk kid and saw early on how having a role model or someone to look up to can help guide your decisions” said Cameron who serves as head of distribution at SpringHill a video production company created by LeBron James and Maverick Carter and a Good City Mentors volunteer.

“A lot of the executives and mentors are not people of color but they’re able to go into these schools and communities and see the other side what these kids who are at-risk are dealing with” Cameron said. “And that moves the needle.”

According to Larrabee some of these highest-need high schools are surrounded by “the most inspiring companies in Los Angeles.”

That’s the case with Netflix Inc. which signed up with Good City Mentors in 2019. The two towers that the streaming giant occupies at Sunset Bronson Studios are next door to Helen Bernstein High School where 90% of students are eligible for free and reduced meals and 34% are English learners.

Netflix has sent 150 employees to serve as mentors at local high schools including Bernstein High.

“They were really our first corporate partner. They opened up the pathway for their employees to become mentors” Larrabee said.

Now Hackman Capital is doing for Fairfax what Netflix did for Hollywood.

Dubbed “Hollywood’s newest power broker” by CoStar Group Inc. the real estate company has added production studio after production studio to its portfolio including Culver Studios MBS Media Campus and Television City which it acquired two years ago for $750 million.

The impact of the AP protest photo that pushed Television City into the spotlight in May is not lost on Sokoloff.

The media industry is largely white and companies are only slowly chipping away at the disparity. UCLA’s latest diversity report said 92% of chief executive positions at major TV studios and networks — “where pivotal decisions are made regarding what gets produced by whom and at what scale” — are occupied by white executives.

A good match

When Sokoloff synced up with Larrabee the two decided to expand Good City Mentors’ Mentor L.A. initiative into Fairfax High School.

It was a good match.

The high school is in Television City’s “backyard” and Larrabee said the school was already on a list that LAUSD had supplied to Good City Mentors identifying its most underserved and highest-need campuses.

Hackman lets it employees use work time to volunteer which became a lot easier during the pandemic because the mentoring sessions went virtual.

“I don’t know if we would have had this same level of commitment if other things like traffic and schedules were getting in the way” Sokoloff said of the company’s 40 volunteers about half of whom work at Television City.

“The future of our city will be brighter if all the inspiring creative local professionals in the biggest brands in the world give their employees an hour or two to invest in the next generation” Larrabee said.

This week when Good City Mentors is back in session for the spring semester mentors will help students create resumes.

And they’ll be able to list mentors as references.

“Think about having the president of Television City on your resume at 17 years old” Larrabee said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Filed on Dec. 21 by San Ramon’s Reza Mahmoodi on behalf of residential group Safer San Ramon the appeal challenges the approval of the project stating that impacts related to traffic the environment and quality of life would be detrimental to the community further stating that the review process itself was flawed.

“We sadly have to appeal the MEGA Costco gas station to the City Council since the unelected Planning Commission put Costco’s greed before the needs and concerns of residents” Safer San Ramon posted on its Facebook page. “Why doesn’t Costco have to do what much smaller gas stations are forced to do and conduct a full and comprehensive EIR so that residents know all of the impacts this will have on traffic air quality and public health? Why is the City giving Costco special treatment?”

Originally approved by the Planning Commission on Dec. 15 the gas station would be located at the site of the Office Depot building on 3111 Fostoria Way and serve the Costco warehouse store located across the city’s border within Danville town limits — the Danville Costco store located at 3150 Fostoria Way currently does not have a gas station.

The project will also include a 12663-square-foot canopy with signage on all sides an approximately 200-square-foot control facility and associated site improvements and landscape enhancement on the 2.88-acre lot.

Among a number of potential problems petitioners took particular issue with the negative impacts the gas station would have on traffic circulation in the region finding that the city’s review of traffic impacts was less than satisfactory.

Arguing that a traffic study should have been conducted by an independent entity appellants are concerned that since the gas station is located outside of the main Costco grounds — about a street away from the store — additional traffic congestion will most likely occur.

“When a fueling facility is placed within the parking lot of a Costco warehouse store and is highly popular or experiences big surges in demand and large queues form those queues are generally confined to some of the parking aisles of the warehouse store parking lot” the appeal noted. “When a Costco fueling facility is located on a site separated from the warehouse store property there is a reasonable likelihood that the trip characteristics of the patrons of the separated site will be different from those of facilities co-located on the warehouse property.”

Petitioners further claimed that the traffic report prepared for the city was not created from an objective source and have called for additional review from an independent source.

Specifically the petitioners said the report’s author Kittleson Associates has “a long-term arrangement” with Costco where the firm “provides advocacy transportation analyses that cast new Costco projects in the most favorable light plausible.”

Appellants have also listed potential health and environmental concerns as additional motivations for their appeal expressing concerns over emissions from vehicles visiting the gas station.

“For example emissions associated with travel and idling of 9500 vehicles per day is of concern to workers and residents in the project area” the appeal reads.

Other items the appeal lists as remaining unresolved related to the project include:

* Complete EIR

* Fiscal Impact Study

* Cumulative Air Quality Study

* Independent study of impact on local businesses

* Hours of operations are extended longer than other local Costcos

* Delivery of fuel schedule

* Queuing capacity for each fueling pump

* Demand (which is based on regional members and not Danville membership)

* Construction emissions of pollutants exceed BAAQMD guidelines

* Wholesale warehouse facility for gasoline was not considered in the North Camino Ramon Specific Plan

City staff have not officially set a date for when the appeal will be heard by the City Council; however plans to review the case are tentatively scheduled for February.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW5kYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tL2xvY2Fsc3RhdGUvYmVuZC1oaWdod2F5LXByb2plY3Qtb3BlbnMtZG9vci1mb3ItY29zdGNvLWZyZWQtbWV5ZXItcGxhbnMvYXJ0aWNsZV9hZDVjMWVmMi01Nzc4LTExZWItYTUyMC1iYmI3ZTE3NWFhNzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bend highway project opens door for Costco Fred Meyer plans,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Several administrative employees at Costco’s Ottawa office say they’ve been told to come into work despite the provincial stay-at-home order.

Some employees at Costco's regional offices in Ottawa are questioning why they're being told to come into the office when they could easily work from home.

Under a provincewide stay-at-home order that took effect Thursday Ontarians are expected to leave home for only essential reasons working from home if possible.

Because Costco's retail stores are considered an essential business primarily selling groceries and other household necessities they are allowed to remain open.

But several office employees whose identities CBC News agreed to keep anonymous because they feared reprisal for speaking out say the company is stretching the definition of ""essential"" to jobs that could easily be done from home.

""We do everything on a computer. It's just a push of a button"" said one employee. ""We don't need to be on site.""

""My office nobody [has gotten] COVID so far knock on wood but is that what they're waiting for?""

They say the company is only sending about half of its workforce home on a rotational basis. Others have been told they are not eligible to work from home leaving hundreds of workers in the building.

Another employee who says he has been with Costco for a decade said the company's actions are ""mystifying"" especially because all the office workers were sent home in March during the first lockdown.

""I did work from home earlier in the year. All of us did. We have the capability as a company"" he said.

""Right now they're ... not taking care of their employees and it feels like a betrayal"" he said.

Costco in a statement to CBC News on Thursday said it would be ""taking steps to significantly reduce the number of employees in our office at any given time to only those employees whose work in the words of the Order '...requires attendance at the workplace.'""

Not 'morally right'

Several employees said after asking management to work from home they were told they could use vacation time or take unpaid leave.

""I don't think it's the morally right thing to do to put hundreds not [a] couple hundreds more people at risk absolutely unnecessarily"" said another employee who has also worked at the company for seven years.

She said there are enhanced safety protocols in the building like barriers between cubicles mandatory masks at all times and directional signs but ""in practice they're not always going to work.""

Costco did not respond to calls for further comment on Thursday.

Inspection of workplaces

The Ontario Ministry of Labour launched a ""blitz"" this week targeting big box stores like Costco to make sure they are following safety protocols including proper physical distancing and mask wearing.

Minister Monte McNaughton did not specify whether offices associated with those stores would also be inspected but said ""employers need to get on board"" with the new measures.

""Our message is clear particularly for people in offices to work from home. Employers have been told to allow their workers to work from home"" he told CBC News.

""If you're not following the rules I'm not going to hesitate to shut you down.""

McNaughton said while the situation at Costco was on his radar he has not been in touch with the company directly. If employees feel unsafe at work he said they can call the Ministry of Labour with their complaint.",,,,,,

Kate Middleton and Prince William have a home that many Brits don’t even know about — a cottage on the Queen’s 50000-acre estate in Scotland.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge split most of their time between London at Kensington Palace and Anmer Hall their country home on the Queen’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk.

But Tam-Na-Ghar holds particularly happy memories for Kate and William a spot they visited often when they were dating the Mirror reported.

And the royal couple even packed their brood — Prince George 7; Prince Charlotte 5; and Prince Louis 2 — into the three-bedroom house for a staycation two summers ago.

The cottage a gift to William from great-grandmother the Queen Mother before she died in 2002 sits near where Prince Charles and Camilla live on the estate — Birkhall.

Balmoral Castle is the crown jewel of the 150-building compound where the Queen and Prince Philip spend their summers.

Also on the grounds are several cottages that the royals rent to vacationers — when they’re not there.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Change could be coming to the sprawling yard however given the impending purchase of its parent company.

CSX Corp. is acquiring Massachusetts-based Pan Am Railways which owns the Waterville rail yard in a deal that has yet to finalized.

Pan Am formerly known as Guilford Transportation Industries bought Maine Central Railroad in 1983. Pan Am’s sale to CSX has statewide implications.

“The Waterville shops have a very strong reputation and I think it would certainly be very positive for Waterville and I think for the state of Maine if they remained open” said George O’Keefe economic development director for the town of Rumford and a longtime follower of the locomotive industry. “We’re not in a place where we have too much of that. There’s enough and we can make it work.”

O’Keefe said he is a firm believer in rail supporting the local economy. He also said the CSX merger is a significant opportunity for Maine industry.

CSX has a large facility in Selkirk New York and some are concerned business could be sent there. O’Keefe however said he expected increased intermodal activity — the shipment of freight by more than one carrier such as truck and rail — in Waterville.

In acquiring Billerica Massachusetts-based Pan Am CSX gets the largest regional Class II railroad in North America which has more than 1700 miles of track in six states and Canada.

Jacksonville Florida-based CSX has more than 21000 miles of track across the Northeast. The Maine portion of Pan Am includes more than 300 miles of track.

CSX is a Class I railroad meaning it is among the nation’s largest. There are eight Class I railroads in the United States including Amtrak.

CSX’s purchase of Pan Am Railways is subject to approval by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board and the company plans to complete its application soon a CSX spokesperson wrote in an email. Pan Am Railways Executive Vice President Cynthia Scarano directed a reporter’s inquiries to CSX.

Nathan Moulton director of the Maine Department of Transportation’s Rail Program wrote in an email that the operational details remain murky until CSX takes over Pan Am. Moulton said the MDOT has a meeting planned with CSX officials to discuss operations.

Once the transaction is finalized MDOT officials will have a better idea of the longer-term effects on Maine businesses. The transaction could take a while. One industry expert said CSX’s purchase of Pan Am will likely be fought by Norfolk Southern Railroad.

Moulton said he believed the direct service in Maine from CSX should provide more-efficient operations and transit times and access to more markets. Maine is a new state for CSX which will have subsidiaries in 23 states.

“We do need to ensure that good connections and interchanges with other rail carriers remain and are efficient so that all traffic moves efficiently not just the traffic that continues on in the CSX system” Moulton wrote. “If this does indeed happen then yes freight rail usage and business in Maine should grow.”

Patrick Strauch executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council said transactions like the CSX-Pan Am deal bring potential to connect more quickly with major markets. The Maine Forest Products Council has many paper and pulp mills as members such as Sappi Fine Paper North America in Skowhegan.

“If there are less links in the system and you’re part of a major line” Strauch said “that usually equates with less time to get to your destination.”

CSX said the acquisition of Pan Am will create more opportunities for the company’s existing customers and those of Pan Am. There are many large producers Pan Am serves across New England.

“We intend to bring CSX’s customer-centric operations and industry-leading reliability to shippers and industries served by Pan Am” the CSX spokesperson wrote. “We look forward to integrating Pan Am and the rail-served industries of the Northeast into CSX and to working in partnership with connecting railroads to provide exceptional supply chain solutions to New England and beyond.”

Adrian Dowling a South Portland resident and self-described New England railroad historian said CSX’s acquisition of Pan Am could have positive and negative impacts on Maine. Dowling said if Pan Am’s dispatchers are moved from Massachusetts to Florida there could be a problem with on-time passenger rail. Dowling also said the sale could positively benefit some of the state’s largest users of freight rail including paper mills but might not be as beneficial to smaller companies.

The CSX spokesperson also wrote the company’s model benefits passenger rail and shippers such as Amtrak which declined a request for comment.

The Amtrak Downeaster runs from Boston to Brunswick on nearly 80 miles of Pan Am track and there is speculation on how the purchase could impact commuter rail service.

The Lake Shore Limited train which is Amtrak’s Boston-to-Chicago service was on time just 41% of the time in 2018 and runs on CSX tracks. The Amtrak’s Downeaster reported 57.3% end point and 74.7% customer on-time performance in November according to a Northern New England Rail Passenger Authority report.

There have been safety concerns over the years involving CSX such as when alleged safety lapses were blamed in 2018 for a fatal Amtrak collision in South Carolina and a derailment in Virginia.

“CSX has a long history of prioritizing their own freight trains ahead of the Amtrak trains and commuter trains that run on CSX tracks” Dowling said. “That’s great for freight customers but not so great for passengers.”

Potential disadvantages include the railroad not being based in New England so CSX might not be as invested as Pan Am was in smaller New England customers. However CSX could also bring improved service according to those close to the rail industry.

An industry expert said CSX could sell assets north of Boston which was allowed by the 1980 Staggers Rail Act.

Consequently O’Keefe said CSX might invest in structural improvements to get through to the port of Saint John New Brunswick Canada. It could level the playing field for some Maine industries if rail service is improved to compete with bigger Canadian industries especially in forest products. In forest products Maine competes with Canadian National which is a Class I rail line like CSX.

“It’s already pretty good but if they do make investments in New England and Maine specifically it really is significant to industry” O’Keefe said. “There’s huge huge demand for (Maine’s) forest products lumber and food products. There’s a lot of potential there.”

SECC director-general Sou Socheat told The Post that consultations with relevant parties were ongoing to account for their input before the prakas is made official.

“Currently we are conducting public consultations to get more feedback from relevant stakeholders and we will consider any suggestions that are suitable for incorporation into the prakas prior to seeking approval.

“The draft is designed for holding companies – meaning it addresses the special cases where a company holds shares of other companies without participating directly in the business activities of the companies they are holding” Socheat explained.

“We are creating this special procedure to enable them to issue their shares on the stock market. This new procedure will not impact existing share issuers. It is a complimentary measure to promote the issuance of securities in our capital market” he added.

CSX vice-chairman Jong Weon Ha told The Post that as per the draft prakas processes for Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) will not be significantly changed but some requirements and conditions must be adjusted according to the different nature of the companies.

“This new prakas opens the door for holding companies to raise funds by listing their firms in Cambodia” he said.

Ha emphasised the distinction that holding companies own and manage shares in other companies rather than conducting their own business operations like standard operating companies.

Existing regulations are not sufficient to cover procedures for public offerings and subsequent obligations for listing holding companies established in Cambodia he explained.

“Therefore the project has been initiated and has now arrived at this stage where the draft prakas is put on the table for discussion” Ha said.

The SECC’s Socheat said a timeframe for approval of the prakas will be determined after accounting for the input from relevant stakeholders.

There are currently 13 listed firms in the Kingdom – seven with stock listings and six with corporate bond listings. According to CSX data they had raised a combined $253 million as of September 30 last year.

The stock index rose 58.37 per cent in 2019 over 2018 only to dip 14.93 per cent in 2020.

Last year public offerings were made by two companies listing stocks and three listing bonds. The five firms raised a combined $92 million from January to September the data showed.",,,,,,,,,

Back by popular request here is another “regen report” from Rod that documents his experience with a 2019 Ram HD 2500 Cummins turbo-diesel and the exhaust system regeneration. Rod initially sent us his regen report for his newer 2020 Ford F-250 Power Stroke diesel truck a few days ago. It generated a lot of discussions and Rod offered to send his MPG and regen data to us for his previous truck which is this Ram heavy-duty.

Just to summarize the new 2020 Ford 6.7-liter turbo-diesel V8 in the F-250 would go into the exhaust regen mode once every 497.5 miles and each regen lasted for about 16.25 miles. Rod drives his trucks in a mixed city and highway environment and puts a lot of miles on his trucks as well.

The 2020 F-250 uses Ford’s latest generation of the 6.7L V8 diesel engine and a new 10-speed automatic transmission. The V8 is rated at 475 hp and 1050 lb-ft of torque.

A little more background:

Before we get to the report here is a little background about what the regen cycle is. If you own a modern turbo-diesel pickup truck it is very likely to have a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). This filter is a part of the exhaust system and it is designed to catch some of the unburned particulates in the exhaust stream. This filter accumulates these particulates over time and thus it must be cleaned to provide better exhaust flow and performance. The regeneration cycle takes care of this by injecting additional diesel fuel heating up the exhaust system and the DPF to 1000 F degrees or more and burning the particulates out of the filter.

The 2019 Ram HD 2500 truck in question here uses a standard output 6.7-liter Cummins I6 turbo-diesel and Ram’s 6-speed 68RFE automatic transmission. This version of the Cummins is rated at 370 hp and 850 lb-ft of torque. This is not the high-output version of the engine that is available in the Ram 3500 trucks.

The Ram HD 2500 report below shows the truck drive 14475 miles while Rod was monitoring the exhaust regen cycles. The truck went through 14 regen cycles over that period for a 245 total miles driven while in regen.

Basically the Ram HD 2500 truck ran a regen cycle once every 1033 miles on average. Every regen cycle lasted about 17.5 miles. This Ram went about twice the distance of the Ford between regen cycles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYWNjZXNzd2R1bi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIxLzEvOTcxNzUzL2p1c3Rpbi1ncmFudC13aW5zLWluLWZyaWRheS1jaGlsaS1ib3dsLXF1YWxpZnlpbmctYWN0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Justin Grant wins in Friday Chili Bowl qualifying action,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='accesswdun.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The case became known as 'The Murder in the Mist' but a decade on Joey's family still have no justice

Carol Cummins mother of murdered Joey Cummins in March 2011

A mum whose son was gunned down 10 years ago feels she could be obliviously walking past his killer in her daily life.

Joey Cummins was shot dead as he was getting into a taxi in what became locally known as ""The Murder in the Mist"" because of the thick fog that evening.

The 25-year-old was hit with three bullets in his back as he was about to get in a Delta cab driven by his friend at around 9pm on January 20 2011.

It happened a decade ago on Longmoor Lane in Fazakerley outside Joey's nan's home where he was living at the time.

A number of arrests were made by detectives some years ago but there has been little new information in recent times.

Today Carol Cummins Joey's mum urged people with any information about her son's killing to come forward.

The nursing assistant told the ECHO : ""It's 10 years on and I [could still be] walking past a killer.

""As a family we would have met and gone out to mark his passing but because of the lockdown we can't.

""But we'll go to the cemetery as individuals.

""I have a lot of anxiety and anger about Joey's death inside me still and I'm sure people know about it and I just wish they would help.

""It eats you up inside knowing the person responsible is out there I could have even spoken to him.

""Even if someone put a letter under my door telling me some information that would be okay.

""I've no idea why Joey was shot he was 25 as his mum you can't be at his back all the time.

""He was very loving and loved his little nephews and now has a niece he never met.

""How can these people sleep knowing they've murdered him?

""But then they can as they're hard-faced.""

The mum-of-two was walking home from work on the night of the murder and heard the sirens heading towards Longmoor Lane but thought little about it until she received a phone call from her daughter telling her to rush to the hospital.

A surgeon was waiting for her and explained ""there’s nothing I can do.""

A £20000 reward remains in place for any information that leads to an arrest charge and conviction.

Joey was an avid Liverpool FC fan and went to games home and away and previously attended Archbishop Beck school.

The mum-of-two added: ""I'd thought maybe he'd been fighting but there was police at the hospital and I heard the helicopter up in the sky.

""If there's a problem why don't people just use their fists?

""I try to stay busy with work to occupy my mind so I don't dwell on what happened with Joey.""

Five people have been arrested and questioned over Joey’s murder but all were released on bail and nobody has ever been charged.

He was shot repeatedly before staggering and collapsing outside a car sales shop.

Police officers were travelling down Longmoor Lane when they came across Joey who had serious wounds.

Detectives think the murder had the hallmarks of a planned execution and have examined why someone might have targeted Joey.

A spokesperson for Merseyside Police's Serious Crime Review Unit said: “It has now been 10 years since the murder of Joseph Cummins.

""Although a number of arrests have been made since his death in 2011 nobody has been charged and his family still have not got justice for his death.

“I want to take this opportunity to appeal for anyone who has information and has not yet come forward to take this opportunity to do so to allow the family to get the answers they deserve.

“We carry out regular reviews to seek any new lines of enquiry or forensic opportunities and we believe there are people within the local community who have the information we need.

“Allegiances change over time.

""Over the course of the past 10 years people may have moved from the area or had disputes and now feel in a position to talk to the police.

Rohit got off to a good start and was playing fluently when he suddenly decided to take on off-spinner Nathan Lyon by hitting him for a six but mistimed his shot and got caught by Mitchell Starc at mid-on instead.

It was the sixth time Rohit was dismissed by Lyon in Test cricket which is more than any other bowler he has got out to in this format.

Former India cricketers Sunil Gavaskar and Sanjay Manjrekar were the first ones to slam the Mumbai batsman for his poor shot selection.

""He had done all the hard work and then he plays that shot. The shot selection sometimes has not been good and that's the reason he got out.

""Maybe he was looking to get a half century with a six. But with the fielders in the deep and the Australians were willing to take that was a risk that was too many to take"" Gavaskar said on Sony Six.

Indian cricket fans including women's team legend Mithali Raj also expressed their disappointment at Rohit Sharma for playing an irresponsible shot to get out.

The grouse Indian fans have against Rohit Sharma the Test player is the same as Indian parents have against their kids.

India were in a good position at 60 for 1 before Rohit's dismissal turned the tide in Australia's favour in the second session. The visitors reached the tea break at 62 for 2 still 307 runs behind Australia's first innings score of 369.

Play never started after the break as rain and subsequently a wet outfield forced the umpires to call for stumps well before the scheduled close of play in Brisbane. Cheteshwar Pujara (8*) and captain Ajinkya Rahane (2*) will resume India's first innings on Day 3."

CVS’s executive vice president Karen S. Lynch who will become company president on Feb. 1 said CVS Health “has more than 90000 trained health care professionals standing by with the capacity to administer approximately 1 million shots per day through our 10000 CVS Pharmacy locations across the country once the federal program is fully activated.""

Biden has proposed a $20-billion national vaccine program as part of his $1.9-trillion spending package in response to the pandemic and the economic downturn.

“We agree with President-elect Biden that pharmacies will play a critical role in the next phase of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and appreciate his leadership in the pandemic response” said Lynch adding “this will build on our success in providing vaccines to one of the nation’s most vulnerable populations having administered more than 1 million shots at long-term care facilities to date.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90d2l0dGVyLXJlYWN0cy1tYXgtaG9sbG93YXktbWFzdGVyY2xhc3MtMjI1ODU3NDE2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Twitter reacts to Max Holloway's masterclass win over Calvin Kattar at UFC on ABC 1,"Twitter reacts to Max Holloway’s masterclass win over Calvin Kattar at UFC on ABC 1

Max Holloway returned to the win column on Saturday when he beat fellow contender Calvin Kattar in the UFC on ABC 1 main event.

Holloway (22-6 MMA 18-6 UFC) earned the first headlining victory on network television during the UFC’s Disney era when he shut down Kattar (22-5 MMA 6-3 UFC) by incredibly one-sided unanimous decision in Abu Dhabi. With the win the former champ snapped a two-fight losing skid both of which came in title fights to Alexander Volkanovski.

If you've been watching Cobra Kai then you already know that Daniel and Ali didn't end up together. While their teenage romance burned out after the first Karate Kid film the actor who plays Daniel is still going strong with his real-life high school sweetheart.

Ralph Macchio first met Phyllis Fierro at a birthday party when he was 15 years old long before his part in Karate Kid made him a household name.

""This is 1970 or whatever"" Ralph told People. ""She was a friend of my cousin and we just smiled and talked and danced a little. Probably the Hustle!""

Photo credit: Kevin Winter

The pair quickly fell in love and tied the knot in 1987 less than a year after Karate Kid II was released. Now they have been happily married for more than 33 years and share two children together: Daniel 25 and Julia 28. For the sake of his wife and kids Ralph has taken a ""one foot in one foot out"" approach to Hollywood—and he credits Phyllis with making that possible.

""Without her and without the foundation and the family we established 'one foot in one foot out' would have been very very difficult on my own"" Ralph explained. ""Because there would not be balance.""

Photo credit: Noam Galai

As Mr. Miyagi once said ""balance is key."" But that's not their only secret to a long-lasting marriage. Ralph says his relationship with Phyllis is rooted in their ""commitment"" to each other.

""It's the belief through the easy times through the tough times whatever we encounter that we are meant to be together"" he said. ""We know that we will overcome all because we believe in that the foundation of that.""

So in case you were wondering whether Ralph is as great of a husband as Daniel is on Cobra Kai...the answer is yes! ❤️"

Here's what you can learn from it.

If you've been wondering why so many companies have gone public in the past year via so-called ""blank check"" or special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) look no further than former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya.

The founder of venture capital firm Social Capital Palihapitiya sought to fix what he felt was broken with the traditional banker-led initial public offering system by taking power away from financiers and giving it to company founders. In so doing he turned SPACs into the IPO 2.0 for today's generation. Palihapitiya prefers technology and other ""big ideas"" companies. Through his Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings SPACs he's taken Virgin Galactic Opendoor Technologies and Clover Health public and more recently announced fintech SoFi would be the next company he'd take public through his preferred vehicle.

There's definitely more than one way to look at this approach. But you can see the wisdom of empowering executives with an owner mindset in a company that Palihapitiya will probably never take public as much as I wish he or someone else would: Chick-fil-A.

Ruffling the industry's feathers

Even if you haven't eaten at a Chick-fil-A restaurant you've undoubtedly heard the superlatives about its chicken sandwich from its base of loyal customers along with the unusual politeness of its employees.

The company instills certain basic tenets into how it operates many of which spring from the family owned restaurant's Christian beliefs. It's why you also won't find a Chick-fil-A open on a Sunday to the dismay of its many fans. Yet by having a fairly limited menu -- basically chicken fries and drinks (and the waffle fries are its most-ordered menu item) -- the restaurant can focus on doing what it knows and doing it well.

That's helped Chick-fil-A leapfrog over the competition like Yum! Brands' Taco Bell and Subway to become the third-largest restaurant chain in the country by sales even though it has fewer locations than many of its competitors. Its success helped launch the chicken sandwich wars that have taken over the fast food industry.

The popularity of Chick-fil-A's sandwich along with changing consumer preferences making chicken a healthy go-to protein encouraged Restaurant Brands International's Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen to introduce its own fried chicken sandwich which became an instant hit and something of a cultural phenomenon.

Others chains came out with their own versions though none has caught on like Chick-fil-A or Popeyes but McDonald's is the latest entrant into the field to try and ride the coattails of the chicken sandwich trend. It will be introducing three variants next month.

Ruling the roost

Chick-fil-A's sales have tripled over the past decade and data from Technomic estimates revenue hit $11.3 billion in 2019 up 13% from the year before. With some 2470 restaurants in operation that works out to average revenue per restaurant of almost $4.6 million.

In comparison McDonald's had $40 billion in annual sales that year from 13800 restaurants or an average revenue per restaurant of $2.9 million. Taco Bell had similar total sales as Chick-fil-A but with nearly three times the number of restaurants its revenue per restaurant average came in at $1.6 million.

In fact no other national fast food restaurant chain generates more revenue per restaurant than does Chick-fil-A.

Some analysts think it's entirely possible Chick-fil-A can grow its business to $30 billion annually which would rank it second on the list of top chains ahead of Starbucks and leaving only McDonald's with greater annual sales.

Rarer than hen's teeth

Unfortunately Palihapitiya likely won't be able to take Chick-fil-A public via a SPAC or through any other vehicle. The chain's founder S. Truett Cathy made his children sign a contract before he died in 2014 promising to keep Chick-fil-A a privately held company (he did say they could sell it).

That's a shame because investors don't have many good options for restaurant stocks in the current climate. The COVID-19 pandemic has limited eateries' ability to operate on a full-capacity basis and with few opportunities for outdoor dining during winter the malaise gripping the industry will continue to drag on performance far beyond the colder months as some may not survive the chill.

However restaurants with a built-in takeout business like Chick-fil-A has will offer better opportunity and returns and drilling down into their restaurant-level revenue and margins will provide valuable insight. Darden Restaurants (DRI -1.19%) has been a standout during the pandemic precisely because its Olive Garden chain had an established robust takeout business in place when the crisis struck. Cracker Barrel (CBRL -1.19%) also weathered the storm by leaning into its catering business modifying its Heat n' Serve Feasts that typically serve 10 people to instead feed a family of six. Off-premises sales have soared to account for 25% of total revenue up from 9% last year.

Unless Palihapitiya decides he wants to buy Chick-fil-A outright and then take it public investors will have to settle for simply enjoying its chicken sandwiches while dreaming about the next private business they'd like a chance to invest in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS1ldGZzLWNoYW5uZWwvMy1zdG9jay1wcmVkaWN0aW9ucy15ZWFyLWxpa2Utbm8tb3RoZXIv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXRmdHJlbmRzLmNvbS9pbm5vdmF0aXZlLWV0ZnMtY2hhbm5lbC8zLXN0b2NrLXByZWRpY3Rpb25zLXllYXItbGlrZS1uby1vdGhlci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stock Market Predictions for Another ‘Year Like No Other’,"By Robert Ross

Investors might have thought they’d seen it all in 2020. But the stock market action was merely a preview of what’s to come in 2021.

Just to take a quick look back the market gave everyone a scare in 2020 when it bottomed in March. But then the S&P 500 surged 67% between March 23 and year-end.

Certain stocks like Tesla (TSLA) Zoom (ZM) and Moderna (MRNA) performed even better soaring by triple-digits.

And now we are going from one “year like no other” to another.

Here’s what I expect the new year will bring for investors…

Prediction No. 1: The Bull Will Still Run in 2021

As 2020 has shown us things outside your control—like a global pandemic—can render any prediction worthless.

But I have a lot of confidence in—and a lot of money riding on—this idea.

Why? Three reasons…

We have every reason to expect the Federal Reserve will keep money flowing into stocks.

Their easy money policies help push people out of “safe” investments (i.e. money market funds and bonds) and into riskier assets (i.e. stocks). With the Fed pledging to keep interest rates low until 2023 bulls can look forward to a multiyear boost.

Here’s something else investors can look forward to…

Congressional gridlock isn’t going anywhere.

With political leadership split nearly down the middle in Washington D.C. we are in for at least two years of political gridlock. Gridlock is historically great for stocks… especially Walmart (WMT) Hewlett-Packard (HPE) and IBM (IBM).

As is this…

Markets are at all-time highs… which typically lead to more all-time highs!

Since 1988 the S&P 500 returns were significantly higher on one- three- and five-year time horizons when the index was at all-time highs:

But while I expect the bulls to keep charging some sectors are looking even better than others.

Prediction No. 2: Tech Will Be 2021’s Top-Performing Sector

Technology stocks have been on an incredible run over the last five years. In fact it has been the best-performing sector in three of the last four years.

Forget those nattering nabobs of negativity who say the tech run is just about done. Get ready to see more outperformance in 2021.

For one while some tech names have had an incredible run in 2020 others have struggled… particularly in the second half of the year.

Household names like Amazon (AMZN) Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) have well underperformed both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since July. And smart investors will see this opportunity to buy great companies at a discount to their peers.

The other kicker is technology stocks are not expensive.

Compared to the dot-com bubble (when interest rates were 5X higher) the five largest US technology companies are relatively cheap:

Technology companies allowed many of us to keep working from home and biotechnology companies will help us return to normal.

That means we’ll see another big year from the companies that made—and will continue to make—this possible.

The worst of the COVID-19 pandemic will soon be behind us. The coronavirus vaccine will take effect both physically and psychologically and the global economy will find its footing again.

Some companies are already taking that side of the bet…

Prediction No. 3: 2021 Will Be the Best Year in a Decade for Dividend Hikes

2020 was the worst year in a decade for dividend investors. In total global companies cut their dividends by 22%.

That means 27% of all publicly traded companies slashed their dividends this year.

We stayed on top of these dividend cuts throughout the crisis. From cruise ships to casinos we steered away from companies whose payouts my Dividend Sustainability Index (DSI) identified as being in danger.

But what goes down… must come up. At least when it comes to dividends.

We have already seen a few dividends return from the dead. Kohl’s (KSS) TJX Companies (TJX) Marathon Oil (MRO) and Darden Restaurants (DRI) are among the first to reopen their purse strings.

Look for more where that came from… even among those that maintained and/or raised their payouts in 2020.

Why? We can use history as our guide.

In the two years after the 2008 financial crisis we saw global dividend payouts increase 39%.

With the Fed keeping the easy money flowing… techs and biotechs getting ready for another unbelievable year… and dividend income ready to be unleashed there’s never been a better time to be an investor.

With the ability to plant 30 acres per day the planter was a combination of well-known and new advances.

""The familiar check row system required the farmer to stretch a length of wire across the field. The wire which had knots in it at regular intervals would pass through a drop mechanism on the planter"" says Neil Dahlstrom Branded Properties and Heritage Manager at John Deere. ""As the planter moved across the field the knot would trigger the drop and deposit the seed. It replaced having an operator sitting on the planter to pull the drop lever.""

The implement also featured a built-in powerlift which was controlled by a rope attached to the tractor seat to lift and lower the planting units and markers. With its ability to plant at five miles per hour the 290 planter was considered high speed at the time and increased productivity by 33% over previous models.

With a price tag of around $350 the popular planter model which is pictured to the right remained in Deere's line for more than 30 years partially because of its versatility.

""Seed plates could be switched out to plant hybrid corn sweet corn soybeans sorghum peas among other crops"" Dahlstrom says.

In the 70 years since the Model 290's debut the planter has evolved into a massive and sophisticated technological tool. Yet many outside agriculture have no idea the level of technology farmers employ to precisely place a seed in the ground. What better place to tell the story of how technology and agriculture are intersecting than at the world's largest technology event.

""Farmers are trying to raise plants in an open-air environment exposed to many variables that are out of their control. Technology gives them the ability to control some of those variables"" says Than Hartsock Global Director of Corn and Soybean Production Systems for John Deere. ""CES gives us the opportunity to bring that story to the masses.""

Showcasing Every Aspect of the Growing Season

This year marks the third year Deere has attended CES. In its first year the company focused on harvest and the technology in the combine.

""We talked about tools like Combine Advisor and how we're adding sensors and capabilities to a combine that make it smarter so no grain is left behind"" he says. ""Last year we talked about smart spraying and how Blue River's See & Spray technology with its cameras and artificial intelligence will drive plant-level management.""

Because CES went virtual in 2021 John Deere took 50 technology reporters to the farm through a hands-on experiment and virtual reality.

Each reporter was sent a corn seed a soybean seed cotton seed dirt and planting instructions. ""The idea was to show him or her what it's like to grow a plant. Now imagine if you were a farmer doing that with millions of seeds across thousands of acres"" Hartsock says.

In addition a computer generated simulation provided a unique perspective on how a crop is planted and the technology integrated into the machine. Outfitted with virtual reality goggles the reporters were taken into a soil pit to learn about the importance of uniform spacing and seed depth.

""The most interesting part of the experience is when a 1775NT ExactEmerge planter plants over top of you"" Hartsock says.

Equipped with 300 sensors and 140 controllers the planter makes a pass in slow motion first to show how each row unit consistently delivers the seed to the soil. Planting 100 seeds per second it then makes another pass at 10 mph. ""With a configuration like this it's not unheard of to plant 400 to 500 acres in a day"" he says. The list price for the 16-row 1775NT ExactEmerge planter featured at CES is priced at $305204.

It's an amazing transformation from the Model 290 that planted 30 acres a day 70 years ago. And Hartsock says the runway of opportunity to continue refining planter performance is still long.

""For example we can look at how the planter deals with varying conditions as it moves across a field. We want it to be able to sense its local environment. What does each row unit see? What adjustments can it make in real time to ensure that seed has the best chance at germination?"" he says. ""While it's exciting to see how far we've come it's also exciting to think about the opportunities ahead for integrating more technology that will drive higher yields and lower costs so farmers are more profitable.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvcmljaGFyZC1rb3Bwcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03NTcxNzc40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Richard Kopps Obituary (1949 - 2021) - Waverly IA - Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/wcfcourier/name/richard-kopps-obituary?id=7571778 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvcmljaGFyZC1rb3Bwcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03NTcxNzc40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcGVnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3dpbGxpYW0tZG9uYWxkLWNsaWZ0b24tc3IlQzIlQTBsaWZlbG9uZy1mYXJtZXIvMjE0Mjk30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,William Donald Clifton Sr. lifelong farmer,"William Donald Clifton Sr. 88 passed away peacefully at home Monday Jan. 14 2021 following a long illness. He was the son of the late W. Carlton and Beatrice Clifton having been born in the family home Aug. 29 1932.

Donald Clifton was a lifelong farmer and one of the last Delaware vegetable canners. He was raised on the Clifton family dairy farm. During his career he witnessed dramatic changes in agriculture. As a boy he handled mule-drawn equipment and in his later years he drove some of today’s modern machines.

Donald appreciated the aroma of freshly turned soil the contours of a prize angus bull and the echo of a two-cylinder Model A John Deere tractor at dusk. He helped his father establish Carlton Clifton & Sons in 1948 eventually becoming owner/operator/president of Clifton Canning Company Inc. until closing the vegetable canning company in 1995.

Donald earned sharpshooter status while serving in the Army National Guard and was an excellent shot as an avid waterfowl hunter. He was also a prolific muskrat trapper in his youth during a time when the cash obtained selling furs could be essential to the family income.

Donald Clifton was first and foremost a family man. He was one of nine children. He married Janie (Ethel Jane Passwaters) July 6 1956. They had five children 16 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren whom they loved to have in their home. They were married 57 years until Janie’s passing Oct. 29 2013.

Donald liked to sing often breaking out in a Hank Williams tune (he would sing “Hey Good-Lookin” to Janie). His favorite songs however were the hymns he sang as a lifelong member of Slaughter Neck United Methodist Church where he served in several capacities including Sunday School superintendent adult Sunday School teacher trustee and various other committees.

In addition to his wife Janie Donald Clifton is predeceased by his father and mother W. Carlton and Beatrice Clifton; sister Ethel Graham; brother Robert Clifton; sister Doris Argo; sister Nancy Rhue; and son David.

He is survived by sisters Vera Reed Lina Carpenter Eleanor Ritter and Carlyn Bryan as well as son William Donald Clifton II and wife Ruth son Derek Ray Clifton and wife Kristin daughter Sharon Clifton Stevens and husband Jay son Darrell Mitchell Clifton and wife Kim. He is also survived by 16 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

Visitation will be held Tuesday Jan. 19 from 6 to 8 p.m. with the funeral service Wednesday Jan. 20 at 11 a.m. both at Slaughter Neck United Methodist Church Argos Corner Road Milford. Interment will be in Slaughter Neck Cemetery Milford. All in attendance will be required to wear a mask and adhere to social distancing guidelines.

The family asks that in lieu of flowers donations be made to the Slaughter Neck UMC PO Box 241 Milford DE 19963.

That’s among the reasons why the EchoStar subsidiary believes its high-capacity Ka-band satellite service is well positioned to secure meaningful aero business in the Americas despite the fact that Viasat has gained strong ground in the region.

Hughes is presently involved in two high-profile Ka aero projects in the Americas — its satellite capacity helps to power the SES/Thales program that will support inflight Wi-Fi across Spirit Airlines’ fleet and it has separately partnered with Inmarsat on an integrated GX+ North America solution that will see aircraft exploit Hughes’ high-throughput Ka satellites over the continental US and roam into Inmarsat’s Global Xpress Ka HTS fleet when operating outside of that footprint. Inmarsat boasts a remarkable technology roadmap for Global Xpress and aircraft fitted with GX+ North America can be positioned anywhere in the world.

“We believe airlines have significant demand and need significant amounts of capacity to serve their passengers. Our Jupiter fleet is the largest fleet of Ka-band capacity across the Americas and the launch of Jupiter 3 will bring even more capacity to the region” says Hughes vice president Reza Rasoulian. The ultra-high density Jupiter 3 satellite is now expected to launch in the first quarter of 2022 representing a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic.

When you look at the airlines’ routes and hubs Rasoulian tells Runway Girl Network “very high capacity is needed. Only a fleet like Jupiter Ka can deliver that performance”.

Those are strong words given Viasat’s recent successes in the US inflight connectivity market. In addition to fitting the lion’s share of American Airlines’ narrowbody fleet with Ka IFC — and having long powered JetBlue’s free streaming class of service — Viasat early this month announced a deal with longtime Gogo customer Delta Air Lines to fit over 300 narrowbodies with its solution. The Gogo 2Ku kit presently installed on those aircraft will be completely removed and replaced with Viasat Ka.

But Rasoulian does not mince words telling RGN that: “Only one provider will not be able to meet the airline demand.” That’s particularly true if a number of airlines adopt free or freemium models he says. As such Hughes believes the Jupiter fleet will become a “very important asset” to aviation.

When industry emerges from the COVID-19 crisis Hughes is hopeful it will see “a significant uptick” in airline orders. There is certainly heightened demand for high-bandwidth functionality on account of the pandemic and a transition to remote work. “Folks wanted to be connected prior to COVID but post-COVID they want to check on their loved ones and check social media and check on their home from a distance — and all the home automation that we’re seeing now as well. So absolutely we’re hopeful that in 2021 as we emerge from COVID and everyone is safe and get back to a normal routine that airlines are also ready to invest” says the Hughes executive.

Though Hughes supports inflight connectivity through both its service and hardware the company does not go direct as an aero ISP for airlines. “Our strategy is to sell our Jupiter solution and managed capacity via partners and basically the value of the partner system is they marry our systems and solutions with a value added layer that they bring to the table” explains Rasoulian. Among Hughes’ service partners Global Eagle for instance has expressed an interest in collaborating on the GX+ North America solution.

“There’s a lot of art and science that goes into [implementing] an IFC program successfully for airlines. There is a lot of knowhow that requires an integrator. It’s not just about bolting an antenna on an aircraft” says Global Eagle CEO Josh Marks.

Hughes’ partnership strategy differs from Viasat which is vertically integrated and acts as aero ISP in addition to powering inflight connectivity service with its satellites.

“We’re really giving airlines many choices you’re not limited to just one provider” notes Hughes’ Rasoulian. “You can use the Jupiter technology or managed service via multiple channels so the airlines will have to decide which is the best channels.”

He continues “I think Hughes as a company is laser focused on connecting the unconnected and in aviation and aero we really have a compelling approach and strategy and compelling capacity to help our airlines really move the needle as the world kind of emerges from the pandemic.”

On Thursday Delta Airlines reported a loss for the fourth consecutive time in the December quarter and a full-year 2020 loss for the first time in 11 years as COVID-19 travel restrictions significantly dented air travel demand but CEO Ed Bastian said he expects 2021 to be the year of recovery.

The Airline company which provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo reported a quarterly adjusted loss of $2.53​​ per share worse than the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.47​​ per share loss.

“Despite coming into the new year on the back of tough 4Q traffic numbers amidst a third pandemic wave and the prospect of 1Q somewhat bereft of catalysts we are very encouraged by mgmt’s confident tone on the conference call with a clear line of sight to the other side of the pandemic. We think this should result in a tide that will continue to rise and lift the airline stocks with it” noted Ravi Shanker equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“We believe Delta Airlines’ (DAL) strong customer loyalty/franchise corporate relationships footprint historical PRASM/margin strength balance sheet and mgmt. team leave them well-positioned amongst legacy peers to participate in the rebound with the potential for an upside surprise if international/corporate volumes/PRASM can surprise to the upside in 2H21/1H22. Long-only investors returning to the sector as traffic comes back are also likely to flock to DAL in our view which makes the technical setup attractive as well. Our 2021/2022/2023 EPS moves to -$1.42/4.33/7.52 vs. $0.91/4.80/NA prior”

Other equity analysts also recently updated their stock outlook. Credit Suisse raised the target price to $48 from $47. Stifel upped the stock price forecast to $49 from $39. JP Morgan lowered the price objective to $49 from $51.

In addition Deutsche Bank lowered shares of Delta Air Lines from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating and set a $47 target price in December. BNP Paribas began coverage and issued an “outperform” rating and a $54 price target.

Fourteen analysts who offered stock ratings for Delta Airlines in the last three months forecast the average price in 12 months at $48.83 with a high forecast of $58.00 and a low forecast of $40.00.

The average price target represents a 22.14% increase from the last price of $39.98. From those 14 equity analysts six rated “Buy” seven rated “Hold” and one rated “Sell” according to Tipranks.

Delta Airlines’ shares closed 3.59% lower at $39.98 on Friday; the stock fell over 30% in 2020. Morgan Stanley’s stock price forecast suggests a potential upside of 37.57% from the stock’s current price.

Morgan Stanley also gave a target price of $86 under a bull-case scenario and $29 under the worst-case scenario. The firm currently has an “Overweight” rating on the Airline company’s stock.

“Why Overweight? Delta Airlines (DAL) has some of the strongest customer satisfaction numbers among the other Legacy peers while also commanding a higher PRASM making it our preferred Legacy carrier. With ample liquidity we see limited liquidity risk here” Morgan Stanley’s Shanker added.

“Additionally we continue to see DAL’s international alliances and partnerships as strategic assets despite recent writedowns.”

It's been less than two weeks since Washington DC was rocked by an assault on the US Capitol Building as rioters attempted to prevent the certification of the Electoral College. Now as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to be sworn into office on Wednesday airlines are doing their part.

New security measures are being implemented on flights to and from the nation's capital starting this weekend with the hopes of preventing another day of violence. Airlines are keen not to repeat the mistakes of last week as the days surrounding the Capitol riots saw increased tensions in the nation's skies.

""These new security measures are more extensive and stringent compared to those implemented after 9/11"" industry analyst Henry Harteveldt of Atmosphere Research Group told Insider.

Delta Air Lines has already banned six passengers who had been harassing Utah Senator Mitt Romney and running afoul of the airline's face mask rule. The senator was accosted in the airport terminal and endured chants of ""traitor"" while in the air for opposing President Donald Trump.

Rioters were also able to board flights home amidst the chaos of the last week despite the best efforts of local authorities to stop them from boarding flights. Onboard disturbances were a reoccurring theme as Phoenix-bound American Airlines plane erupted in ""USA"" chants while non-compliance with mask requirements saw Alaska Airlines ban 14 passengers.

Here's how airlines are doing their part to protect the inauguration.

No weapons allowed

All major US airlines that fly to Washington's two area airports will prohibit passengers from transporting firearms in their checked luggage in the days surrounding the inauguration on flights to and from the region. That list includes American Airlines Delta Air Lines United Airlines JetBlue Airways Alaska Airlines Frontier Airlines and Southwest Airlines.

Each airline is different in its restrictions but some include other area airports as far away as Baltimore/Washington International in Maryland and Richmond International in Virginia. Unloaded legal firearms are typically allowed to be transported in checked baggage as long as they are in a locked case.

Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air are banning firearms on flights to Baltimore as the airlines do not fly to either of Washington's local airports.

Harteveldt said he doesn't recall any firearms restrictions on flights to Washington following the September 11 2001 attacks.

Some airlines are allowing those passengers who had planned on transporting firearms will be allowed to change their flights free of charge and allowing exemptions for law enforcement and active-duty military personnel.

Alaska Airlines will require passengers to stay seated on the first hour of a flight from Washington or Baltimore or the last hour of a flight when arriving in the two cities.

The policy builds upon a safety measure enacted after the 2001 terrorist attacks where passengers couldn't get out of their seats when within 30 minutes of Washington on a flight to or from National Airport. Alaska's policy adds an additional 30 minutes to the 9/11-era rule and expands it to Dulles International and Baltimore/Washington International Harteveldt told Insider.

""I do recall taking a shuttle flight from LaGuardia to National when the policy was in effect"" Harteveldt said. ""The gate agent reminded us of the restriction several times before boarding and encouraged passengers to use the restrooms before boarding due to the short flight which would require we be seated for its duration.""

""Onboard the flight attendants said that we couldn't even stand up to retrieve or place something in the overhead bin and told us that if we needed something such as a computer bag to let them know"" Harteveldt said.

No other airline has enacted a similar policy.

A temporary prohibition movement on flights

American Airlines will not be serving alcohol on its flights to and from Washington and Baltimore between January 16 and January 21 a spokesperson told Insider. This policy was also enacted in the days surrounding last week's riots.

The airline currently doesn't sell alcohol in economy; rather alcoholic drinks are only served to first class passengers on most domestic flights. Airlines have largely stopped serving alcohol in economy as a result of the pandemic.

Harteveldt told Insider that no such restrictions were enacted post-9/11 and no other airline told Insider that alcohol sales would be put on hold.

Limiting ticket sales on DC-bound flights

Alaska Airlines will be limiting ticket sales on its flight to Washington and Baltimore to stem the flow of travelers to the region. The inauguration has gone mostly virtual as concerns of a super-spreader event have prompted authorities to warn against travel.

""To support law enforcement's calls to avoid travel to the area we will limit the number of tickets purchased on flights to and from the DC metro area"" the airline said in a statement.

No other airline has told Insider that they would be limiting ticket sales. The Seattle-based airline flies to Washington and Baltimore from Seattle Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Ensuring mask compliance

Flying on a Spirit Airlines Airbus A320neo. Thomas Pallini/Business Insider

Mask enforcement will be a top priority on flights to and from the region multiple airlines told Insider after onboard incidents following the Capitol riots involved passengers defying mask-wearing policies.

The number of passengers banned by airlines for not wearing masks only increased in the days following the Capitol riots. A single Alaska flight saw 14 passengers banned for non-compliance while United banned 60 passengers during the week of January 4 alone a spokesperson told Insider.

Sun Country Airlines which doesn't currently fly to Washington also reported an uptick in mask incidents following last week. American will update its pre-departure announcements to stress the importance of wearing a mask while flying.

Airlines have been tough on mask enforcement as wearing a covering has been proven by the Department of Defense and Harvard School of Public Health studies to curb the onboard spread of coronavirus and airlines don't want to jeopardize the fragile recovery by appearing lax on enforcement. Currently the only exception is for actively eating and drinking.

Most airlines will remove passengers from the banned list once the pandemic is over and the rule is no longer in effect unless the banned person commits another offense that warrants a longer ban.

Support from the federal government

To top it off the Federal Aviation Administration is continuing to warn passengers that any unruly behavior can result in jail time and a fine of up to $35000. Administrator Steve Dickson on Wednesday also enacted a zero-tolerance policy through March 30 2021 that could land flyers in legal trouble.

""Effective immediately however the FAA will not address these cases with warnings or counseling"" the FAA said in a statement. ""The agency will pursue legal enforcement action against any passenger who assaults threatens intimidates or interferes with airline crew members""

Wearing a mask is currently not required by federal law but the FAA has brought civil charges against passengers who have refused to cooperate with airline mask policies. The strongest punishment recommended by the FAA in those charges is a $15000 fine for a passenger who the agency says ""screamed obscenities at and hit a flight attendant"" before grabbing a phone the flight attendant was using to talk to the pilot and causing the flight to divert.

Most airlines have also cited increased coordination with law enforcement authorities as well as an increase in airport staffing."

US District Judge Eric Tostrud in Minnesota ruled Friday January 15 that the plaintiffs a group of drug distributors had successfully pleaded their case that Mylan Optum CVS Caremark and Express Scripts engaged in a conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and that Mylan violated the Sherman Act.

The suit filed in Trenton New Jersey Sanofi claimed that Mylan caused it to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in sales by erecting barriers to US consumers’ access to and use of a rival product Auvi-Q.

In particular Sanofi claimed that Mylan offered rebates to insurers pharmaceutical benefit managers and state Medicaid agencies conditioned on Auvi-Q not being an epinephrine auto-injector device they would reimburse for use by consumers.

As a process symbolizing traditional IT service management and the ITIL framework it’s under increasing pressure to modernize in response to agile and DevOps trends. However change management emerged for a reason. I think it’s prudent to look at what at its best the practice actually does and why so many companies have used it for so long.

This is the topic of my recently updated research “Overcome Change Management Paralysis.” In this report I cover the reasons for the change process. It has legitimate objectives — coordination risk reduction audit trail — that do not go away because of agile or DevOps. The question is instead how does the modern customer-led digital organization achieve them? The classic “issue a request and appear before a biweekly change advisory board” is one way to achieve the desired outcomes — and likely not the most effective means as I discuss.

I don’t believe change management will ever go away. My recent state of modern technology operations research indicates that effective change management is strongly correlated with superior availability outcomes — some of the most robust statistical correlations in the report.

But the practice does need to be revamped. Organizations still misapply heavy change management practices to low-risk changes. A significant percentage in our research were still referring all changes to a change advisory board (CAB) regardless of risk. In our findings referring all changes to the CAB is not correlated in any way with better availability business results or change failure rate. (The Accelerate research found that referring all changes to the CAB is correlated with worse software delivery performance.)

Manual documentation of changes; lengthy change-approval delays; large biweekly face-to-face CABs; and reviewing all changes regardless of risk are no longer essential or suitable to modern change practice. Organizations pursuing agile and DevOps agendas are already changing their approach. The change process is increasingly automated; in some cases release automation tools auto-create and update change tickets via APIs.

Certainly the robust audit trails inherent in modern continuous delivery toolchains enable change management’s original intent with far greater rigor than any manual process ever could. Organizations adopting product team models (correlated with agile transformations) are less likely to see a CAB as essential. Furthermore we found that organizations who have taken action to streamline their change process were much more likely to report superior business performance.

And yet the change process itself retains support. Organizations undergoing an agile transformation were more likely to view their change process as effective at identifying risk. They were strongly likely (p ~= 0) to view their change process as essential to coordination.

So what are we to make of these somewhat contradictory findings? Ultimately change management is transforming and becoming more transparent and integrated into the overall software delivery pipeline but its concerns never vanish. A few of our recommendations:",,,,,,,,,,,,

This year’s event however was replaced with a virtual online version in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Even so the local students joined others from across the state in the competition that challenges designers/models to create outfits made from recyclable or reused materials such as newspaper aluminum cans and cardboard.

The ReFashion Show includes four challenge categories with participants in two age groups –13 and under and 14 and over based on the age of the outfit designer not the model. Cash prizes of $150 $100 and $50 are awarded to age group winners and category winners receive a mall gift card. Ultimately 23 participants in West Virginia used their imagination to create outfits from high fashion to cosplay and science fiction themes. The competition is open to anyone in the state not just students.

Brooke High School art teacher Sara Roark learned who won during the week feeding into Christmas news that made her especially happy.

“This is my 15th year teaching at Brooke High School” Roark noted. “We’ve entered the W.Va. ReFashion Show every year since 2007 — my second year teaching — but what’s even more exciting is that we’ve placed something in the show every year that we’ve entered. This year however set a new record for us in having three students place in the show. We’ve had two in one year several times in the past but never three” Roark explained.

“And Brooke Middle School participated for the first time and had a winner too so all of that is very exciting for Brooke County Arts” she added noting Brooke Middle School art teacher Lindsey Zeigler encouraged her students to get involved in the 2020 event.

Brooke schools had seven students create outfits with five actually entering.

Roark announced the local winners and explained their inspiration.

¯Veronica Mann a Brooke High School junior Ramen Noodle dress first overall 14 and over category.

“Veronica thought to do her dress based off her hair — yes you heard right her hair” Roark began. “She said her hair reminds her of Ramen noodles when falling out of a bowl. She also enjoys eating them — her favorite flavor is chicken — and while she does not know how many packages she used for sure she knows it was well over 100. No worries she did not eat that many herself rather collected wrappers from other Ramen-loving friends family and classmates” Roark assured.

¯ Lani Cole Brooke High School junior Mountain Dew packaging second overall 14 and over category.

“When it was assigned Lani went into the kitchen and looked around to see what there might be a lot of” Roark explained. “Both of her parents drink a lot of Mountain Dew so she knew she wouldn’t have trouble getting that to use for her project. Her family and parents’ Facebook friends instantly started collecting. She then she went to the craft store to pick out the perfect pattern. During the next couple weeks she saved all the supplies and stuck them in a corner which her mom said looked like a garbage room” Roark continued. “She used approximately nine 12-pack cardboard boxes 49 cans 35 grocery bags 52 labels off bottles and pop tabs. At first she wasn’t too sure of herself and kept saying ‘how do people do this for a living?’ but during the process and with her twin sister’s help it started coming together. She tweaked it numerous times to get the perfect fit. She commented on how loud the dress was as she clanked around her house trying it on but in the end when she was posing for the contest photo shoot she said ‘So this is what it feels like to be a super model in trash'” Roark said.

¯ Madison Roble Maleficent (Best of Cosplay Category) 2014 movie

A Brooke High School senior Roble knew she wanted to try to create the Maleficent costume even before she figured out what materials she was going to use. “I just thought it was a really cool character and thought it would be really fun to make” she told her teacher. With the dress being predominately black she scrambled to figure out what recycled materials she had available to create that finally settling on the inside ribbon from VCR tapes and broke open and unraveled at least 10 old discarded movies to have enough to make the dress and accessories.

¯ Anneliese Schupbach a seventh-grader at Brooke Middle School also won Best of the Newspaper Category. According to her teacher she was inspired by her grandparents who are avid newspaper collectors.

Entries had to be submitted through e-mail by Nov. 30 andl consist of two videos not to exceed 30 seconds each. The first video was to include the designer on camera stating their name and age group and describing their design inspiration and the materials used in the garment. The second video was to highlight the garment with a runway walk making use of the model’s environment home yard etc. Designers also were encouraged to submit photos of their design especially shots highlighting detailed aspects of the garment and any fashion accessories that were part of the design including shoes and purses for example.

“I love this competition because it encourages both out-of-the-box — or maybe using the box — thinking and spurs consideration and conversation on various economic social environmental issues in a fun way” Roark said. “We are such a throw-away society and that certainly has consequences. This fashion show puts on display not only dresses but maybe more importantly the idea that there are alternatives out there if we only put a little time and creativity into finding the solutions” she added.

Roark was glad the event could still be held given the pandemic has interrupted a schedule of normalcy.

“The past year has brought a lot of uncertainty change and loss and I was crossing my fingers that in a time where so many things were getting canceled that this event would still go on. And it did” she said.

“While it didn’t look quite like past years for us — there was no trip to Charleston no walking the runway in the middle of the mall with a cheering crowd and no live awards I think it still had the same excitement leading up to it with the students frantically brainstorming and working to turn trash into stunning pieces of wearable art” she noted. “I’ve encouraged my students to enter every year and have been extremely proud of their efforts and results but I’m even more impressed by this year’s students as they had to work hard from home most of the time. We started the ReFashion pieces while we were still face-to-face in school but soon after went remote forcing students to be extra creative and self-motivated to get their pieces done in time. They certainly rose to the challenge. These outfits were so impressive” Roark commented.

“Last year we entered a Snow White dress out of Dollar General bags and magazines; a flashy bird costume from CDs and VCR tapes; and an inventive take on the Mad Hatter largely made of teabags and old books” Roark said.

While there is a slideshow of participants on the www.wvrecycles.com site a video and official statewide announcement of winners was set to post mid-January.

The Recycling Coalition of West Virginia that organizes the show is a nonprofit environmental organization whose mission is to promote the effective and sustainable reduction reuse and recycling of materials otherwise destined for disposal. It pursues these goals by promoting the purchase of products made with recycled materials; by coordinating and facilitating activities relative to recycling; and by fostering communication among organizations government agencies and individuals through the sharing of ideas and resources according to its website.

EVANSTON Ill. (WLS) -- A fourth victim from last weekend's shooting spree that stretched from Chicago's South Side to Evanston died Saturday according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office.

TIMELINE: Shooting rampage between Chicago Evanston leaves 7 shot at least 3 dead

Marta Torres 61 of Evanston died after she was critically wounded at an Evanston IHOP in the 100-block of Asbury Avenue last Saturday.

She is one of seven people shot and three others killed by 32-year-old Jason Nightengale according to police. Among the other victims killed was 30-year-old University of Chicago Ph.D. student Yiran Fan 46-year-old mother of two Aisha Johnson and 20-year-old Anthony Faulkner who had just moved back to Chicago.

The three victims killed in a shooting rampage Saturday have been identified as family and friends reel from the senseless loss of their loved ones.

Yiran was the first of the seven victims and was found shot to death in a Hyde Park parking garage. Friends remember him as a ""brilliant student"" and a ""positive loving person.""

Johnson was Nightengale's next victim according to police. She was shot and killed while working as a doorwoman at a Hyde Park condo building in the 4900-block of South East End Avenue. Police said Nightengale had asked to use the phone before opening fire. He fatally shot Johnson and critically wounded a 77-year-old woman who was retrieving mail in the building.

""She was a good person. She has two kids that I know of"" one neighbor said about Johnson.

The shooter then traveled a few blocks away where police said he pulled a gun on a man he knew. Nightengale pushed the man into his apartment in the 5000-block of South East End Avenue where he stole the keys to the man's vehicle according to police.

After locating the vehicle in a nearby parking garage Nightengale proceeded to a convenience store in the 9300-block of South Halsted Street. There he announced a robbery before fatally shooting Faulkner who was just at the store to buy some snacks and lottery tickets police said.

""He had the most contagious smile. I mean he was just so loving and so kind"" said Shapearl Wells Faulkner's cousin.

The shooter also critically wounded the food mart's 81-year-old cashier before he stole the register and took off.

Police are working to piece together Jason Nightengale's crime spree that started on Chicago's South Side and ended in Evanston Saturday.

Next police said Nightengale fired shots from an unknown location striking a 15-year-old girl in the head as she rode in the back seat of a car her mom was driving in the 10300-block of South Halsted Street. The teen's father last said she was in critical condition fighting for her life.

A short time later police said Nightengale returned to the scene of the robbery in the 9300-block of South Halsted where he then fired shots striking a Chicago police vehicle.

The crime spree didn't end there.

Police said Nightengale then traveled up to Evanston where suburban police responded to a call about a man with a gun at a CVS store near Asbury and Howard. When officers arrived they said the suspect ran across the street to an IHOP where he took Torres hostage before shooting her in the neck area according to Evanston police.

Marta Torres became the fourth victim to die following last weekend's random shooting rampage that stretched from Chicago's South Side to Evanston.

Nightengale then led officers on a chase east on Howard before he was ultimately shot and killed by Evanston police near a Dollar General parking lot according to officials.

Police have not released a motive as to what led Nightengale to commit the deadly rampage. However the ABC7 I-Team uncovered social media posts from Nightengale in the hours leading up to the shootings.

Suspect posted slurred rambling videos before fatal rampage: sources

Evanston police press conference on crime spree hostage situation"
DLTR,Dollar Tree,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vbmV4dHN0bC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS9ib3VsZXZhcmQtaGVpZ2h0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Groth Guide to Boulevard Heights,"Boulevard Heights is located in south St. Louis roughly bound by Gravois on the west the city limits to the south and Holly Hills/Loughborough on the north and I-55 and Grand to the east. In full disclosure I’ve lived in this neighborhood for nearly 5 years.

It’s an oddly shaped neighborhood that does not include Carondelet Park nor the Loughborough Commons shopping center. I always thought the River Des Peres was the dividing line between the city and the county but the map above from the city website shows the city limits extending south of River Des Peres to Weber road. The neighborhood has some areas that are typical of south city a la Holly Hills Princeton Heights Southampton etc. Other parts of the neighborhood are more suburban with cul de sacs and no sidewalks etc.

The BH website claims to be the safest residential neighborhood in the entire city. I think this is generally true. We’ve had no problems living here and people look out for each other. There is somewhat of an identity crisis in BH not unlike the Patch:Carondelet situation many in BH think they live in Holly Hills. In fact the Holly Hills Improvement Association represents part of Boulevard Heights. Notice in the photos how many Holly Hills signs and flags are present in BH.

BH lost 5% of its population from 1990 to 2000. Census data counted 8503 residents in 2000 95% of which were white 2% Hispanic/Latino 2% Asian and 1% black. There were 3939 total households 57% of which are “family households”-78% are married. That’s a very high marriage rate. Of the 4093 total housing units 96% were occupied. 85% by owner 15% rental.

This neighborhood is home to much greenspace several large cemeteries mixed architecture quality necessary services some cool independent businesses. This is also a very socially conservative part of town. Not that that’s a bad thing I’m just sayin’. Many cops and firemen and city employees live here. I think it’s one of the neighborhoods that people that HAVE to live in the city due to residency requirements choose because it’s the most reminiscent of the county or a mid-century suburb and again it’s a very safe and quiet neighborhood. Don’t just take my word for it read the “NO LOUD MUSIC” sign!

For what ever reason this sign cracks me up. What is this sign attempting to accomplish? Beware all you drivers with the booming systems…all you air horn holders keep em securely tucked away in the glove box when you pass through BH….they’ll track your honkin’ ass down. Makes me want to lay on the horn as I drive by. I mean what is loud what is too loud what’s up with the range in the monetary fine? What constitutes a $500 fine? Is someone supposed to see this sign and turn down their radio? Why did we spend tax dollars on this?

Wow I’ve digressed enough on the sign already. Anyhow if you are a walker runner or bicyclist you’d love it here due to the fantastic Great Rivers Greenway trail that goes right through BH as well as the marked bike lanes along Christy and Holly Hills heading toward Carondelet Park. Carondelet Park recently installed a jogging path that is extremely popular and adds a lot of activity and vibrance to the park.

I can’t tell you how much the pedestrian/bike trail has improved BH. Before it existed Christy Park/Frank Leisure Park/St. Marcus Park between Holly Hills and the River Des Peres was just a swath of unused ground that the city mowed (infrequently). Nobody I mean nobody was seen in the park. There were homeless people living in several areas of St. Marcus Park complete with mattresses and cardboard walls. The new path changed everything it’s made the neighborhood safer in that I trust my kids to run around by themselves more now that there are extra eyes on the street so to speak. Here’s a before picture:

Since the GRG project was completed there are now hundreds of trees tons of bikers dog walkers joggers etc enjoying the paths and adding vibrancy and life to a once boring stretch of unused land. Bravo to Great Rivers Greenway and the city of St. Louis park’s dept. for kicking it up a notch and really staying on top of park maintenance now that the parks are actually used.

I’d like to see St. Marcus Park a former cemetery rededicated as a park in honor of veterans of all wars see some improvement as many of the monuments that were left have been vandalized or simply knocked over. Here’s a couple of the sights at St. Marcus Park:

Some of the gravestones were constructed into a series of walls:

Most of the veterans are from World War I but some date back to the nineteenth century.

I have nothing to note that has gotten particularly worse in my neighborhood in the last 5 years. The main improvements have been the shuttered 7-11 at Gravois and Loughborough was renovated and now has a Papa John’s in it. This was a net gain over the shuttered convenience store but it resulted in the closing of the Papa John’s just up the street in Princeton Heights.

The old Aamco Transmission property is now a QT the shuttered BP/Amoco station at Germania/Gravois is now a CVS pharmacy; the first CVS to enter the St. Louis market (Olivette and SoCo are not St. Louis). The former Goodwill (which I miss) on Morganford was handsomly renovated into a Plumbers Supply and Dollar Tree. Yes I understand these are auto-centric developments but they are upgrades over what was there before. In some cases incremental change is better than nothing at all. The site of the former city greenhouses was converted to a new housing area called Boulevard Heights.

Here are some more unique businesses bars restaurants worth trying if you are in Boulevard Heights:

Gyro Company on Gravois and Allemania:

Apollonia at Gravois and Loughborough; home of great hamburgers mousaka chicken gyro salad lamb slouvlaki pasticco dalmades and spanakopita.

The Haven at 6625 Morganford recently re-opened. I haven’t been there yet but the sign is undeniably cool:

Garavaglia’s Hilltop Inn is one of my favorite beer guzzling joints and their burgers are pretty good. This place in many ways epitomized the southside bar. I like the Bud signs too:

The Sno-Cone stand at Morgan Ford and Loughborough is a popular gathering place for summer refreshment (home of extremely nice owners homemade syrup flavors and best sno-cone in town):

A violin maker and hair salon occupy some handsome retail spaces on Loughborough at Morganford:

There are also some notably attractive building along Gravois between Kingshighway and Loughborough:

I’ll also try to give you a feel of some of the varied housing styles available in Boulevard Heights. Some homes on the north and north western side of BH are more like typical south side neighborhood like Holly Hills Princeton Heights Southampton and North Hampton. Check out these timeless beauties:

I love the corner windows on this next home:

Here are some more sights along Morganford. This firehouse is home to some of the nicest firemen around. They have let my sons gawk at the trucks and are great with the kids:

The south side of Boulevard Heights near the county border is a little more reminiscent of Affton Lemay Mehlville and other South St. Louis County suburban municipalities. There are post war frame houses typically wood sided and some ranch homes:

The closer you get to the city limits the more suburban the neighborhood settings become:

Here’s an all metal (roof walls etc.) Lustron home along Germania:

If you are looking for a safe and quiet neighborhood with many convenient services near by and are a lover of pedestrian paths check out Boulevard Heights! It’s also a couple miles from the Shrewsbury Metrolink stop!

***In February 2020 I revisited the neighborhood and the following includes updated commentary and photos.***

Misses On Original Tour

I’ll admit a few of the homes I had in the original post are not within the current city-defined neighborhood boundaries. I will keep them here as they are a reminder of my continuous learning. Further I was reluctant to oversell this neighborhood in the original post because I lived there for ~five years and I didn’t want that to influence my post. Now that I’ve been in Fox Park for nearly ten years I’m okay with acknowledging the fact that I have great memories here and it’s a wonderful neighborhood.

How did I not mention Concordia Turners? That place had not hit our radar yet when our kids were just babies. Now I know that place and will speak to it proper.

This place is insanely dense. Home after home so tight and cozy so well-cared for.

I didn’t speak to the benefit of smaller ranch homes. As my folks get older and as I think of the familiarity for suburban-upbringings ranches have a distinct appeal. They are prevalent here and that’s a rarity for the older parts of St. Louis almost all of St. Louis with few exceptions. In fact if you want a ranch and like the privacy of cul-de-sacs this is a neighborhood for you.

Noticeable Changes

People are investing in their homes here. New roofs sustainable/no-mow landscaping new siding tuck pointing the little things. This is what it takes to maintain the neighborhoods built insanely dense with 2 bedroom homes sided and brick. This is a post-war neighborhood. Many GI bill homes. Dignity and home care continues in these parts. That is comforting to me.

There are now much less Bosnian-Americans in the last ten years. They continue to move to the south county burbs. It’s palpable. I used to walk these streets nightly for >1 hour walks. I knew it so well. It’s changed. The Eastern European vibe is largely gone. It’s trending younger couples now. I see lots of M/F white couples walking dogs and strollers. That wasn’t as noticeable ten years ago. I talked to some of them who said they’d lived there less than 5 years. They like it.

I’m hopeful this part of town will remain stable and real for another generation.

What Are The Future Needs?

I’m surprised to say this as I remember speaking up at several neighborhood association meetings when I lived here. I was spieling about the need to slow traffic on Holly Hills and people looked at me like I was speaking Latin. I remember thinking about the need for crosswalks and more street trees to help pedestrians feel safe. You gotta understand I grew up in the burbs walking in the streets. When I moved here and could walk miles on sidewalks walking became part of my routine. I knew where I was safe and not (from cars/drivers). I KNEW where you had to remove the headphones and look around in certain spots or you will get hit by a car.

Two of these dangerous pedestrian areas have been rectified with crosswalks and traffic calming. New plantings of street trees are prevalent even on Gravois.

The large cemetery along Gravois recently built a new fence showing investment and dignity.

There are signs of home investment and care new no-mow landscaping popping up.

It would be good to see the “Boulevard Heights” new home development on the former city greenhouse property be filled in. Vatterott homes continues to fill in but at a very slow pace. There are a few signs of infill in other spots but it is rare. There just aren’t a lot of empty lots.

Just like most neighborhoods BH could use some more intra-neighborhood businesses and establishments.

Boulevard Heights looks great and has improved in the last ten years.

Rows and rows of houses densely built:

Many homes have stained glass and those pastel mosaic tiles on front porches that can be found all over the city:

Ranch homes exist all over the neighborhood.

The fantastic Great Rivers Greenway pedestrian/bike trails have matured in the last ten years and you can now ride from Carondelet Park to River City Casino in South County. Soon you’ll be able to connect to Grant’s Trail. This is a major selling point for Boulevard Heights. Many homes and streets abut the greenspace and trails.

A couple personal favorites:

The homes on Loughborough that overlook Carondelet Park are beautiful:

There are opportunities for planting street trees to shade and provide additional safety and overall curb appeal.

There is some infill and opportunity for new builds in the “Boulevard Heights” development from Vatterott.

Opportunities for intra-neighborhood business exists check out this one at French and Eugene:

The post-WWII smaller frame homes are in good shape.

Along Gravois you have the Concordia Turners Hall a great family place for gymnastics summer camps swimming pool and gathering space. This place is a South City gem.

The St. Peter and Paul Cemetery built by German Catholics has been around since 1865 and looks well cared for with a new fence and street trees recently planted. There are some great metal and neon and other signs that will catch your eye. The St. Louis southern border with the South County suburban area (Affton MO) is along Hamburg Ave. The signs are easy to spot the asphalt is different the sidewalks from the suburbs end in St. Louis and the trash cans are different in the city vs. the suburbs.

They set it on fire.

""It was a total loss"" said building owner Paul Gonyea founder of Gonyea Commercial Properties. ""The roof collapsed. The inside walls collapsed. What remained had to be turned down.""

The four men were caught by authorities. After delays hiccups with hazardous debris removal and $800000 in costs (some not covered by insurance) the building at 1161 University Av. is 85% rebuilt and due to open in March with Enterprise back in as the tenant.

""It's been more difficult than I would like"" said Gonyea. ""I'm in a hurry to finish this. My tenant wants to be there and they want to open as soon as they can. It's on the Green Line. It's a good spot.""

The restored building one of an estimated 280 buildings damaged during last spring's riots in St. Paul is a welcome sign of progress for the hard-hit Midway area a busy 4-mile commercial corridor that scoots along University Avenue — roughly from the State Capitol to Hwy. 280.

""The area took the brunt of the damage from the riots in St. Paul"" Midway Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Chad Kulas told St. Paul Building Owners and Managers Association members during a recent Zoom call to update neighbors about recent improvements. ""Piece by piece we are collecting ourselves and opening up more and more of the Midway. It's hard to say things will be back to normal in two years"" but there is progress.

Local developers such as Reuter Walton Suntide Commercial Realty Kraus-Anderson Cornerstone Construction Wellington Management Inc. and Gonyea among others have recently worked ""the avenue"" bulldozing or repairing damaged buildings replacing broken windows and doors and snatching vacant lots for future development as offices or apartments.

About 12 projects are in the works equaling hundreds of million of dollars in development. The recovery ""is like after a wildfire when you start to see vegetation arise from the damage. That's what is happening in Midway"" Kulas said.

This week Kraus-Anderson is demolishing the vacant U.S. Bank branch near Keys Cafe at University and Raymond avenues. The graffiti-covered building KA bought in December will make way for a $50 million apartment building with 220 units. Blocks east a former boarded-up auto garage at 1835 University Av. was knocked down to prepare for affordable rental units.

Across from the Ax-Man Surplus store near University and Snelling avenues a soon-to-open Bank of America bank branch has replaced the shuttered Pawn America. A little over a mile east an office complex will replace the soon-to-be-razed Johnny Baby's bar at 981 University Av.

""For the neighborhood we are well aware with daily reminders of what transpired [in May]. But I think there is overall a sense of hope"" said Kate Mudge director of the Hamline Midway Coalition. ""We celebrate every time we see a really damaged building come down and get cleaned up or we hear about somebody managing to reopen.""

Two new apartment buildings are being built a soccer ball kick away from Allianz Field soccer stadium on land that used to house a Bremer Bank and Furniture Barn. One mile east Minneapolis-based Alatus LLC plans this summer to begin constructing a six-story $60 million apartment and retail complex near the White Castle at N. Lexington Parkway and University Avenue.

Last year's riots caused Alatus' ""builders risk insurance"" premium to triple for the 288-unit project to nearly $550000 said Development Director Chris Osmundson. Insurers re-evaluated their risks for all Minneapolis and St. Paul construction in the wake of the riots.

Not all area projects are on track. The 34-acre Midway Shopping Center and Big Top Liquors near Allianz Field burned and damaged by water in the riots remain shut awaiting demolition. But there's no word from the city or the shopping center's owners — Rick Birdoff and Minnesota United FC owner Bill McGuire — about when the site will be razed.

In 2016 the city approved a master plan for the site to eventually become an ""urban village"" of offices apartments a hotel and parking surrounding Allianz Field home to Minnesota United. But the master plan lacks a timeline and hasn't been updated since May's fires city officials said.

Through a spokesman Birdoff and McGuire declined to comment for this article. Kulas said McGuire told his chamber in July the strip mall would be knocked down but didn't say when.

Nicolle Goodman director at St. Paul Planning and Economic Development said the city doesn't know when work will begin. The city's biggest concern she said is that any redevelopment meet the community's needs and not price neighbors out of the area. ""Redevelopment is great"" she said. ""But we need to do everything we can to ensure that the character and the identity of the area don't disappear.""

Days after George Floyd's May 25 death Suntide Principal Jeff Hart watched on TV as protesters gathered by the 1000 University Av. office his team bought and rehabbed 10 years ago. Some rioters spray-painted graffiti and then moved up the block.

Suntide scrubbed off the paint and looked for ways to uplift the neighborhood. They had already bought the building across the street — Johnny Baby's — a problematic bar at 981 University Av. Now was the time to knock it down to build nice offices. Demolition starts this spring. ""We are trying to do our part and clean up the neighborhood"" Hart said.

For University Avenue businesses the 2020 riots were perhaps the most dramatic of a string of disruptions. They have endured years of light-rail construction that finally ended in 2014. Then Sears Walmart and Herberger's stores shut. The global pandemic and recession followed.

Then in May rioters torched the street's Enterprise car rental shop the Sports Dome Napa Auto Parts Bole Ethiopian Cuisine's two restaurants and the Midway Shopping Center's Foot Locker Game Stop and Big Top Liquors. Smoke and water damage wrecked the rest of the strip mall.

""What a whammy! If you survived University Avenue and all of that [2010-2014] light-rail construction just to live for today? God help you!"" said Twin Cities commercial real estate veteran Jim Durda who now manages the City Center for Ryan Cos.

Setbacks aside neighbors are encouraged by ripples of progress. Recently dozens of boards came off store windows. Last month a shuttered auto-repair shop near University and Fairview avenues came tumbling down to be replaced by two affordable apartment buildings projects worth $64 million. ""That's fantastic"" said Mudge.

The property held past lives as an Andy's Garage Andy's Eat Now Diner and a secondhand store. Nothing stuck.

Developer Reuter Walton (RW) bought the site in November and bulldozed it. The St. Paul Housing and Redevelopment Authority approved $30 million in bonds while Bridgewater Bank AFLCIO-HIT and Fannie Mae made loans. The state spent $330000 to decontaminate the land.

This week contractors plan to pour concrete footings for the apartment's coffee shop and underground parking. The project is RW's first on University Avenue.

""The Reuter Walton team is proud that we are able to bring these 243 much-needed affordable homes to the Hamline Midway neighborhood"" said CEO Nick Walton.

More housing is coming. Friday a wrecking ball readied to topple the vandalized former U.S. Bank branch that Kraus-Anderson bought at University and Raymond.

The $64 million effort is KA's latest on University. In March 2019 it paid $31 million for the Midway Marketplace by Hamline Avenue that includes the riot-damaged but restored Cub Foods TJ Max Dollar Tree plus the nearby LA Fitness and shuttered Walmart.

KA has been mum about the future of the former Walmart store that shut in 2019.

""We don't have any redevelopment plans for the site at this time"" said KA Senior Vice President Matt Alexander.

Aldi customers and pizza lovers are drooling over a 49p dip which they claim tastes just like a Domino's alternative.

The budget food retailer is upping its pizza game and shoppers love the sauce which they say is just like the garlic and herb version from the take away giants reports Lancashire Live.

For many a dip to dunk pizza crusts in is essential whether that be chilli garlic and herb barbecue or sour cream.

And The Carlos Takeaway Garlic and Herb Dip is available in store now for just 49p - a fraction of how much Domino’s sell them for.

Aldi shoppers have taken to social media to share their love of the sauce.

One post on Facebook’s Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK received more 1000 comments.

The author of the post said ""I personally thought it tasted exactly the same as Domino's"" while another Facebooker commented: ""Best dip I've had in ages!! I need to get more.""

It is the perfect accompaniment to Aldi’s Carlos Stuffed Crust Pizza (£1.59 500g/493g) or the XXL Garlic Pizza Bread (£2.49 500g) shoppers can create a mouth-watering fakeaway for a night in this winter."

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 largest industrial companies in the US. Before we get started let's first try to understand what an industrial company is. After all all companies operate in either individual or multiple industries right so isn't this just a list of the biggest public companies in the world filtered for the US? Well not really. An industrial company is a company which is engaged in the production of capital goods which in turn are generally used in either manufacturing or construction. Among the businesses that these companies engage in are the production and selling of machinery supplies and equipment which are basically used for the production of other goods and aren't products geared towards the end consumer.

The biggest industrial companies in the US are involved in various sectors which include aerospace lumber production tools defense construction waste management cement and metal fabrication among many others. In the United States the sector has become smaller than what is used to be as the manufacturing sector decreased comparatively in scope while the services sector has increased by leaps and bounds. However the sector is characterized by many small dynamic firms even though we also have some major companies which we will take a look at later. Further wages paid in the sector are quite high compared to other sectors and there is a lot of potential for the growth of the sector too. 8.5% of the total number of employed Americans belong to the manufacturing sector and even though employment in the sector has reduce by a third since the 1980s it has also increased production by at least 2.5 times through automation technology and greater efficiencies. The industry is also responsible for providing employment indirectly to many other people as well. In fact in 2013 17.1 million jobs were directly linked to manufacturing.

15 biggest industrial companies in the US

Also there is little doubt that the industrial sector has a lot of growth in store with at least 1.1 million jobs already being added since 2008. And while there may be some stagnation in the biggest cities such as Houston Chicago or Los Angeles there is significant growth being observed in smaller cities which are witnessing more and more manufacturers being established. By 2025 there are estimates that more than 2 million more jobs may be established in the industrial sector as well as adding $530 billion with electronics automation and aerospace driving this growth.

Story continues

Of course in 2020 there has been little to cheer about in most sectors and industries and the industrial sector did not escape the wrath of the Covid-19 pandemic which has seen nearly 95 million cases and over 2 million deaths and the worst part is both figures are expected to be severely understated. Since the industrial sector is dependent on many different industries which have all been affected by the lockdowns and the recessions and depressions that followed the lockdowns not just in the US but across the globe. And as cases and deaths continue to soar in the US so does the uncertainty and the exact impact of the pandemic on the industry will only be ascertained later on.

However if anyone can survive the effects of the pandemic it will be the biggest industrial companies in the US which are absolute giants in their industry. The combined revenues of these companies exceed $380 billion while their profits are a massive $26 billion despite just one company making a loss of nearly $5 billion. They also have assets worth more than $676 billion and provide direct employment to close to a million people. The market cap of these companies at March 2020 was more than $480 billion. To rank these companies we have used their assets revenues profits market cap and employees with all the information being taken from the Fortune 500 list for industrial companies in the US. So without further ado let's take a look at some of the giants in this industry starting with number 15:

JPMorgan Chase on Friday beat analysts’ estimates for fourth-quarter profit on record trading results and a boost from releasing money previously set aside for loan losses. The sell-off was part of a price slide in the banking sector led by weakness in Wells Fargo and Citigroup.

Shares of Exxon slipped more than 5% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation into the oil giant over how it valued a key asset in the oil-rich Permian Basin. The bad news quickly spread to other stocks in the energy sector including Chevron. Lower oil prices also weighed on the stock.

Daily March E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average

Daily Swing Chart Technical Analysis

The main trend turned down on the daily swing chart on Friday when buyers took out 30638 breaking a higher-top higher-bottom chart pattern that had been intact since January 4. The main trend will change to up on a move through 31116. Taking out 31148 will reaffirm the uptrend. The downtrend will be reaffirmed on a trade through 29318.

The first minor range is 31148 to 30506. Its 50% level at 30827 is potential resistance.

The second minor range is 29760 to 31148. Its 50% level at 30454 is the first potential support level.

The short-term range is 29318 to 31148. Its 50% level at 30233 is the most important support level. It’s the last potential support level before the 23918 main bottom.

The main range is 25872 to 31148. Its retracement zone at 28510 to 27887 is controlling the near-term direction of the Dow.

Short-Term Outlook

Given the close at 30720 we’re looking for an upside bias to develop on a trade over 30827 and for the downside bias to resume on a trade through 30454.

Bullish Scenario

A sustained move over 30827 will indicate the presence of buyers. This could lead to a test of the pair of tops at 31116 and 31148. Taking out these levels will signal a resumption of the uptrend.

Bearish Scenario

A sustained move under 30454 will signal the presence of sellers. This could trigger a break into 30233. Buyers could come in on the first test of this zone but if it fails be prepared for an acceleration into a minor bottom at 29760.

The main bottom at 29318 is the last potential support before the 28510 – 27887 retracement zone. This area is controlling the near-term direction of the Dow.

Q4 US corporate earnings may surprise markets to the upside with more upward EPS revisions

Financials materials and communication services sectors saw largest jump in earnings forecasts

The S&P 500 index price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is now above 30.0 well over its 5-year average

Recommended by Margaret Yang CFA Get Your Free Equities Forecast Get My Guide

The Q4 earnings season is around the corner with about 9% of the S&P 500 companies reporting their results in the week of 18-22 January. Peak earnings season arrives in the last two weeks of January 2021 with 25% and 22% of the S&P 500 components releasing results respectively (table below). By then major American banks and the five FAANG stocks (Facebook Apple Amazon Netflix and Google) would have delivered their scores which are critical to the performance of the S&P 500 Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 indices. Investors will focus on fundamental metrics and assess how Corporate America fared in the winter when another severe viral wave hit the economy.

Analysts and companies were increasingly optimistic about Q4 earnings with the estimated EPS decline for the quarter revised up to -8.8% from -12.7% seen in the end of September according to data compiled by FactSet. Only 29 S&P 500 companies have issued negative EPS guidance compared to 56 that gave a positive assessment. Among companies with negative Q4 EPS estimations the majority are in the aviation entertainment tourism hospitality and energy sectors that were hit the hardest by Covid-related restrictions.

Sector-wise the largest upward earnings revisions were observed in the financials sector (from -24.1% to -7.5%) led by big banks such as JP Morgan Bank of America Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. The outlook for the materials (from -2.0% to 7.1%) and communication services (from -18.2% to -12.9%) sectors have also improved significantly led by Mosaic Nucor Alphabet Facebook and Netflix. The energy sector is likely to remain weak with the expected earnings decline widening from -83.0% to -98.4%. Exxon Mobil Phillips 66 and Chevron are the key companies to focus on in this sector.

Recentlyinvestors became increasingly wary about stock markets’ rich valuation against the backdrop of a worsening pandemic. The S&P 500 index is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio above 30.0 at the highest level in two decades and nearly 50% above the five-year average of 20.5. Such valuation may render the index vulnerable to profit-taking should earnings unexpectedly disappoint.

Despite near-term headwinds a fresh US$ 1.9 trillion Covid-relief plan proposed by President-elect Joe Biden appeared to have revitalized hopes for reflation thanks to a bolder stimulus offset to the virus crisis. The gradual rollout of Covid-19 vaccines around the world may foster a faster pace of recovery and normalization in business activity in the medium term. In the meanwhile base metal and crude oil prices have surged to multi-month highs reflecting an improving demand outlook as a recovery appears to get underway.

The cycle-linked energy materials financials and industrials sectors have been outperforming since the end of last year extending a rotation into value from big tech names. The reflation trade may encourage a catch-up rally in the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices both of which have largely underperformed relative to the Nasdaq 100 during 2020 as the pandemic hit traditional industries harder.

Frankly this could very well be someone’s dream job.

Kraft Heinz is looking to hire a new team of Hotdoggers (yes that’s what the job posting says) to drive its famous hot dog-shaped Wienermobile across the country for a year.

An ideal Hotdogger is an “outgoing creative friendly exuberant college graduate who has an appetite for adventure and is willing to see the country through the windshield of the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile for one year” the job description reads.

Hotdoggers will hit the open road in the 27-foot orange and yellow vehicle stopping at more than 200 events according to the job posting.

They’ll also appear on local television and radio and do newspaper interviews and they will create content for social media.

They will sleep in hotels or short-term corporate housing across the country.

In March 2020 all Wienermobile events were canceled because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Despite the hiatus the Wienermobile garnered attention in September when a Hotdogger who goes by the name “Zach n’ Cheese” proposed to his girlfriend at Yellowstone National Park next to the famous hot dog bus.

In October the Wienermobile set out again.

CNN has reached out to Kraft Heinz to ask about Covid-19 safety protocols for Hotdoggers.

The Wienermobile has evolved since the first one was created in 1936 by Carl Mayer according to the company.

The 1969 model featured Ford Thunderbird taillights and a Chevy motor home frame and averaged 187 “smiles” per gallon according to Oscar Mayer.

In 2017 the company unveiled an entire Wienerfleet including a hot dog-shaped drone.

Nowadays six Wienermobiles are driving across the United States at any given time according to Oscar Mayer.

Dr Phil Stone worked at Sheppey Community Hospital until he retired in January 2014 and gave talks about one of England's most controversial monarchs.

Former hospital colleague Michael Dillon said: ""Dr Stone gave sterling service to Sheppey Sittingbourne and Medway hospitals as a radiologist for 25 years. As chairman of The Richard lll Society he was intimately involved in the project to find the king's remains and to give them the regal burial they were previously denied.""

Dr Stone gave talks on Richard lll at many venues including the Sheppey Little Theatre. He had been determined to try to change the public's perception of the king whose reputation took a pounding at the hands of playwright William Shakespeare and a particularly villainous film portrayal by Sir Laurence Olivier.

Dr Stone was shown the film at school when a games lesson was rained off more than 50 years ago.

He recalled: “I enjoyed it this dreadful depiction but I thought nobody could be quite so bad. Time passed and I read a little about him.”

Then he came across a newspaper article about obscure groups. The Richard III Society which has members dotted all over the world was featured. He joined it in 1976.

In 2014 two years after the king's remains were discovered beneath a car park in Leicester he said: ""I would never suggest Richard was a saint but I still don’t think he was the black-hearted villain of Shakespeare’s play.”

For years he shared his home in Gillingham with a £9000 clay reconstruction of the king's head which he kept in a box under his dining room table. It had been based on the monarch's 500-year-old skull.

Richard fell during the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 and was the last English king to die in a fight.

Dr Stone said: “The society just wants to encourage people to start looking again about him instead of blindly following what we call the Shakespearean myth. It is a wonderful play but unfortunately a lot of it just doesn’t add up.”

His stepson Jeremy Horton said: ""Phil was also passionate about Ancient Egypt. He loved spending time in Egypt examining the ruins and studying artefacts in museums. His house was full of both Egyptiana and Ricardiana including a much-prized 3000-year-old shabti (an ancient death figurine of a servant Egyptian aristocrats were buried with to serve them in the afterlife).

""He also gave very interesting talks on medieval medicine including that given on the battlefield thus combining both his vocational and leisure interests.""

Dr Stone was born in Walthamstow east London in November 1946 the only son of Thomas and Doris Stone. His father was a certified accountant who died while Dr Stone was quite young.

Mr Horton said: ""He did not have the happiest of childhoods. His relationship with his mother was always quite difficult. He always felt he was never quite good enough for her.""

He was academically quite successful studying medicine in London and becoming a qualified doctor. His ambition was to be an orthopaedic surgeon and being an accomplished embroiderer his hands may have had the dexterity needed. But he never got through the extra exams required and so he became a consultant radiologist.

He was married three times. First and least successfully to Jill in 1974. The marriage ended after four years and without any children.

'They had quite a whirlwind romance'

In 1987 he met Mr Horton's mother a radiographer work colleague at Greenwich District Hospital.

Mr Horton said: ""My mum had been divorced from my dad four years earlier and had three teenage children: myself who was a 19-year-old law student; my younger brother who had just left home and our sister who was 15.

""They had quite a whirlwind romance. My mum was very much swept up by this charming intelligent doctor.""

The pair married after a six-month courtship but separated after 13 years. Mr Horton said: ""Despite the divorce I remained on friendly terms with Phil and always found him to be a very honourable reliable and thoughtful friend. We always exchanged Christmas and birthday cards and presents and he continued to take an active interest in my twins who always continued to call him 'Grandpa'.

In 2004 Dr Stone married Beth a friend from America. His stepdaughter was bridesmaid at their wedding in Chicago.

Mr Horton said: ""They always seemed very well suited and happy together. It was a case of third time lucky.""

But in June last year Dr Stone was widowed when his wife died with pneumonia.

Mr Horton said: ""Phil seemed to take it much harder than he expected. He was still very much grieving for her when he died. I suppose ultimately he died of a broken heart in both senses.""

Dr Stone was found dead at his home on December 17. The cause was degenerative heart disease.

Mr Horton said: ""Apparently his heart just gradually wore out until it stopped. He was found slumped in his chair. They reckoned he may have nodded off in front of the TV which was still on and died in his sleep.""

In December both companies filed applications requesting the Michigan Public Service Commission to authorize 12-month gas cost recovery plans the cost incurred by natural gas companies to purchase gas customers use. The filings also requested approval of the companies’ five-year forecasts which are determined through a process that factors weather how much gas is stored and partnerships.

“Is there any way to predict that a ‘stable’ market will occur in the future? No” said Eric Schiffer a DTE Gas Company senior gas supply and planning analyst according to public documents. “One cannot know with any certainty how much the price of natural gas will change or fluctuate from month to month.”

The MPSC will consider the applications at remote pre-hearings SEMCO’s at 9:30 a.m. on Feb. 10 and DTE’s at 9 a.m. Feb. 11. People can refer to the MPSC website for more information on documents access and how to participate.

Tim Lubbers SEMCO spokesperson said the pre-hearings are standard and happen every year to implement the cost plans for the upcoming April 1 through March 31 period.

It’s important to understand the cost recovery plan is determining the maximum amount to charge but customers are often charged below that and the number will very likely change after the pre-hearing during this long process he said.

There is also a gas cost recovery reconciliation at the end of the year where the company goes to the commission and says it either paid too much or collected too much for gas and then collects or gives that amount as the company cannot mark up that part of the gas bill.

“It is a very complex process” Lubbers said.

Natural gas is a commodity and the current price is considered “very low” compared to 10 years ago he said.

Lubbers said there is a high natural gas supply in the country it’s been a warm winter and there isn’t a strong pressure on prices.

For the foreseeable future Lubbers expects gas cost recovery rates to remain fairly low unless there is a significant policy change or similar factor.

According to public documents the company’s five-year plan also expects to grow its customer base gradually over the years from an average around 314500 in 2021 to an average of over 327000 in 2026.

DTE Gas also expects to grow customers in the upcoming years but expects a decrease in sales.

George Chapel market forecasting manager for DTE Gas said though the company expects customer count to grow he expects the ongoing efforts of the company’s energy waste reduction program to more than offset the higher volume usually associated with growth according to documents.

In the past the company saw relatively steep declines in normalized sales through 2009 and 2010 normalized consumption rebounded slightly from 2012 to 2014 and demand increased steadily for the next several years beginning in 2017.

“The advent of the present CoVid-19 situation however has seen a marked dip in normalized customer demand …” Chapel said and he expects adverse economic conditions due to COVID-19 to depress customer consumption over the next two years.

In March both SEMCO and DTE temporarily suspended disconnections and shutoffs during the pandemic to try and help customers and people can still seek help.

SEMCO customers concerned about gas service or struggling to pay their bill can call 1-800-624-2019 to speak with a customer service representative.

DTE customers behind on energy bills can call 1-800-477-4747 before service is subject to shutoff and the company can work with them to set up a payment plan or advise of assistance agencies in the area.

Lubbers said if someone is struggling with payments the company would rather they call sooner rather than later to figure something out.

“We understand these are tough times” he said.

Technical issues made sure it was a bit of that but for the most part the 75-minute “Hang!” celebrating the Romeo Mich. native’s 50th birthday was the kind of down-home good time Rock fans have become used to over the course of his 30-plus years of recording and performing.

Sunday’s bash was certainly a far cry from Detroit’s Ford Field which was packed for Rock’s guest-filled 40th birthday celebration. Unable to stage such an event during a pandemic even in Tennessee Rock held the party in the saloon on his property near Nashville with a small gathering of friends and family generally maskless (though Rock has promoted mask-wearing as well as the Michigan Mask Challenge) in the room. Rock meanwhile held court at a table in front of a laptop and a couple cans of Coors Light speaking to online attendees — some 70000 had registered he said though peak attendance appeared to be around 13000.

Many in the chat accompanying the video complained about interrupted service frozen screens or being booted off entirely. Rock (nee Bob Ritchie) and company soldiered on however offering a variety of “presents” for those tuning in.

His fiance Audrey Berry and son Bob Ritchie Jr. made appearances as did Rock’s granddaughter Skye and country star Jake Owen — whose latest album features Rock on “Grass is Always Greener.” Rock alluded to other famous friends on the guest list while he also showed off 19-year old Dalton Little an aspiring country artist who’s currently working as a farmhand for Rock.

There was a smattering of political talk and lamenting about the pandemic and Rock sang along to recordings of songs slated for his next album — including “Monster Truck” and “My Kind of Country.” But his chief concern was raising money for Barstool Sports’ Barstool Fund for small business owners; Rock who recently contributed $100000 to the fund held a virtual chat with founder David Portnoy and promised that if viewers contributed $2000 he would perform live.

He wound up kicking in another $4000 when those donations reached $196000 singing a par of songs accompanied by friend and neighbor Tim Watson on fiddle and his son TJ Watson on guitar. The trio started with Webb Pierce’s “I Ain’t Never” then played a new version of Rock’s “F***in’ 40” recast of course as “F***in’ 50” instructing granddaughter Skye to “plug your ears” singing that “I don’t hang much more with outlaws…I hang out at toys are us…I still rock like a champ middle finger in the air with my granddaughter on my knee.”

He also promised in the song that there will be “no more talking s*** about Oprah or fighting at the Waffle House” referencing a couple of notorious misadventures from his past.

The Watsons led the live crowd in singing “Happy Birthday” and Rock promised there will be more virtual programming and performances to come from the saloon. “We’ve got all sorts of things in the work” he said telling the virtual fans “I love each and every one of y’all like cornflakes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoZXJuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWF0dXJlL2FyZS1jby1vcC1jdXN0b21lcnMtc3Vic2lkaXppbmctZGlydHktZW5lcmd5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Co-Op Customers Subsidizing Dirty Energy? | Features | Northern Express,"Are Co-Op Customers Subsidizing Dirty Energy?

Some say Wolverine Power's decade-old contract for coal-fired energy costs ratepayers far too much.

By Patrick Sullivan | Jan. 16 2021

Michigan environmental groups and clean energy advocates say a deal that Wolverine Power Cooperative entered into a decade ago forces today's Michigan residents to unknowingly pay millions more in electricity bills to subsidize two inefficient 1950s-era coal power plants in Ohio and Indiana.

They’d like Wolverine and its members — including Great Lakes Energy Cherryland Power Cooperative in northwest Lower Michigan and three other Michigan-based co-ops — to find a way to break the contract or to work together to force the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC) to operate more efficiently.

“The costs of OVEC are very high and there’s really no way to justify paying those high costs in the market that exists today” said Chris Bzdok a Traverse City environmental attorney who has represented the Sierra Club in legal battles with OVEC. “They are two of the oldest least efficient generating plants in the Upper Midwest region. … Many customers would rather that their power not come from these relics.”

MONEY FROM RATEPAYERS POCKETS

The power plants in question were constructed in 1953 during the Cold War to help enrich uranium for the Atomic Energy Commission. After the Cold War the plants needed new customers.

In 2004 Wolverine and OVEC entered into a power-sharing agreement that was to run through 2020; in 2011 the contract was revised to extend through 2040 said Jeremy Fisher senior advisor for strategic research and development for the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program.

Wolverine has only a 6.65 percent ownership stake in OVEC for energy and capacity.

That energy doesn’t flow directly into Wolverine power lines; rather Wolverine essentially buys power credits and OVEC sells the power it generates into a larger market. The problem Fisher said is that Wolverine pays more for the power than it can be sold for in the marketplace so Wolverine has to eat the loss.

For example in 2019 Wolverine paid OVEC $55.28 per megawatt per hour and sold the energy at market price for $35.33 per megawatt hour netting a loss of $15.7 million Fisher said.

What drives this Fisher said is that the OVEC plants even operate at times when they can’t produce power anywhere near the market rate.

That would make sense in some circumstances. Utilities like Wolverine enter into contracts like this to buy “capacity” or the ability to offer power when demand exceeds their ability to produce it with their own generating power.

While Wolverine apparently entered into the OVEC contract as a backup so that the utility would have enough power during periods of peak demands Fisher said the OVEC plants routinely produce power in periods of low demand that last for weeks or months much longer than would be necessary to offer stopgap power on extremely hot days or frigid cold snaps when power demand surges.

“Basically what this boils down to is that Wolverine and its co-owners are overpaying for both the capacity and energy of the OVEC power plants” Fisher wrote in an email to a group of northern Michigan observers who are worried about the contract. “Some of this should be relatively straightforward to deal with from OVEC’s standpoint: the plants shouldn’t be committing to operate out of merit and shouldn’t be sustaining energy-system losses. That’s just uncompetitive behavior that pulls money from ratepayers' pockets. … [The] conversation about not sustaining these losses through 2040 has to start somewhere and start soon.”

HOW IT ALL STARTED MAYBE

How did Wolverine get tangled up in such a seemingly bad deal? Steve Smiley a clean energy advocate from Leelanau County believes it was fallout from the proposed coal-fired power plant in Rogers City that was blocked in 2011 after opponents objected on environmental grounds.

“This is my opinion — it was a dirty deal and [Wolverine] did it because they were pissed that the Roger City coal plant which they spent tens of millions of dollars trying to build got shut down by the environmental community. And they were just pissed and said ‘Well you know screw you. We’re going to go buy some dirty coal’” Smiley said. “It was a stupid idea from the beginning.”

Smiley said he doesn’t actually know the motivation behind Wolverine getting into the contract with OVEC in 2011 but that’s his guess. And now he said ratepayers have to live with a contract that subsidizes dirty energy meaning that people pay more for electricity that is worse for the environment.

All of the critics of the OVEC contract agree that there is no easy way for Wolverine were it so inclined to get out of the contract today. But they argue that since it is locked in for almost two more decades they should do something about it now.

“I think they can get out of it but they've got to do something dramatic” Smiley said. “First of all I think they need to shut [the OVEC plants] down as soon as possible. And how do you do that? I think that if our community put enough pressure on Great Lakes Energy to pass a resolution to make a plan to buy out sell out cancel or walk away from the contract with OVEC if they said we want to get out of this deal we’re going sell out or walk away they could put pressure on the whole thing.”

A request for comment to a spokesperson for Great Lakes Energy from Northern Express was not returned.

“The biggest problem is knowledge and the members not knowing about this dirty deal” Smiley said. “You know our co-ops do a lot of good things. They bought some wind power and all that and it keeps the lights on and the service and maintenance is great but the boards and management really have screwed this up.”

Smiley who is a partner at Leelanau Solar a business that sells solar panels to homeowners believes Wolverine’s subsidization of coal is the reason why some co-ops have policies that disincentivize consumer-level renewable energy like rooftop solar panels through policies like minimum fix-rate energy charges that appear on each customer’s monthly bill no matter how much — or little — energy they use.

“That’s one of my main irritations that they’re punishing solar” Smiley said.

WOLVERINE’S RESPONSE

A Wolverine Power spokeswoman would not answer questions or arrange an interview when contacted by Northern Express but she offered to pass along emailed questions to an attorney who works for the power company.

Northern Express sent nine questions that delved into the details of the OVEC contract requested responses to criticisms of the contract’s terms and asked whether Wolverine leadership has considered challenging or somehow breaking the contract.

One of the questions was: “Does the contract as it stands today make sense for Wolverine’s customers? Is it in the best interest of ratepayers?”

The emailed response from Wolverine did not address the questions directly except one that asked how much OVEC represented in Wolverine’s power portfolio. The following is a response from Joseph Baumann Wolverine vice president:

“Wolverine Power Cooperative aims to balance its members’ objectives of price competitiveness price stability and environmental stewardship. Wolverine is proud that through the relentless pursuit of this balance it has achieved: (1) the highest carbon-free power portfolio in Michigan (2) standing as the state’s leader in modern renewable energy and (3) competitive prices compared to all other utilities in Michigan.

""Wolverine already exceeds all State mandates for renewable energy with nearly 20% renewable supply. In addition Wolverine owns a fleet of flexible efficient and competitively priced Michigan-based natural gas peaking assets. Wolverine’s fractional ownership in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC) with its two coal-fired power plants supplements Wolverine’s broad power portfolio. OVEC will provide approximately 10% of Wolverine’s power supply obligations in 2021.”

OPERATING OUT OF SIGHT

Electric cooperatives exist in a kind of netherworld. They are not municipal utilities they are not nonprofits and yet they are not exactly for-profit businesses either. They are owned by their users but what that means is unclear.

One result is that they do not operate with a high level of transparency.

Smiley has recently been at odds with Wolverine in his attempt to get a copy of the co-op’s 2019 annual report: As a customer of Cherryland he reasons that he should be entitled to the document. (Annual reports for DTE Energy Co. a public corporation for example are available online.)

The director of business origination for Wolverine refused and responded to Smiley’s request in an email: “Our annual report is for our owners’ (Cherryland etc.) and lenders’ consumption. What they pass through in their report to their owners (you) is their discretion but I’m happy to answer any questions you might have about Cherryland’s generation.”

Transparency is a problem for electrical cooperatives Fisher said.

“It’s a pretty opaque book. It’s really hard to look into Wolverine’s record what they knew and how it affects the ratepayers” he said.

Bzdok who was one of the attorneys who fought against the Reed City coal plant agrees. Cherryland Electric Cooperative Great Lakes Energy and the other member cooperatives are not very transparent and Wolverine exists one level beyond that. When the OVEC contract was signed in 2011 Bzdok said it happened with almost no oversight.

“It’s like a double layer of non-responsiveness and non-transparency” Bzdok said.

Should the executives and the board of Wolverine have known in 2011 that renewable energy would become so competitive so fast? Perhaps.



Or perhaps not.

Back when the deal was first inked some thought coal was the best option said Douglas Jester a partner at 5 Lakes Energy a Lansing-based clean energy consultant.

“Since then the comparative costs of coal and other forms of generations have shifted and for the most part coal plants are not economically viable in the long run” Jester said. “It has been quite a transition in the last decade. Some people including me thought the writing was on the wall in 2010.”

However now that wind and solar have gotten so comparatively cheap coal-fired energy is only likely to get more expensive.

“In order to keep running plants will only get more expensive as costs keep up with regulations; those costs will be passed on to consumers” Bzdok said. “The only thing honestly that’s keeping them remotely in the game is that coal costs have been softening.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbm4tYXJib3IvMjAyMS8wMS9xYS1taXNzeS1zdHVsdHMtZGlzY3Vzc2VzLW5leHQtc3RlcHMtaW4tYW5uLWFyYm9ycy1wbGFuLXRvLWFjaGlldmUtY2FyYm9uLW5ldXRyYWxpdHkuaHRtbNIBlQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbm4tYXJib3IvMjAyMS8wMS9xYS1taXNzeS1zdHVsdHMtZGlzY3Vzc2VzLW5leHQtc3RlcHMtaW4tYW5uLWFyYm9ycy1wbGFuLXRvLWFjaGlldmUtY2FyYm9uLW5ldXRyYWxpdHkuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Q&A: Missy Stults discusses next steps in Ann Arbor’s plan to achieve carbon-neutrality,"Editor’s note: This is Part 1 of a two-part Q&A with Missy Stults Ann Arbor’s sustainability manager and leader of the city’s A2Zero carbon-neutrality initiative.

DUK,Duke Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd1c2Yub3JnL2Vjb25vbXktYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS0wMS0xNi9zZXR0bGVtZW50LWNvdWxkLWluY3JlYXNlLWR1a2UtcmF0ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Settlement Could Increase Duke Rates,"Duke Energy Florida is asking state regulators to approve a proposed settlement that would lead to about $195 million in rate increases over three years and avoid a potentially lengthy and expensive battle over base rates.

Duke which has more than 1.8 million customers in Florida filed a proposal Thursday at the Florida Public Service Commission after reaching agreement with representatives of consumers and large commercial electricity users.

If approved by the commission the settlement would set base rates from 2022 through 2024 and resolve a series of other issues.

“Ultimately this 2021 settlement agreement between DEF (Duke Energy Florida) and the parties who represent customers’ interests before the commission is a fair reasonable and comprehensive resolution of matters that is in the best interests of DEF and its customers and that is therefore in the public interest” the company said in a petition accompanying the proposed settlement.

The proposal in part includes base-rate increases of $67.246 million in 2022 $48.933 million in 2023 and $79.199 million in 2024 for a total of $195.378 million. The settlement however includes caveats that could change the increases if for example federal income-tax rates are revamped.

Duke said in a news release that average residential customers would see bill increases of 3 percent to 4 percent in 2022 while non-residential customers would see increases of 1 percent to 6.5 percent. All customers would see annual increases of 1 percent to 2 percent in 2023 and 2024.

Base rates which pay for many of the day-to-day expenses of utilities are one of the most closely watched issues in utility regulation. Florida Power & Light this week made a filing at the commission that was an initial step in seeking nearly $2 billion in base-rate increases over a four-year period.

Duke’s current base rates expire at the end of 2021 and the company said the proposed settlement comes after lengthy negotiations with representatives of consumers and businesses. The settlement was reached with the state Office of Public Counsel which represents consumers; the Florida Industrial Power Users Group which represents some major electricity users; PCS Phosphate and Nucor Steel Florida Inc.

The petition described the multifaceted settlement as an “interdependent package” and requested that regulators approve it without changes.

“The parties engaged in negotiation before DEF filed its general base rate case for administrative efficiency and to avoid expensive litigation” the petition said. “The 2021 settlement agreement is the result of more than five months of intensive and thorough informal discovery and negotiation and determines all issues that would have been raised in a general rate case.”

The settlement would allow Duke to earn a return on equity --- a key measurement of profitability --- of 8.85 percent to 10.85 percent. If the return would fall below 8.85 percent Duke could ask the commission to change base rates. Conversely the other parties could seek a review of base rates if the return would exceed 10.85 percent.

Also the proposed settlement includes a caveat that could allow a return on equity of as much as 11.1 percent based on a formula involving potential increases in yield rates of 30-year Treasury bonds. If such an increase was triggered the amount of money collected in base rates could go up.

Similarly rates could be adjusted if President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration and Congress change federal income-tax rates. Utilities and other companies benefited from a 2017 tax overhaul that lowered corporate income-tax rates from 35 percent to 21 percent.

The proposed settlement also deals with a series of other issues including allowing Duke to offer a new electric-vehicle charging station program that would build on a pilot program. Also a summary of the settlement filed at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it includes speeding up from 2042 to 2035 the retirement of two coal-fired power plants at the utility’s Crystal River North site.

There was no possible upside only risk. But the apolitical CEO is one of the many norms shattered by Donald Trump. In many respects the 45th President has made it easy for corporate leaders to be more outspoken. It’s sort of a no-brainer to speak out as National Association of Manufacturers president and CEO Jay Timmons put it on Jan. 6 against “armed violent protesters who support the baseless claim by outgoing President Trump that he somehow won an election that he overwhelmingly lost.”

There are a number of factors driving CEOs’ new embrace of the bully pulpit. For one insurrection sedition and violence in the streets is bad for business. Big organizations require stability. Tear gas and bear spray make it hard to achieve the “visibility” into future earnings much prized by Wall Street. “With our country in the midst of a pandemic business leaders recognize that ongoing division and distrust in our political system threatens the economic recovery and job creation our country desperately needs” says the Business Roundtable an organization made up of the CEOs of the nation’s biggest corporations including Apple JPMorgan Chase GM and Walmart.

On its most basic level Trump’s persistent assault on the rule of law and the degradation of a federal election risked undermining the foundations of the system that made the American economy the most dynamic and successful on earth. The primacy of U.S. capital markets and the nation’s standing as a safe haven for global investors were at risk with Trump’s attacks on the norms of good governance. An authoritarian government and a free market can’t co-exist. At its heart the capitalist system requires honoring contracts which made Trump’s flouting of rules a profound threat to financial institutions capital markets and corporate governance. “We believe in investment in the rule of law not the law of rulers” says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld senior associate dean of leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. “CEOs say that about investing abroad—now that has to apply that at home too.”

Defending that system helps explain in the week after the Capitol attack a who’s who of the nation’s most prominent blue-chip companies including Marriott AT&T American Express and Amazon said they would halt campaign donations to members of Congress who voted to challenge the presidential-election results. Unsentimentally Hallmark Cards which is based in Kansas City Mo. took the additional step of asking Republican Senators who objected to certifying the results to refund the company’s previous donations. Other companies including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup called a temporary halt to donations to both Republican and Democrats.

“We are taking a pause on federal contributions and using this as an opportunity to really evaluate the candidates that we have supported and do their actions and values align with ours” Lynn Good CEO of Duke Energy said in an interview with TIME. “We felt like this was an important one for us to weigh in on as a company.” Good said the decision came after careful deliberation and was informed by the strong reaction of many of the company’s employees and customers. “Everyone was watching with some degree of dismay and shock” says Good. “We are not a supporter of violence being used as a way to voice an opinion on an important topic.” (One could ask whether corporations should play such an outsize role in funding candidates but that’s a separate topic for another day.)

Additional moves may be forthcoming. Sonnenfeld who has convened three emergency summits with CEOs since the election said the majority of CEOs at a recent meeting said they would “reconsider their investments in states of seditious Congressmen.”

Business leaders are stepping in to fill a void left by the erosion of trust in government and other institutions. Communications firm Edelman which annually measures trust in institutions including government NGOs business and media found in its new study that business is the “only trusted institution … and the only institution seen as both ethical and competent.” The report concluded “The heightened expectations of business bring CEOs new demands to focus on societal engagement with the same rigor thoughtfulness and energy used to deliver on profits.”

One marker of a sea change is the emergence of a new vocabulary. Deplatforming—kicking bad actors off the tech infrastructure—has become a mark of corporate activism. Twitter Facebook and most recently YouTube have deplatformed President Trump. On Jan. 12 YouTube said in a statement “After careful review and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence we removed new content uploaded to the Donald J. Trump channel … We are also indefinitely disabling comments under videos on the channel.”

Other tech giants up and down the digital food chain took similar steps in the wake of the Capitol attack. Amazon’s immense cloud-services businesses (in the most recent quarter they generated nearly $10 billion in revenue) kicked right-wing social network Parler off its web-hosting servers earlier this month. (Parler has sued for breach of contract.) Apple and Google which removed Parler’s app from its app stores have moved to dismantle the infrastructure of hate. And Stripe a high-flying fin-tech startup said it would no longer process payments for Trump’s campaign website in the wake of the Capitol riots for violating its policies against encouraging violence.

Whether this was a bold act of corporate leadership—or the equivalent of closing the digital barn door after the rabid horse had already kicked the stable manager in the head and flung its rider to the ground—is a complex question. The deplatforming largely resulted in a collective short-term sigh of relief but was a stark demonstration of the inordinate and lightly regulated power of a handful of tech giants based in Silicon Valley. Global leaders including the heads of state of Germany and Mexico expressed concern over private companies’ ability to censor speech. Forging a new paradigm around the complicated questions of free speech market concentration and tech regulation will be one of the most consequential global policy debates of our time.

A final driver forcing CEOs to come off the sideline is the expectation of today’s more politically engaged younger workers. The Edelman survey found that 86% of respondents expected CEOs to speak out on societal issues. “We govern with the consent of the governed and the governed are restless” one CEO of a small firm told TIME voicing concern over the expectation that a CEO statement was now considered de rigueur after any development of note. Speaking out is fine on big issues like climate change or illegally closing the borders to people of one religion according to the CEO. But there is a growing unease about where it will lead particularly with issues that hit closer to home like executive compensation and the wealth gap. In a post-Trump Joe Biden world “no comment” is no longer an option.

Well she likely is a little bit — if a big wave surfer ever tells you they’re not scared they’re lying — but she deals with that fear in a way that enables her to focus on the task at hand. It’s a key mindset that most if not all big wave surfers have to try and master and Justine Dupont is about as close to mastering something un-masterable as one can get. But as far as relativity goes it could be said that Justine Dupont is relatively unafraid of giant waves. Case in point: the absolutely ridiculous bomb at Jaws on January 16.

Things got huge at Maui’s most frightening wave and as you’re reading this (unless you’re reading it a few weeks after we wrote it of course) things are still getting huger. More huge? Whatever. It’s very big right now.

The U.S. government further tightened sanctions on Chinese businesses by issuing new sanctions against several companies during President Donald Trump’s final week in office.

The U.S. Department of Defense Thursday blacklisted nine companies with alleged links to the China military. They include three of China’s state-owned aviation majors — Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (Comac) China National Aviation Holding (CNAH) and Grand China Air (GCAC) Co. Ltd. — along with private smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp.

The blacklist mainly restricts securities transactions of affected companies. The list was created in June 2020 under the annual National Defense Authorization Act which defines “Communist Chinese military companies” as being owned or controlled by the People’s Liberation Army or “engaged in providing (it) commercial services manufacturing producing or exporting.”

The move threatens to cripple China’s long-sought ambition to build its own aircraft to compete with Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. Chinese commercial airline manufacturers have relied heavily on U.S. imports for key aircraft components such as engines and airborne equipment.

The Pentagon listed the first tranche of 31 companies in August — including telecom giant Huawei surveillance-gear maker Hikvision Digital Technology Co. Ltd. and a litany of aerospace and telecom firms. It has added more since including top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and oil giant CNOOC Ltd. in December.

A Nov. 12 Trump executive order banned Americans from trading shares in companies starting 60 days after they are placed on the list. The order also bars such companies’ securities from being traded on U.S. bourses after 365 days.

Following the news Air China CNAH’s main business unit tumbled 3.7% in Hong Kong. The flag carrier’s Shanghai-listed shares also dropped 0.7%.

Grand China Air-controlled Hainan Airlines Co. dropped 0.71% in Shanghai. Comac the state-owned aerospace manufacturer is not listed.

The three companies didn’t comment in response to Caixin inquiries.

Separately the U.S. Department of Commerce Thursday also imposed additional license requirements on companies on its “Military End-User” (MEU) list. The list mainly restricts the export re-export and transfer of products and technologies by enterprises. A total of 59 Chinese entities are on the MEU including the latest addition Beijing Skyrizon Aviation Industry Investment Co. Ltd.

Changes on the MEU list will affect two subsidiaries of Comac —Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co. (SAMC) and Shanghai Aircraft Design and Research Institute (SADRI) subjecting them to stricter restrictions on purchasing American products and technologies. Both companies were added to the list in December.

Comac’s C919 a narrow-body alternative to Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 is in testing. About 60% of the main suppliers to the C919 are American companies such as General Electric Honeywell and Eaton Corp. according to a report by the Center for Strategic & International Studies a Washington-based think tank.

Comac has so far produced six C919 prototype airplanes for testing across China. The plane is still in the process of obtaining airworthiness certification and has not yet gone into mass production.

The perfect symmetrical relationship between two proportions the ‘golden ratio’ has been the core theory behind all of One Point Six’s projects. This combined with the duo’s exemplary attention to detail has empowered the team with the vision to create design and deliver meticulously considered design-led homes for a number of private clients and investors.

We sat down with Yadav and Bhavnish and discussed everything from the firm’s unique design philosophy to 45 Eaton Square described as the company’s most ambitious project to date.

So Yadav and Bhavnish please tell us a little about yourselves.

Yadav Jani: I’m a director at One Point Six a property development business started alongside my business partner Bhavnish. While growing up I lived between London and Nairobi as my family alternated between the UK and Kenya for business building one of East Africa’s largest financial advisory firms. I was always fascinated by the unique architecture of both cities with their eclectic styles which is where my interest in property first began.

Before starting One Point Six I received a masters in finance and marketing from the University of Birmingham. I then took on a role as a financial consultant working within my family’s business to provide investment advice for our clients across a broad range of industries such as banking farming mortgage services and of course property.

Bhavnish Chandaria: I also have a background in finance graduating from the University of Manchester. I began working in real estate in 2005 for my family’s Kenya based company DMC Group where I now head up the group’s real estate ventures. We cater to the growing needs of the residential and commercial markets in Kenya helping investors to secure strong returns.

What was the inspiration behind starting One Point Six and can you tell us about your offering?

Bhavnish: One Point Six is a progressive property development partnership started by Yadav and myself in 2017. We have known each other since childhood and always got on fantastically well. After working together on a project we decided to combine our joint expertise and experiences together as property entrepreneurs to create spectacular residences driven by our belief in the ‘golden ratio’. We develop our own properties as well as providing a turnkey service to individuals and businesses whether it involves meticulous restorations of their own homes through to a detailed ground-up development to sell.

Yadav: We both have significant experience investing in the prime central London market covering thousands of the capital’s finest properties. Our expertise lies in identifying outstanding opportunities sourced through our extensive networks. We create thoughtfully planned spaces as functionally efficient as they are effortlessly glamorous sensitively tailored to their location.

Can you tell us more about ‘golden ratio’ and how it is incorporated into your design philosophy?

Yadav: Absolutely the ‘golden ratio’ is the divine proportion creating perfect harmony in nature art and architecture. Ancient Greek mathematicians discovered how to express it mathematically using the principle to construct the Parthenon. We chose to name ourselves after it to symbolise our commitment to deliver meticulously considered design-led developments and a reminder that inspiration can come from anywhere.

Bhavnish: Our acute understanding of the importance of precise proportions sets our homes apart. We commission many pieces of furniture to bespoke specifications. Inspired design is as evident in functionality as it is in glamorous finishes. Careful consideration of layout and the practicalities of everyday living is a hallmark of a One Point Six home.

You have impressively achieved record deals at a number of landmark London addresses. What has been the secret to the success of these projects?

Bhavnish: We only choose very specific addresses – this is paramount to our success in achieving three record-breaking sales on Pont Street Cadogan Gardens and Observatory Gardens.

We are also selective about who we work with to bring each project to life. Take our success at 49-51 Pont Street. When we originally purchased it in 2014 the layout was not compatible for today’s living standards. We worked in collaboration with Vastu Shastra a 5000-year-old interior and architectural design practice to create an elegant turnkey home. The property exchanged for £3345 per square foot a record price achieved for an apartment on Pont Street.

Yadav: By taking the time and investing on the design side more than other developers we have been able to quickly achieve a number of record sales. Earlier this year we launched an exceptionally remodelled 1840 square foot apartment at Cadogan Gardens. Within three days we agreed a record sale for £6750000 an equivalent of 3668 per square foot making it the highest price paid for a property per square foot ever at the prestigious garden square address.

What projects are you currently working on at the moment?

Bhavnish: We have just finished our most ambitious project to date 45 Eaton Square located at London’s premier garden square address.

Originally an unmodernised apartment we transformed the layout to create a three-bedroom turnkey home. Our team introduced a one-to-one ratio of bedroom to bathroom which is incredibly popular with overseas buyers all while maintaining the original interior architectural features and character. The period elements are balanced by the intricate contemporary finish emanating luxurious warmth.

Since the Covid-19 pandemic what changes are you seeing in what discerning buyers are looking to add to their homes?

Yadav: Our relationships with our homes have certainly shifted over the past year. A house is not just a place to live anymore it is the office school gym and cinema so flexibility within the layout is key.

Materials used will change too. Those which have antibacterial properties such as copper will be in high demand. It provides a luxurious natural finish whilst removing germs from the surface. Self-cleaning smart sanitary ware and air filtration systems are also rising in popularity.

Looking ahead to a fresh start in 2021 what do you see happening in the prime London market over the next twelve months?

Bhavnish: The prime residential property market in London is unlike any other. Areas of Mayfair and Belgravia have a historical appeal and classical characteristics which just cannot be matched Eaton Square for example is known across the globe. Factor in the English language legal system time zone and world-class education system and London is still an attractive destination for buyers.

And what we should we be looking out for from One Point Six in the future?

Bhavnish: In addition to our flagship launch of 45 Eaton Square there are a number of interesting projects in the works in London. Excitingly we are also expanding into new areas of the UK with our first large development set to launch in Shenley Hertfordshire in Easter 2021.

Yadav: We are also overseeing the development of a fantastic site for a client in Leeds’s city centre 2 Headrow. It is a Grade II Listed 17000 square foot former Lloyds TSB building and will be transformed into a multi-use residential scheme. It features wonderful ornate detailing on the exterior and was designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield one of the architects behind the development of London’s Regent Street.

Rating: About this rating Mostly False What's True Dozens of eBay bidders placed bids of over $1000 on at least four listings for empty PS5 boxes. What's False We confirmed with eBay that transactions were never completed for the four listings.

New PlayStation Xbox and Nintendo gaming systems have traditionally been hard to find on launch days. High demand and low inventory has meant that the value of the video game consoles skyrocket. When PlayStation 5 (PS5) released in November 2020 it may not have been a shock to learn of bidding wars on eBay as gamers desperately tried to get their hands on the new technology. However some people might be surprised to learn that eBay sellers were also listing empty PS5 boxes that were receiving bids for hundreds and even thousands of dollars.

Empty boxes for brand new video game consoles have a long history of being sold on eBay for various reasons such as for a joke. The eBay listings often explicitly state ""box only"" or ""empty box"" in the item name. However some bidders miss this important text. For example Kotaku reported that in 2013 eBay buyers bid thousands of dollars for an empty PlayStation 4 box despite the fact that the item name read: ""Empty Sony PlayStation 4 PS4 Aus Pal Packaging/Box."" The listing was eventually removed before the auction ended.

Fast forward to November 2020. TikTok user @wowitsbobby posted that a listing for an empty PlayStation 5 box was selling for $2025.

It's true that the video showed a real eBay listing for an empty PS5 box with buyers who were bidding thousands of dollars. The listing's title read: ""Sony Playstation 5 PS5 Disc Version **** BOX ONLY NO CONSOLE **** SENDING ASAP.""

The winning bidder later had regrets and posted ""SCAM!"" in a negative review for the eBay seller. The seller eBay user avraa101 responded: ""Item description clearly stated what buyer would receive. Not a scam.""

However we confirmed with eBay that the seller for this listing was never paid after the winning bidder discovered it was for an empty PS5 box.

Other empty PS5 boxes went for $1200 $1275 and $1300. Once again eBay confirmed that no payments were ever made by the winning bidders for these three listings.

The seller with the $1300 sale posted another listing that included a real PS5 and components and said the empty box listing was a joke: ""So if you seen my earlier listing it was a joke to see that people don't read! $1300 for a bunch of empty boxes. Luckily I'm not a POS and canceled the fake Listing.""

After contacting eBay about listings for empty PlayStation 5 boxes we received this statement:

We have been taking action to remove fraudulent listings from our marketplace.

A company spokesperson confirmed that making listings for photos of items and empty boxes do not comply with its No Items Listing Policy. They also told us that eBay doesn't allow sellers to misrepresent what they're listing for sale on eBay.

In the past the empty PS5 boxes on eBay became a topic of discussion on Reddit. One person said: ""Anyone know where I can actually buy the box? I'm pranking someone."" Another person mentioned that ""panicked"" parents and grandparents might be the bidders: ""Chances are some panicked parent or grandparent that's trying to get a kid what they want for Christmas is going to buy it. Probably not knowing much about computers or what they are doing just trying to make a kid happy. To me there's no excuse for this crap legal or not.""

While some eBay listings for empty PS5 boxes have received bids for hundreds or thousands of dollars we also have found quite a few listings that ended under $50. There are a number of reasons that bidders might purchase empty boxes for a lower price. It might be for a prank. Influencers might want to pretend they own a PS5 for brownie points on social media. Others might simply just want to display the box in their home until they are able to find and buy a PS5 for themselves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEvbWFnaWMtdGhlLWdhdGhlcmluZy1wc2EtMTAtYWxwaGEtYmxhY2stbG90dXMtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItcnVzaC1zaWduYXR1cmUtcHdjYy1lYmF5LXNhbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ebay PSA 10 Magic: The Gathering Alpha Black Lotus,"While the world of Pokémon TCG is still heating up especially with its upcoming 25th anniversary eBay is bringing back one of the biggest cards in TCG history as part of its Magic: The Gathering auction.

Led by PWCC the latest ultra-rare card is looking to crush the PSA 10 Alpha Set Black Lotus card that sold last year for $250000 USD. The new card in question is a Gem Mint PSA 10 MTG Alpha Black Lotus Card signed by artist Christopher Rush himself. So far eBay estimates that there is an MTG card sold every ten seconds on the marketplace. There’s no info yet on the starting bid but a page over on eBay has been created with a “Coming Soon” teaser. How much do you think this one will bring in?

In other card auction news a 1952 Mickey Mantle card has just sold for $5.2 million USD.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpcHN0ZXJzb2Z0aGVjb2FzdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS9wc2EtMTAtZ3JhZGVkLWFscGhhLWJsYWNrLWxvdHVzLXNpZ25lZC1ieS1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1ydXNoLWhpdHMtZWJheS1hdWN0aW9uLWJsb2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PSA 10 Graded Alpha Black Lotus Signed by Christopher Rush Hits eBay Auction Block,"An incredibly rare piece of Magic: the Gathering history a Gem Mint PSA 10 Alpha Black Lotus signed by artist Christopher Rush went up for auction this evening on eBay. It is only one of seven known Black Lotuses with a PSA Gem Mint 10 grade.

UPDATE: The card sold for a final price of $511100.

The card is being sold by top trading card retailer PWCC on behalf of the card’s owner David Edwards. The auction will run on eBay for 10 days from January 17 to January 27.

Mr. Edwards owns DM’s Alpha Set on the PSA Registry a complete set of graded Alpha cards where only 32 cards are not graded at Gem Mint 10 and many are the top or only graded Gem Mint 10 in existence. He has been an avid collector of PSA 10 graded Alpha magic cards for the past 13 years.

Through an eBay representative I was able to interview Mr. Edwards and ask the questions that beg answering: where did this card come from what’s its story and why is now the time to sell it?

Donny Caltrider: Tell me about how you came to this card?

David Edwards: I bought this and its brother already graded in late 2008 one from West Coast Sports and one from Daniel Chang of Vintage Magic around the same time. I’m not sure which came from which source because the e-mails I’ve retained don’t specify that. The West Coast Sports one was listed on eBay throughout the year of 2008 so if anyone can harvest old auctions they’d be able to compare the cert #’s to specify which was which. I have been the sole owner of both since then and the other Lotus can be viewed on the public PSA set registry in “DM’s Alpha Set.”

It was signed at GP Chicago in 2014 and Christopher Rush was kind enough to post about the event to his personal Tumblr.

DC: Why is now the time to let it go?

DE: I was just a kid who spent my childhood playing Magic every free moment and then spent every dollar I made in my 20s buying all of the cards I could never manage to acquire as a child. It has been a wonderful 13 years being able to cherish this card but after you have a few kids it becomes less about you and more about them. I’ve had my fun and nostalgia out of owning it. Hopefully selling it will allow me to create new memories and enjoy life a little more with my three young children and college isn’t getting any cheaper. If I’m lucky the timing is right for a new record sale. PSA Pokémon cards have been on fire and many people believe cryptocurrencies rally in 2017 fed back into Magic cards..

The current record for a Gem Mint PSA 10 Alpha Black Lotus signed by the artist is $250000 which sold on eBay in July of 2020. The owner of that Black Lotus was Daniel Chang of Vintage Magic one of the vendors where this Black Lotus was possibly acquired more than a decade ago.

Wrapping Up

Again the auction for this Gem Mint PSA 10 Alpha Black Lotus signed by Christopher Rush will run for ten days from 1/17/2021 to 1/27/2021 and can be found on eBay. There is a very good chance that we’ll see a record breaking auction—do you think this Lotus will surpass the $250000 threshold?

Since its release and the current free availability users have been urging EA for a crossplay that enables gamers from different platforms to face-off in battles.

The popular video game company and publisher Electronic Arts also known as ""EA"" is repetitively asked by players for a crossplay action that invites users from the PlayStation Xbox and PC to come together. The title in question is ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" which is the latest freebie game for the week revisiting the gameplay from the galaxy far far away.

However how wide the galaxy far far away is ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" is not and that is no thanks to EA who has not made a move regarding the availability of letting players complete despite using different platforms.

'Star Wars Battlefront 2' Crossplay: Redditors Ask for Cross-Platform Gaming

Various players throughout the years have been urging and asking for the multiplatform action with Redditors uniting in the r/StarWarsBattlefront community repeatedly asking for the 2017 video game's crossplay. This change might benefit Electronic Arts as crossplay invites more players and gamers to join essentially increasing the popularity and usage.

Some Redditors argued that crossplay should be observed only on console gaming platforms such as the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One to provide a leveled playing field once the action starts. However these Redditors came as one and agreed that online games as massive as ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" should have crossplay enabled.

'Star Wars Battlefront 2' Crossplay: What is EA's Answer?

According to an online forum on Electronic Art's website the company was asked by a user in 2019 regarding a cross-platform gameplay for the Battlefront 2. A massive number of 132 players upvoted or agreed with the question and statement that asks for a crossplay.

Unfortunately EA at the time answered the gamer saying that it does not have any plans on expanding the game for a crossplay availability.

Crossplay: Online Games Must Have

A co-free game (in the Epic Games Store) of the ""Star Wars Battlefront"" which also observers an online gaming community that has crossplay enabled is Rockstar Games ""Grand Theft Auto V's"" online. Despite being released almost eight years ago in 2013 ""GTA Online"" still sees a massive surge of gamers revenue and events in the present.

EA may not be enabling this to the ""Battlefront 2"" because it is an old game which the publisher does not want to develop or continue on its servers because of the rumored development of the ""Battlefront III."" However for the time being ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" is seeing a massive surge of returning or starting gamers thanks to Epic Games store's freebie release.

Such opportunities come thanks to “Cyberpunk 2077” a Polish video game launched before Christmas after a decade of development. It sold 13m copies at up to $60 each in its first ten days with buyers tempted by its mix of hyper-violence women wearing inexplicably few clothes and a one-armed terrorist played by Keanu Reeves. Pre-launch hype turned its Warsaw-based creator CD Projekt into the country’s most valuable listed company and a rare example of European business succeeding at the frontier of a 21st-century industry rather than coasting on a reputation built up in the century before. Even the in-game currency provides something for Europhiles to cheer: in Cyberpunk lore the main currency “eddies” is based on the euro. Society may have collapsed into a living nightmare but at least the EU ’s single currency lived on.

What should have been a rare technology victory for European business soon turned into a farce however. The game was launched while still littered with bugs much like the actual euro. Performance was so poor on older consoles that Sony the world’s biggest console manufacturer took the rare step of pulling the game from its stores. One scene gave an unfortunate reviewer an epileptic seizure. CD Projekt issued grovelling apologies. Its share price halved as complaints and refund demands poured in. The paper billionaires created among the Polish company’s management became paper millionaires once more. The peculiar cocktail of success and embarrassing failure of “Cyberpunk 2077” is an allegory for Europe’s video-game industry at large. It also says something about Europe’s economic place in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAxLzE2L2J1c2luZXNzL2N5YmVycHVuay0yMDc3LWRpc2FzdHJvdXMtcm9sbG91dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Glitches long hours and delays: Inside Cyberpunk 2077's disastrous rollout,"CD Projekt SA Chief Executive Officer Marcin Iwiński made a public mea culpa this week about the disastrous rollout of the video game Cyberpunk 2077 in December. He took personal responsibility and asked fans not to blame the team. In a somber five-minute video address and accompanying blog post Iwiński acknowledged the game ""did not meet the quality standard we wanted to meet. I and the entire leadership team are deeply sorry for this.”

Iwiński’s apology the second within a month was an attempt to restore the Polish company’s reputation with scores of fans — and investors — who had waited eight years for the game only to discover it was riddled with bugs and performance issues when it was finally released. Uproar over the botched debut caused a 30% drop in CD Projekt’s shares from Dec. 10 through mid-January.

Interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff most of whom requested anonymity so as not to risk their careers depict a development process marred by unchecked ambition poor planning and technical shortcomings. Employees discussing the game’s creation for the first time described a company that focused on marketing at the expense of development and an unrealistic timeline that pressured some into working extensive overtime long before the final push.

In order to implement these effects AD Massicuro used Pascal “Marty McFly” Gilcher’s Reshade Ray Tracing Mod and the results are pretty good.

AD Massicuro used Reshade RT Global illumination effects both on direct lights and indirect lights using dedicated personal shaders. He also added realistic lights and shadows around all objects via RTgi and Ambient Occlusion. Additionally he tried to improve the Tessellation of some grounds and rocks.

Furthermore this video showcases better and more realistic reflections. You can also find sharper textures and a better sense of depth thanks to the RT Beta Shader.

AD Massicuro also created a custom tonemap similar to the one used in the latest Unreal Engine 5 tech demo. He also used Fog Transparency in order to avoid any smoke bleeds between RT shader and the in-game effects and used Color Grading in order to give a more photorealistic look to the whole image.

In case some of you are interested you can find here other PC games with Reshade Ray Tracing effects. These past few months we’ve covered a lot of games. Some of them appear to benefit greatly from it while others do not. You can also find Reshade Ray Tracing Mod videos for Star Citizen Resident Evil 3 Remake Watch Dogs and Red Dead Redemption 2.

Dennis Royalty BS’71 is a retired reporter editor and columnist who covered the Indiana Hoosiers in the early 1970s. As a student Royalty worked for the Indiana Daily Student as a reporter and sports/news editor. Following graduation he was a sports writer for the former Courier-Tribune in Bloomington Ind. His extensive reporting and writing career included 27 years with The Indianapolis Star.

In 2015 he retired from Eli Lilly and Company where he worked in internal communications. Royalty and his wife Ginger live in Prescott Valley Ariz.

Below is an excerpt from Royalty’s unpublished memoir of his time as a reporter specifically his coverage of the Hoosiers and his relationship with former IU men’s basketball head coach Bob Knight.

I was at my desk when the phone rang. It was the early 1970s in the sports department of the Bloomington Courier-Tribune my first full-time job after college.

The caller? Bob Knight IU basketball coach.

The same Bob Knight known for humiliating or ignoring most sportswriters.

I’d become acquainted while covering the IU basketball beat but this was a surprise. Knight calling me?

The conversation began something like “Dennis I don’t know what to do about Bob Owens. What do I need to do to get on the same page with this guy?”

Owens was the Courier-Tribune’s sports editor. He’d spent many years covering the Hurryin’ Hoosiers. Knight’s contrasting style was a taste yet to be acquired by the veteran sports editor.

I remember Owens cackling when one headline blared “Hoosiers Snatch Defeat from Jaws of Victory.”

So here was Knight asking Mr. Young Pup Sportswriter how to build a better relationship. Flustered I managed “He’s sitting about 10 feet away. I’ll transfer you.”

Knight said OK so I did. Listening to Owens’ side of the conversation it became clear the ice was melting. Knight and Owens made not just a truce but over time a friendship.

If you’re among the millions who cast Knight aside years ago as a profane bully you might be surprised to read this. While he always had a handful of media favorites he earned a reputation for belittling journalists or refusing their presence altogether.

But this wasn’t the Bob Knight I knew when I covered his arrival and his first two-plus seasons with the Hoosiers. Oh he was a disciplinarian prone to bursts of temper and foul language. But was he a strident off-putting tyrant? Not then.

I introduced myself in late summer/early fall of 1971. Knight wasn’t quite 31 when he arrived in Bloomington. I wasn’t yet 22 having graduated from IU in May.

He smiled and was cordial. Knight said he’d help me however he could. Our coach/writer relationship continued until late 1973 when it came to a jarring end.

Knight kept his promise. But then in a fit of anger he fired a basketball at me.

Here’s what happened. I was given access to team practices which was a very big deal in learning how Bob Knight basketball was played.

If you’ve seen [the movie] Hoosiers you’ll remember Coach Norman Dale excluding Hickory residents from practice because he tolerated no interference. Dale was created as Knight-like in many respects.

This was one of them. Class was in session when IU practiced. Knight demanded concentration and quiet. If not for sneaker-squeaking player-panting and calling out screens you could have been sitting in a library.

Except for one thing: Knight’s teachings often followed by “Do it again until we get it right.”

Rebukes stung when he reached exasperation. There was no mistaking his standards.

It’s easiest to remember those outbursts but they seldom dominated practice. Knight mostly coached in a way reminiscent of my best teachers.

Only a privileged few were allowed to observe from the stands. I painstakingly abided by his demand for silence.

But one day as I sat 30 or so rows up I found myself greeted—out loud to my horror—by a new employee from the sports information department. He had somehow made it past “Practice is Closed” signs unaware of Knight’s rule.

Panicked I shushed. Too late. Coach glanced our way seething.

For a moment practice resumed. But more chatting by my oblivious pal led to a volcanic eruption. Roaring disapproval Knight showed off a pretty amazing arm.

His throw caromed off a seat nearly five rows away. We were then ordered out of the arena.

My friend was miffed. He couldn’t understand how a few hushed words could offend. I on the other hand was mortified. Not so much by the thrown ball which probably was more of a warning shot.

I was mortified because what would I tell Owens if it turned out I was permanently banned?

So I stuck around in a hallway. I waited until Knight emerged from the dressing room to explain what happened.

And then I accepted his apology.

Yes an apology from the same Bob Knight who phoned me at the C-T office on a peace-making mission. This was a Knight who could admit fault and realize he’d gone too far.

Dec. 1 1971 was a big day in the history of Indiana basketball. Knight’s Hoosiers won their first game in Assembly Hall over Ball State.

Dec. 3 1971 was a big day in my life. I reported to Fort Knox Ky. for basic training. I had enlisted in the Indiana Army National Guard.

Others covered for me as I missed much of Knight’s first season at Indiana.

I completed basic training and proceeded to Army clerk school. At last weekend passes were granted. So I phoned Owens to see if he’d let me cover IU’s visit to arch-rival Purdue on Saturday Feb. 26 1972.

A crowd of 14123 at Mackey Arena didn’t have a lot to cheer about much of the game. IU charged to a 10-point halftime lead and was still in front late. But the Hoosiers missed several scoring opportunities and fell 70–69. Tough tough loss.

Bob Knight nevertheless turned up for postgame remarks. Aware that I was away at military training he got a surprise—me. Here I was on weekend pass using my free time to drive 220 miles and cover IU basketball.

Knight was impressed by my reporting about the Hoosiers at Purdue but I didn’t understand how much until the fall of ’72.

That’s when the Big Ten held its seventh annual preseason press conference at Chicago. Knight represented IU. I covered for the C-T.

By today’s standards the gathering was modest. What has turned into a made-for-TV event was then held in a relatively small ballroom.

To give an idea of how informal things were I’d invited my dad. We sat at our own small table roughly 50 feet from the stage.

The Big Ten was really 10 [schools] those days (now 14 teams). But even just 10 coaches speaking for 15 minutes each meant a lot of notebook-scribbling.

I was so busy catching up after the final speaker that I didn’t even look up to see Knight standing at our table. It was his first stop before conducting additional interviews.

“Den” my dad said. I looked up surprised and rose to say hello.

But Knight hadn’t come for me. He’d figured out that this older lookalike was my father. For the next several minutes I listened awkwardly while he told dad how much he liked my reporting and how he admired the fact that I spent my weekend pass covering IU-Purdue.

The years that followed turned Knight into not just an IU legend but a college basketball coaching legend. During and after his first season he recruited players who over the next four years would anchor teams finishing 22–6 23–5 31–1 and 32–0. Twice Indiana would reach the Final Four winning it all in ’76 as an undefeated champion. There hasn’t been another undefeated NCAA champ since.

As good as those players were Knight’s role as motivator and strategist made it work.

I’m not breaking news when I say that Knight’s drive for perfection had a regrettable side. Even as the team won his language in public and bench behavior too often ranged from unfortunate to shameful depending on the beholder.

I was in position to see even worse up close. Knight’s temper erupted after a disappointing defeat at Columbia S.C. three days before Christmas in 1972.

I’ll never forget how he raged afterward a fury that continued as he loudly excoriated forward John Ritter BS’73 for much of the flight home. He expected better leadership from the senior holding him up as an example for others. Knight continued this tirade for what seemed like hours while the rest of us turned to duck and cover. No one else spoke.

Hurtful as this seemed I believed it wasn’t intended to be personal because Knight respected Ritter. The coach simply couldn’t accept how his team lost and was taking steps to ensure it wouldn’t happen that way again.

After what I saw and heard on the plane I began to question whether the coaching end justifies the means.

The 1972–73 season built to an amazing climax. The Hoosiers won the Big Ten which meant that Knight was taking them to the NCAA tournament in just his second season as Indiana coach.

Indiana defeated Marquette and rival Kentucky in the Nashville regional. So we were on to St. Louis and the Final Four.

I say “we” because Owens and I represented the C-T on press row. Indiana lost its first-round game to UCLA but only after a stirring comeback that left Coach John Wooden gripping the rolled-up program in his hands tighter and tighter.

When the next season began in December I had no idea that my full-time sports writing career wouldn’t last the month.

Two days after Christmas C-T staffers learned they had published the final issue of the newspaper. The business side wasn’t pulling in enough revenue so we were an early casualty in the demise of many newspapers.

Irony of ironies my final coverage for the Courier-Tribune came three days before Christmas at Assembly Hall when IU hosted a return match with South Carolina. Indiana won 84–71. Knight visited the losers’ dressing room after the game to wish them well. What a difference from a year earlier.

I was among the lucky ones who quickly found a new job. In the next few days I landed a reporting slot in news writing with the state’s largest newspaper The Indianapolis Star. I was hired to fill a one-person news bureau in West Lafayette Ind. of all places. (The location of Indiana’s greatest rival Purdue.)

Transitioning to a new job kept me from saying goodbye to Knight and the players. But it wasn’t my last interaction with the coach.

I followed the Hoosiers with great interest from afar. By year-end 1974 Indiana was 11–0 and had dominated all but one opponent winning by double figures except for an overtime escape at Kansas.

I wrote a letter to Knight congratulating him. He responded on Jan. 14 1975 thanking me for writing. “If you get a chance to come down don’t hesitate to give me a call” he wrote adding that he greatly appreciated hearing from me. He also said this:

“The team has been doing well in most games but there are some things we need to improve.”

That sentence pretty much sums up Bob Knight’s standard of excellence. His letter was dated the day after IU improved to 15–0 by overwhelming Minnesota 79–59.

The next season of course was when the Hoosiers celebrated a 32–0 record and their first national championship under Knight. It was fun to watch players I’d covered win it all.

Many star players graduated so the 1976–77 team understandably had a tough time. Indiana slipped from 32–0 to 16–11.

Losing was tough on fans accustomed to winning. When IU rebounded to 21–8 the next year advancing once again to the NCAA tournament things looked rosy once again.

But Bob Knight made a significant change one that I was disappointed to learn.

In late 1977 I read that Knight had decided to no longer speak to reporters in postgame news conferences. This was contrary to the Knight I knew who saw it as his obligation to meet with reporters—even in circumstances like the loss I’d covered at South Carolina.

So I wrote another letter dated Dec. 29 1977. After complimenting the team on recent play I wrote:

“This regards your policy of not speaking to reporters after games. I realize you have your own reason for this undoubtedly a good and sensible one. But it bothers me somewhat nevertheless.”

I went on to explain that with his talents at the top of the profession “only you can give the best insight as to this style of coaching….you are most qualified to comment on Indiana’s basketball successes and failures.”

I told him that he was depriving Hoosier fans of his insights. “One might argue that difficulties with reporters involving accuracy or editorial bias is sufficient reason to discontinue talking to all reporters. But I hate to see that happen. I remember being a young reporter who had some difficulty communicating at times with a young coach but neither of us let that stand in the way of getting the job done. I know I learned much from the experience and I’m just dumb enough to think there were thousands of people out there who ate up every word of every interview concerning IU basketball at the time.”

Indiana defeated Iowa on Jan. 5 1978. In a letter dated the next day Knight responded:

“Many thanks for taking the time to drop me a note. I greatly appreciate your thoughtfulness in doing so as well as your thoughts on the press. I have made some changes in a number of things relative to the use of my time with the press only being a part of the overall picture. What I have done has been a result of a lot of thought on what I think is best for our basketball program. However I do appreciate what you had to say.”

Again the response was a disappointment. It also was my last communication with the coach. My life changed dramatically over the next few years as I married Ginger and we were blessed with son Andrew and daughter Kelsey. In 1982 I was promoted to city editor at The Star responsible for a staff of about 50.

I made time to follow the Hoosiers closely celebrating national championships in 1981 and 1987 and watching as Knight coached the USA team to a gold medal in 1984. He was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 1991.

On the court he had been a big winner. But in the game of life he had become increasingly rude crude disrespectful and at times so ugly in public behaviors I was ashamed for him.

How could a man lose his temper to the point where he would throw a chair during a Purdue game or angrily lay his hands on Neil Reed ’97 at practice prompting a firestorm of controversy and outrage? Reed for heaven’s sake was a player who gave everything he had.

How do you explain the coaching excesses reported by John Feinstein author of the best-selling A Season on the Brink?

These are but a sampling of the things that stained a coaching icon and cost him his job at IU.

I tried to make sense of all this for readers on May 23 2000. I was then chief of a news bureau for The Star and wrote a weekly column.

Knight had recently been disciplined by IU President Myles Brand who warned that there was now a zero tolerance policy for poor conduct. As it turned out this was Brand’s last step before firing the coach.

In my column I mentioned the relationship of mutual respect I’d had with Knight. I then lamented what his behaviors had caused.

“I believe his only hope of surviving IU’s zero tolerance mandate is to start caring about other people again: his players his family fishing buddies and the rest of us—secretaries athletic directors even those in the media who dare to disagree with him. He should treat others as he’d like to be treated himself.”

Alas Knight didn’t or wouldn’t understand. This from a well-read man who not only changed the way the college game was played in the 1970s but was a vigorous supporter of the IU library and as I’ve said a man who could do incredibly nice things.

One of those was helping Bob Owens find work after the Courier-Tribune folded. I tried to confirm this myself unsuccessfully. But in John Laskowski’s BS’75 book Tales from the Indiana Hoosiers Locker Room he reveals that Knight first used his contacts to help Owens land a job in Lincoln Neb. And he did it again when that newspaper also went under helping Bob find work at The Columbus Dispatch in Ohio Laskowski wrote.

Many of Knight’s former players not only remain loyal to him but love him. So do thousands if not tens of thousands of fans who flocked to his speaking engagements and appreciated his final coaching years at Texas Tech.

As for the coach himself here are telling quotes from a Chicago Tribune article. Staff Writer Skip Myslenski had interviewed Knight in a story that also appeared in May of 2000.

Knight told Myslenski that people would remember two things of his time at Indiana. One was that he was honest. The second? “I can’t mold myself to what other people want me to be … There has to be in each one of us in order to be successful a willingness not just to accept those things that we feel are inadequate but to do something about them. That is often misconstrued as temperament.

“I’ve always felt that it is necessary when trying to reach a particular end to be emphatic about the means that are to be used to reach that end.”

To that point coach it’s a matter of how emphatic. Too much so is where we part ways.

What is it about exceptional people that can for some lead to erratic or surprisingly objectionable behavior? I have no answer. What I do know is I was privileged to watch up close as one of the greatest strategists in the game’s history practiced his craft.

The Bob Knight I knew did expose his temper but largely in private surroundings like practice. His coaching style was strategic I believed—designed so his charges would “play to their potential.”

The Bob Knight I knew was a man who would apologize for his excesses.

How I wish the Bob Knight I knew could have left the school I loved on good terms respected by all. It was nice to see him finally return to Assembly Hall last season. Congratulations to former players for making that happen and for their love and loyalty to him.

If only everyone could still feel that way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW9jZW50dXJ5LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzYzMzU1Mi9hcmN1cy1jZDczLWluaGliaXRvci1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLWF6LXMtb2xlY2x1bWFiLWF0LWxlYXN0LXNpeC1vdGhlcnMtZm9sbG93LWluLW9uY29sb2d5LWRhdGEtYnl0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arcus' CD73 inhibitor challenges AZ's oleclumab at least six others follow in oncology: Data Byte,"DATA GRAPHICS | Product Development

Her second album One in a Million was certified double platinum in 1997 and her final record Aaliyah sold over 2.4 million copies worldwide and scored a Grammy nomination for best R&B album in 2002.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vbWFkaXNvbjM2NS5jb20vbWlkd2VzdHBvd2VyYnJva2VyczIwMjAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Midwest Power Brokers 2020: 32 of the Region's Most Influential People of Color,"We launched just over five years ago as a nonprofit news outlet to carry the voices of and tell the stories from communities of color in Wisconsin.

We’ve published our Black Power list — highlighting the most influential Black leaders in Wisconsin — every year since our founding and it’s become the most anticipated thing we do. Since 2015 we’ve also published five lists of Wisconsin’s most powerful Latino leaders and just this year we’ve added lists of the state’s most influential and accomplished Indigenous and Asian American leaders.

And now this year more than ever it’s time to look beyond Wisconsin. To people on the coasts and even in the mainstream media even the word “Midwest” is often a substitute for “white.” But we know better and so do you — from the Twin Cities to Cincinnati from Michigan’s UP to central Iowa people of color are thriving leading and changing their communities.

We can’t pretend of course that this is just another year. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on our communities — our health and our jobs and our financial wellbeing and our education system and all of these effects are most pronounced in our Black communities. Add to that the brighter-than-ever spotlight on the injustice of systemic racism — it’s been a tough year for everybody but even more so for our communities of color.

Many have responded to this extraordinary year by expressing an authentic desire to learn more about Black communities celebrate Black excellence. This has also led to a reckoning with regard to other communities of color and a desire to learn more about and celebrate communities of color more broadly. That’s what this list is about. This list is not just a list. It is also an invitation — an invitation to engage to create to make your states and your communities wherever you are across this region a better place to attract and retain leaders of color.

We have never intended our lists to be exhaustive. It’s also not limited to people we agree with politically or otherwise. This list will however introduce you to some people you’ve never heard of who are doing great things in other parts of the region or simply working behind the scenes doing the work without the accolades.

With this list I hope you learn something you didn’t know about some of the real leaders in communities throughout the Midwest and that we might be able to make some connections and start conversations that really move communities forward.

Mukhtar Ibrahim is founder of Sahan Journal a Minneapolis-based nonprofit news outlet serving the Somali and other immigrant communities around the Twin Cities launched in 2019 in partnership with Minnesota Public Radio. Mukhtar was studying biology and premed when he read about a group of young Somali American men who left Minnesota to join the terrorist group al-Shabab in Somalia. The Somali-born Ibrahim who immigrated to the United States at age 17 was engrossed by the story but felt that the reporters were disconnected from the community they were covering. He switched his major to journalism with the goal of providing more nuanced coverage of his community. As a reporter at Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) and the Star Tribune in Minneapolis Ibrahim became one of the first Somali American journalists working for a major media outlet in the state which has the country’s largest Somali American population. He is known for his award-winning reporting on Islamic State recruitment of Somali Americans and how law enforcement’s response is affecting Minnesota’s Somali American community. Ibrahim’s reporting on the assault of a woman speaking Swahili in a restaurant helped spur a hate crime bill in the Minnesota legislature.

A Concord ""rent registry"" program for the city to collect rental housing data to help drive forming future policy was approved. (Ashley Ludwig/Patch)

CONCORD CA — A Concord ""rent registry"" program for the city to collect rental housing data to help drive forming future policy was approved this week with direction to city staff to include a public information portal as part of the program.

The unanimous decision by the council to move ahead with the registry came after more than three hours of discussion by council members staff consultants and the public. Many of them were concerned about making sure that accurate information is obtained from landlords and/or about maintaining privacy of both landlords and tenants. Councilwoman Laura Hoffmeister said she was concerned the city could be mining information from a city with many landlords when a relatively small number of them are seen as causing problems. ""I don't know if the registry program is going to get all of the bad apples out of there"" Hoffmeister said.

The rent registry program will require the owners of all multifamily complexes with four or more units to register with the city (affordable housing complexes are exempt from the rent registry). Information will include evictions units' square footages rent costs and how those costs have changed over time. Mayor Tim McGallian at one point said he was leaning toward not wanting a public portal at all. The main purpose of the registry he said was for the city to gather information to help guide policy not for outside advocacy groups to use for purposes he views as positive or not.

""For us to be dictated to that's not how it's supposed to work"" said McGallian who along with Hoffmeister feared overreach by the city in seeking data. But Vice Mayor Dominic Aliano and Councilmembers Edi Birsan and Carlyn Obringer all said there needs to be some manner of public interface. Birsan said he was uncomfortable with the idea of the city collecting data it wouldn't openly share.

""We do not make policy based on secret data"" Birsan said. However council members opted to withhold certain specific information they deemed would be privacy violations for landlords or tenants. The rent registry is being created in response to requests from local renters and their advocates for information that could help show whether landlords are carrying out evictions legally and fairly or whether rents are rising unreasonably. Some advocates of the registry have said it also will serve to show ""the real rental landscape"" in Concord.

The registry comes under the city's existing Residential Tenant Protection Program Ordinance. That ordinance is the product of several years of work by the city to respond to concerns among renters and their advocates about the city's rental housing market including affordability availability and tenant evictions. An estimated 9700 units in Concord are eligible for the registry. The plan was approved by the City Council in December and plans are for information to be submitted by July 1. It will be funded mostly by a fee that would be paid by the property owners. The total proposed cost would be $5.25 per unit per year. Community activists have asserted that the Latinx community has faced the most evictions. ""This registry ... positions the city to become a leader in creating data- and equity-driven housing policy"" said Alex Werth of the group East Bay Housing Organizations. Several landlords and property owners told the council they have concerns about how the information available on the registry and how it might be ""weaponized"" against landlords. Much of it they said is already available on documents including loan applications. Others said availability of some of the property information could be used to commit fraud. One called it an ""outright attack on the housing business in Concord.""

""It makes me think about whether I want to be a landlord in the City of Concord"" Blaine Carter told the council. ""I'm disgusted by the fact that you're not protecting the little guy."" But Karen Hernandez of the advocacy group Monument Impact said evictions have been on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracking them is important Hernandez said ""to hold (responsible) certain specific landlords who are taking advantage of the 'other' little guys."" Hoffmeister said it's possible that after a year of analyzing data it will be seen that Concord rents aren't rising all that much. She said if that proves to be the case she hopes the advocacy groups will accept the data. ""This has morphed into much more than I thought when we started down this path"" she said.

See below.

Vrbo the vacation rental platform run by Seattle-based Expedia Group is getting some blowback online for not following the lead of competitor Airbnb which announced this week that it was blocking and canceling reservations in the Washington D.C. area during the upcoming inauguration week.

Following the violent storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 officials in D.C. including the city’s mayor and Metro Police urged people not to travel from outside the area for the inauguration of President Elect Joe Biden.

In a blog post on Wednesday Airbnb said it was “aware of reports … regarding armed militias and known hate groups that are attempting to travel and disrupt the Inauguration.” It said guests whose reservations are canceled will be refunded in full.

Expedia and Vrbo both put out statements on Friday. Vrbo said the safety of its guests and hosts is of the utmost importance and anyone planning to travel to D.C. next week was encouraged to follow local governmental regulations and check the latest news for updates.

Hello will you please take action and refund all of the DC trips planned for the inauguration week!!! @Airbnb decided that the safety of their clients is more important that making them pay their fees. Will you please do the same? We’re begging you! — G®EM (@grem_pls) January 14 2021

“If you mistreat people there’s no space for you on Vrbo. We reserve the right to remove anyone from our marketplace who violates these principles and we are encouraging hosts to cancel bookings during this time if they believe a guest intends to violate these policies” the blog post stated.

Expedia said in a tweeted statement that it was carefully evaluating bookings activated crisis response teams and launched “extraordinary emergency procedures.”

Sarah Gavin VP of global communications for Expedia told GeekWire Saturday that Vrbo has legitimate customers booked next week and it does not want to cancel on them.

“We are working to ensure that those people who are traveling and staying at a Vrbo are in D.C. for legitimate travel reasons” Gavin said. “And we’re implementing extraordinary emergency procedures to assess all risks for existing and any new bookings in the D.C. area. And we’re working very closely with a number of different law enforcement agencies.”

With the steps Expedia has taken Gavin added “We feel like we’re doing the right thing.”

Buzzfeed News wrote about the rental saga on Friday and interviewed a man who was planning to travel from California to the nation’s capital because he wanted to see the Biden swearing in. The man booked three nights in an apartment on Vrbo for a total of $900 but when he had second thoughts and reached out to Vrbo for a refund he was reportedly denied.

@vrbo I’ve been a happy customer of yours for a while. In the wake of what just happened I’m begging you: #DontRentDC Jan 17-21 — Katy Otto (@exfkaty) January 11 2021

Steve Schmidt one of the founders of the anti-Trump group Project Lincoln was among those calling out Expedia and Vrbo on Twitter on Saturday urging the company to “be responsible” and “do good” and warning that the company’s CEO board and senior management “don’t have what it takes” for a fight with Project Lincoln.

.@Expedia @vrbo Here is the deal. @ProjectLincoln and the majority of America detests sedition and chaos. We love democracy and the rule of law. Here is some free advice. I suggest you get your shit together immediately. You will feel immense pain if we fight. Cancel — Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES) January 17 2021

Reservations and help secure DC. Do you really want to be the quartermasters and housing supply to the fascist racist violent extremist mob that has attacked America? Be responsible. Do good. @ProjectLincoln is not playing games and trust me when I say this. Your CEO Board — Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES) January 17 2021

And Senior management do not have what it takes for this fight. Take the exit. We are watching. So are your investors and shareholders. — Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES) January 17 2021

Gavin told GeekWire that she was attempting to get in touch with Schmidt and Project Lincoln to explain Expedia’s case on Saturday.

With the overall travel industry and Expedia’s business hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic for the past year rental platforms have been one of the few spots to rebound. Expedia announced in July that gross bookings on Vrbo “increased significantly” in May and June compared to last year as “drive-to destinations” were one of the first segments of travel to recover from the global health crisis.

Expedia retired the HomeAway brand and brought its entire vacation rental portfolio under the Vrbo name last summer. Expedia paid $3.9 billion in 2015 to acquire HomeAway which bought Vrbo in 2005.

Vrbo competes with Airbnb and is live in 15 countries.

Update Monday Jan. 18 9:30 a.m. PT: Expedia Group issued a new press release on Monday morning expanding on the steps it is taking to bolster security related to those who use its Vrbo rental properties in the Washington D.C. area this week.

Along with heightened screening measures for those booking rentals Expedia said it has expanded Vrbo policies for cancellations and refunds for both travelers and partners. “In the event we cancel a reservation for security concerns a host chooses to cancel a reservation or a traveler decides to cancel a reservation the guest will be refunded and the host will be paid in full. This applies to the Washington D.C. metro area and all U.S. state capitals through January 24 2021” Expedia said.

“We continue to support travel for individuals and families who are or plan to be in and around Washington D.C. and all U.S. state capitals for legitimate and critical reasons” the company added.

Update Tuesday Jan. 19 10:30 a.m. PT: Expedia Group and Vrbo tweeted on Tuesday that new bookings in and around Washington D.C. would be blocked through Friday. Expedia said it had received “updated guidance” on security threats.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS83LWEtYi10ZXN0aW5nLXF1ZXN0aW9ucy1hbmQtYW5zd2Vycy1pbi1kYXRhLXNjaWVuY2UtaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy1lZWU2NDI4YThiNjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 A/B Testing Questions and Answers in Data Science Interviews,"7 A/B Testing Questions and Answers in Data Science Interviews

Photo by Victoriano Izquierdo on Unsplash

A/B tests a.k.a controlled experiments are used widely in industry to make product launch decisions. It allows tech companies to evaluate a product/feature with a subset of users to infer how the product may be received by all users. Data scientists are at the forefront of the A/B testing process and A/B testing is considered one of a data scientist’s core competencies. Data science interviews reflect this reality. Interviewers routinely ask candidates A/B testing questions along with business case questions (a.k.a metric questions product sense questions) to evaluate a candidate’s product knowledge and ability to drive the A/B testing process.

In this article we’ll take an interview-driven approach by linking some of the most commonly asked interview questions to different components of A/B testing including selecting ideas for testing designing A/B tests evaluating test results and making ship or no ship decisions. Specifically we’ll cover 7 most commonly asked interview questions and answers.

Before a Test — Not Every Idea Is Worth Testing

An A/B test is a powerful tool but not every idea is selected by running a test. Some ideas can be expensive to test and companies in early phases may have resource constraints so it’s not practical to run a test for every single idea. Thus we want to first select which ideas are worth testing particularly when people have different opinions and ideas on improving a product and there are many ideas from which to choose. For example a UX designer may suggest changing some UI elements a product manager may propose simplifying the checkout flow an engineer may recommend optimizing a back-end algorithm etc. In times like this stakeholders rely on data scientists to drive data-informed decision making. A sample interview question is:

There are a few ideas to increase conversion on an e-commerce website such as enabling multiple-items checkout (currently users can check out one item at the time) allowing non-registered users to checkout changing the size and color of the ‘Purchase’ button etc. how do you select which idea to invest in?

One way to evaluate the value of different ideas is to conduct quantitative analysis using historical data to obtain the opportunity sizing of each idea. For example before investing in multiple items checkout for an e-commerce website obtain an upper-bound sizing of the impact by analyzing the number of multiple-items purchased per user. If only a very small percentage of users purchased more than one item it may not be worth the effort to develop this feature. It’s more important to investigate users’ purchasing behaviors to understand why users do not purchase multiple items together. Is it because the selection of items is too small? Are the items too pricey and they can only afford one? Is the checkout process too complicated and they do not want to go through it again?

This kind of analysis provides directional insights on which idea is a good candidate for A/B testing. However historical data only tells us how we’ve done in the past. It’s not able to predict the future accurately.

To get a comprehensive evaluation of each idea we could conduct qualitative analysis with focus groups and surveys. Feedback gathered from focus groups (guided discussion with users or perceptive users) or questions from surveys provide more insights into users’ pain points and preferences. A combination of qualitative and qualitative analysis can help further the idea selection process.

Designing A/B Tests

Once we select an idea to test we need to decide how long we want to run a test and how to select the randomization unit. In this section we’ll go through these questions one by one.

How long to run a test?

To decide the duration of a test we need to obtain the sample size of a test which requires three parameters. These parameters are:

Type II error rate β or Power because Power = 1 - β. You know one of them you know the other.

Significance level α

Minimum detectable effect

The rule of thumb is that sample size n approximately equals 16 (based on α = 0.05 and β = 0.8) multiplied by sample variance divided by δ square whereas δ is the difference between treatment and control:

This formula is from Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments by Ron Kohavi Diane Tang and Ya Xu

If you are interested in learning how we come up with the rule of thumb formula check out this video for a step by step walkthrough.

During the interview you are not expected to explain how you came up with the formula but you do want to explain how we obtain each parameter and how each parameter influences the sample size. For example we need more samples if the sample variance is larger and we need fewer samples if the delta is larger.

Sample variance can be obtained from the existing data but how do we estimate δ i.e the difference between treatment and control?

Actually we don’t know this before we run an experiment and this is where we use the last parameter: the minimum detectable effect. It is the smallest difference that would matter in practice. For example we may consider a 0.1% increase in revenue as the minimum detectable effect. In reality this value is discussed and decided by multiple stakeholders.

Once we know the sample size we can obtain the number of days to run the experiment by dividing the sample size by the number of users in each group. If the number is less than a week we should run the experiment for at least seven days to capture the weekly pattern. It is typically recommended to run it for two weeks. When it comes to collecting data for a test more is almost always better than not enough.

Interference between control and treatment groups

Normally we split the control and treatment groups by randomly selecting users and assigning each user to either the control or treatment group. We expect each user is independent and no interference between control and treatment groups. However sometimes this independence assumption does not hold. This may happen when testing social networks such as Facebook Linkedin and Twitter or two-sided markets such as Uber Lyft and Airbnb. A sample interview question is:

Company X has tested a new feature with the goal to increase the number of posts created per user. They assigned each user randomly to either the control or treatment group. The Test won by 1% in terms of the number of posts. What do you expect to happen after the new feature is launched to all users? Will it be the same as 1% if not would it be more or less? (assume there’s no novelty effect)

The answer is that we will see a value larger than 1%. Here’s why.

In social networks (e.g. Facebook Linkedin and Twitter) users’ behavior is likely impacted by that of people in their social circles. A user tends to use a feature or a product if people in their network such as friends and family use it. That is called a network effect. Therefore if we use “user” as the randomization unit and the treatment has an impact on users the effect may spill over to the control group meaning people’s behaviors in the control group are influenced by those in the treatment group. In that case the difference between control and treatment groups underestimates the real benefit of the treatment effect. For the interview question it will be more than 1%.

For two-sided markets (e.g. Uber Lyft ebay and Airbnb): interference between control and treatment groups can also lead to biased estimates of treatment effect. It is mainly because resources are shared among control and treatment groups meaning that control and treatment groups will compete for the same resources. For example if we have a new product that attracts more drivers in the treatment group fewer drivers will be available in the control group. Thus we’ll not be able to estimate the treatment effect accurately. Unlike social networks where the treatment effect underestimates the real benefit of a new product in two-sided markets the treatment effect overestimates the actual effect.

How to deal with interference?

Now that we know why interference between control and treatment can cause the post-launch effect to behave differently than the treatment effect it leads us to the next question: how do we design the test to prevent the spillover between control and treatment? A sample interview question is:

We are launching a new feature that provides coupons to our riders. The goal is to increase the number of rides by decreasing the price for each ride. Outline a testing strategy to evaluate the effect of the new feature.

There are many ways to tackle the spillover between groups and the main goal is to isolate users in the control and treatment groups. Below are a few commonly used solutions each applies in different scenarios and all of them have limitations. In practice we want to choose the method that works the best under certain conditions and we could also combine multiple methods to get reliable results.

Social networks:

One way to ensure isolation is to create network clusters to represent groups of users who are more likely to interact with people within the group than people outside of the group. Once we have those clusters we could split them into control and treatment groups. Check out this paper for more details on this approach.

to represent groups of users who are more likely to interact with people within the group than people outside of the group. Once we have those clusters we could split them into control and treatment groups. Check out this paper for more details on this approach. Ego-cluster randomization. The idea originated from Linkedin. A cluster is composed of an “ego” (a focal individual) and her “alters” (the individuals she is immediately connected to). It focuses on measuring the one-out network effect meaning the effect of a user’s immediate connection’s treatment on that user then each user either has the feature or does not and no complicated interactions between users are needed. This paper explains this method in detail.

Two-sided markets:

Geo-based randomization. Instead of splitting by users we could split by geo-locations. For example we could have the New York Metropolitan area in the control group and the San Francisco Bay Area in the treatment group. This will allow us to isolate users in each group but the pitfall is that there will be a larger variance because each market is unique in certain ways through things such as the customer’s behavior competitors etc.

Basically we select a random time for example a day of a week and assign all users to either the control or treatment group. It works when the treatment effect only lasts for a short amount of time such as when testing a new surge price algorithm performs better. It does not work when the treatment effect takes a long time to be effective such as a referral program. It can take some time for a user to refer to his or her friends.

Novelty and Primacy Effects

When there’s a change in the product people react to it differently. Some are used to the way a product works and are reluctant to change. This is called the primacy effect or change aversion. Others may welcome changes and a new feature attracts them to use the product more. This is called the novelty effect. However both effects will not last long as people’s behavior will stabilize after a certain amount of time. If an A/B test has a larger or smaller initial effect it’s probably due to novel or primacy effects. This is a common problem in practice and many interview questions are about this topic. A sample interview question is:

We ran an A/B test on a new feature and the test won so we launched the change to all users. However after launching the feature for a week we found that the treatment effect quickly declined. What is happening?

The answer is the novelty effect. Over time as the novelty wears off repeat usage will be decreased so we observe a declining treatment effect.

Now you understand both novelty and primacy effects how do we address the potential issues? This is a typical follow-up question during interviews.

One way to deal with such effects is to completely rule out the possibility of those effects. We could run tests only on first-time users because the novelty effect and primacy effect obviously doesn’t affect such users. If we already have a test running and we want to analyze if there’s a novelty or primacy effect we could 1) compare new users’ results in the control group to those in the treatment group to evaluate novelty effect 2) compare first-time users’ results with existing users’ results in the treatment group to get an actual estimate of the impact of the novelty or primacy effect.

Multiple testing problem

In the simplest form of an A/B test there are two variants: Control (A) and treatment (B). Sometimes we run a test with multiple variants to see which one is the best amongst all the features. It can happen when we want to test multiple colors of a button or test different home pages. Then we’ll have more than one treatment group. In this case we should not simply use the same significance level of 0.05 to decide whether the test is significant because we are dealing with more than 2 variants and the probability of false discoveries increases. For example if we have 3 treatment groups to compare with the control group what is the chance of observing at least 1 false positive (assume our significance level is 0.05)?

We could get the probability that there is no false positives (assuming the groups are independent)

Pr(FP = 0) = 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.857

then obtain the probability that there’s at least 1 false positive

Pr(FP >= 1) = 1 — Pr(FP = 0) = 0.143

With only 3 treatment groups (4 variants) the probability of a false positive (or Type I error) is over 14%. This is called the “multiple testing” problem. A sample interview question is

We are running a test with 10 variants trying different versions of our landing page. One treatment wins and the p-value is less than .05. Would you make the change?

The answer is no because of the multiple testing problem. There are several ways to approach it. One commonly used method is Bonferroni correction. It divides the significance level 0.05 by the number of tests. For the interview question since we are measuring 10 tests then the significance level for the test should be 0.05 divided by 10 which is 0.005. Basically we only claim a test if significant if it shows a p-value of less than 0.005. The drawback of Bonferroni correction is that it tends to be too conservative.

Another method is to control the false discovery rate (FDR):

FDR = E[# of false positive / # of rejections]

It measures out of all of the rejections of the null hypothesis that is all the metrics that you declare to have a statistically significant difference. How many of them had a real difference as opposed to how many were false positives. This only makes sense if you have a huge number of metrics say hundreds. Suppose we have 200 metrics and cap FDR at 0.05. This means we’re okay with seeing false positives 5 of the time. We will observe at least 10 false positive in those 200 metrics every time.

Making Decisions

Ideally we see practically significant treatment results and we could consider launching the feature to all users. But sometimes we see contradicting results such as one metric goes up while another one goes down so we need to make a win-lost tradeoff. A sample interview question is:

After running a test you see the desired metric such as the click-through rate is going up while the number of impressions is decreasing. How would you make a decision?

In reality it can be very involved to make product launch decisions because various factors are taken into consideration such as the complexity of implementation project management effort customer support cost maintenance cost opportunity cost etc.

During interviews we could provide a simplified version of the solution focusing on the current objective of the experiment. Is it to maximize engagement retention revenue or something else? Also we want to quantify the negative impact i.e. the negative shift in a non-goal metric to help us make the decision. For instance if revenue is the goal we could choose it over maximizing engagement assuming the negative impact is acceptable.

Where to put the bodies.

""Every day we’re getting ready to work and such and then we have a whole new list of people. It's increasing by the day"" said Robert Perez owner of Perez Family Funeral Home with five sites across the county. ""Where is the space? What are we going to do?""

As of Friday COVID had contributed to 412 deaths in Ventura County according to public health data.

Almost half of the deaths — 203 — came after Nov. 30. The 138 deaths in December more than tripled the previous high — 41 in August.

The death rate for people in Ventura County who tested positive for COVID has fallen from an early pandemic peak and was about 0.6% in December. But the total number of deaths has climbed in the wake of a massive rise first in COVID cases then in hospitalizations and finally patients so sick they need ICU beds.

The still rising trajectory of the surge means January with 65 COVID-involved deaths as of Friday could be even deadlier than December.

""We’re seeing even more cases in the surge now. Christmas and New Year's are going to contribute"" said Ventura County Public Health Officer Dr. Robert Levin referring to the spread of the virus through holiday gatherings. He said the rollout of COVID vaccinations should at some point slow the rise.

In Los Angeles County COVID has contributed to more than 13000 deaths with more than 300 reported in a single day. There some mortuaries are so inundated they have to turn families away.

Ventura County mortuaries have not hit that point yet said several funeral directors. But the rise in deaths has pushed funeral homes to expand embalming facilities acquire refrigerated trailers for storing bodies and carefully calculate resources.

""I think it's at a point where we hope and pray we don't get sick"" said Lorena Rey Garcia co-owner of Garcia Mortuary in Oxnard reflecting on the need for every available staff member. ""It's really a sad time.""

Funeral services delayed

The surge means everything takes longer. Overworked doctors need more time to complete death certificates. Crematoriums face delays. Funeral services may be pushed back two weeks or longer.

Travel restrictions can mean it takes a month or longer to ship a body to loved ones in Mexico or elsewhere.

""Every day you're faced with the unknown"" said Perez of working with government entities in different countries. ""Things are changing by the day — rules regulations laws.""

The biggest change is the numbers. In pre-pandemic times Garcia Mortuary in Oxnard and a sister site in Santa Paula dealt with eight to 12 grieving families a week.

""Currently we have 50 families. That is unprecedented. We are managing but it is very difficult"" said co-owner Robert Rey Garcia Jr. adding about 1 of 3 of the deaths involve COVID.

Hospitals forced to hold bodies

Some of the funeral requests inundating area mortuaries come from families who have been turned away in Los Angeles County. Many others are local.

Area hospitals with small morgues are asking mortuaries to pick up bodies almost immediately to free up space. Backed-up funeral homes can't always meet the requests.

""Our hospitals are reporting sometimes three-day delays in getting patients that have expired out of the hospital and into a mortuary"" said Ventura County Emergency Medical Services Administrator Steve Carroll in a Tuesday report to the Board of Supervisors.

Garcia plans to soon open a 10000-square-foot preparation facility in an industrial area of Oxnard. It will provide more space for bodies but even more importantly will ramp up embalming with four tables dedicated to the preservation process. There will also be a walk-in cooler and crematory equipment.

""We’re going to free up a lot of space"" said Garcia noting the mortuary is working out ways that other funeral homes could use the facility. He also suggested mortuaries ask families to consider embalming even with cremations.

""If we embalm we don't have to have refrigerated space"" he said.

Some mortuaries say they have enough room to deal with rising funeral and cremation requests.

""We have seen an increase unfortunately. We are not currently concerned about capacity"" said Jennifer Finnerty of Rose Family Funeral Home in Simi Valley noting mortuaries would never want to turn a family away. ""Thankfully we are not at that point and we hope it stays that way. But who knows what’s going to happen.""

Preparing for the worst

Hospitals are planning too. Administrators at the Ventura County Medical Center have added a refrigerated storage unit just outside its morgue.

""Today we have seven (bodies) in our morgue and one in the extra storage space"" said Dr. Todd Flosi the hospital's chief medical officer on Thursday.

More than three years ago the morgue at the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office could hold 16 bodies said Medical Examiner Dr. Christopher Young. Now it can hold more than 150.

Some expansions including a donated trailer that was modified into a storage unit reflect preparations undertaken after reports of overloaded health systems and mortuaries in New York City.

""We wanted to be ready. At this point we have this storage in place in event if funeral homes and hospitals experience a backup"" Young said. ""My hope is we would have extra storage and not have to use it. But I think we’re getting to that point.""

Bob Achermann executive director of the California Funeral Directors Association said the rise is hitting so hard in some regions of Southern California including Los Angeles County that mortuaries have to constantly reassess resources.

""They’re actually kind of triaging every day and night: 'How much capacity do we have left? Do we have to turn people down?'"" he said.

COVID's fatal numbers

In Ventura County 97% of the COVID deaths involve people with pre-existing conditions that make them more susceptible to severe illness.

The COVID death rate was highest early in the pandemic with 3.8% of the people who tested positive for the virus dying in April. That rate has improved steadily.

About 0.7% of the county's COVID cases have ended in death for the entire pandemic according to public health data provided on Wednesday.

""I think doctors are getting better at handling severe illness"" said Ventura County Health Officer Dr. Robert Levin.

While the rate is falling the rise in total COVID deaths reflects the enormity of the ongoing surge.

COVID hospitalizations more than quadrupled since Dec. 1. The number of coronavirus patients in ICU beds at one point tripled.

Levin said it's possible the rise in deaths will soon begin to flatten because of the priority given to vaccinating people in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. That aging population made up about 38% of the COVID deaths in December.

As the vaccinations take effect the COVID fatalities in nursing homes and similar sites should fall.

""The immunization is going to play a role"" said Levin. ""When it will take effect is not clear.""

Mortuary leaders said COVID protocols already mean many people have to watch loved ones die from afar not able to share the final moments.

The flooded mortuary system means more complications and delays.

Some funeral directors would speak only anonymously. Others not only offered their names but emphasized the importance of having the story told.

They said people don't understand the severity of the pandemic.

Twice Garcia has handled funeral services for a husband and wife who died after testing positive for COVID. He also helped the family of a mother and daughter who both died after acquiring the virus.

""If that's not making the point to people what can we do?"" he said. ""This has never been seen. We need to take it seriously. Everyone needs to.""

A proper dining area might seem too much of an indulgence especially if you only use it a couple of times a week for sit-down meals.

Consider going with built-in dining to minimise floor estate and maximise the area. Some of these ideas also allow you to incorporate extra storage while others turn your eating space into a more multifunctional one. The best part though? They are all supremely stylish.

1. Resort living

With the use of natural materials the beadboard details and the copious amount of cushions this beautiful built-in dining nook offers up a relaxing Mediterranean vibe to the home.

It seats up to eight thanks to the use of customised wall benches where the cushions can be lifted up for extra

2. Curvy ideals

Curves are all the rage this year so there is no reason why you shouldn’t go all out with a curved built-in dining area like in this flat.

With a curved dining bench and a complementary upholstered backing made from lush maroon velvet and featuring arches the dining area was intended to mitigate against the effects of the odd-shaped floor plan while also lending an inviting feel to the space.

3. Pop-up station

Instead of going for a regular dining setup this bachelor’s flat conceals its dining area within the raised platform in the living room. With the table raised there is ample legroom underneath to sit comfortably.

It can be pushed back into the platform after meals turning the space into a hangout spot perfect for entertaining friends.

4. Cosy corner

Part of the living room wall was set aside for this built-in dining which sees L-shaped banquette seating and plenty of storage. Instead of feeling boxed in the space feels light and airy thanks to the clear glass panel dividing the wall between the dining area and kitchen.

5. Book in

Framed by a series of bookshelves this built-in dining feels more like a library than an eating space. It’s also the perfect excuse to use books as décor (Tip: Organise your collection by colour).

The space can double up as a study offering a stylish work-from-home setup that will definitely get productivity levels up.

6. Home Sweet Home

To allow the Scandinavian style home to stand out from the sea of Nordic-inspired interiors in Singapore the designer did up an unconventional house-shaped dining nook.

The quirky detail coupled with the lush green walls presented the built-in dining area as a focal point for the home.

7. Ahead of the curve

Part of the kitchen counter was carved out to allow for a dining area. A curved one with a round dining table allowed room for more and provided a gentler integration with the kitchen counter.

Pale yellow upholstery lends a subtle visual shift while the thin lines draw length upwards.

8. Extension line

The slim dining table doesn’t take up much room but what’s really impressive is that it can be tucked away neatly back into the built-in storage once dinnertime is over.

Underneath the customised dining bench are a couple of ottomans that can be pulled out when the homeowners have guests over for meals.

9. Pantry staple

Rather than create separate entities for the dining area and the pantry in this BTO flat the designer decided to join together both areas to maximise tabletop space while allowing for nifty features like power points by the side — steamboat? No problem!

Citing a complaint it said it has seen the WSJ said that several persons involved in valuing a key asset in the Permian – the highest producing US oil field – alleged that during an internal assessment in 2019 employees were forced to use unrealistic assumptions about how quickly the company could drill oil wells there so as to arrive at a higher value.

The WSJ said that the SEC began probing the matter after receiving the complaint. An SEC spokesman declined a comment to the WSJ.

The WSJ said that at least one of the employees who complained had been fired last year.

In response Exxon-Mobil said on Friday that the claims reported by the WSJ were demonstrably false.

“Actual and provable performance exceeded drilling plans for the Permian and such performance has been accurately represented to the investment community. The Wall Street Journal has been aware of these facts since September” the company said in a statement.

“The company stands by its statements to investors and if the company were to be asked about this matter by authorities it would provide information that shows the accuracy of its valuation of the company’s Permian assets and that actual drilling performance exceeded the plans” it added.

According to the statement ExxonMobil has an extensive and rigorous planning and budgeting process that considers many sensitivities and ranges of outcomes. “It takes into account thousands of inputs including hundreds of drilling curves over a seven-month period. Learning curves were developed as a collaborative effort between the drilling team executing the work who had the most expertise with current drilling performance and the development team who leveraged data from demonstrated learning curve performance in other unconventional projects. There were multiple learning curves considered and evaluated throughout the process” it further added.

Against this background ExxonMobil said that it was obvious that the employees who are alleged to have made the claims reported by the Journal lack the breadth and depth of experience to understand how and why drilling curves are routinely revised as technologies improve and understanding of the resource base expands. “Historically the company’s unconventional drilling performance has increased in short timeframes as engineers and planners gather more data in basins across its portfolio” it further said

While the SEC probe will not impinge on Exxon’s operations here attorney Melinda Janki told Stabroek News “This investigation by the SEC into ExxonMobil’s asset values validates the warning by the global energy think tank IEEFA that Guyana’s relationship with ExxonMobil is a cause for concern. It also demonstrates the Government’s folly in trying to move ahead with such an untrustworthy partner as ExxonMobil and the increasing risk that oil will make Guyana poorer not richer”.

The WSJ noted that in November last year Exxon retreated from an ambitious plan by Chief Executive Darren Woods to pump up its overall oil and gas output by a million barrels per day by 2025. The newspaper said that Woods’ Permian growth plans dismayed some Exxon employees who saw them as unrealistic.

In March 2019 the WSJ said that Woods stated that Exxon would hike oil and gas production in the Permian to one million barrels a day as early as 2024 up from the previous estimates of 600000 by 2025. The WSJ said that the new target would amount to roughly 25% of Exxon’s overall production before the COVID-19 pandemic.

“No one I knew in the organization thought this was possible; the pressure to deliver on Woods’ promise to the market permeated the organization” the WSJ reported the whistleblower as saying. The newspaper said that key to Woods’ goal was boosting production on the Permian acreage that Exxon acquired in 2017 for US$6.6 billion in an area called the Delaware Basin.

The WSJ said that as it had previously reported some Exxon managers in 2018 had initially put the net present value (NPV) of the Delaware Basin at around US$60 billion while some employees involved in the company’s annual development planning had estimated during 2019 that the area’s NPV was closer to US$40 billion.

The newspaper said that the whistleblower complaint stated that the lower estimate reflected that it took longer than expected to drill wells in 2018. The WSJ said that after employees delivered the new number an Exxon official allegedly asked that they “claw back” some of the lost value by using different assumptions the whistleblower complaint contended. These assumptions included a more optimistic “learning curve” which estimated the rate at which they would better drilling times. The WSJ report said that some employees objected to using the new learning curve which they viewed as unrealistic. One employee submitted the revised estimates in a file named “This is a Lie” according to the whistleblower complaint. The development planners eventually estimated the NPV at US$50 billion – US$10 billion down from what had been previously floated.

The WSJ said that Exxon had previously told it that it was common for disagreements during the planning process. The WSJ said that while Exxon has never publicly disclosed the Delaware Basin valuation the Head of its oil and gas division Neil Chapman had said in March that the company had steadily improved drilling times and costs.

The size of the Permian underscores the value to Exxon from its Guyana operations. The Liza-1 is producing 120000 barrels daily. The Liza-2 is to begin producing 220000 barrels per day by early next year and Payara is expected to begin producing 220000 barrels per day in 2024. More platforms are also planned here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8xNi9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9leHhvbnMtbGF0ZXN0LXdlbGwtY29tZXMtdXAtZHJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon’s latest well comes up dry offshore Guyana,"Hassa-1 ExxonMobil’s latest exploration well in the offshore Stabroek Block has come up dry and the company yesterday announced that it encountered hydrocarbons at other intervals and will be assessing its data.

“The Hassa-1 exploration well in the Stabroek block did not encounter hydrocarbons in the primary target reservoirs. However the well did encounter hydrocarbons in other intervals. We are evaluating the data which will be integrated into our regional subsurface interpretation and modelling” the company’s Public and Government Affairs Advisor Janelle Persaud said.

Persaud posited that the dry hole “serves as a reminder that geologic risk is inherent to frontier oil and gas exploration activities” but added that “ExxonMobil remains committed to evaluating the potential in our offshore Guyana blocks using our world-class technology and technical capabilities”.

While it has had 18 successes in the Stabroek Block Hassa-1 is the second consecutive well here to be declared non-commercial. Back in November at its first well drilled in the adjacent Kaieteur Block the company also had a similar result.

Then ExxonMobil had said that while Tanager-1 showed hydrocarbons it did not appear to be economic on a standalone basis but the company pledged to press on with exploration activities in the area.

The company last month began spudding its first well in the controversial Canje Block and said it was expected to be on location for several weeks.

A notice by the Maritime Administration Department (MARAD) had stated that as of January 1st 2021 the company would continue with the exploration drilling operation at the Bulletwood-1 well site with those works expected to end by February 23rd.

ExxonMobil had said that it has some three wells scheduled to be drilled in the Canje block.

ExxonMobil is the operator of all three deepwater blocks: the Stabroek Kaieteur and Canje and the circumstances of its buying into the operations of the latter two have come in for much scrutiny. This is because months after the signing of its renegotiated Stabroek Block Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) in June 2016 the company bought shares in both the Canje and Kaieteur blocks. The Canje and Kaieteur blocks had been controversially awarded in 2015 just prior to Exxon’s first major oil strike in the Stabroek Block. The small companies that snagged the rights did not have the required capital or expertise to explore the blocks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpaml0aW1lcy5jb20uZmovc2hlbGwtZXh4b24tYWltcy1hdC0yLTUtYmlsbGlvbi1pbi1kdXRjaC1zdWJzaWRpZXMtZm9yLWNhcmJvbi1zdG9yYWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shell-Exxon aims at $2.5 billion in Dutch subsidies for carbon storage,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) – A consortium that includes oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil has requested a total of 2.1 billion euros ($2.55 billion) in subsidies for a project to store CO2 gasses in empty Dutch gas fields in the North Sea the Dutch Economy ministry said on Thursday.

The subsidies were requested together with industrial gas suppliers Air Liquide and Air Products for a project which aims to capture carbon dioxide emitted by factories and refineries in the Rotterdam port area in order to significantly reduce emissions in Europe’s largest sea port.

The port and the four companies involved said they would take a final investment decision on the project early next year and aim to have it operational by 2024.

The Dutch government has said it will grant a total of 5 billion euros in subsidies in 2021 for technologies that will help it achieve its climate goals.

The government said it had received applications for a total sum of 6.4 billion euros. It expects to decide on the division of the subsidies by the end of the second quarter.

Home to many large industries and Europe’s main seaport the Netherlands is among the countries with the highest emissions of greenhouse gasses per capita in Europe.

It aims to lower emissions by 55% relative to 1990 levels by 2030. Emissions were down 18% from 1990 levels in 2019 the most recent year for which data is available."

Caledonia junior guard Eli King suffered a torn meniscus and will miss the entire 2021 season. The high-flying King was supposed to finally take the reins of Caledonia's high-powered squad. Now we'll have to wait until next year to see King's explosive dunks.

King averaged 16.2 points 6.4 rebounds 5.2 assists 3.3 steals and 1.8 blocks per game for a 28-win team last year. His recruiting had erupted after a great showing on the AAU circuit. The electric Class of 2022 prospect has multiple Division I offers in both basketball and football.

But it seemed his future was always going to be in basketball and 247Sports' Ryan James reported that Iowa Iowa State Minnesota Marquette and Stanford were pushing the hardest for King.

Even rival Three Rivers Conference coaches gushed when they broke down King's game.

""Eli King is as high-end of an athlete that I’ve seen in this area"" Chatfield coach Jeff DeBuhr said. ""He’s still a young guy but every year he seems to be a better jump shooter. Every year he’s a better ball handler. He puts in the time. That’s where the ceiling can get so high. Everyone is born with athletic limitations but he doesn’t seem to have any.""

Friday was the first time in years that a King boy didn't suit up for Caledonia. The Warriors still rolled Triton 96-52. Andrew Kunelius stepped up and scored a team-high 18 points. Jackson Koepke and Sam Privet both added 15 points. Thanke Meiners (nine points) Ja'Shon Simpson (eight points) and Austin Klug (seven points) were also productive.

It's been a wicked stretch of months for the world and that includes the southeastern Minnesota basketball community. The basketball season got pushed back due to COVID-19. Then just days before it was finally supposed to start King suffers a season-ending knee injury.

When King comes back he'll undoubtedly be flying higher than ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Associated Press

NEW YORK — General Motors plans to spend $800 million to turn a Canadian SUV plant into one that will make electric delivery vans.

Work on the plant which is in Ingersoll Ontario will start immediately and take two years. The plant currently makes Chevrolet Equinox SUVs.

The electric delivery vans are part of GM's new venture BrightDrop which is building electric vehicles for delivery companies. The growth of online shopping has increased demand for electric vans as delivery companies look for cleaner vehicles to deliver packages.

BrightDrop's first customer is FedEx which will begin receiving GM's EV600 electric vans later this year.

The 26-year-old Shreveport native is due to take another giant leap after his performance last week in the Delray Beach Open.

Harrison who entered Delray as a qualifier knocked off No. 1 seeded Cristian Garen on his way to a semifinal finish where he fell in straight sets 7-6 (4) 6-4 to eventual winner Hubert Hurkacz. He was ranked No. 789 in the world entering the event but is due to make a massive leap to No. 340 when the new ATP rankings are posted Monday.

“In the last year and a half I’ve been able to train really consistently” Harrison told The Times. “I felt like I was pushing too hard in training where I had two practices a day and that was forcing injuries. So I changed how I practiced. While we were in quarantine with no tournaments to look forward to I was hitting just one time a day. I was able to build a foundation in practice.

“Now I feel like everything is clicking and happening naturally.”

COVID-19 shut down the pro tennis tour for most of last year but Harrison said he worked out on neighborhood courts near his Florida home. Staying in physical shape was key to getting off to a quick start.

“I was able to keep practicing all the time because of the access” he said. “I used it as a time to keep good routines and good habits then make some progress.”

Harrison who attended Shreveport’s Eden Gardens Elementary lost in the men’s doubles final at Delray with his brother Ryan 6-7 7-6 10-4.

“It was good but it hasn’t hit me too much because part of me felt like I could always have these results” he said. “Now that it’s happened I’m more motivated to just keep doing what I’m doing to keep that success coming.”

The Harrison brothers’ room next to each other on the tour and often order Uber Eats together with sushi and Chipotle as their mainstays. Christian prefers spicy tuna shrimp and an occasional eel roll.

The brothers have played doubles professionally about 10 times making a quarterfinal run in the 2012 U.S. Open.

“We always get along especially now that we’re getting older. I had a lot of injuries after (the Open run) where I missed time” Harrison said. “We look forward to playing a lot more together because we know we can be successful together.”

Harrison has undergone eight surgeries including left femur (2009) right hip (2013) left hip (2014) right shoulder (2014) right wrist (2014) right adductor (2014) left adductor (2014) and left femur (2018). He doesn’t believe all of them were necessary.

“It was something where I talked to the wrong surgeon. The surgeons I saw were very good but very aggressive” he said. “Somehow one hip turned into ‘let’s do both hips. Let’s look at your shoulder.’ Then it became ‘let’s do a surgery to avoid problems.’ It was not the right way to go about it that I’ve now learned. It had nothing to do with my body structurally it was just bad advice and bad decision making. I’m as close to 100 percent as I’ve been in a long time – pre-surgery.”

The season is just getting underway and Harrison has played five events with the ATP counting a player’s best 18. The higher ATP ranking will allow him to qualify for more tournaments.

“I’m looking forward to keeping this momentum going” he said.

Harrison hasn’t yet hit his prime and knows pros continue extending the length of their careers.

“Until there’s a normal tournament schedule it’s just going to be playing wherever they do have tournaments – continuing to add points and trying to get a high match count” he said. “That’s my main focus.”

Read more

Even without Joel Embiid the 76ers made it a competitive game with the Memphis Grizzlies. Depsite a late surge and a 28-18 fourth quarter advantage it wasn’t enough in Saturday’s 106-104 loss at the FedEx Forum.

Here are three reasons why the Sixers lost.

Turnovers

The Sixers committed 23 turnovers compared to 11 for Memphis. There were too many sloppy passes and too many times the Sixers tried to force the ball into spaces that were too tight. As well as he played with 28 points Shake Milton still committed five turnovers and he didn’t even have the team lead. Ben Simmons committed seven and Tobias Harris added five.

Containing Ja Morant

Last season’s NBA Rookie of the Year Morant was rusty early on since he had missed the previous eight games with a left ankle sprain.

He missed his first three field goal attempts but then he scored early in the second quarter on this alley oop dunk on a feed from Kyle Anderson. This basket seemed to get Morant going.

The Sixers opened with Simmons guarding Morant and Matisse Thybulle also spent considerable time on him. Danny Green also spent time guarding him.

Morant had 17 points and six assists (and three turnovers) and hurt the Sixers on pick and rolls. Here he gets the assist on a lob to Brandon Clarke.

Morant shot 7 for 14 including 0 for 3 from three-point range while playing 30 minutes and 42 seconds. Sensing his perimeter game was off Morant kept taking it to the basket. Of his seven field goals he had a dunk four driving layups and two floaters in the lane. He wasn’t overly rushed playing at his own pace.

Dwight Howard at the line

Dwight Howard filled in admirably for Embiid with eight points and 18 rebounds including five on the offensive glass. Howard however is a liability on the foul line. He was 2 for 8 in a game the Sixers lost by two.

The rest of the Sixers shot 21 of 24 (.875) from the foul line.

Howard missed all four fourth quarter free throw attempts. He played 9:01 in the fourth quarter. Even with Embiid out the Sixers may want to revisit having him in the game in crunch time due to his difficulties at the foul line."

The OceanH2 project which will be based around Swedish outfit Hexicon’s twin-headed floating wind units and open-sea solar installations powering onboard electrolysers will explore “different implementation scenarios” for an offshore hybrid electricity generation system factoring in the emerging hydrogen production storage and distribution supply chain.

Kicking off with laboratory-scale test of various concepts carried out by Wunder Hexicon a company jointly owned by Hexicon and Spanish outfit WunderSight the three-year project will be developed in six autonomous communities of the European country – Madrid the Canary Islands Andalusia Cantabria Navarra and Catalonia – to “guarantee technological synergies and national scientific capacities”.

“There are two main merits to using floating wind to produce hydrogen offshore in our view” Hexicon's incoming CEO Marcus Thor said to Recharge in an exclusive interview.

“First of course that being offshore there is limitless water [for use in the electrolysis process that produces hydrogen]; and second that floating wind plants could function with no connection to the mainland producing hydrogen for offshore loading onto shuttle tankers for onward transport to industry and also for use in the future as fuel for green shipping.

“And this would get a project out of a pressures of power pricing. The need for stable electricity prices is removed.“

Acciona in a statement said: “The knowledge obtained with this project may be transferred to areas of application and markets not contemplated to date achieving in addition to an increase in the competitiveness of the participating companies greater sustainability in the sector.

“This will favour both job creation and the mobilisation of future investments to implement the innovative results of the project in the market.

“To facilitate the subsequent technological development process and its introduction on the market all phases of the project will be based on strict technical and economic requirements.”

The project which is supported by Spain’s Ministry of Science Innovation & Universities under the aegis of a €70m R&D programme will also involve contractors including Redexis Ariema TSIand BlueNewables as well as twelve research centres in the country.

Once seen an experimental technology floating wind is gathering speed in its industrialisation and is increasingly being looked at for utility-scale standalone projects in the world’s major maritime regions as well as as part of hybrid concepts using other renewables technologies such as floating PV and wave power.

Hexicon currently has pure-play floating wind developments underway off Korea with oil giant Shell as well as in South Africa and Scotland but this is its first hybridised project – though the Swedish company's original offshore energy design incorporated wind wave and solar technologies.

Floating wind markets are on the verge of explosive growth globally with recent analysis from UK-based low carbon advisory body the Carbon Trust calculating over 70GW of floating wind could be turning by 2040 – a near-1000-fold expansion of the current global fleet – as international supply chains take shape to support development of commercial-scale projects around the world.

DNV in its latest Energy Transition Outlook forecasts some 260GW of floating wind turning worldwide by 2050 but hinges on the sector reducing levellised cost of energy to €40-60/MWh ($50-75/MWh) from levels today that are three times as high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2lnbmJvb20uY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvc29uby1tb3RvcnMtc2lvbi1uZXh0LWdlbi0wMS0xNi0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,sono motors covers the sion with solar panels on all straight + curved exterior parts,"german electric car maker sono motors has revealed the next generation of sion its self-charging electric car. in line with its vision for an affordable accessible world without fossil fuels the company has created a proprietary platform to expand the use of the solar technology innovations born from the sion.

‘we have found a way to deliver sustainable free power across various transportation applications by replacing the traditional “paint shop” process with integrated solar technology’ comments jona christians co-founder and chief executive officer of sono motors. ‘while sono solar technology is cheaper lighter and much more efficient than conventional glass-based solar cells I am most excited about the potential uses that will arise thanks to its incredible flexibility. we are continuing to enhance this technology and look forward to our next achievements.’

the PV/solar trailer represents the next step for sono solar technology underscoring the technology’s potential use across various mobility applications and upending global consumers’ historic reliance on traditional combustion engines. the sion also exhibited the first series-intended solar integration on the body for the model during CES 2021 emphasizing the company’s innovation track record.

sono motors achieved something remarkable by placing solar panels on all straight and curved exterior parts of the sion. the company has also taken a step forward in the development of the sono app and infotainment system which is showcased this prototype. the in-vehicle series-intended control units communicate with the app and infotainment — for example in live tracking of solar energy keyless entry opening the charging lid control of the cabin temperature and ambient light. high quality surface materials and the series-close dashboard give the vehicle a contemporary look and a good indication of the standard look-and-feel of the sion.

The low-cost airline continues to struggle to survive the financial effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the new initiative is another measure for the airline to stay afloat.

Norwegian Air has in recent years operated long-haul routes to destinations such as Thailand Argentina and across the USA but Jacob Schram Norwegian’s chief executive has revealed the airlines plan to drop all these long-haul flying and focus on its European and Nordic short-haul business.

The drop in business means that thousands of jobs are on the line as cabin crew and pilots face being made redundant.

According to Jacob Schram the focus for Norwegian is to rebuild a strong and profitable airline so they can safeguard as many jobs as possible. Norwegian expects a very low demand in long-haul flights in the near future and the focus will therefore be on developing the airline’s short-haul network as they emerge from the reorganization process.

Before the pandemic struck she was working at Fiserv Forum where under a ""community benefits agreement"" between the local union and Forum management she was on track to make $15 an hour plus tips as a bartender.

Then the pandemic hit in March and Harmon was laid off.

She struggled to find consistent work and eventually landed a job at a Family Dollar store behind the cash register.

But Harmon — who was already behind on rent and other bills and can't afford to move — said her new wage of $10 an hour isn’t enough. She is working only 20 to 24 hours a week and spends 80% of her paychecks on rent.

President-elect Joe Biden has promised to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend that increase to farming and domestic workers who are not now covered. The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.

It's a goal that activists and others have sought for years including in Milwaukee where organizers have staged protests lobbied lawmakers and argued that a livable wage is a matter of social justice.

Their call echoes the work of Martin Luther King Jr. who in the months leading up to his death argued that every American deserved a reasonable income. When he was shot and killed in April 1968 he was in Memphis to support striking sanitation workers.

Making $15 an hour would change things significantly for Harmon she said.

""I know to some people it don’t seem like it’s much but it becomes a big difference in being able to just somewhat maintain a home"" she said.

Poverty a defining factor in the lives of many Milwaukeeans

Today poverty and income inequality are worse than they were in King's time and in Milwaukee that disparity falls sharply along racial lines.

Real median household income for Blacks in Milwaukee has fallen by almost 30% since 1979 according to research by Marc Levine founding director of the Center for Economic Development at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Black households in the city make 42% of what their white counterparts make his research shows a drop from 58.3% in 1979.

Jeffrey Sommers is a professor of political economy and public policy at UWM’s Department of African and African Diaspora Studies who co-wrote an article examining King's political and economic outlook.

If King were alive today he’d be horrified by the lack of progress on poverty Sommers said.

“What you have today is workers are getting a much smaller share of total output of the economy” Sommers said. “It’s depressing and it’s horrifying the state that we’ve allowed so many people to descend into with poverty.”

RELATED:UWM study on the state of Black Milwaukee describes the city as 'the epitome of a 21st century racial regime'

King tied economic security to social justice because he had seen economic security denied to his own relatives: King's father grew up in a plantation district his grandparents were sharecroppers and four of his three great-grandparents had been slaves.

That's why in speeches as early as 1956 King began pointing out the need to reduce wealth inequality.

“God never intended for one group of people to live in superfluous inordinate wealth while others live in abject deadening poverty” he said.

His profound concern turned into the Poor People’s Campaign in 1967.

The campaign advocated for a number of economic reforms including more support for labor unions raising the minimum wage establishing government jobs and creating a universal basic income.

King was planning a march on Washington as part of the campaign when he took a fateful detour to Memphis to lend his support to Black workers striking over low wages and dangerous working conditions.

There before he was shot King reaffirmed his belief in economic justice saying “It’s a crime in a rich nation for people to receive starvation wages.""

Anti-poverty and labor groups support an increase

The Poor People’s March on Washington was held in May 1968 but King’s vision of ending poverty went unrealized.

It did result in the creation of anti-poverty agencies that were set up across the country in the 1960s.

George Hinton is the executive director of the Social Development Commission one of those anti-poverty agencies; it focuses on Milwaukee County.

Hinton said that on Martin Luther King Jr. Day it's important that people recognize the breadth of King's vision.

""Martin Luther King was a champion of people in poverty not just people of color"" Hinton explained. ""He spoke to the plight of people who were brown and Black just like me but also the issues of poverty for everyone.""

That compassion Hinton said is sorely needed as the coronavirus pandemic brings more economic suffering and exacerbates long-existing problems such as the benefits cliff.

People can topple over the benefits cliff if their income rises above a certain point and social programs such as food stamps or rental assistance are no longer available. Forced to pay ""full price"" they can be left worse off even with additional income.

""It’s not the smartest thing to do to walk over the cliff"" Hinton explained. ""You find people making choices about how much they can make without losing all their benefits and ending up worse off than they were. ... (That) doesn’t incentivize people to take that next step.""

Something similar played out over the summer Hinton said when many people saw income from unemployment insurance exceed their regular wages.

""You can look at it from a cynical way or an opportunity way. The cynical way is 'OK people don’t want to work because they can get more money with unemployment.' The thing is maybe we’re not paying people enough money in the first place"" he said.

Peter Rickman president of Milwaukee Area Service and Hospitality Workers Organization which is part of Milwaukee's Fight for 15 campaign said while he is excited about the prospect of a federal minimum wage he hasn't given up pursuing it in Wisconsin. The current minimum at both the federal and state levels is $7.25 an hour.

Rickman and other unions have brought Gov. Tony Evers a proposal to increase the minimum wage and lobbied for legislation that would allow municipalities to set their own.

""We can’t just hope for goodwill from the local employers here. That strategy is doomed to failure"" Rickman said.

A debate over the impact of raising the minimum wage

But proposals to raise the minimum wage have run into strong opposition in the past and when the economy is strong employers frequently have to pay more than $7.25 an hour to attract workers.

On one side are people like Levine and Sommers.

Sommers argues Biden’s promise could begin to lift millions out of poverty and even help narrow the racial wealth gap.

Levine said a purely economic argument doesn't consider equity. Raising the minimum wage he said ""would set a standard for fairness and make an unequivocal statement that we don’t think as a society we should be paying poverty-level wages to workers.""

Laura Dresser a labor economist and the associate director at COWS (the Center on Wisconsin Strategy) a left-leaning Madison-based think tank said that in a place like Milwaukee concerns about job loss are based on an outdated narrative that places manufacturing at the center of the economy.

""So many of our metaphors in Milwaukee employment are around manufacturing but the entire competitive structure in Milwaukee is in the service sector. To raise the minimum wage in the service sector you don’t face ruinous wage competition from a hamburger maker in China.""

RELATED:The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention to a trend that began in the mid-1970s: The economy has produced too many low wage jobs

But conservative economists and thought leaders are not persuaded by such arguments.

They argue that small businesses in particular would find an increase to $15 an hour burdensome. And those businesses would respond by either hiring fewer workers or letting some of their current workers go.

In a commentary last summer for the conservative Heritage Foundation Rachel Greszler a research fellow in economics used the online shopping giant Amazon as a case in point.

As businesses become larger and more productive she wrote they can pay their workers more. In 2018 Amazon announced it would raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour which likely gave the company a competitive advantage in hiring.

But that won’t work for many smaller businesses Greszler wrote. And it wouldn’t have worked for Amazon years ago when it was a young company.

""If Amazon had to pay a $15 minimum wage when it first set up shop 26 years ago it may not even exist today. Businesses don’t start big and if they don’t have room to grow they won’t start at all"" she wrote.

Sommers counters that while the increase may be painful for small businesses in the short-term higher wages would mean customers can afford to spend more.

Levine says there is another benefit. Economic research from the 1950s and '60s suggests increasing the minimum wage will narrow the income and wage gap between white and Black workers.

""I think the main argument in favor would clearly be the equity argument and particularly racial equity"" Levine said. ""The bottom line is a disproportionate number of Black and Latino workers hold low-wage jobs or slightly above minimum wage jobs.""

The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimates that nearly a quarter (22.7%) of Wisconsin's workforce would be affected by a raise in the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025.

A pay hike would be welcome

Whatever the economic arguments for workers directly affected a pay bump would be welcome news.

Anthony Steward is a 35-year old who like Harmon has two sons. Steward recently became a union steward for the premium cooks and dishwashers at Fiserv Forum and he's happy workers there make a $15 minimum wage.

""This minimum wage here it's ridiculous"" he said of the prevailing standard. ""It's not keeping up with society or our living standards. The cost of living is going up but our pay rate isn't going up.""

Like Harmon Steward has been laid off from his job as a cook at the arena. For now he is living off unemployment.

Harmon's older son helps out financially. But with her 14-year-old son home and attending virtual school Harmon said that's another expense she wasn't expecting.

""It gets hard but I keep my faith that everything will get better"" she said. ""Even though I know it’s not quite enough I still work. I still do what I can. I know there’s people who are way worse off than I am.""

The Milwaukee Bucks edged over the Dallas Mavericks 112-109 at Fiserv Forum on Friday extending their winning streak to four. Kristaps Porzingis was still under time limit contributing 15 points 10 rebounds and two blocks in 29 minutes for the Mavericks. Luka Doncic missed one rebound for a triple-double by dropping 28 points nine rebounds and 13 assists. Though they lacked multiple key teammates like Josh Richardson Dwight Powell Jalen Brunson and Dorian Finney-Smith the Mavericks still managed to contend with the opponents until the last minute.

Giannis Antetokounmpo went 14-21 to score 31 points and nine rebounds at home. He also made two of his five attempts behind the 3-point line. However behind his good efficiency in field goals stood the absurd 1-10 performance in free throws. The Greek Freak has already missed 282 free throws since the start of last season the most in the league and 107 more than the second Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz. Moreover going 1-10 in free throws in one game is already the worst record in Bucks franchise history. Antetokounmpo is also the fourth NBA player who shot 10 percent or worse (of at least 10 attempts) on the free throw line in 25 seasons. The other three are Andre Drummond (four times) Shaquille O'Neal (twice) and Al Horford (once). Other games on Friday (away teams come first):

Orlando Magic 97-124 Boston Celtics The Celtics were finally able to return to the court after watching three of their games get postponed. Though Jayson Tatum still did not play Jaylen Brown took over the leader role. Not only did he score 21 points he also delivered eight assists with only two turnovers helping his team pocket a 27-point big win. Boston's 2.26-meter Tacko Fall received the chance to play in this hardly intense game at TD Garden. He was 3-3 to get six points five rebounds and one block in seven minutes.

New York Knicks 103-106 Cleveland Cavaliers The Cavaliers put an end to their three-consecutive-loss trend thanks to the close home win at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. Andre Drummond put down court-high 33 points and 23 rebounds. He also had two steals and two blocks. This is the sixth time for a player to get 30+ points and 20+ rebounds in Cavaliers franchise history. Compared with Drummond JaVale McGee was not very happy as he only got two points and one rebound in Friday's game. The arrival of Jarrett Allen will undoubtedly cut McGee's time on the floor. There are already reports that multiple teams are interested in acquiring the three-time NBA champion center.

Chicago Bulls 125-127 Oklahoma City Thunder When the Bulls expanded their lead to 22 points in the third quarter the game seemed to have been long gone. However Luguentz Dort of the Thunder disagreed and he showed his willpower by scoring 10 points in Q3. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander took over from Dort in Q4 and went 5-5 to get 12 points including the finishing a 2+1 play to drag the game into overtime. Though he missed all three shots in OT Mike Muscala sealed the win for the Thunder with two triples. Zach Lavine dropped game-high 35 points for the Bulls at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Friday and it's already the fourth game in a row for him to get 30+points. Nonetheless his efforts failed to lead the Bulls to even one win.

Atlanta Hawks 92-116 Utah Jazz Onyeka Okongwu the No. 6 selection of the 2020 NBA Draft finally made his debut for the Hawks at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Friday. The 20-year-old forward was 2-6 to put down four points six rebounds and two assists in 14 minutes which was acceptable for a rookie. However when Trae Young went 1-11 in field goals and only took (and missed) two attempts from downtown it's basically impossible for the Hawks to win. Though the team have more than enough ball handlers and each of them can launch offense they only have one commander and it's Young. Donovan Mitchell buried six triples to score 26 points in the game not only adding another home win to the Jazz's pocket but also lifting the team to the third in the Western Conference. For years the Jazz have been used to starting late in the playoff qualification competition. Perhaps they want to make a change this season.

New Orleans Pelicans 95-112 Los Angeles Lakers After the Anthony Davis trade in 2019 summer the Pelicans have always been very enthusiastic in the games against the Lakers. Friday's contest at Staples Center was no exception. For example the Pelicans led in rebounds field goal rate and 3-point rate in the first half not to mention they expanded their lead in points to double digit multiple times. Nonetheless they lost by 17 points in the end partly thanks to their 20 turnovers on the court. The purple and gold did not commit all of their 11 steals via high defensive pressure. The Pelicans' ball movement in offense was more than problematic – they turned the ball over in launching pass several times which should not happen to a playoff contender team. LeBron James was two rebounds away from claiming a triple-double. He apparently did not turn on full power but that did not keep the Lakers from achieving the fifth consecutive win.

And the NBA’s No. 1 offense versus the No. 2 defense. The game came down to an exciting fourth quarter and final minute.

All of those topics however were overshadowed by The Gesture with seven seconds left in Dallas’ 112-109 loss to Milwaukee at Fiserv Forum.

Advertisement

It was a hand motion and irritated look that Luka Doncic directed toward the Mavericks’ bench after a potential tying possession fizzled with a missed 3-pointer by Trey Burke an offensive rebound with 19 seconds left and a missed Kristaps Porzingis 3-pointer without Doncic touching the ball in-between the 3-point misfires.

Doncic formed a T with both hands clearly indicating that he believed coach Rick Carlisle should have called a timeout in that situation.

“It’s coach’s decision” a much calmer Doncic said after the game. “If we would have made the shot everything would be good. If we can make the shot everything would be different. ... It’s the coach’s decision to call a timeout or not so I think it’s good.”

Before we go further let’s put the gesture into context. This wasn’t Dez Bryant angrily waving his arms in the middle of the field and continuing his histrionics on the sideline.

Advertisement

This was a competitive 21-year-old briefly registering his dismay toward an NBA title-winning coach who understands heat-of-the-moment frustration.

“Yeah I like the ball in his hands and the defense not being set” Carlisle said. “One great look at a 3 from Burke at the top and then we got an offensive rebound and KP for a look so we got two good looks and you always want to save your [last] timeout if you can.”

Carlisle’s clear inference: He believed not calling timeout was the correct decision in that situation but he also believes the ball should have found its way back into Doncic’s hands.

Advertisement

Still Doncic’s reaction was notable in its rarity of him showing public disagreement over a decision or lack thereof. In reality though plenty of other factors played into the short-handed Mavericks coming up just short of an upset.

Also notice Doncic isn't exactly in prime position to immediately do much had Porzingis chosen to pass to him although with 12 seconds left and no shot clock to worry about there certainly were other options on the table. https://t.co/zlYGSSeyN9 — Brad Townsend (@townbrad) January 16 2021

Doncic finished with 28 points 13 assists and nine rebounds while two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo had 31 points nine rebounds and ghastly 1-of-10 free-throw shooting for the Bucks.

Milwaukee led 109-107 when Dallas gained possession with 39 seconds left after a Jrue Holiday miss. Significantly Dallas had just one timeout left at that point and Carlisle certainly wasn’t going to use it then. What no one anticipated was a long and chaotic Dallas possession.

Advertisement

Burke missed a 29-foot 3-pointer from the beyond the top of the key with 21 seconds left but the ball caromed to Mavericks center Willie Cauley-Stein on the left wing.

Cauley-Stein held the ball for three seconds then handed off to Burke who dribbled beneath the basket. This probably is the point in which Doncic began wondering about the potential of a timeout being called.

By the time Burke realized he had no path to an open shot 14 seconds remained. He passed out to Porzingis with 13 seconds left. Porzingis was 29 feet from the basket. At that point he was 5 of 18 from the field. The game clock was inching down and there was seven seconds left on the shot clock.

Doncic was beyond the top of the key 35 feet from the basket shadowed by Holiday. Porzingis faced a split-second decision of whether to try to pass out to Doncic or shoot over a fast-closing Antetokounmpo the reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Porzingis rose and with 12.8 seconds left unleashed a shot over Antetokounmpo’s out-stretched left hand.

This was only Porzingis’ second game back from right knee surgery. Clearly he was rusty. A sharper Porzingis might not have hurried the shot in the way he did this one. A more game-conditioned Porzingis might have realized there was plenty of time left to get a better shot. A more finely tuned Porzingis probably wouldn’t have missed 13 of his 18 attempts to that point or had that seed of doubt in his head.

Porzingis’ shot sailed over the rim missing it completely glanced off the backboard and was rebounded by Milwaukee. Dallas fouled Kris Middleton and it was during that pause that Doncic made the timeout gesture toward the bench displeasure all over his face. Middleton made both free throws giving Milwaukee a 111-107 lead.

“It’s very difficult to call a timeout against a Milwaukee set defense out of a timeout so I think in those situations if you can put the ball in your best player’s hands you’ll get better opportunities” Carlisle said. “And I thought we got two good ones.”

Porzingis finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds in 29 minutes but took responsibility for his shooting and decision-making.

“I think it would have been better if I knew I was able to play that many minutes” he said. “I think I would have been more calm out there. I feel like I’m trying to still find that rhythm and make the right decisions. I feel a bit disappointed in my performance today.

“This one definitely slipped out of our hands and I need to play better.”

Of his thought process on the ill-fated possession Porzingis said he hurried for no reason.

“It’s a good look but it’s just like out of rhythm because I see all of the sudden he’s running at me fast and it’s just a little bit of that feel that I need to still find where I don’t need to rush that shot” he said.

Advertisement

Carlisle said he had no issues with Porzingis attempting so many shots or his shot selection and Carlisle was in no mood to publicly quibble about Porzingis’ decision on the play in question.

“I just think it’s a situation where the more he plays the more we can reconcile that; he can reconcile that” Carlisle said. “Hey if you were out for five months and you were just getting the chance to get back with your team you’d be aggressive too. You’d want to be out there you’d want to get the ball in your hands.

“Put yourself in his shoes: The guy desperately wants to help the team. If he was not aggressive I’d be a lot more concerned.”

A less-rusty Porzingis probably makes that shot or at least doesn’t miss it so badly. A made shot would have meant no reason for Doncic’s gesture.

Advertisement

Instead it was another lesson learned for the Mavericks’ young MVP candidate and its All-Star-talent big man and a Hall of Fame coach who will make sure it’s a teaching moment for all concerned.

Asked immediately after the game whether he’d had a chance to speak to Doncic about the play and his reasoning for not calling timeout Carlisle said: “I’m not going to get into that publicly. Look we got two good shots and we preserved a timeout. As a coach that’s all you can hope for in that situation.”

Asked whether he had spoken to Carlisle Doncic said “Not yet.”

Did he plan to do so?

“Hmm I don’t know” Doncic said. “If we talk we’re going to talk it’s not going to be in the media. It’s going to be between us.”

Built for America campaign highlights Ford’s unique position as the top assembler of vehicles in America and largest employer of U.S. hourly autoworkers; this piece comes on the heels of #FinishStrong a public call to action by the company to support those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic

DEARBORN Mich. Jan. 16 2021 – Look to the builders. In times of strife and divisiveness look to the people who don’t give up on their principles but build on them. Because this country isn’t built on brick and steel – it’s built on the strength of all of us working together.

That message of unity is paramount in “Builders” the new spot in Ford’s Built for America campaign which highlights Ford’s unique position as the top assembler of vehicle in America and largest employer of U.S. hourly autoworkers. The newest ad underscores Ford’s solid 117-year history and the need for solidarity in the face of change.

“In tough times Ford and our country have always come together and built things – vehicles tanks even relationships” said Kumar Galhotra president Americas & International Markets Group. “This spot shows from our perspective where our nation should focus – on the fixers the builders the ones who can bring us together.”

The 60-second piece directed by Stacy Wall and produced by Wieden+Kennedy New York will air Saturday Jan. 16 on Fox during college basketball which begins at noon. It can also be seen throughout the day on CBS Sports ESPN Discovery and cable channels including Hallmark HGTV Nat Geo The Food Network DIY Great American Country The Science Channel and Motor Trend Network. The spot is narrated by award-winning actor Bryan Cranston. See it here.

The spot comes on the heels of Ford’s recent public call to action a piece titled #FinishStrong created by acclaimed filmmaker Peter Berg known for “Friday Night Lights” “Patriots Day” and “Lone Survivor.” That spot released at the end of 2020 was designed to offer inspiration to Americans doing their best to stay vigilant and protect themselves and others as the COVID-19 vaccine is rolled out across the country.

Ford has been a leader in COVID mitigation efforts since April of 2020 and one of the first manufacturers to pivot toward making personal protective equipment (PPE). To date Ford has manufactured 55 million masks and will hit 100 million masks for donations by mid-2021.

The company in partnership with the UAW has produced tens of millions of pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) to meet the strong demand. These include:

20 million face shields

50000 patient ventilators

More than 32000 powered air-purifying respirators in collaboration with 3M

1.4 million washable isolation gowns

Throughout its 117-year history Ford has stepped up in moments of global crisis including creating iron lungs in the polio epidemic and leading the Arsenal of Democracy in WWII. Ford’s latest effort builds on the company’s support for those affected by the pandemic – from creating programs allowing customers to defer car payments to transforming its plants to make ventilators.

In collaboration with the UAW and Ford Motor Company Fund Ford also has donated more than 50 million face masks to nonprofit organizations state and local officials first responders schools and underserved communities in all 50 states. Details are available at FordFund.org.

“Ford’s strong bond with America continues to grow stronger” said Galhotra. “We’ll always speak up to let our customers know where we stand – and we’ll always be in their corner.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS1mb3JkLW11c3RhbmctbWFjaC1lLXF1YWxpdHktaXNzdWUtcHJvbXB0cy1zdG9wLXNhbGUtb3JkZXItMTU0NTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E “Quality Issue"" Prompts Stop-Sale Order","EV

What’s wrong you may be wondering? Only the Ford Motor Company knows that and unfortunately for expecting customers the Dearborn-based automaker isn’t willing to detail the issue that prompted the stop-sale order.“As part of our commitment to delivering high-quality vehicles we are conducting additional quality checks on several hundred Mustang Mach-E models built before dealer shipments started last month” said a spokesperson. “As part of our quality process we want to ensure they meet the quality our customers expect and deserve.”If you ask me a quality-improving delay is the right course of action if Ford intends to eat into Tesla’s piece of thepie.The Mustang Mach-E isn’t the only all-new model with quality-related problems at launch though. The Blue Oval had trouble with the Explorer and Lincoln Aviator and early builds of the F-150 for the 2021 model year have been sidelined for repairs at the Dearborn and Kansas City plants.Just like the Bronco Sport the Mustang Mach-E is assembled in Mexico. It's also worth highlighting that it's the second-most expensive sport utility vehicle in the lineup at the present moment. Pricing starts at $42895 excluding destination charge but potential savings that include the $7500 federal tax credit will bring the MSRP down to very competitive levels.The Mustang Mach-E has also received quite a bit of praise over its most obvious rival the Model Y. For its part Tesla has indirectly confirmed the challenge posed by the Ford Motor Company by launching a more affordable version of the electric crossover. The smallest battery available and rear-wheel drive have brought the price down to $41990 as opposed to $49990 for the Model Y in the dual-motor Long Range specification.Moving forward the Blue Oval will square up against the MYP with the GT Performance Edition. In this configuration the Mustang Mach-E is targeting up to 235 miles (378 kilometers) of EPA-rated driving range and a 60-mph time of 3.5 seconds thanks to 634 pound-feet (860 Nm) of torque.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1yZWlkLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTc0MjkxNTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Reid Obituary (2021) - Dearborn MI - The Detroit News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/detroitnews/name/robert-reid-obituary?id=7429155 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1yZWlkLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTc0MjkxNTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL21hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmcvYW1lcmljYW4taG9uZGEtc2FsZXMtc2x1bXAtMjAyMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Honda Sales Slump for 2020,"After contending with pandemic-related shutdowns at its U.S.-based factories American Honda Motor Co.

Palm Beach Daily News

Recorded at $55.15 million the recent Palm Beach sale of the late Kathleen DuRoss Ford’s lakefront mansion at 300 N. Lake Way was the second-highest-dollar deal ever recorded on the island for a lakefront estate without ocean frontage.

But the deal holds another price distinction in a town where many of the largest deals are handled privately outside the multiple listing service. The sale which closed early this month is the most expensive MLS-listed property to change hands in nearly four years an online search shows.

It beat the $49-million price of an MLS-recorded sale that closed Feb. 1 2017 for what was then a never-lived-in beachfront house developed on speculation at 101 Indian Road on the far North End.

Broker Lawrence Moens of Lawrence A. Moens Associates had the listing for the former Ford house which Ford’s estate sold to David and Constance Littman as previously reported by the Daily News. The buyers were represented by broker Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate.

Angle also represented the buyer in the deal on Indian Road opposite listing agent Cristina Condon of Sotheby’s International Realty. That house was developed by an investment group that included Moens and Robert G. Fessler. It was bought by a trust associated with Tamara and Albert Rabil III.

Other estates in Palm Beach have sold for far more than those two houses over the past four years. But those were off-market transactions.

Kathleen Ford was the widow of automotive scion Henry Ford II who headed Ford Motor Co. They married in 1980 and he died in 1987. She died in May at 80.

Netflix’s newest reality series Bling Empire follows the lives of Los Angeles’ wealthiest Asians and Asian-Americans as they navigate between traditional Eastern values and … well having lots of money and being in front of a camera for reality TV.

Although Bling Empire is expected to bring us the high drama and absurdity reminiscent of many of our favourite unscripted series  the young daughter of a tech billionaire reportedly keeps it cool and classy for the small screen. (And when the executive producer of Bling Empire is Jeff Jenkins who also produced Keeping Up with the Kardashians maintaining a chill demeanour might be harder than it looks.)

Here’s what we know about Netflix’s newest 23-year-old star.

She’s a high fashion influencer

Like many of her cast mates Xie is no stranger to the front-row seats of fashion week. Teetering on the cusp of the millennial generation and Gen Z (she was born in 1997) the young stylista makes her mark in the fashion world through Instagram and YouTube as well as those coveted fashion week appearances.

Recalling her beginnings as a social media influencer Xie told online lifestyle magazine Husskie “It started a few years ago when friends and family encouraged me to share my love for fashion and find a way to capture my style to share with the world.”

She is gluten free dairy free and vegan – or at least tries to be

Xie tries to keep up a healthy lifestyle as much as she can. In addition to not drinking alcohol or smoking (mostly) Xie avoids gluten dairy fish and meat as much as she can.

But which dietary restriction is the hardest to follow? Xie said in a YouTube video that she can’t help but sample croissants and pastries when she’s travelling in Paris. She’s also partial to Sugarfish by Sushi Nozawa a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles that’s very popular with celebrities.

Her dad’s a Silicon Valley mogul

Her father Ken Xie founded Silicon Valley cybersecurity company Fortinet in 2000 which offers firewalls and cloud security to businesses. Forbes estimated his net worth to be around US$4 billion and made the Forbes 400 list in 2020.

Xie has opened up to her YouTube followers about her mother who was very present in their childhood while her dad was busy working often driving the young Xie to her horseback riding lessons.

She pays for her own shopping sprees

As a fashion influencer it’s important that Xie keeps her wardrobe up to date with the latest designer collections – but you may be surprised to learn that the 23-year-old fashionista doesn’t rely on her parents for a shopping allowance.

Xie has told her fan base that her parents used to support her shopping habits – despite them having no interest in fashion. But now the young go-getter can afford to purchase pieces for herself and she thanks her parents for teaching her the value of money at an early age.

She loves horses

Since first grade Xie says she’s been obsessed with horseback riding – to the point that she even considered being a professional. She competed in her teens and ranked No 1 in the United States Equestrian Federation in 2014.

But fashion ended up taking over as her leading passion.

But It Insisted on One Unusual Condition. (Published 2021),"On Oct. 12 2020 Fox News agreed to pay millions of dollars to the family of a murdered Democratic National Committee staff member implicitly acknowledging what saner minds knew long ago: that the network had repeatedly hyped a false claim that the young staff member Seth Rich was involved in leaking D.N.C. emails during the 2016 presidential campaign. (Russian intelligence officers in fact had hacked and leaked the emails.)

Fox’s decision to settle with the Rich family came just before its marquee hosts Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity were set to be questioned under oath in the case a potentially embarrassing moment. And Fox paid so much that the network didn’t have to apologize for the May 2017 story on FoxNews.com.

But there was one curious provision that Fox insisted on: The settlement had to be kept secret for a month — until after the Nov. 3 election. The exhausted plaintiffs agreed.

Why did Fox care about keeping the Rich settlement secret for the final month of the Trump re-election campaign? Why was it important to the company which calls itself a news organization that one of the biggest lies of the Trump era remain unresolved for that period?

The insurrection at the US Capitol has sparked a political firestorm and unnerved millions of Americans. It has also unleashed a wave of criticism over the role played by pro-Trump media outlets such as Fox News which fed lies and conspiracy theories about the election to angry supporters of the president for weeks.

“The mob that stormed and desecrated the Capitol … could not have existed in a country that hadn’t been radicalized by the likes of [Fox News hosts] Sean Hannity Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham and swayed by biased news coverage” wrote Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan.

But are the airwaves of any democracy free of this kind of harmful propaganda and downright fiction? The United Kingdom for one comes pretty close.

Though the UK media scene is defined in part by a freewheeling and often partisan tabloid press with its own share of conspiracy theories its TV news channels largely frame their coverage down the middle with broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV maintaining high levels of public trust. Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News is no longer on air in the country after failing to generate a significant viewer base.

A big factor in this is media regulator Ofcom which enforces rules on impartiality and accuracy for all news broadcasters. Those who breach the rules can be censured or fined — putting pressure on TV channels to play stories fairly straight.

What the impartiality rules do is ensure you cannot have the kind of shock jock culture.” Steven Barnett University of Westminster media professor

Russian state-funded news channel RT for example was slapped with a £200000 ($272000) penalty for repeatedly breaking impartiality rules in its 2018 coverage of the poisonings of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter as well as the conflict in Syria. It has not been fined since.

“What the impartiality rules do is ensure you cannot have the kind of shock jock culture — [a] far right or indeed far left one-sided interpretation of events” said Steven Barnett a professor of media and communication at the University of Westminster.

The UK system isn’t perfect. A review of BBC coverage ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum found that its main news program was more negative on the European Union than Russian President Vladimir Putin. And two new media ventures expected to launch shortly could again push the limits of what’s allowed. But according to experts the framework has protected against the kind of disinformation peddled by Fox News in the United States.

No Fox News

Ofcom which was established in 2003 has two important standards that the news broadcasters it licenses must abide by — “due impartiality” and “due accuracy.”

This does not mean that equal time needs to be given on television and radio to both sides of an issue. But broadcasters do have a responsibility at least to acknowledge opposing viewpoints and to quickly correct “significant mistakes.”

When Fox News was on the air in the United Kingdom its top stars were found to have violated the regulator’s rules.

Ofcom said that a Hannity program about President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting travel from seven majority-Muslim countries didn’t do enough to surface the viewpoints of those who opposed the order. Ofcom also said that a separate Carlson broadcast following the 2017 Manchester terror attack — which included claims that UK authorities had done nothing to stop terrorism or to protect “thousands of underage girls” from rape and abuse — did not adequately reflect alternate perspectives.

Fox News was pulled off air in the United Kingdom later in 2017 when Murdoch the billionaire chairman of News Corp and Fox News’ parent company was seeking government approval to purchase the shares he didn’t own of European pay TV network Sky. (He ended up selling his Sky holdings to Comcast.)

21st Century Fox the network’s parent company at the time said it made the decision because Fox News had attracted “only a few thousand viewers across the day” in the United Kingdom and it didn’t make commercial sense to continue broadcasting. But the move also came amid scrutiny from Ofcom which had previously slammed Fox’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against former network boss Roger Ailes and former star host Bill O’Reilly calling their alleged conduct “deeply disturbing.”

Such warnings hint at the trouble Fox News could have faced had it stuck it out during the Trump era.

Hefty penalties awarded to other channels such as RT have effectively communicated the consequences of slipping up to media executives said Trevor Barnes a TV and radio compliance consultant and former Ofcom official.

“They’re aware that if they misbehave they’ll be hit with a fine” he said.

The United States meanwhile doesn’t have these kinds of rules — and hasn’t since the Reagan era when the Federal Communications Commission stopped enforcing the so-called Fairness Doctrine for TV and radio stations. Historians believe the demise of this rule which required broadcasters to present a variety of views on issues of public importance paved the way for the explosion of conservative talk radio in the late 1980s and 1990s which later served as a model for Fox. Those talk radio shows continue to be popular today.

As a cable network Fox News wouldn’t have been bound by the doctrine which only applied to broadcast channels. But Julian Zelizer a history professor at Princeton University and CNN contributor said its removal changed the rules of the game.

“It served as a kind of check” Zelizer said. “It was always on the mind of everyone who was in the news business.”

Now even members of the Murdoch family are reckoning with the role Fox News has played. James Murdoch who made a dramatic break from his family last year when he resigned from the board of News Corp said in a statement on Friday that “spreading disinformation” has “real world consequences.” While he did not mention Fox News by name it was clear his focus was on the network controlled by his father and brother.

“Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies. We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever” James Murdoch and his wife Kathryn Murdoch said in a joint statement to the Financial Times.

New networks may test the system

The United Kingdom has largely watched the Capitol riot and its aftermath in horror.

“The events … have been the ultimate demonstration of what can happen when those fundamental pillars of democracy break down: accurate information [and] fair information” Barnett said.

But two outlets expected to debut shortly in the United Kingdom could test the bounds of the regulatory system including Ofcom’s appetite for enforcement.

Murdoch’s UK operation which still controls three big British newspapers — The Sun The Times and The Sunday Times — is working on a new video venture having recently received a license under the name News UK TV. Details haven’t been announced.

Meanwhile upstart competitor GB News which recently secured £60 million ($81 million) from investors is hiring journalists as it prepares to launch a 24-hour news channel.

“Many British people are crying out for a news service that is more diverse and more representative of their values and concerns” former BBC host Andrew Neil who will serve as the chairman of GB News said in a statement last week. Neil was previously the editor of Murdoch’s Sunday Times and executive chairman of Sky TV.

Critics fear the News UK TV venture and GB News could move to take on the BBC and fill a perceived gap in right-wing broadcasting sparking concerns about whether UK regulators are up to the task of maintaining due impartiality or whether Britain could soon have its own Fox News-type problem.

Both outlets may play things fairly safe at first and Barnes noted that the rules will give them some latitude.

“There’s no requirement under due impartiality for a channel not to have a bias” he said. “All it requires is you reflect to a pretty small degree what the opposing viewpoint is.”

But Barnett is worried that over time there could be a slow erosion of norms — combined with an anti-Ofcom push from Murdoch’s powerful papers who may level criticisms of a “nanny state regulator telling us what we can and can’t say.” News Corp declined to comment.

“I will make a prediction that within a year we will see a concerted attack within the Murdoch press on Ofcom” he said. And if support for the regulator fades all bets will be off.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9oYWltLXNhYmFuLWV4cGxhaW5zLXdoeS10aGUtZm94LWRpc25leS1tZXJnZXItc3R1bXBlZC1oaW0tMTQ1OTQ3Mjg0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Haim Saban explains why the Fox-Disney merger 'stumped' him,"Disney+ (DIS) has thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic boasting last month that it has 86.8 million subscribers. The streaming service predicts it will have between 230 million and 260 million global subscribers by 2024 when it will be five years old.

The platform’s surge owes in part to an immense content library bolstered by the high-profile acquisition two years ago of 21st Century Fox which brought aboard franchises like “X-Men” and “Deadpool” as well as old favorites like “Home Alone” and “Night at the Museum.” (The agreement also gave Disney 60% ownership of Hulu.)

Billionaire media investor Haim Saban told Yahoo Finance that the $71 billion deal between Disney and Fox “stumped” him at the time because it deviated from the longtime strategy of holding onto assets favored by Rupert Murdoch executive chairman of Fox parent company News Corp.

But Saban said he understood the thinking behind Murdoch’s side of the deal explaining that Murdoch believed he could not achieve the scale necessary to compete with other media behemoths and instead opted to “play the Disney card.”

“Rupert doesn't sell anything. He doesn't like to sell absolutely anything” says Saban who partnered with Murdoch in the 1990s on the launch of “Fox Family Channel” which later sold to Disney in 2001.

“He realized it's a matter of too big to be small and too small to be big so he really needed to make a move” Saban adds. “He realized you need more scale both at the content and as well as the distribution level.”

Saban said Murdoch first tried to acquire other entities that would help Fox amass enough scale to compete.

“When he identified the fact that there wasn't much for him to buy” Saban says. “And [Disney CEO] Bob Iger came to him with this offer he said ‘Well okay I'll go the other way I'll play the Disney card.’”

After the sale of 21st Century Fox Murdoch retained ownership of Fox Sports the Fox TV network and Fox News the latter of which set cable news viewership records last year. The channel drew heightened scrutiny for its friendly coverage of President Donald Trump over recent days in the aftermath of the siege of the Capitol.

Saban spoke to Serwer in an episode of “Influencers with Andy Serwer” a weekly interview series with leaders in business politics and entertainment.

Known for his entertainment industry savvy Saban rose to prominence in the 1990s with the creation of “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” which led to a joint production venture with News Corp. called the Fox Family Channel that later sold to Disney (DIS). Currently Saban serves as chairman and CEO of the private investment firm Saban Capital Group which specializes in media and entertainment.

Speaking with Yahoo Finance Saban offered unequivocal praise for the another recent media merger: between AT&T and Time Warner which overcame a prolonged legal challenge from the Trump administration in 2019. He highlighted the content acquired by AT&T and praised Jason Kilar who last April became the head of the company’s entertainment and news.

“Jason Kilar is a guy with a vision to run it and I think that they're doing some very interesting things” Saban says. “I think they're going to come out really well with the [Time] Warner acquisition in my humble opinion.”

James Murdoch the youngest son of Rupert Murdoch has publicly attacked ""media property owners"" and news outlets for their role in promoting false election claims that helped lead to the deadly riots in the US Capitol last week.

In an interview with the Financial Times published on Friday Murdoch said that the Capitol siege which resulted in five deaths is ""proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very very much so.""

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years"" the youngest Murdoch said according to the FT. ""I hope that those people who didn't think it was that dangerous now understand and that they stop.""

Murdoch did not mention any news outlets specifically although Fox News — the company owned by his father and eldest brother Lachlan — has previously been criticized for peddling baseless claims of voter fraud following the 2020 election which was first made by President Trump.

His comments are the strongest rebuke of the industry since he decided to break from the family media empire last year.

Murdoch announced his resignation from the board of directors of News Corp in July. The multinational media company owns several US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.

In a statement at the time Murdoch said he chose to leave ""due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""

According to several news reports James and his wife Kathryn were frustrated ""with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage"" on climate change as wildfires ripped through most of Australia last year.

The youngest Murdoch son has since turned his attention to his foundation called Quadrivium which according to its website aims to promote initiatives related to democracy voter participation and climate change among others.

In a separate statement that was published after the FT interview Murdoch and his wife wrote: ""Spreading disinformation — whether about the election public health or climate change — has real-world consequences.""

""Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies. We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever"" they added according to CNN Business."

The insurrection at the US Capitol has sparked a political firestorm and unnerved millions of Americans. It has also unleashed a wave of criticism over the role played by pro-Trump media outlets such as Fox News which fed lies and conspiracy theories about the election to angry supporters of the president for weeks.

“The mob that stormed and desecrated the Capitol … could not have existed in a country that hadn’t been radicalized by the likes of [Fox News hosts] Sean Hannity Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham and swayed by biased news coverage” wrote Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan.

But are the airwaves of any democracy free of this kind of harmful propaganda and downright fiction? The United Kingdom for one comes pretty close.

Though the UK media scene is defined in part by a freewheeling and often partisan tabloid press with its own share of conspiracy theories its TV news channels largely frame their coverage down the middle with broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV maintaining high levels of public trust. Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News is no longer on air in the country after failing to generate a significant viewer base.

A big factor in this is media regulator Ofcom which enforces rules on impartiality and accuracy for all news broadcasters. Those who breach the rules can be censured or fined — putting pressure on TV channels to play stories fairly straight.

What the impartiality rules do is ensure you cannot have the kind of shock jock culture.” Steven Barnett University of Westminster media professor

Russian state-funded news channel RT for example was slapped with a £200000 ($272000) penalty for repeatedly breaking impartiality rules in its 2018 coverage of the poisonings of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter as well as the conflict in Syria. It has not been fined since.

“What the impartiality rules do is ensure you cannot have the kind of shock jock culture — [a] far right or indeed far left one-sided interpretation of events” said Steven Barnett a professor of media and communication at the University of Westminster.

The UK system isn’t perfect. A review of BBC coverage ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum found that its main news program was more negative on the European Union than Russian President Vladimir Putin. And two new media ventures expected to launch shortly could again push the limits of what’s allowed. But according to experts the framework has protected against the kind of disinformation peddled by Fox News in the United States.

No Fox News

Ofcom which was established in 2003 has two important standards that the news broadcasters it licenses must abide by — “due impartiality” and “due accuracy.”

This does not mean that equal time needs to be given on television and radio to both sides of an issue. But broadcasters do have a responsibility at least to acknowledge opposing viewpoints and to quickly correct “significant mistakes.”

When Fox News was on the air in the United Kingdom its top stars were found to have violated the regulator’s rules.

Ofcom said that a Hannity program about President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting travel from seven majority-Muslim countries didn’t do enough to surface the viewpoints of those who opposed the order. Ofcom also said that a separate Carlson broadcast following the 2017 Manchester terror attack — which included claims that UK authorities had done nothing to stop terrorism or to protect “thousands of underage girls” from rape and abuse — did not adequately reflect alternate perspectives.

Fox News was pulled off air in the United Kingdom later in 2017 when Murdoch the billionaire chairman of News Corp and Fox News’ parent company was seeking government approval to purchase the shares he didn’t own of European pay TV network Sky. (He ended up selling his Sky holdings to Comcast.)

21st Century Fox the network’s parent company at the time said it made the decision because Fox News had attracted “only a few thousand viewers across the day” in the United Kingdom and it didn’t make commercial sense to continue broadcasting. But the move also came amid scrutiny from Ofcom which had previously slammed Fox’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against former network boss Roger Ailes and former star host Bill O’Reilly calling their alleged conduct “deeply disturbing.”

Such warnings hint at the trouble Fox News could have faced had it stuck it out during the Trump era.

Hefty penalties awarded to other channels such as RT have effectively communicated the consequences of slipping up to media executives said Trevor Barnes a TV and radio compliance consultant and former Ofcom official.

“They’re aware that if they misbehave they’ll be hit with a fine” he said.

The United States meanwhile doesn’t have these kinds of rules — and hasn’t since the Reagan era when the Federal Communications Commission stopped enforcing the so-called Fairness Doctrine for TV and radio stations. Historians believe the demise of this rule which required broadcasters to present a variety of views on issues of public importance paved the way for the explosion of conservative talk radio in the late 1980s and 1990s which later served as a model for Fox. Those talk radio shows continue to be popular today.

As a cable network Fox News wouldn’t have been bound by the doctrine which only applied to broadcast channels. But Julian Zelizer a history professor at Princeton University and CNN contributor said its removal changed the rules of the game.

“It served as a kind of check” Zelizer said. “It was always on the mind of everyone who was in the news business.”

Now even members of the Murdoch family are reckoning with the role Fox News has played. James Murdoch who made a dramatic break from his family last year when he resigned from the board of News Corp said in a statement on Friday that “spreading disinformation” has “real world consequences.” While he did not mention Fox News by name it was clear his focus was on the network controlled by his father and brother.

“Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies. We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever” James Murdoch and his wife Kathryn Murdoch said in a joint statement to the Financial Times.

New networks may test the system

The United Kingdom has largely watched the Capitol riot and its aftermath in horror.

“The events … have been the ultimate demonstration of what can happen when those fundamental pillars of democracy break down: accurate information [and] fair information” Barnett said.

But two outlets expected to debut shortly in the United Kingdom could test the bounds of the regulatory system including Ofcom’s appetite for enforcement.

Murdoch’s UK operation which still controls three big British newspapers — The Sun The Times and The Sunday Times — is working on a new video venture having recently received a license under the name News UK TV. Details haven’t been announced.

Meanwhile upstart competitor GB News which recently secured £60 million ($81 million) from investors is hiring journalists as it prepares to launch a 24-hour news channel.

“Many British people are crying out for a news service that is more diverse and more representative of their values and concerns” former BBC host Andrew Neil who will serve as the chairman of GB News said in a statement last week. Neil was previously the editor of Murdoch’s Sunday Times and executive chairman of Sky TV.

Critics fear the News UK TV venture and GB News could move to take on the BBC and fill a perceived gap in right-wing broadcasting sparking concerns about whether UK regulators are up to the task of maintaining due impartiality or whether Britain could soon have its own Fox News-type problem.

Both outlets may play things fairly safe at first and Barnes noted that the rules will give them some latitude.

“There’s no requirement under due impartiality for a channel not to have a bias” he said. “All it requires is you reflect to a pretty small degree what the opposing viewpoint is.”

But Barnett is worried that over time there could be a slow erosion of norms — combined with an anti-Ofcom push from Murdoch’s powerful papers who may level criticisms of a “nanny state regulator telling us what we can and can’t say.” News Corp declined to comment.

“I will make a prediction that within a year we will see a concerted attack within the Murdoch press on Ofcom” he said. And if support for the regulator fades all bets will be off.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9oYWltLXNhYmFuLWV4cGxhaW5zLXdoeS10aGUtZm94LWRpc25leS1tZXJnZXItc3R1bXBlZC1oaW0tMTQ1OTQ3Mjg0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Haim Saban explains why the Fox-Disney merger 'stumped' him,"Disney+ (DIS) has thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic boasting last month that it has 86.8 million subscribers. The streaming service predicts it will have between 230 million and 260 million global subscribers by 2024 when it will be five years old.

The platform’s surge owes in part to an immense content library bolstered by the high-profile acquisition two years ago of 21st Century Fox which brought aboard franchises like “X-Men” and “Deadpool” as well as old favorites like “Home Alone” and “Night at the Museum.” (The agreement also gave Disney 60% ownership of Hulu.)

Billionaire media investor Haim Saban told Yahoo Finance that the $71 billion deal between Disney and Fox “stumped” him at the time because it deviated from the longtime strategy of holding onto assets favored by Rupert Murdoch executive chairman of Fox parent company News Corp.

But Saban said he understood the thinking behind Murdoch’s side of the deal explaining that Murdoch believed he could not achieve the scale necessary to compete with other media behemoths and instead opted to “play the Disney card.”

“Rupert doesn't sell anything. He doesn't like to sell absolutely anything” says Saban who partnered with Murdoch in the 1990s on the launch of “Fox Family Channel” which later sold to Disney in 2001.

“He realized it's a matter of too big to be small and too small to be big so he really needed to make a move” Saban adds. “He realized you need more scale both at the content and as well as the distribution level.”

Saban said Murdoch first tried to acquire other entities that would help Fox amass enough scale to compete.

“When he identified the fact that there wasn't much for him to buy” Saban says. “And [Disney CEO] Bob Iger came to him with this offer he said ‘Well okay I'll go the other way I'll play the Disney card.’”

After the sale of 21st Century Fox Murdoch retained ownership of Fox Sports the Fox TV network and Fox News the latter of which set cable news viewership records last year. The channel drew heightened scrutiny for its friendly coverage of President Donald Trump over recent days in the aftermath of the siege of the Capitol.

Saban spoke to Serwer in an episode of “Influencers with Andy Serwer” a weekly interview series with leaders in business politics and entertainment.

Known for his entertainment industry savvy Saban rose to prominence in the 1990s with the creation of “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” which led to a joint production venture with News Corp. called the Fox Family Channel that later sold to Disney (DIS). Currently Saban serves as chairman and CEO of the private investment firm Saban Capital Group which specializes in media and entertainment.

Speaking with Yahoo Finance Saban offered unequivocal praise for the another recent media merger: between AT&T and Time Warner which overcame a prolonged legal challenge from the Trump administration in 2019. He highlighted the content acquired by AT&T and praised Jason Kilar who last April became the head of the company’s entertainment and news.

“Jason Kilar is a guy with a vision to run it and I think that they're doing some very interesting things” Saban says. “I think they're going to come out really well with the [Time] Warner acquisition in my humble opinion.”

James Murdoch the youngest son of Rupert Murdoch has publicly attacked ""media property owners"" and news outlets for their role in promoting false election claims that helped lead to the deadly riots in the US Capitol last week.

In an interview with the Financial Times published on Friday Murdoch said that the Capitol siege which resulted in five deaths is ""proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very very much so.""

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years"" the youngest Murdoch said according to the FT. ""I hope that those people who didn't think it was that dangerous now understand and that they stop.""

Murdoch did not mention any news outlets specifically although Fox News — the company owned by his father and eldest brother Lachlan — has previously been criticized for peddling baseless claims of voter fraud following the 2020 election which was first made by President Trump.

His comments are the strongest rebuke of the industry since he decided to break from the family media empire last year.

Murdoch announced his resignation from the board of directors of News Corp in July. The multinational media company owns several US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.

In a statement at the time Murdoch said he chose to leave ""due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""

According to several news reports James and his wife Kathryn were frustrated ""with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage"" on climate change as wildfires ripped through most of Australia last year.

The youngest Murdoch son has since turned his attention to his foundation called Quadrivium which according to its website aims to promote initiatives related to democracy voter participation and climate change among others.

In a separate statement that was published after the FT interview Murdoch and his wife wrote: ""Spreading disinformation — whether about the election public health or climate change — has real-world consequences.""

""Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies. We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever"" they added according to CNN Business."

She was also a pioneering sports journalist and tennis star.

NEW ORLEANS — Marilyn Barnett who perfected the art of public relations for nearly four decades at the Royal Orleans Roosevelt and Hilton hotels where she developed friendships with movie stars famous authors and symphony conductors died Sunday. She was 97.

Ms. Barnett known to colleagues and friends as “MB” rose to become one of the local public relations industry’s most talented practitioners. She was described in a 2005 Times-Picayune article as a “one-woman media conglomerate.”

In addition to her public relations career she was a classical disc jockey holder of numerous tennis titles a newspaper reporter and one of the first female sports journalists in the South.

But Ms. Barnett is best known for her stints representing the biggest New Orleans hotels. According to her nephew Jim Barnett her first hotel public relations job was at the brand-new Royal Orleans in 1960 a position she landed after giving a newspaper columnist an item about the French Quarter hotel’s general manager. The general manager was impressed by the publicity and offered her the job.

During her nearly ten years at the Royal Orleans Ms. Barnett assisted Arthur Hailey in research for his novel “Hotel."" She became his informed source about local hotel history. When the protagonist in his book described the Royal Orleans as “the finest hotel in North America” Ms. Barnett scored a stroke of PR genius.

As a result of their friendship she became the model in 1968 for publicist Tanya Livingston in Hailey’s “Airport” a heroine noted for typing in lower case a signature trait of Ms. Barnett’s.

“Good public relations means that nothing is too much trouble either for your guests or your property. Whatever is needed it can be done. It also helps if you bring a certain graciousness or elan to the work and of course you should really like what you do"" she once said of her work.

After leaving the Royal Orleans she moved to the Fairmont (Roosevelt) Hotel for 12 years where she handled the bookings in-house advertising and publicity for stars who performed at the hotel's famed supper club the Blue Room - everyone from Lena Horne to Tiny Tim. For years she hobnobbed with and coddled celebrities once lending her coat to actress Imogene Coca and dancing with mob boss Frank Costello.

In an interview with former Times-Picayune theater writer David Cuthbert she remembered Ella Fitzgerald as “wonderful but aloof” called Richard Harris “rather difficult” and said Tina Turner was “tough to deal with.” Pearl Bailey called her “Sister.” They even shared crawfish and crabs at West End. Ms. Barnett also stood on Eartha Kitt’s shoulders to rescue a baby blue jay in Audubon Park.

Other celebrities on the receiving end of Ms. Barnett’s public relations touch included Carol Channing Ginger Rogers Tony Bennett Danny Kaye Charles Laughton Shari Lewis Sebastian Cabot Jose Ferrer Van Johnson and Rosemary Clooney. Ms. Barnett took Peggy Lee to the hospital emergency room during a visit to the city. Lee wrote in her autobiography that Ms. Barnett “exudes the charm of New Orleans.”

Ms. Barnett worked behind the scenes attending to celebrities arranging dinners and seeing to every detail. For example she knew that Marlene Dietrich preferred yellow and white flowers in her hotel room and Dom Perignon. “A hotel is a paradise of stories” Ms. Barnett told an interviewer.

Ms. Barnett would know a good story because she began her career writing them. A New Orleans native she went to work at the New Orleans Item in 1944. During a five-week apprenticeship under editor Clayton Fritchey she clipped and filed newspaper obituaries in the Item’s “morgue.”

She went on to become a news reporter on the city desk and then feature and sports writer in 1951. She interviewed baseball legends Joe DiMaggio and Leo Durocher and Italian professional wrestler fighter Primo Carnera.

She also covered horse races basketball boxing matches and football games at Tulane Stadium where she recalled she had to sit directly beneath the press box since no women were permitted inside. She said the isolation from the other writers allowed her to soak in all the elements of the game from the stands.

She penned a tennis column called “Drop Shots” and later became a golf columnist one of a handful of women golf writers in the country at the time.

After the Royal Orleans Ms. Barnett had stints at the Royal Sonesta Hotel Iberville (now Westin Canal Place) and a dozen years at the Hilton New Orleans Riverside where she was inducted into the hotel's Walk of Fame honoring prominent citizens of New Orleans.

In addition to her work in sports and public relations Ms. Barnett also dabbled in radio. She was the first classical music disc jockey for radio station WTIX. Her show was initially called “Waxing Eloquent” but she changed it to “Afternoon Symphony.” That also led to a job in public relations as the publicist for the New Orleans Philharmonic Symphony from 1954 to 1960. It became her first public relations gig. She was dubbed the “Typewriter Timpanist.”

A 1976 New Orleans Magazine profile summarized Ms. Barnett’s approach to public relations: “One senses about Marilyn that there is a certain order to the world ways that things should be done and said ways to hold a tennis racket and select wine.""

""There is a perceptiveness about her"" the magazine wrote ""that borders on vigilance when it comes to hotel affairs: too much cassis; a waiter chewing food on duty a screw protruding from the carpet near the escalator; a drooping centerpiece; a businessman wearing a short-sleeved shirt with a pin-striped suit. She misses very little. In Marilyn’s realm things are comme il faut (as it should be.)”

In her private life Ms. Barnett was an accomplished amateur tennis player who covered the Eastern Tennis Circuit for the States-Item at the same time. She won 13 titles including city singles champion in 1944. She was ranked number 10 in women’s doubles in the South. Barnett was still taking home trophies in 1980 at the age of 57. She won so many over her lifetime that she donated dozens of trophies to the Salvation Army so the awards could be re-engraved for others.

“As a tennis player Marilyn isn’t one of those girls who you occasionally see in the periodicals daintily holding a racket with her demitasse finger. She’s dainty enough but along with this she’s authentic” a sports magazine wrote in 1960.

Nick Taylor as he did on his previous 125 shots through two rounds at the Sony Open hit his 126th from his natural right-handed swing.

Thanks to his left-handed one.

On the 503-yard par-5 9th at Waialae Country Club on Friday Taylor hit his drive left and off the tall netting that separates the driving range from the hole and his ball dropped inches outside of out-of-bounds fence posts below. Taylor could not swing righty due to the fence. Taylor after talking with a rules official could not swing lefty either due to the net.

Taylor wisely was applying the rule for temporary immovable obstructions which says:

“The additional relief provided by this Local Rule includes the ability for a player to take relief when the TIO is located on the straight line between his or her ball and the hole (known as “line of sight relief”) by moving sideways keeping the same distance from the hole so that the TIO is no longer between the player’s ball and the hole (also known as moving along the “equidistant arc”).

“When a player takes relief from a TIO whether under this Local Rule or the relief procedures in Rule 16 the player is guaranteed complete relief from physical interference.”

Taylor took a drop to the right and hit his second shot — right-handed — to within about 50 feet of the hole. From there he pitched to about 3 feet and rolled in the birdie putt and after two rounds Taylor led by two.

“So the lower part of the fence the chain-link fence is the actual boundary that defines the out of bounds that separates the 9th hole from the driving range” analyst Justin Leonard said on the Golf Channel broadcast. “The netting above the chain-link fence the protective netting is a temporary immovable obstruction. I wasn’t sure he was going to get relief here because he really didn’t have a swing due to the chain-link fence but he’s going to give it to him because it’s between his ball and the 9th green so that’s what he’s getting relief from.

“I think what he was saying was he would have played it left-handed and if he did that that T.I.O. would have been in his line to the target” added analyst Mark Rolfing.

Taylor after his round said he had “a hunch” he would get relief. Why’s that Nick?

“I had been there in the past and got a drop” he said. “I called an official just to double-check. It was a fortunate break to get that job. Easily could have probably gone under the fence but to bounce off and get a drop was a break and it was nice to take advantage of it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGw0c2hvb3RlcnMuY29tL2VuL3Nob290aW5nL2FjY2Vzc29yaWVzL3NhZmFyaWxhbmQtMDE1LW9wZW4tdG9wLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWhvbHN0ZXItaXBzYy1keW5hbWljLXNwb3J0LWRpc2NpcGxpbmVzLWZlYXR1cmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For IPSC and other dynamic disciplines: Safariland 015 Open Top Competition Holster | all4shooters,"Safariland – lots of expertise: how the 015 Open Top Competition works

Optionally the 015 Open Top Competition from Safariland is also available with a muzzle adaptor.

The holstered gun is held in place with a rotating lock that secures the handgun into the trigger block to ensure maximum carry safety. The lock is deactivated during the natural grip motion without loss of time to complete the drawing process cleanly. Safariland's typical well thought-out holster-magazine pouch-belt complete system with male and female adapter plates allows the components to be separated while maintaining the user's set equipment position. In addition Safariland is known for keeping gear in place bombproof in the heat of competition stress. An optional muzzle adaptor adjustable to barrel lengths from 4"" to 7.5"" is also available to extend the holster and add even more stability. The 015 Open Top competition holster is designed to fit competition belts with widths of 1.5"" and 1.75"" and is primarily designed for typical IPSC 2011 pistols in the Open and Standard Divisions. Thanks to the holster design these ""Custom Guns"" can be equipped with thumb rests compensators and other gimmicks without this limiting the carrying comfort or the quick first shot readiness.

However it is of course available for other gun models to choose from. The 015 Open Top competition holster is available in black red or blue and costs 223 USD (about 183 euro) in the USA (323 USD – about 273 euro – with 015A Muzzle Adaptor).

However hiring specialists to bring in more diverse talent is only one step in the move toward a sustained approach to hiring developing and promoting diverse talent.

Women and men of color comprised only 10% and 18% of senior-level positions respectively in U.S. organizations.

The events of 2020 have amplified the importance of diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) within business and talent strategies as protests against racial injustice followed the dual economic and health crises presented by COVID-19 — effects felt disproportionately by underrepresented groups.

Diversity and equity opportunities aren’t new. As of late 2019 Gartner TalentNeuron data showed that women and men of color comprised only 10% and 18% of senior-level positions respectively in U.S. organizations.

Organizations can now take into consideration future location strategy and go beyond proximate labor markets.

The challenge for hiring managers is how to hone the searches in their talent acquisition process. Data can help with that. Data can show for example that popular locations replete with talent aren’t always optimal locations that offer stronger representation of females and ethnic underrepresented talent.

Alex Ovechkin was scoreless inconceivably after two games to start this season. That simply could not be allowed to stand any longer.

Before the first period of Sunday’s Caps-Pens game was over Ovechkin remedied the problem with an assist from Kuznetsov and Wilson.

Video

While the Penguins regrouped “Two-way” Tom Wilson attacked the puck in the offensive zone forcing a turnover. Wilson quickly fed to Kuznetsov who left the puck in the crease for Ovechkin to pick up besting Penguins goalie Casey DeSmith.

With his trademark demented smile Ovechkin welcomed his linemates for a group hug. My advanced lip-reading skills tell me he’s saying “come on baby!”

That’s one goal on the season and 707 all-time. Ovechkin is now one goal behind Mike Gartner. (Though in a just world he’d be 100 goals further ahead.)

The id Tech 7 engine delivers exceptionally high-quality visuals at a smooth 60 frames per second across the full range of PlayStation and Xbox consoles. We witnessed a boost in texture quality geometry density and world scale. It's a game that really demonstrates the full potential of these machines while laying the technological foundation for the next generation. In theory this should make a potential Switch conversion of the game even more challenging than prior Panic Button ports of id Tech titles and yet there's a good argument here in saying that this the talented developer's most impressive work yet.

Of course by any virtually any measurable criteria - bar power consumption of course! - the Switch rendition of Doom Eternal is the least preferable way to play the game. In fact it calls to mind classic conversions like Quake for Sega Saturn. It was by far the least impressive version yet the technological achievement in actually making it happen was simply immense. By extension I can praise Panic Button's work here while knowing full well that it is best played on other systems. That's the key here - one can find such a port impressive and interesting while still acknowledging its shortcomings.

From my perspective the focus of a port like this should always centre around recreating key aspects of the game in question while making intelligent cuts. Even with a reduction in visual quality the game should retain its visual identity while offering performance characteristics that avoid spoiling the fun. If your port exhibits painfully long loading times poor performance and a huge reduction of visual quality it's not a good conversion. With its prior id Tech ports I feel that Panic Button delivered good work in achieving these objects. Doom 2016 and the various Wolfenstein titles all very clearly deliver the gameplay and visual signature of the original versions albeit at a lower resolution and frame-rate. However each port exhibited flaws including bad frame pacing and slowdown.

With Doom Eternal standing as the more technically ambitious game then I was pleasantly surprised with how it fares in comparison. The average resolution for instance is comparable to Doom 2016 but generally retains a higher pixel count than the most ambitious Wolfenstein: The New Colossus. In docked mode Doom Eternal maxes out at 720p - just like those other titles - but can dip just under 540p when taxed. In comparison Wolfenstein: The New Colossus dropped as low as 360p when docked so this is an improvement. In portable mode 360p is a possibility while 612p is the maximum pixel count.

In 2021 these low pixel counts are starting to feel somewhat incompatible with modern displays especially on a 4K TV which must surely be the major challenge the so-called Switch Pro is looking to address but the presentation holds up more on the handheld screen despite the big cuts in pixel count. And it is Doom Eternal. As I stacked up various scenes between Switch and Xbox One X I found that the port captured the look of the original: overall scene complexity lighting and effects are mostly intact. Yes it's blurry as a result of the lower rendering resolution but it's unmistakably Doom Eternal.

This comes back to the concept of intelligent cuts. Panic Button needed to find a way to replicate the look of the original game within the constraints of the platform. It's this need for such creative changes that I find most engaging. So what has changed? Well aside from the resolution the most significant departure lies in the textures. Basically with id Tech 7 id left behind the remnants of Megatexture embracing more tried and true methods. This allows for greater high-frequency detail at close proximity - it's the reason why textures are so much sharper in Doom Eternal compared to Doom 2016.The downside is that the Switch just doesn't have the memory to support this approach without sacrificing asset quality and that's precisely what has happened here. Texture resolution is reduced throughout leading to less nuanced surfaces with more visible bilinear blur. Level of detail transitions are also more aggressive in spots and the volumetrics - as usual - are of a lower precision.

Another loss from my perspective is the complete elimination of per-object motion blur and other post-processing effects such as depth of field. This is perhaps the most significant cut as these elements not only help offset the reduced frame-rate but play a key role in defining the look of Doom Eternal. Without these effects which were present in previous Panic Button conversions the game winds up looking somewhat less impressive in motion.

Despite all this the density and complexity of the maps themselves has been retained. Considering the sheer volume of geometry on display and the size of the map data this is a remarkable achievement. It also ensures that the entirety of the game is intact. Animation quality is also retained as are the alembic animations used in certain areas. However sometimes the graphical compromises do cut deep - at various points Doom Eternal swings between impressive and noticeably less attractive depending on where you point your camera.

That said the notion of getting a cutting edge game running on the Switch at all is still an achievement that's difficult to fully grasp and I feel that the team made the right calls in most places. The reduction in texture quality is a given but I appreciate that map complexity is intact. The Doom Eternal aesthetic has been achieved by and large. It is visually superior to the prior Wolfenstein ports overall I might argue. The sacrifices made are less distracting and it more closely matches the original console release. Really the only major critique that I really found difficult to adjust to was the elimination of post-processing effects. With motion blur restored at the very least the quality of the visuals would benefit tremendously. Of course this has its own fixed cost so I can understand the decision to eliminate it - especially when performance is so solid.

As a reminder Doom 2016 on Switch exhibited minor dips and significant frame pacing errors that robbed the game of fluidity while Wolfenstein 2 suffered from serious drops in performance during the game's larger battles. Miraculously Doom Eternal outperforms all prior id Tech ports to Switch. The target frame-rate is of course reduced to 30 frames per second as expected for the hardware but unlike prior releases Doom Eternal maintains this frame-rate most of the time. I played through around 50 per cent of the entire game content and found only one area with any noticeable drops to the target frame-rate - which is a huge improvement over prior ports. Mobile mode isn't quite as solid overall but still holds up really well - the main compromise being letterboxed locked 20fps cutscenes. Regardless getting Doom Eternal to work at all is a minor miracle and to see it play out on a handheld with a ridiculously low power budget is truly remarkable.

So what's the takeaway here? Well it's an interesting situation. When we discuss Switch ports inevitably there is a group of people that don't fully understand the conclusions drawn and why wer're impressed by what is a palpably compromised effect - but it's really quite simple. The Switch simply isn't comparable to last-generation consoles in terms of performance due to its portable nature. When judging ports to any platform the difference between the original and target platforms must be defined - and that's why I believe Doom Eternal on Switch is a generally excellent conversion. Is it the best current-gen port yet? Well the work carried out on The Witcher 3 is certainly up there but this is definitely a phenomenal translation of what is one of the most technologically advanced engines on the market.

Not only that it's clearly some of the finest work Panic Button has done yet. It exhibits many of the same sacrifices as its prior ports but offers a considerably smoother overall frame-rate while improving resolution over the Wolfenstein titles. The fact that it delivers a near locked 30 frames per second experience versus the unstable results of the prior games is a huge achievement especially when you factor in how much more challenging Doom Eternal is to convert across in the first place. Ultimately this is Doom Eternal... and now it's available to play on a handheld.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL3R2L3VzdHYvYTM1MjM1MzcyL3d3ZS13cmVzdGxlbWFuaWEtMzctZGF0ZS1mdXR1cmUtbG9jYXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE announces new date for WrestleMania 37 and future locations,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a35235372/wwe-wrestlemania-37-date-future-locations/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL3R2L3VzdHYvYTM1MjM1MzcyL3d3ZS13cmVzdGxlbWFuaWEtMzctZGF0ZS1mdXR1cmUtbG9jYXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvMTYwMTkzONIBJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvYW1wLzE2MDE5Mzg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Preferred by youngsters digital banking gains momentum,"KARACHI: In Pakistan around 82 per cent of bank consumers visit their branches once every few months after opening accounts while 73 per cent customers are inclined towards using digital banking channels to meet their financial needs and obligations a survey released recently said.

PwC in partnership with A.F. Furguson & Co in its survey tilted ‘Banking in the digital age: exploring Pakistan’s potential’ gathered perspective of 1000 plus individuals with diverse age demographics income brackets employment/business backgrounds across different geographies to analyse how they like to interact with their banks use branches or alternate channels and how receptive they are to new age banking.

The survey found growing usage of alternate channels. 84pc respondents said they preferred to use ATMs 67pc mobile banking 55pc internet banking and just 17pc use phone banking.

It was revealed that 86pc individuals use mobile banking for fund transfer and 85pc for account balances. 75pc used this medium for bill payments and only 17pc for location-based discount.

Survey finds millennials and Gen Z are the most sensitive regarding ‘time to serve’

The age group breakup revealed that 76pc individuals in their 30-39 years use internet banking and 57pc internet banking while 81pc and 64pc individuals in 40-49 years used it respectively.

Millennials and Gen Z were the most sensitive regarding ‘time to serve’.

Over 70pc respondents of the survey in the age bracket of 20-49 years said they have downloaded their mobile banking apps and 75pc of them said they use it either daily or twice a week.

Around 84pc individuals in the same age bracket either visit the branch once in a few months or only visited once to open their accounts. Of them 95pc go for dispute resolution followed by 79pc for depositing cash 76pc for cheque deposit 72pc for bill payment 64pc for cash withdrawal and 84pc for fund transfer.

However there were many concerns highlighted by the survey as 66pc respondent blamed the ‘time to serve’ as the main factor that discouraged them to visit their branches followed by 20pc complained non-facilitative staff and 17pc found employees not knowledgeable and only 11pc pointed finger to ambience.

It was also found out that 74pc preferred online marketplaces 54pc brands’ online websites and 17pc social media platforms for online purchase of goods and services.

The survey results also found a higher tendency of payments through cards — debit and credit. Around 90pc respondents said they would like to use cards. However 34pc said they make payments 4-6 times in a week while 24pc at least once in a week.

Switching their primary bank to digital channels the 57pc survey respondents cited customer care 35pc service agility 38pc attractive mobile banking proposition 39pc value added product features 44pc international acceptance 37pc rewards and 35pc cited security as key factors.

Veronika Koziel’s (ILR '19) education at the Scheinman Institute and ILR helped to develop her interest in collective bargaining conflict resolution global labor supply chains and HR. Her current position in HR in a People Analytics role at General Dynamics NASSCO has allowed her to be on the frontlines for critical employee negotiations.

What activities did you participate in at the Scheinman Institute?

I was very much involved with the Scheinman Institute during my time as an undergrad. I actually remember when the Scheinman Conflict Resolution Club was first founded when I was an undergrad and I was very excited to join as when the club was first getting started. I was a leader in supporting the international and comparative labor and alternative dispute resolution (ADR) initiatives as well as helping students connect with professors interested in the field and find international opportunities through the ILR School. During my time there I was also a research assistant working with Richard Fincher the ILR Neutral-In-Residence for the Scheinman Institute’s Asian Labor Arbitration Project where I investigated reform trends in labor and employment law and ADR in China. Additionally first as a student and then as the teaching assistant for the ILR Global Exchange Engaged Learning Program in Vietnam I conducted research focusing on the intersections of conflict resolution collective bargaining and corporate social responsibility on living wages and minimum wage setting in Vietnam.

How did your education at the Scheinman Institute and ILR influence your current professional interests?

After graduating from the ILR School in 2019 I became an interdepartmental resource for the Labor Relations and HR Project Management teams at General Dynamics NASSCO where I have supported grievance handlings investigations and assisted with gathering and reporting HR data and metrics required on labor providers attrition competitors and wage data. I was able to leverage my experience in both labor relations collective bargaining and ADR from my time at ILR as well as my strong desire to delve into the economics and data realm to land a position as the youngest member of the chief negotiating team with the 7 bargaining units in the company’s shipyard. In addition to understanding the potential positions that the union would propose our team had to restructure our strategy and parameters due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately our team was able to successfully conclude negotiations and bargain in good faith to ratify contracts with the two unions in our shipyard in about one month.

The Albanese Government announced 10 December 2023 that Hanwha Defense Australia (HDA) has been downselected as the preferred tenderer for the multibillion dollar Land 400 Phase 3 Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) program with the Redback IFV with final Government Approval to be sought at the conclusion of contract negotiations. This was Armys largest ever acquisition program to date and HDA was looking forward to delivering the Redback IFV to the Australian Army. The program covers 129 vehicles across two variants and will be delivered under an accelerated schedule in line with the Defence Strategic Review.

Redback spiders (Latrodectus hasselti) belong to the Family Theridiidae which is found worldwide. The notorious Black Widow Spider (Latrodectus sp) of the United States is a close relative of the Redback Spider and only differs in appearance by the absence of a red dorsal stripe. Female Redback Spiders are black (occasionally brownish) with an obvious orange to red longitudinal stripe on the upper abdomen with the red stripe sometimes being broken and an ""hourglass"" shaped red/orange spot on the underside of the abdomen.

Redback Spiders are found Australia-wide and will live almost anywhere They are capable of capturing quite large animals such as male trapdoor spiders king crickets and small lizards if they become entangled in the web. Spiderlings are cannibalistic and will eat unhatched eggs and other spiderlings. The spiderlings disperse by ballooning to another suitable nest site on long silk threads that are caught by air currents. Only the female bite is dangerous. They can cause serious illness and have caused deaths.

Equipped with advanced situational awareness systems normally found on jet fighters  the Redback IFV rides on rubber tracks that reduce noise and vibration while offering superior ride quality for its crew and the soldiers it protects. The vehicle boasts an advanced layered protection system including Elbits active protection system Plasans world class armour and a structure designed to protect occupants from the effects of blast. Using Australian steel from Bisalloy the vehicle allows soldiers to fight at every step on the battlefield. All this is supported by an independent suspension system which does not use torsion bars thus supplying more space for innovative blast mitigation systems.

Redbacks main armament is a Mk44S Bushmaster II 30mm cannon from Northrop Grumman capable of firing all natures of 30mm x 173mm ammunition in service with 19 nations including the US the UK and other allies. The Redback is also armed with a 7.62mm co-axially mounted machine gun and a remote weapons station that can be fitted with a range of weapons including 7.62mm machine gun .50 calibre machine and an automatic grenade launcher. The Redback is a highly advanced infantry fighting vehicle and is one of the safest and most lethal platform soldiers can use Mr Cho said. The Iron Vision system that allows the Redbacks crew to effectively look through the hull of the vehicle as though it isnt there is an absolute game changer when it comes to operating heavy armoured vehicles in close company with dismounted troops.

We are excited for the next phase of this program that will see HDA and Australian industry deliver a world class IFV to the Australian Army Mr Richard Cho Managing Director of HDA said. I would like to thank our industry partners who supported us through the Risk Mitigation Activity during the challenging times that COVID presented to us and since then as we prepared our winning response to the Commonwealth.

The selection of the Redback for the Australian Army is an exciting milestone not just for soldiers who will have an IFV that was specifically designed and built for them as it also cements the closer ties between Australia and the Republic of Korea. HDA will work with the Commonwealth to finalise the contract suite and deliver the optimum outcome for the Australian Army.

Hanwhas selection as preferred tenderer for the Land 400 Phase 3 project has major implications for Korea-Australia defence and economic cooperation Mr Son Jaeil President and CEO of Hanwha Aerospace parent company of HDA said. Production of the worlds first fifth generation IFV is a game changer for Australian Defence capability. Were looking forward to being a true partner to Australia for this program alongside LAND 8116 Phase 1.

Hanwha Defense Australia is a subsidiary of Hanwha Aerospace a division of the vast Republic of Korea Fortune 500 conglomerate Hanwha Corporation. Hanwha Corporation has been operating in Australia since 2005 in areas including mining equipment logistics and sustainable energy. Headquartered in Melbourne Hanwha Defense Australia was established in 2019 with an initial focus on Land Systems. The company signed a contract with the Commonwealth of Australia to supply self-propelled artillery systems under LAND 8116 a $0.9 billion to $1.3 billion project. These vehicles will be manufactured in the Greater Geelong area of Victoria at the HDA Armoured vehicle Centre of Excellence (H-ACE) now under construction.

The Redback IFV will be manufactured at HDAs Armoured Vehicle Centre of Excellence the H-ACE currently being built next to the Avalon Airport in Geelong. This facility was being built for the Land 8116 Protected Mobile Fires Program to deliver the Huntsman AS9 self-propelled howitzer and AS10 armoured ammunition resupply vehicles and will expand to support Redback in Australia plus any future international programs.

The facility will expand to deliver a world leading capability to the ADF with these platforms. This will create hundreds of jobs not just for HDA but also the nationally based supply chain of Australian industry partners. These partners include Bisalloy in NSW Elphinstone in Tasmania Penske and Corvus in Victoria alongside many more. International partners such as Elbit Systems Plasan and Northrop Grumman are also key in delivering this game changing capability.

The armys infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) tender was due to be narrowed to a short list by mid-2019. The Land 400 Phase 3 contract could be for up to 450 close-combat troop-carrying armoured vehicles costing up to $15 billion to replace the M113 armoured personnel carriers. The government says the IFV contract will be the largest investment in [the] armys capability ever undertaken and requirements will range from peacekeeping to close combat.

the project will see Armys capability significantly enhanced with a fleet of up to 450 modern Infantry Fighting Vehicles and 17 Manoeuvre Support Vehicles. The Shortlist would be announced in third quarter of 2019 - a maximum of two solutions will be shortlisted. After evaluation a contract would be signed in 2022. As of 2018 the anticipated Initial Operating Capability was FY 202425 with a Final Operating Capability anticipated in 2030.

The LAND 400 Phase 3 Mounted Close Combat Capability Request For Tender (RFT) was released 05 September 2018 and would closed at 5.00pm AEST Friday 1 March 2019. LAND 400 will acquire and support the next generation of Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFV) with the firepower protection and mobility to defeat increasingly firepower and adaptive adversaries well into the future.

Land 400 Phase 3 seeks an Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) with high levels of protection mobility and lethality capable of lifting a standard infantry battalion section including six dismounts. A key discriminator will be the tactical manoeuvrability of the IFV. These are to be similar to the Australian M1 Main Battle Tank to enable combined arms manoeuvre along with operational and strategic mobility on ADF platforms.

Defences preference was for a tracked vehicle with a manned turret. The project will also provide specialist tracked Manoeuvre Support Vehicles to enable Army to undertake combat Support Vehicles to enable Army to undertake combat operations in a joint environment to overcome enemy constructed obstacles and to aid the construction of defensive fortifications.

LAND 400 will deliver enhanced levels of survivability to the Joint Land Force including sensors weapons and information systems which will be networked to strategic intelligence platforms. At its foundation the program will deliver replacements for the Australian Light Armoured Vehicle (ASLAV) and M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) fleets. The program will also provide specialist Manoeuvre Support Vehicles (MSV) to properly enable Armys combat brigades to undertake joint land combat.

LAND 400 has four discrete phases:

LAND 400 Phase 1  Project Definition Study (completed). LAND 400 Phase 2  Mounted Combat Reconnaissance Capability primarily enabled by the Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV) mission system (the ASLAV replacement). LAND 400 Phase 3  Mounted Close Combat Capability primarily enabled by the Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) (the M113 APC replacement) and MSV mission systems. LAND 400 Phase 4  Integrated Training System.

The Defence Industry Capability Plan (DICP) outlines Governments vision to build a robust resilient and internationally competitive Australian defence industry base that was better able to help meet defence capability requirements advance Australias economy and create and sustain Australian jobs. The DICP introduces an initial list of ten Sovereign Industrial Capability Priorities (SICP). A number have been identified for L400 Phase 3. The proposed Australian Industry Capability (AIC) Plan solution in response to L400 Phase 3 was a key consideration in evaluating the offers. The AIC plan was to be optimised to deliver VFM to the CoA.

Minister for Defence Industry Christopher Pyne encouraged Australian industry to get behind the project saying ""I actively encourage Australian small and medium sized enterprises to take advantage of the significant opportunities arising from this project.""

DE Lynx KF41 Rheinmetall IS Namer APC General Dynamics (GDLS) ROK AS21 Redback Hanwha UK AJAX General Dynamics (GDLS) UK CV90 BAE Systems

Confirmed competitors for the AU$1015 billion (US$7.411 billion) project comprise Rheinmetall Defences Lynx IFV General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) Ajax armoured fighting vehicle and the Hanwha Groups AS21 Redback IFV. Participation by BAE Systems CV90 combat vehicle was under consideration as was that of the Puma IFV produced by Rheinmetall Defence and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW).

BAE Systems Australia and Rheinmetall Defence Australia are among European-controlled companies expected to tender and US and Israeli tenders may still turn up. BAE Systems has a well-established manufacturing chain in Australia and Rheinmetall has an expanding Australia-wide chain based in Queensland. The German-owned company was seen as having an early advantage in the running partly because of the manufacturing commonality possible at its Brisbane hub being set up to assemble its Boxer combat reconnaissance vehicles a $5.2bn contract.

Rheinmetall launched its campaign to secure the $15 billion Land 400 Phase 3 program with the arrival of its new Lynx KF41 Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) in Adelaide ahead of the 2018 Land Forces Conference. The Lynx is a tracked protected IFV designed to meet the military requirements of Land 400 Phase 3 which is an IFV for close combat - to close in and defeat an enemy. Rheinmetall Defence Australia Managing Director Gary Stewart said the Lynx  which touched down at Adelaide Airport aboard an Antonov cargo carrier - had been designed to satisfy the demands of the Army for the next 30-40 years.

General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) has launched its AJAX-based armoured fighting vehicle as a contender for Land 400 Phase 3 at the Land Forces conference in Adelaide. In a statement GDLS said that AJAX which was developed tested and produced in the UK can be adapted to meet the Army's mounted close combat capability requirements including the Infantry Fighting Vehicle which will incorporate a GLDS 30mm turret. The AJAX vehicles have an open generic vehicle architecture and modular armour system.

Associated Press

NEW YORK — General Motors plans to spend $800 million to turn a Canadian SUV plant into one that will make electric delivery vans.

Work on the plant which is in Ingersoll Ontario will start immediately and take two years. The plant currently makes Chevrolet Equinox SUVs.

The electric delivery vans are part of GM's new venture BrightDrop which is building electric vehicles for delivery companies. The growth of online shopping has increased demand for electric vans as delivery companies look for cleaner vehicles to deliver packages.

BrightDrop's first customer is FedEx which will begin receiving GM's EV600 electric vans later this year.

The Group earmarked one billion Canadian dollars (just under $800 million) for the conversion.

BrightDrop GM’s new electric delivery vehicle outlet will have its new truck made there once they switch over the current Chevrolet Equinox production to the EV600s. The model is set for delivery in late-2021 and GM said they would start transforming the CAMI factory in Ingersoll immediately pending agreements with Canadian authorities.

The logistics-focussed BrightDrop brand had only been announced three days ago and GM says they will offer commercial customers “an ecosystem of connected and electrified products and services” that cover the first to last mile. The first model is the EP1 and set to hit the market in just a few weeks. This is not an electric delivery truck like the EV600 but an electric pallet truck.

This latest electrification effort also stands in a longer line. GM CEO Mary Barra in November called for an “all-out pursuit of global EV leadership” with Chevrolet leading the charge. By 2025 the US carmaker wants to have 30 electric models and intends to raise investment from 20 to 27 billion US dollars.

On-going plant conversions have been backing up the strategy. In October GM announced it would transform the Spring Hill plant in the US state of Tennessee into its third production facility for electric cars. GM workers will build electric cars and internal combustion engines initially in parallel. At the same time General Motors is turning two of its plants in Michigan into pure electric vehicle sites namely the Detroit-Hamtramck facility and the plant in Orion Township. In Detroit-Hamtramck the last internal combustion engine rolled off the assembly line in February 2020. The GMC Hummer EV and later the self-propelled electric car Cruise Origin are to be built at the Hamtramck plant starting this year.

Once GM completes the Ontario factory’s conversion it will become “Canada’s first large-scale electric delivery vehicles manufacturing plant” according to the announcement. GM Canada is also talking to the Ontario and federal governments regarding its new investments. They await ratification of “a tentative 2021 agreement” reached with Unifor and confirmation of government support.

Vittorini said that working at GM was a great opportunity for him and after that year he went on to work on other projects as a freelance designer for companies like Dreamworks and Universal Studios eventually landing himself his current job at AppliedEV.

Read: This Restomod Is A Corvette Disguised As A 1957 Chevrolet Nomad

His concept draws inspiration from Chevy’s Opala of the 1960s and 1970s which was a Brazilian-market vehicle that was available as a sedan coupe or a “Caravan” wagon. As for its name it was speculated to come from the stone opal or that it was a portmanteau of GM subsidiary Opel and the Chevy Impala. However GM claimed that this was not their intention as the name was chosen by a journalist as part of a competition simply because it sounded nice. The Opala had a successful run before it eventually went out of production in 1992.

Vittorini chose this car as his project since his father had owned two Opalas and he had “no words to express the passion.” He then decided that with all the extra time he had in this past rollercoaster of a year he would dig up his Opala homage and freshen it up. And freshen it up he did as he was able to create 3D versions of his Caravan concept and release it as his take on a modern Chevy wagon.

The design is clearly an estate but with muscular proportions much like the original Opala Caravan. It also features quad exhaust tips huge wheels and brakes as well as side fender vents to highlight its sporting intentions. Vittorini says his mission was to “bring the passion of a classic car to a modern concept​​​​​​​” and we think he did exactly that.

And it's something of a legend these days not just because of its pioneering ways but because of the way GM supposedly killed the electric car—there's a bit more to it than that—by recalling every EV1 and crushing them in 2003 when the multi-year experiment leasing the coupe to consumers ran its course.

But there are still some out there in the world that escaped the crusher. Outside a few museum pieces a handful were saved and given to universities as educational tools for engineering departments; we caused a bit of a stir when we tracked down a surprising EV1 survivor abandoned in an Atlanta parking garage in 2019 that slipped through that donation program. Predictably most of those college-educated EV1s got completely trashed or stripped for parts over the years. Now The Drive has learned of an absolutely pristine GM EV1—the nicest example left outside of a museum—that's hiding out in the depths of an unnamed university building under the watchful eye of an anonymous dedicated protector.

Anonymous

Still buried deep within a college campus in the US—afraid we can't be more specific than that—the time capsule EV1 is said to have been protected from marauding engineering students by a caretaker ""who cherishes the car deeply"" according to a source who gave us permission to publish these photos. The caretaker's devotion is clear; the thing is completely spotless inside and out. But as with other notable vehicles we've covered he's staying quiet.

What's clear is the EV1 is legitimately owned by the university so this isn't a case of someone sneaking one out the back door in the chaos of all the crushing. And unlike with Chrysler and the Dodge Viper GM hasn't made any attempts to take the cars back from schools except a few times where kids got the cars working again and drove them on public roads. As for why this one didn't get used for its intended educational purposes chalk it up to the caretaker.

Powered by a 137 horsepower electric motor drawing energy from a lead-acid or nickel-metal-hydride battery pack the experimental coupe had 142 miles of range decades ago. Just over a thousand units were built and leased to eager consumers for a few years but in the end GM pulled the plug for a number of reasons none of them great.

Our source added this one hasn't seen daylight in a decade which helps explain why the plastic body very '90s GM interior magnesium wheels and custom Michelin tires are all in great shape. It's not known whether the vehicle is still functional or how much work it would take to get it there.

Yes all of the EV1s were sent to the schools deactivated—important hardware such as the controller for the electric motor brakes power steering and other important functions were all removed. Some schools were reported to have reactivated theirs over the years however. And as you can see from the under-hood shot above things look to be completely intact.

Another thing suggesting this one is at least close to operational is the static ride height looks correct indicating that it wasn't gutted completely if at all. Of course important pieces could still have been removed or destroyed but we can't tell if any significant weight is missing.

And that's the whole story for now unfortunately. We know that there's a Smithsonian-quality EV1 still out there and that it's being maintained and protected by someone who cares deeply about both the car and their privacy. That'll have to be enough for now."

Apple senior executives are measured on key financial goals when it comes to being awarded among the market's most lucrative pay packages such as sales earnings and valuation growth. Now for the first time executives at the stock market's largest company are also going to have a portion of their millions in cash bonus pay linked directly to factors reflecting a fast-changing world of capitalism: environmental social and governance (ESG) metrics. In 2021 Apple is adding an ESG ""bonus modifier"" to its cash incentive program which can swing the total bonus payout by 10% — executing on ESG goals can increase the bonus by 10% while failing to hit ESG targets could cost Apple's top brass a bonus reduction of the same amount. The new executive compensation measure revealed in Apple 's recent 2021 proxy — shareholders have to approve executive compensation plans each year — comes after years of pressure from activist shareholders. In fact just last year Apple opposed a proxy measure filed by shareholder Zevin Asset Management — which received 12% support from the company's stockholders — that asked for executive compensation to be linked to ESG. Apple argued to shareholders there was no need to narrowly link pay to ESG since its corporate mission already included ESG goals foundationally. What changed in one year? A lot. For starters activist shareholders say it is common practice among corporations to resist any resolution introduced at annual meetings even in cases where the companies are moving in a similar direction — if at a slower pace — and when they are ready will do an about-face. ""The general posture with companies toward proposals is oppose in every instance"" said Pat Tomaino director of socially responsible investing at Zevin Asset Management which authored the ESG compensation proposal last year. The Apple shareholder said that this posture is even more likely to be the case when the issue is executive pay. ""Companies desire to have a free hand with executive compensation and we see it across the marketplace. The relationship between the compensation committee and the CEO is guarded very closely."" To its credit Tomaino said Apple reached out to him after his measure's defeat at the 2020 meeting and provided him with an indication that change was coming. He said throughout the process Apple was eager to understand what the shareholder was asking. ""I don't think of shareholder resolutions as adversarial. They wanted to understand what we wanted and i never doubted they were going in good faith to compensation consultants to study and understand whether it made sense. They could have chosen to do nothing.""

2020 accelerated corporate pressure

The past year was no ordinary year either. After a 2020 that included civil unrest in the U.S. the Black Lives matter movement and a pandemic that showed the financial fragility and health risks across many communities and workers there is more pressure on companies to focus on ESG themes such as diversity equity and inclusion and labor policy. ""For better or worse this year the world is a lot different than it was last proxy season"" said Jannice Koors senior managing director at Pearl Meyer an executive compensation consultant. ""Diversity equity and inclusion is taking up a lot more bandwidth in boardrooms."" Apple declined to comment to CNBC beyond citing the proxy language. ""It will enter into the discussion more"" said Courtney Yu head of research for executive compensation consulting firm Equilar. ""What happened over the course of the past year and summer has helped supercharge lots of these processes and put direct focus on how companies are looking at diversity ... and just their contribution to society in general."" An analysis by JUST Capital which ranks corporations on ESG (Apple is No. 3 overall behind tech peers Microsoft and Nvidia ) found that in recent years among the Russell 1000 universe of companies about 20% have linked executive pay to ESG goals. That is consistent with other surveys showing between 10% and 20% of companies have some executive pay tied to ESG key performance indicators. Most are of the magnitude of the new Apple 10% swing factor in bonus pay according to a Pearl Meyer survey from last summer. Roughly 25% of the firms that said they have an ESG pay component indicated it was less than 5%; 67% indicated it was 5% to 10%.

Old ESG versus emerging ESG

Executive compensation and ESG experts say the data on companies that have incorporated ESG into pay can be misleading though and overstate the trend's influence when the details are not considered. A significant percentage of the existing ESG compensation plans are in industries where they have been mandated for a long time due to safety concerns such as in oil drilling mining and other industrial operations where the risk of an accident is an immediate material and legal risk to the company. Or as Koors put it ""Old ESG versus emerging ESG. Emerging ESG is different."" If 15% of S&P 500 companies have incentive plans with an ESG component that includes many with the ""old"" ESG according to Gregg Passin senior partner and Mercer's U.S. executive solutions Leader. ""It will be much bigger this year and in future years"" he said. A small number of companies included diversity equity and inclusion as a metric in prior years. ""We expect many more this year"" he added. The majority of companies that have an ESG pay metric use a bonus modifier like Apple. It allows companies to still rely on core financial metrics such as sales and profit as the most influential payout measures while bringing in newer metrics — which also may be harder to measure — on the edges. ""Is it enough? Ten percent of a bonus doesn't strike me as being a massive swing factor"" said Martin Whittaker CEO of JUST Capital. Apple's top executives received bonuses in 2020 that were 179% of the target payout opportunity according to its proxy. ""It's laudable it is in there at all and it puts Apple in a minority. That's leadership. ... If we only have 20% of companies tying compensation to ESG that tells you there is lots of room for intelligent incentive packages that will drive performance even better"" Whittaker said. Using a modifier takes the pressure off in the goal-setting process and reflects the imprecision that still exists in ESG. ""Companies can't just dive into the deep end of the pool right off the bat"" Koors said (her firm does not work with Apple specifically). ""The question for them is 'How do we start to introduce these measures in a way where we don't end up regretting it. You don't necessarily want to be the first one out. You can tell the pioneers by the ones that have arrows in their backs. But lots want to be a fast follower."" Pearl Meyer expects more companies will be adopting ESG metrics in incentive plans — in its summer survey the number of companies that said they were looking at adding an ESG pay metric this year (9%) more than doubled over those that said they already had one (6%). ""Given the data we've seen this is still the early adopter phase"" Koors said.

Sometimes getting started is the hardest thing. We expect to see a lot more shareholder pressure on executive compensation. Martin Whittaker JUST Capital CEO

Which ESG metrics and how many to incorporate remains a challenging question. ""That everything is important should be signalled but on the flip side if everything is important than nothing is important"" Koors said. Mercer's Passin recommends no more than a handful of executive compensation metrics in total and only one or two tied to ESG though companies can have multiple factors considered within each category. ""What are we measuring? That's the bigger problem"" says Whittaker. Climate is an area in which metrics are maturing such as reductions in carbon emissions across multiple well-defined scopes of emissions types. But not all ESG metrics are as easy to define. ""The issue is there has been no generally accepted standard set of ESG metrics"" Whittaker said. In the Equilar 500 roughly 20% of the companies tie compensation to some kind of diversity metric ""and even there it is very broad"" Yu said. There are quantitative measurements for gender pay gap or ethnic pay gap analysis but there is no ""monolithic approach"" says Koors. The issues should not deter companies from thinking about senior executive incentive plans though because they drive behavior and performance throughout an organization. ""You need everyone in the boat all rowing in the same direction and the more companies that make a plan like this it can cascade down through the entire management.""

""It's typically the first step companies take the bonus modifier"" Tomaino said. ""Companies typically do not reorient a whole portion of equity incentive around ESG but take an existing part of the cash bonus plan."" Even in taking its first step Tomaino said Apple has done more than other companies that insert basic language into a proxy saying it is at the discretion of the company's compensation committee to set targets for pay and that could include ESG performance. Apple's move is better than a blanket statement but ""it gives them a ton of wiggle room"" Whittaker said. ""Sometimes getting started is the hardest thing. We expect to see a lot more shareholder pressure on executive compensation."" More shareholder measures are coming soon and targeting Apple peers among the market's dominant tech firms. Tomaino said Zevin Asset Management will again introduce a measure at Alphabet for this year's meeting. ""Impact investors can now point to Apple and I think it is a powerful example"" Tomaino said. ""Our argument is there is no better way to send a signal that it is mission critical than putting a portion of executive compensation at risk. I wouldn't say Apple went from zero to 60. Apple went from zero to 30."" Microsoft  Intel and IBM already have a compensation plan in place that accomplishes something similar to Apple's new incentive. An Alphabet spokeswoman told CNBC in an email that in ""assessing the individual performance of our executive officers the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee considers their performance against a number of strategic goals including those related to sustainability and diversity."" Tomaino described Alphabet 's approach to similar resolutions introduced over the past three years as ""less transparent"" than Apple. ""It is harder to tell if they are considering a change and their contention to us is that within each executive performance review there are certain basic sustainability issues on the table. Our contention is we want ESG aimed at senior officers and need more on what the mechanism is. And we have not been able to understand it over the past three years"" Tomaino said.

What we will find out about Apple in 2022

For Apple the proof that the ESG metric matters won't come until next year. That is because companies do not actually detail their compensation awards and how they arrived at those awards until the following year's proxy. ""We have to wait and see how serious they are about using this tool now that they have it"" Tomaino said. Investors will be looking at the discussion in next year's compensation section of the Apple proxy and how executive payouts moved up or down in respect to ESG. ""That's what we get with any other financial and we are already pushing on Apple to outline what investors would want to see."" ""No one telegraphs this in advance"" Koors said. Apple has increased transparency on climate and raw materials relative to conservation and investors want to see that metric-approach in supply chain risks and with diversity and inclusion. As examples that can include recruiting at historically Black colleges and universities and employee participation in affinity groups. ""The labor issues in their supply chain are a big issue as is progress on diversity in engineering"" Tomaino said. ""Tim Cook has described these issues as mission critical and ESG is financially relevant right now and into the long term. It is time for Apple to put their money where their mouth is ... a warts and all analysis. My message is consistent to companies: as an investor I don't want to substitute my judgment for their own or micromanage. They tell me which are the most relevant factors for them and how to get there.""

the standard of living through this pay ment mode may increase the y early purcha se of products through

buy now-pay later mechanism b y 23005 units (ta ka). This is because throu gh this mechanism

consumers may buy their required goods in times of cash crisis and fulfill their demand. As a result the

consumers often reveal impulse purchase decision when they have the scope to make the payment at a

later date. On top of that this payment mechanism often induces consumers to increase their propensity

to consume and spend more on luxury goods. The other variables under this study were found to be

statistically insignificant.

8. Conclusion

At present buy now-pay later mechanism is a much practic ed mode of payment. This study investigates

the factors influencing consumers to use buy now- pay later mod e of payment estimating multiple

regression function. It aims to find whether this mechanism has a role in intensifying the degree of

impulsive buying among consumers and increasing their standard of living.

The findings of this study reveal that most of the respondents received benefits from the buy now-pay

later mechanism. It is also found that the users of the system were educated which is logical – only

people with education can use a rather complicated system of transaction using credit card. In terms of

decision-making an educated person can exhibit greater efficiency (Hilton et al. 2016). So they g o for

a credit card in order to reduce the risk of ca rrying cash and making a purc hase-decision when required

and overc ome cash crisis. Besides they can purchase through installments to meet their demands. Thus

government policies to increase literacy rate support higher education and establish subsi dized

educational institutions with qualit y education can create awareness amo ng the consumers re garding

how to maximize their utility with limited budget using dif ferent payment tools. The stud y suggests

giving emphasis on efforts to increase financial literacy and banking habit of the people.

The study a lso reveals that majority of the respondents had re latively high income. Poor people usually

spend their entire income to buy basic necessities of life. So the poor peopl e with low incomes cannot

afford credit card facility. The policy implication is that measures should be taken to increa se people’s

income so that they can derive benefit of transactions through buy now- pay later mechanism.

The study findings suggest that buy now-pay later mechanism resulting in impulsive purchase decision

may have a negative impact on the future spending on necessities due to excess current spendin g o n

some unnecessary goods. Besides the burden of installment payment can hinder the accumulation of

personal savings. In the long run these negative impacts can be mitigated with rational policies for

appropriate structure and regulation of buy now-pay later sales mechanism.

There is an overwhelming need for bringing a chang e in the buy now-pay later mechanism for moving

towards a much better outcome for the consumers. Curre ncy outside banks is re ally high in Bangladesh

in dicative of poor banking ha bit of the citizens of this country . A more de veloped banking and financial

system minimization of inter-bank variation in condition of lending backed by adequate infrastructure

trained workforce 24 hour customer care service increased availability and accessibility of information

and development of credit card guidelines can benefit the customers. Moreover at the time of

installment sale both sellers and credit card issuers should provide the consumers with proper

information regarding payment mode and period and the rate of interest. If shops and sales outlets keep

option for making purchase via credit cards and relevant payment mechanisms offering buy now-pay

From 16 February the cost of making a PAYG call will rise to 10p a minute – up from 3p. The cost of sending a text in the UK will jump from 2p to 10p while the price of using data anywhere rises from 1p to 5p a MB.

While these new prices will apply to calls made in the UK and on Three’s Go Roam service in European countries the biggest increase will hit those who take their phone outside the continent where the cost of sending a text will rise from 2p to 35p.

Three says its new rates “remain extremely competitive” and the increases to international roaming rates are to keep prices in line with its new standard rates for using your phone at home and are not linked to Brexit.

The February increases only affect Three’s PAYG customers who joined the network before March 2020 rather than those on a package/contract.

The fear is that this could be the first of many price rises this year across the industry. Telecoms providers have reported a big loss of revenue over the past 10 months as profitable roaming charges have all but dried up.

A Three spokesperson said: “Our new rates remain extremely competitive in the market and our customers have access to 5G at no extra cost. Plus we continue to focus on improving the customer experience through investment in our network to deliver better connectivity every day for every customer.”

Dan Howdle a telecoms analyst at Cable.co.uk said the price rises while hefty would bring Three’s PAYG prices closer to its competitors such as Vodafone and EE.

The government launched its new 1GX (One Government eXperience) payroll system in December. It is described as a “new suite of online business application” that is a “modern solution [that] supports many functions across government.”

However on Saturday the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees said that it believes the new system was launched for payroll before it was ready and has left as many as 5000 workers owed money.

“Our members are angry and rightly so” said Susan Slade the vice-president of AUPE. “This system was introduced before it was ready and there was inadequate training for workers or managers.

“It is clearly incapable of handling the complexity of a large complex workforce with members working a vast variety of different jobs and different shifts.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""It is clearly incapable of handling the complexity of a large complex workforce with members working a vast variety of different jobs and different shifts.""

“We understand the concerns that staff have on this we are resolving those concerns as soon as possible and are confident that the issues experienced will not be a long-term concern.”

On Sunday Service Alberta followed up with Global News and said that it had received 531 official reports of payroll issues.

However AUPE said Sunday it believed the problem is “widespread.”

“We are hearing from lots of members that have been affected by the payroll problems since the Government of Alberta introduced the 1GX system. We don’t have exact numbers yet but we know the problem is large” said an emailed statement Sunday from Slade.

AUPE says that it has concerns because of the issues the federal government had with its Phoenix pay system. That system has been plagued with problems since its launch and led to some employees receiving no payments for months while others were overpaid.

The union added that it is working with the government to resolve the issues but believes the “unacceptable” situation could have been avoided.

And she’s looking ahead as never before making her first five-year plan. “There’s less autopilot in a sense” she says. “This is an opportunity to really kind of reevaluate a lot of things that I would have started doing without thinking about them.” Almost despite herself she is sensing possibility in the very uncertainty that she dreads.

It already had been an unsettling year for Lexi Walker when the pandemic broke. A creature of routine — “If I don’t have certainty I’m going to freak out” she says — she had nonetheless in mid-2019 traded in a law career in Virginia for a new job as a fiduciary or court-appointed assets manager in her hometown of Taylors S.C. Then her father passed away and no sooner had she buried him than pandemic life became a constant series of “What’s next?” “There’s so much uncertainty now and there’s no escaping it” she says. “Your life could change fundamentally tomorrow — you have no idea. It’s easy to get caught up in it.”

Humans are naturally ill at ease with not knowing. We evolved to seek answers for survival’s sake. Cognition is the pursuit of resolution. So dependable is our aversion to being unsure that subjects in one series of psychological experiments were far more stressed not knowing whether they would get an electric shock than knowing for sure they would receive one.

Now an onslaught of unknowns — fueled by unrest recession fire flood and plague — drives laments about “these uncertain times” to fever pitch. Yet shunning uncertainty at this critical moment would be a mistake. A new wave of research is revealing that this long-misunderstood mindset plays an essential role in catalyzing higher-order thinking in times of flux. When a problem is muddy or new being unsure prompts us to slow the rush to judgment take another look at a first and often-erroneous conviction and reach for a better answer.

“There’s an adaptive value to the sense and experience of uncertainty” says Dr. Paul K.J. Han a senior scientist at the National Cancer Institute and a leader of recent scientific efforts to decode the psychological mechanisms of uncertainty. “It’s not as if we should be suppressing it. On the other hand we simply don’t like it in most circumstances.” That uncertainty unsettles us is its paradoxical gift.

Epic challenges confront us from the ravages of climate change and assaults on democracy to an intractable pandemic. But these complex problems can be fully redressed only if we break our preference for quick fixes and certainty and harness the literally thought-provoking mindset of not knowing. Studies show that simply fearing uncertainty makes us prone to rigidity close-mindedness and anxiety — the very states that hobble us in moments of upheaval.

Nothing set in stone

Who is the better candidate? Which vaccine is safest? We all know what it’s like to be unsure — to sense that one’s knowledge is incomplete and there’s something more to know. But remarkably the mindset of uncertainty until recently was often overlooked as a topic of study in itself. Psychologists tended to view it as something for humans to eradicate as quickly as possible.

The fallacy that not knowing is a cognitive no-man’s-land however is rapidly crumbling.

Health care for example is a field historically bent on pursuing certainty from diagnosis to treatment. But that has come at a price. Medical students who shun ambiguity show less interest in treating underserved patients with often-complex conditions. Doctors’ discomfort with uncertainty has been linked to excessive testing to overprescribing antibiotics and to the burnout and depression that reached alarming levels even before the pandemic. It’s crucial to address medicine’s “unhealthy reaction to uncertainty” Dr. Arabella Simpkin an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School wrote in a commentary last April for BMJ.

And some in the field have begun to do just that.

A few years ago faculty at a small family-medicine residency program in Lewiston Maine noticed that their young doctors were increasingly uneasy treating outpatients whose care typically involved ongoing complexity and ambiguity. It took senior doctors at Central Maine Medical Center a while to realize the problem: The trainees were uncomfortable with the uncertainty that is integral to their profession. In 2015 the faculty added an extra month of outpatient rotation more time for faculty mentoring lectures on medical error and a new emphasis on the idea that “there isn’t one right way to treat a patient” says the program director Dr. Bethany Picker. “We reframed the learning in a way to allow people to be open to not-knowing not resist it but to seek it.” That’s when “we saw light bulbs going on.”

A pilot study published in 2018 by Picker psychologist Deborah Taylor Dr. Donald Woolever and colleagues showed that after the new curriculum was added residents became less likely to see ambiguity as threatening. For example before the new rotation residents on average heartily agreed that “an expert who doesn’t come up with a definite answer probably doesn’t know too much.” Afterward and even six months later they strongly disagreed. The teaching had shifted their professional identity.

“It was reiterated to us that it’s okay to say ‘I need to look this up’ or ‘I don’t know the answer right now’ — which is a very hard thing to do by the way” recalls Dr. Nupur Nagrare a 2017 graduate of the program who practices in upstate New York. The training has given her confidence — even courage — during the pandemic. “If you’re open to ambiguity you don’t have tunnel vision and things aren’t so set in stone” she says.

Day to day humans fare well by relying on intuitive cognition the quick heuristics or shortcuts largely honed from past experience. This is how an experienced doctor for example first suspects that a patient’s chest pains signal a heart attack. But when something defies expectations or goes awry the mind must break away from autopilot pivot and reassess. An error a contradiction a discrepancy — a false-positive medical test an awakening to societal inequality — creates a discomfiting mismatch between old expectations and a new reality.

What happens in our minds at that point is one of the hottest topics in cognitive science.

At that moment uncertainty widens our focus and bolsters working memory. It evokes the “slow” thinking needed to update a now-deficient understanding of the world. Being unsure is both a signal of danger and a provocation to investigate what’s different missing or wrong an undertaking called “conflict processing.” “Uncertainty can be informative and people don’t often seem to realize that” says Sander van der Linden who directs the University of Cambridge’s Social Decision-Making Laboratory. “It points us in the direction of what we do not know.”

Consider a pioneering study of 104 German chief executives facing the dramatic expansion of the European Union in 2004 to include many former communist countries. A few months before that change some of the 104 CEOs predicted it would bolster their firms while others said it would hurt their prospects according to the study by Nils Plambeck of HEC Paris Business School and Northwestern University’s Klaus Weber. A third group however saw the enlargement of the European bloc as potentially both positive and negative; they were unsure of the ultimate outcome.

When the researchers returned more than a year later to see how the executives had fared they found to their surprise that the deep ambivalence popularly equated with paralysis had had the opposite effect. The torn CEOs considered a wider number of responses included more diverse voices in their decisions and took more novel and bold actions. They realized that “there is a reality out there that is not binary” says Weber. In contrast those who had evaluated their prospects as good or bad or who felt more in control of the situation tended to stick to routine operations; some did almost nothing at all.

Uncertainty is a gadfly of the mind jolting us from complacency — if we are willing to take up its invitation.

“Being uncertain means that I lack confidence.” “There is really no such thing as a problem that can’t be solved.” These are measures used in the “Intolerance of Uncertainty” and “Tolerance for Ambiguity” assessments psychological tests that are attracting new attention in medicine clinical psychology and the business world as tools for helping people unlock the upsides of not knowing. In essence the tests measure the degree to which people view uncertainty as a challenge or as a threat — a seemingly innocuous difference in attitudes that nonetheless affects how we learn argue and solve problems.

Those who shy from the indefinite tend to engage in rigid thinking leap to conclusions and yearn for life to be clear and predictable; they see knowledge as a rock to hold and defend. At the opposite end of the spectrum are flexible curious thinkers who are more likely to cope well with and even seek out diversity complexity and change. The implications are clear: Tolerance for uncertainty is the stepping-stone to cognitive flourishing.

The ability to skillfully confront uncertainty increasingly is seen as a path not just to critical thinking but to mental well-being. Many leaders in clinical psychology believe that fear of the unknown is a major root cause or “transdiagnostic factor” behind mental illnesses including anxiety depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Anxiety in this light arises from excessive or unnecessary efforts to resolve uncertainty by avoiding it or by seeking an illusion of control through worrying.

New treatments are teaching patients with anxieties to delegate more at work for example or to make decisions without hyper-checking the Internet. In effect they are practicing facing their worst fear not knowing just as someone who is afraid of dogs might first try to approach a puppy then a dog on a leash. “People worry that ‘uncertainty is going to ruin me’” says Kevin Alschuler a University of Washington psychologist. “We help them see they can handle it.”

A chance for a reset

Amid widespread anger despair and exhaustion more than half of Americans believe “we should seize the opportunity of COVID-19 to make important changes to our country” according to research by the nonpartisan nonprofit More in Common. Shifting views on race are inspiring “the opening up of imaginations” human rights activist Opal Tometi told The New Yorker. A new administration heartens at least one half of the political spectrum.

But fledgling hopes for a societal reset will shrivel unless we first reconsider a culture that has transformed our innate love of quick certain answers into a foundational value of the times. Executives are viewed as less competent if they pause to deliberate in public for just seconds. The pace and look of the technological milieu foster an implicit conviction that “knowing” is downloadable neat and quick; after just a few minutes of online searching people are apt to think they know more than they actually do. Deepening polarization devalues the personal uncertainty that is essential for compromise.

The greatest obstacle to thoughtful unifying change is not the wrongness of the other side or the need for a better algorithm but the intolerance of uncertainty that places us at a dangerous remove from a nuanced multifaceted evolving understanding of reality.

We can laugh at past eras’ assumptions that the stars and earth’s species were fixed and that the adult brain and personality were immutable. Instead we should ask ourselves: What veil of certainties now keeps us in the dark about ourselves our world and each other? The great Enlightenment-inspired battle to eradicate not-knowing — what John Dewey called the “quest for certainty” — is ending. It’s time to enlist the “enemy” in solving the problems of our days.

Not long ago my husband and I were involved in the poignant work of dismantling a family home. By prior agreement the contents were divided by ranking people’s choices and then a roll of the dice. All went well until we won something that another relative had yearned for and exhausted family members began to demand that we hand over the heirloom.

The choice at first seemed clear: Keep it and anger kin or sacrifice fairness to restore peace. But then I realized that in our collective hurry to seal the deal we were failing to explore hidden aspects of the problem. Perhaps the situation wasn’t quite as win-lose as we had thought. Maybe memories weren’t so zero-sum. A moment’s indecision inspired me to dig deeper and craft a third option: a trade that satisfied all sides. Not knowing proved to be an essential accomplice to good thinking not the cognitive defeat that we too often fear.

Hardly a surprise that no one subsequently has filched that title from the old girl who was born in Germany in 1925 and began competing in gymnastics as a 9-year-old.

If you’re a kid entranced by Quaas’s dazzling dipsy-doodles on the parallel bars please don’t attempt any of her flips and flops without a qualified adult at your side.

Superb senior gymnast Johanna Quaas never would say it but if you’re an adult especially advanced in years be warned: Don’t dare try one of her routines if you’re home alone.

Quaas today is a nonagenarian dynamo a former team handball champion in East Germany an inspirational trim tour de force on the bars and in the floor exercise. A mother of three she won the German Seniors gymnastics title for 11 straight years (2000-11) age 75-86.

“You are never too old” she said in 2015 when the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame honored her at its annual dinner in Oklahoma City “to learn something new.”

The Internet is full of video clips of Quaas’s routines all of them defying her age all of them a marvel leaving one and all on either side of age 95 to feel like they’re just the sorriest couch potato ever to tumble off the turnip truck. Please pardon the mixed-veg metaphor but she’s a big proponent of a plant-based diet. She loves her greens.

Quaas’s moves these days are slow deliberate form perfect videos of her sets essentially a “how to” instruction manual. Her hair is white her face a rich mosaic of story lines and her sense of self that of an elderly woman who proudly tells anyone “My heart is young.”

Got that right. She has the ticker of a 20-something.

Quaas’s secret formula: her green diet moderation (eat till full then stop) and plenty of exercise (gymnastics three or four days a week with an occasional sauna and a dip in the pool). Oh and all of it covered by a sunny disposition.

No real magic there right? Hardly revolutionary TB12 live-long-and-prosper stuff or that sensational gizmo that sells for $59.95 on QVC promising those ever-elusive six-pack abs. Ever notice how those gizmos always fit neatly under the bed so we can tuck ‘em away and act like we never saw them?

“I mean look at her doing the parallel bars and her tumbling” said Dr. Kristen Gunning an internist recently watching one of the Quaas videos. “She’s amazing.”

Gunning is a member of the Bulfinch Medical Group located on the Massachusetts General Hospital campus and she specializes in part in geriatric patients albeit not those who routinely wake up each day and spring cartwheels across the kitchen floor.

A gymnast in her childhood what Gunning tells her elderly patients and those middle-age and younger fits Quaas’s story: Stay active both of body and mind maintain proper diet and weight and especially try not to be deterred today by thinking that you’ll start doing all the right health and fitness things tomorrow.

“Like say patients who are carrying 30 extra pounds” noted Gunning. “They’re always planning ‘Well once I get through tax season then I’ll be able to exercise.’ Or ‘Once I get through this I’ll be able to do that … once my kids are older and I’m not running around like crazy I can get to that.’ ”

It’s especially the extra weight Gunning reminds them that adds years packs on the health risks.

“It ages you a lot” she said ticking off the added risk of cancer high-blood-pressure diabetes etc. “The inactivity ages you.”

Too often noted Gunning we are the greatest obstacles standing in way to our better selves especially when it comes to trying smarter diets new health regimens.

“A lot of patients stay in their own way truthfully” she said. ‘If I think of my own patients in their 90s … some often look younger than my patients in their 60s. Having taken care of patients [for some 25] years there seems to be a split somewhere in your late 60s/early 70s where one group of individuals is physiologically 20 years older than the other group of individuals.”

Some of that noted Gunning is purely random such as older patients that develop a devastating illness unrelated to their fitness level diet or good health practices.

“But so often it’s lifestyle” she said. “It’s diet. It’s exercise. It’s keeping yourself mentally sharp keeping yourself physically in shape just socially keeping up — such as people who can make friends throughout their lives. No question people who’ve lived in moderation have an advantage.”

Gunning noted two of her current vital 90-somethings one a woman who only until recently regularly conducted tours at the Museum of Fine Arts another a 91-year-old Korean War veteran whose passion is to help those steering through recovery at Alcoholics Anonymous.

“He’s in the [Holyoke] Soldiers’ Home now and COVID-negative thankfully” she said. “Once they give him an ounce of freedom the very first thing he’s going to do is go back to sponsoring people at AA meetings.”

Amid the ongoing pandemic said Gunning COVID-19 has claimed but one of her patients. A significant number of elderly in her care though have succumbed to the isolation and associated inactivity the pandemic has forced on so many of us of all ages.

“I’ve lost so many seniors” said a somber Gunning. “It’s the social isolation. It’s the lack of activity. They’re losing ground in their physical stamina. Just not being able to walk the same distances. They’re shriveling up and it’s truly awful.”

Other than a brief hiatus around the World War II years Quaas has been a gymnast for the better part of three-quarters of a century. The passion has shaped her life helped her stay healthy won her a bunch of rewards. It is a passion that radiates from her every move.

Clint Eastwood the 90-year-old filmmaker said a couple of years ago that his secret to remaining vital was his refusal “to let the old man in.”

Dirty Harry and the elegant impish Quaas though from separate worlds have one thing in common: the art of sticking a landing.

Certificates of deposit or CDs which require you to lock up savings for a predetermined amount of time offer slightly better interest rates but not much better than the paltry 0.07% annual percentage yield (APY) that is the current national average for savings accounts according to Bankrate.

But one crypto startup BlockFi is letting users earn at a rate that’s nearly 123-times higher on dollar-backed cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins. More specifically the company is currently paying an 8.6% interest rate on savings accounts holding the Gemini dollar the stablecoin introduced by the Winklevoss twins’ regulated and audited New York trust company Gemini. Interest is paid out monthly by BlockFi in either a dollar equivalent or a favored cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ether.

BlockFi's savings accounts are not FDIC insured but they do offer interest rates currently 123-times higher than the national average as measured by Bankrate.

“You can start earning your interest and gaining passive exposure into a new asset class” BlockFi co-founder Flori Marquez explained in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live. “The people who use our products span from everyday consumers who are buying bitcoin for the first time to even some small corporates.”

It’s important to note that the higher interest rates BlockFi offers on its accounts carry a special set of risks. Unlike traditional savings accounts BlockFi’s are not FDIC-insured which means they don’t carry the traditional $250000 of protection per depositor. Even BlockFi’s disclaimer warns customers that their savings account “is not a risk-free product and loss of principal is possible.”

Despite those risks hundreds of thousands of customers have turned to the Peter Thiel- and Coinbase Ventures-backed platform to either trade cryptocurrencies or earn interest through BlockFi’s savings accounts according to Marquez.

“As opposed to most fintech platforms our average account size is actually $50000” she said. “So people are depositing... a meaningful amount of assets.”

Comparing a $25000 deposit at Marcus by Goldman Sachs which offers 0.5% interest rates on its savings accounts and BlockFi's 8.6% rate shows the difference in expected earnings over a year.

Similar to banks BlockFi acts as a financial intermediary that’s able to benefit in the gap between borrowing and lending. As Yahoo Finance’s Brian Cheung recently explained in this week’s Yahoo U installment banks profit by enjoying a larger return on money loaned out than the interest they pay on deposits. As BlockFi CEO Zac Prince explained to Yahoo Finance in the past the company’s similar role as an intermediary comes with another perk unique to the crypto space: a lack of other established players.

“We're the largest lender of cryptocurrencies to institutional borrowers who today are primarily market makers and proprietary trading firms that are active in this asset class and have been for a while but they can't finance that activity with their traditional prime broker relationships because banks aren't active in the space yet” he said. “That's the reason why the yields are still high because this is a new asset class. It's nascent it's growing quickly and it doesn't have access to the traditional sources of debt capital. And as a result when we're lending we're able to charge higher rates and then we pay that back to the folks who are our clients on the front end.”

Story continues

As the industry matures Prince expects that BlockFi will likely have to lower interest rates on its savings accounts at some point but rates have held at 8.6% for more than a year.

Prince also stressed that interest earned on BlockFi’s accounts are also taxed much like interest revenue from traditional bank accounts and that BlockFi provides users with an annual 1099 form to help with tax filings.

“We’re heavily regulated at the federal level and at the state level as a financial services company in the U.S.” he said.

The first to arrive was a masked young man who used the name of a dead anarchist to identify himself. He carried a first-aid kit and tree-of-liberty flag as he trudged up the hill to the state Capitol on Sunday the advance guard of a protest that never materialized — at least not in Hartford.

On a day when police stood on alert in every state capital ready for protests promised in the wake of the stunning assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 Hartford was quiet. No one came to cry that the election was stolen from Donald J. Trump.

Reporters and photographers outnumbered protesters counter-protesters and onlookers. Police outnumbered them all.

In and around the Capitol complex waited 200 police officers one dog a National Guard contingent armed with assault rifles and armored police and military vehicles some painted in desert tan. One was an MRAP a mine-resistant assault vehicle.

“We believe what we were doing was appropriate based on the intel we had” said Brian Foley a spokesman for the state Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection. “That being said I’d much rather next Thursday be talking to you about over-preparation than under-preparation. And the fact that no one showed up is just fine with us.”

Next Thursday will be President-elect Joe Biden’s first full day as the 46th president of the United States. Police expect to remain watchful over government buildings and other potential targets of protest or violence.

But if there are insurrectionists in Connecticut interested in keeping Donald J. Trump in power past Biden’s inauguration at noon on Wednesday they did not show themselves on Sunday.

The self-described anarchist with the tree-of-liberty flag identified himself as Duncan Lemp 17 of Norwich. The name is an alias adopted by some right-wing groups as a nod to a 21-year-old anti-government “boogaloo boi” killed in a police raid in Maryland last year.

The young man with the flag was accompanied by an older man of uncertain years who was identified by gold stitching on his cap as a Marine: “Once a Marine Always a Marine.” He walked with a cane and pleasantly announced his mission: Keeping an eye on his grandson the family anarchist.

“He’s a good boy” said the grandfather.

The pair arrived before noon the young man assuring the waiting press that more people were coming. The older man seemed skeptical. He laughed and said “This is it?”

While the grandson used an alias the grandfather declined to use any name. Keeping his name out of the news was a practice developed decades ago on Teamster picket lines he said. He smiled and said “I was a trouble-maker then.”

The younger of the pair said he learned of the protest on a bulletin board maintained online by The Tree of Liberty which he described as generally freedom-loving and anti-government.

“What I know is from official statements from the organizers via the website Tree of Liberty” he said. “Its goal is anything that stands for freedom. Anybody who has any single issue with the government whether it be taxes or legalizing marijuana anything.”

As he chatted Joanna Iovino of Hartford arrived with a pink bullhorn that needed batteries and a hand-written sign disapproving of Trump the KKK and fascists. She described herself as a counter-protester and said there were others on the way even if there was nothing to counter.

A young anarchist using a dead man’s name did not concern her.

“Maybe there’s not enough fascists in Connecticut you know?” Iovino said. “But yeah we’re out here to counter-protest against fascism.”

Others drifted by. A trio of serious-looking men approached from Bushnell Park and watched. One dropped his mask and lit a cigar. He said they were just curious. He was polite but disinterested in further discussion about politics or current events with a reporter.

A man with a shaggy beard strolled along the blaze-orange bicycle-rack fencing around the Capitol. As he passed the old man with the Marines cap he said “Thank you for your service.”

He was asked if he was press protester or tourist.

The bearded man replied “Just interested.”

A tall man who would only give his name as Will walked by with a bullhorn amplifying a profane rap from his iPhone. It was “FDT” by Nipsey Hussle. “DT” stands for Donald Trump.

The Marine grandfather of the boy using a dead boogaloo’s name said he was mildly offended by the language.

When the song concluded Will joined Iovino by the perimeter fence.

“I’m from Hartford. I have to be here. It’s basically I’m here against fascism plain and simple always will be” he said. “So this is what I do. And we came up here with one or two people even if we were surrounded we’ve been surrounded by Trump supporters before.”

There was no chance of being surrounded.

A tall thin male jogger in shorts and knee-high black socks glided by showing no sign of noticing anything amiss on a Sunday afternoon at the Connecticut Capitol.

Capitol police stood inside the perimeter. Near the north steps a State Police truck was parked watched by a K-9 officer. His dog lay flat disinterested.

Overhead a State Police helicopter circled in ever-widening orbits over the Capitol the Legislative Office Building the State Office Building State Armory Supreme Court and the neighborhoods beyond.

There was nothing to see. No marchers staging ready to move on the Capitol.

“In the wake of what we saw in the nation’s capital last week it was important we be prepared for anything that might present this weekend” said Luke Bronin the mayor of Hartford who lives a block from the Capitol.

Gov. Ned Lamont who had hip-replacement surgery on Wednesday was at his home in Greenwich. His spokesman Max Reiss echoed Bronin and Foley in saying that it was better to be over-prepared.

Authorities had no immediate estimate of the cost of having so many troopers massed around the Capitol.

“What was spent today will be tracked coded through our fiscal people at the state separately and we should hopefully once it’s settled down in the coming days have an idea of what the cost was” Foley said. “Certainly I would say the cost is much less than having some sort of violent outbreak occur.”

He said state officials learned on a 50-state conference call Friday that every state capital was using the same template. One challenge for law enforcement was the decision by technology firms to crack down on the uses of social-media platforms by those deemed to be extremists.

It made a source of intelligence go dark complicating efforts to judge how big a protest to expect.

“When social media started shutting down Parler and a lot of the talk and many of the advertisements about any sort of organized protests we lost an arm of our intelligence” Foley said. “Not all of our intelligence but an arm of it. And the ability to estimate what was going to happen became cloudy.”

At precisely 1 p.m. the protest that never transpired was deemed a non-event. Police opened Capitol Avenue to traffic too late for a small group of women seeking food at Emanuel Lutheran Church across from the Armory and Legislative Office Building.

A sign at the church door said the church food bank was closed at the request of Capitol police. The women who didn’t want to give their full names said they come to the food bank every weekend.

“I wasn’t expecting anything like this” a woman named Grace said. “Two cops stopped us just walking to the church. We’re just trying to get some food.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9kYXZpZC1icm9keS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03NDUzOTM40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David BRODY Obituary (1925 - 2021) - Hartford CT - Hartford Courant,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/hartfordcourant/name/david-brody-obituary?id=7453938 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9kYXZpZC1icm9keS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03NDUzOTM40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2JhbHRpbW9yZS9uZXdzL3dpbGxpYW1zLWxlYWRzLWhhcnRmb3JkLXBhc3QtdW1iYy13aXRoLWRvdWJsZS1kb3VibGUv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2JhbHRpbW9yZS9uZXdzL3dpbGxpYW1zLWxlYWRzLWhhcnRmb3JkLXBhc3QtdW1iYy13aXRoLWRvdWJsZS1kb3VibGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Williams Leads Hartford Past UMBC With Double-Double,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Austin Williams had 16 points and 13 rebounds to carry Hartford to a 70-63 win over UMBC on Saturday.

Rating: About this rating Mostly False What's True The image appears to show a real creation of Servando Hernandez an artist who uses the handle Livin' Plastic on social media. What's False This is not official merchandise from Mattel which owns Barbie’s brand. The Ouija trademark is owned by Hasbro their rival.

A Barbie-themed Ouija board intrigued Reddit users in January 2021 because of the unusual combo of one of the world’s most popular dolls with the board game known for calling spirits back from the dead.

A low-quality image shared to Reddit appeared to show a board game called “Barbie Ouija!” with a tattooed arm playing the game:

This was not an official Mattel product but we did manage to find the possible source of the image.

On the bottom left corner of the image is the text “Livin’ Plastic.” That lead us to designer Servando Hernández who goes by the handle @livinplastic on Instagram. Based in Mexico City Hernández frequently shares images of Barbie dolls in unique poses and styles. The Barbie Ouija board was featured on his Instagram account with the hashtag “#notanofficialproduct.” The board game in the image on Reddit may have originated from or been inspired by Hernández’s work.

Hernández the artist behind the game confirmed to Snopes that this was indeed his brainchild: ""It belongs to a series of objects created by me. I like to decontextualize Barbie and put her into situations and objects that are not commonly associated with her or bring them to real life.""

The originators of Ouija in the United States sold their product to a company that was later bought by toy manufacturer and multinational conglomerate Hasbro. The Ouija name is trademarked by Hasbro so the games cannot be manufactured by Barbie’s owners Mattel.

Given that the object in the image seems to be inspired or created by an independent artist but it is unclear if it is a real game available to play and is not an official product of Barbie’s parent company we rate this as “Mostly False.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vdHJhbnNmb3JtZXJzLWRyZWFtd2F2ZS1yZWxhdW5jaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Transformers Became a Monster Comics Hit...

Considering the other-wise violent nature of the Battle-Royale genre Fortnite is the best game on which toy’s companies can base their products. This is because it does not depict blood and a more video-game like feel with bright colors and wholesome features.

Further the range even includes Rocket Launchers Harvesting tools and supply drops! In this article we look at the best Nerf blasters that you can buy and recreate the Fortnite experience in real life:

Nerf Fortnite SMG-E Motorized Dart Blaster

The SMG-E Nerf blaster is part of the newer range which has motorized shooting. The gun comes with only 6 darts with no backup dart storage.

The SMG-E Nerf gun is especially suitable for longer range-outdoor matches although you might need to buy extra darts to make it work. The gun looks very similar to the real thing and actually follows the real reload mechanism that characters use in the game!

Nerf Fortnite TS Blaster

The Nerf TS Blaster comes with the original pump action blasting that is used in the game. Further it is an extremely powerful gun and can be used to fire darts at targets.

Further the gun comes with a dart storage slot which can be used for quicker reloading. The increased range and the quick reload option makes it quite perfect for outdoor games.

Nerf Fortnite AR-E Blaster

Assault Rifles are used by players who prefer quick-fire shooting and large magazine capacities. The AR-E Blaster has both of those things. It can shoot up to ten darts at once and has a backup dart storage that can house the other ten dart bullets that you get.

Further it mimics the motorized dart blasting that we see in the game and has two AR-sights that can be used for better distance aiming. The Blaster requires four AA batteries to run and is quite the perfect weapon for both short-range and long-range shooting.

Many of the North American animals in the outdoor exhibits are more active when the temperature drops. We recommend visiting the Northlands region of the zoo for a chance to see four gray wolves two snowy owls and an American marten. During the winter guests will often spot the wolves running around their enclosure and the snowy owls on the ground or perched in one of the trees in their habitat. The marten likes to build tunnels when there is snow on the ground.

ZooAmerica is also home to two river otters in the Eastern Woodlands region of the zoo. River otters are built for swimming even in the cold water so guests should look for them playing in the pool in their habitat.

According to the American Red Cross blood drive cancellations tripled in 2020 due to the pandemic and collections at high schools and colleges dropped by more than 50% compared with the prior year.

Yet the need for blood plasma and platelet donations remains strong locally and nationally.

“We’ve seen a 16% increase in the number of transfusions overall compared to pre-COVID-19” said Sean Erony section chief for the blood bank in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory at Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center.

January is National Blood Donor Month a nearly 50-year-old tradition that helps spread the word about the importance of donating blood plasma or platelets. Tertiary care centers such as the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center rely on donations to help save lives.

The American Red Cross estimates a daily need for 36000 units of red blood cells 7000 units of platelets and 10000 units of plasma nationwide.

“Treating patients is a 24/7/365 mission and you never know when a desperately ill patient — a tiny newborn an adult needing a bone marrow transplant or a trauma patient — will need blood” said Dr. Melissa George medical director of the blood bank at Hershey Medical Center. George estimates trauma patients may need as many as 100 units of red blood cells because of critical bleeding during and after an accident.

In Pennsylvania anyone older than 16 may donate blood. Donors must be in relatively good health and weigh 110 pounds or more. People experiencing an illness people with low iron or those who have traveled outside the U.S. to countries with high rates of malaria may not be eligible. However “People who had COVID-19 can give blood so long as they are 14 days out from the resolution of symptoms” George said. The American Red Cross offers this list of blood donor eligibility facts.

The American Red Cross Central Pennsylvania Blood Bank and Miller Keystone Blood Center all accept blood donations that help benefit patients in the Hershey region. During blood drives at Hershey Medical Center throughout the pandemic the American Red Cross added more safety precautions requiring mask-wearing for donors and blood-drive employees taking donors’ temperatures at the door and ensuring proper social distancing.

While a persistent need exists for the donation of all blood products donations for convalescent plasma for patients fully recovered from COVID-19 are in particularly high demand. This plasma may be a COVID-19 treatment.

“Our blood bank members have transfused almost 200 units of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma at Hershey Medical Center and Penn State Health St. Joseph Medical Center” Erony said.

Just one blood donation potentially can save as many as three lives. Donation also brings a personal satisfaction from helping others.

“It’s always a rewarding feeling when you’re able to give something to a patient in need” George said.

The kit from Prime Party includes 12 Roses that stand at over 22 inches tall by 12 inches wide and includes a yard sign that says “A Dozen Red Roses Just for You.” They’re made of commercial-grade corrugated plastic material and fade-resistant ink so they should hold up against the elements.

Of course something this amazing doesn’t come cheap as the set sells for $99.99 at regular price plus shipping. As of this writing the whole set was on sale for $79.99 however.

If the price tag is a bit much for you they also have an option that comes as a picture of the dozen red Roses in a single yard sign for $19.99.

You may also want to consider pairing actual roses with a few other “Golden Girls” gifts for your own play on the theme.

If you have a Costco near you you can get 50 roses (the actual flowers this time) for just $55 ($57 for non-members) or 50 roses for $49 at Sam’s Club. You could then pair them with some fun gifts inspired by the series like bobbleheads shot glasses or Chia Pets. You can even find a “Golden Girls” sunshade for their car and a tiki mug set.

Of course you can still stick to some traditional Valentine’s Day gifts that even a fan of “The Golden Girls” would appreciate.

Candy is always a winner and this year Hershey’s has a few new goodies like rose-shaped Reese’s Cups and Hershey’s Kisses Meltaway Roses. Target also has some sweet treats like heart-shaped strawberries-and-cream hot cocoa bombs chocolate that looks like an avocado and a Wine is My Valentine gift pack which includes three 187-milliliter bottles of rose chardonnay and red blend wines for just $9.99.

You can even send a personalized heart-shaped box of M&M’s to your Valentine or get your hands on these gorgeous heart-shaped chocolate bonbons at Sam’s Club if you’re looking for some fancier treats. In four flavors — fresh strawberry cherry cordial sea salt caramel and toasted coconut — each set contains 20 chocolates for $8.98.

She was also a pioneering sports journalist and tennis star.

NEW ORLEANS — Marilyn Barnett who perfected the art of public relations for nearly four decades at the Royal Orleans Roosevelt and Hilton hotels where she developed friendships with movie stars famous authors and symphony conductors died Sunday. She was 97.

Ms. Barnett known to colleagues and friends as “MB” rose to become one of the local public relations industry’s most talented practitioners. She was described in a 2005 Times-Picayune article as a “one-woman media conglomerate.”

In addition to her public relations career she was a classical disc jockey holder of numerous tennis titles a newspaper reporter and one of the first female sports journalists in the South.

But Ms. Barnett is best known for her stints representing the biggest New Orleans hotels. According to her nephew Jim Barnett her first hotel public relations job was at the brand-new Royal Orleans in 1960 a position she landed after giving a newspaper columnist an item about the French Quarter hotel’s general manager. The general manager was impressed by the publicity and offered her the job.

During her nearly ten years at the Royal Orleans Ms. Barnett assisted Arthur Hailey in research for his novel “Hotel."" She became his informed source about local hotel history. When the protagonist in his book described the Royal Orleans as “the finest hotel in North America” Ms. Barnett scored a stroke of PR genius.

As a result of their friendship she became the model in 1968 for publicist Tanya Livingston in Hailey’s “Airport” a heroine noted for typing in lower case a signature trait of Ms. Barnett’s.

“Good public relations means that nothing is too much trouble either for your guests or your property. Whatever is needed it can be done. It also helps if you bring a certain graciousness or elan to the work and of course you should really like what you do"" she once said of her work.

After leaving the Royal Orleans she moved to the Fairmont (Roosevelt) Hotel for 12 years where she handled the bookings in-house advertising and publicity for stars who performed at the hotel's famed supper club the Blue Room - everyone from Lena Horne to Tiny Tim. For years she hobnobbed with and coddled celebrities once lending her coat to actress Imogene Coca and dancing with mob boss Frank Costello.

In an interview with former Times-Picayune theater writer David Cuthbert she remembered Ella Fitzgerald as “wonderful but aloof” called Richard Harris “rather difficult” and said Tina Turner was “tough to deal with.” Pearl Bailey called her “Sister.” They even shared crawfish and crabs at West End. Ms. Barnett also stood on Eartha Kitt’s shoulders to rescue a baby blue jay in Audubon Park.

Other celebrities on the receiving end of Ms. Barnett’s public relations touch included Carol Channing Ginger Rogers Tony Bennett Danny Kaye Charles Laughton Shari Lewis Sebastian Cabot Jose Ferrer Van Johnson and Rosemary Clooney. Ms. Barnett took Peggy Lee to the hospital emergency room during a visit to the city. Lee wrote in her autobiography that Ms. Barnett “exudes the charm of New Orleans.”

Ms. Barnett worked behind the scenes attending to celebrities arranging dinners and seeing to every detail. For example she knew that Marlene Dietrich preferred yellow and white flowers in her hotel room and Dom Perignon. “A hotel is a paradise of stories” Ms. Barnett told an interviewer.

Ms. Barnett would know a good story because she began her career writing them. A New Orleans native she went to work at the New Orleans Item in 1944. During a five-week apprenticeship under editor Clayton Fritchey she clipped and filed newspaper obituaries in the Item’s “morgue.”

She went on to become a news reporter on the city desk and then feature and sports writer in 1951. She interviewed baseball legends Joe DiMaggio and Leo Durocher and Italian professional wrestler fighter Primo Carnera.

She also covered horse races basketball boxing matches and football games at Tulane Stadium where she recalled she had to sit directly beneath the press box since no women were permitted inside. She said the isolation from the other writers allowed her to soak in all the elements of the game from the stands.

She penned a tennis column called “Drop Shots” and later became a golf columnist one of a handful of women golf writers in the country at the time.

After the Royal Orleans Ms. Barnett had stints at the Royal Sonesta Hotel Iberville (now Westin Canal Place) and a dozen years at the Hilton New Orleans Riverside where she was inducted into the hotel's Walk of Fame honoring prominent citizens of New Orleans.

In addition to her work in sports and public relations Ms. Barnett also dabbled in radio. She was the first classical music disc jockey for radio station WTIX. Her show was initially called “Waxing Eloquent” but she changed it to “Afternoon Symphony.” That also led to a job in public relations as the publicist for the New Orleans Philharmonic Symphony from 1954 to 1960. It became her first public relations gig. She was dubbed the “Typewriter Timpanist.”

A 1976 New Orleans Magazine profile summarized Ms. Barnett’s approach to public relations: “One senses about Marilyn that there is a certain order to the world ways that things should be done and said ways to hold a tennis racket and select wine.""

""There is a perceptiveness about her"" the magazine wrote ""that borders on vigilance when it comes to hotel affairs: too much cassis; a waiter chewing food on duty a screw protruding from the carpet near the escalator; a drooping centerpiece; a businessman wearing a short-sleeved shirt with a pin-striped suit. She misses very little. In Marilyn’s realm things are comme il faut (as it should be.)”

In her private life Ms. Barnett was an accomplished amateur tennis player who covered the Eastern Tennis Circuit for the States-Item at the same time. She won 13 titles including city singles champion in 1944. She was ranked number 10 in women’s doubles in the South. Barnett was still taking home trophies in 1980 at the age of 57. She won so many over her lifetime that she donated dozens of trophies to the Salvation Army so the awards could be re-engraved for others.

“As a tennis player Marilyn isn’t one of those girls who you occasionally see in the periodicals daintily holding a racket with her demitasse finger. She’s dainty enough but along with this she’s authentic” a sports magazine wrote in 1960.

She was inducted into the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame in 1994. She was also recipient of the 1988 President’s Award from the Press Club of New Orleans.



Ms. Barnett was a graduate of Isidore Newman School and Hood College in Maryland. Her nephew said she was informed by an instructor there that she would never write well. Ms. Barnett said she later mailed the professor her first byline newspaper story as a triumphant vindication.

Her correspondence with many of the stars she worked with during her career – including thank you notes autographed photos press clippings artwork cards and gifts - comprise nearly 5000 documents donated to the Historic New Orleans Collection.

In retirement Ms. Barnett an animal lover devoted much of her time to animal welfare. She was a devoted supporter of the Louisiana SPCA Chimp Haven and the Humane Society of Louisiana. Family members said she would load her car with pet food and drive around the city to feed and catch stray cats have them neutered and returned to their neighborhoods or adopted.

Survivors include a brother William M. Barnett of New Orleans; two nephews Robert A. Barnett (Lisa) of Covington and James M. Barnett (Faye) of Bethesda Maryland; three grandnephews William A. Barnett Zachary J. Barnett and Christopher M. Barnett and a grandniece Elizabeth Barnett Gregorio (Jeff) who shares the same birthday as her great-aunt.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsbmV3c21lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hpbHRvbi1kdWJhaS1qdW1laXJhaC10by1jZWxlYnJhdGUtYnVybnMtbmlnaHQtd2l0aC1zY290dGlzaC1tZW510gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton Dubai Jumeirah to celebrate Burns Night with Scottish menu,"Located at Hilton Dubai Jumeirah Wavebreaker Beach Bar & Grill will celebrate Burns Night offering a selection of Scottish-influenced dishes within a limited-edition menu.

There is a surprising amount of water heater inertia in our area — we are clinging to old-style heaters. I’ve been scratching my head about it. Mid-peninsula residents have been quick to adopt all kinds of clean tech like EVs solar panels smart thermostats LED lights and more. We care about climate change and we want to do our part especially when it involves cool new technology and some beefy incentives.

We’ve got all that going on with new-style water heaters yet adoption is lagging. Heat pump water heaters greatly reduce emissions while using 3.5-6 times less energy than gas water heaters but still we persist in firing up the gas to heat our water boosting our home’s carbon footprint by about 50%. (1) What’s up with that?



Flame under a gas-tank water heater

This is the first in a two-part series about heat pump water heaters which I hope will help answer that question demystify the heaters some and encourage more of us to give them a good look. In this first part we are going to go on a virtual tour of some real life local installations after a brief overview.

Below is a picture of two Rheem water heaters. They look pretty similar but the one on the left hooks up to gas and works like a gas stove while the one on the right plugs into the wall and works like a refrigerator (in reverse). From this description it’s hard to imagine that we’d care so much about which one we got that we’d choose the one that’s much much worse for the climate (on the left).

They look about the same. They’re about the same size. And they’re both available at Home Depot. The one on the right is much more expensive but there’s a hefty local rebate and the bills are a little lower (2).

I asked some people who understand these water heaters why there seems to be a lot more interest in EVs than in heat pumps. I got a really interesting range of answers.

1. They are invisible. Since people can’t see these unlike EVs and solar roofs it’s hard to know who else has one how “normal” they are and if your friends and neighbors are buying them. People don’t talk much about their water heaters so it’s hard to learn about them.

2. They are invisible. A different take on their invisibility is that since people can’t see them there is less social pressure to get one to show your friends that you aren’t burning gas for your showers. You can’t “virtue signal” with a water heater.

3. The installers are the problem. The “influencers” the installers contractors architects and builders are conservative with a “Go with what you know” attitude. Josie Gaillard an Environmental Quality Commissioner in Menlo Park estimates that “80% of installers will try to talk you out of it.” We certainly don’t see that with EV sales.

4. The installers are the problem. An informed take on the reason for installer pushback is that there are few qualified installers. Zach Liske who owns a company that represents clean energy product manufacturers said installation is “the bane of the industry. There are few trained installers. Our culture dissuades young people from going into the trades and the diminished unions aren’t doing any training. So techs aren’t trained and there’s no place for training.” (His company Flow Tech is helping to fix that.)

5. Electric work is needed. Most heat pump water heaters need a 240V circuit and possibly other electrical work though it can be reduced with the right choices. This means that the fuel switching can take longer and cost more to install. Update (July 2022): Rheem now has two 120-volt models available.

Interestingly I heard a pretty different list when I talked with people who aren’t particularly familiar with these water heaters. They echoed questions about cost but also raised concerns about placement and noise. I am going to address placement and noise below and cost in a follow-up blog. For now I’ll just say that these need not be major obstacles in most cases. The trick is to find a qualified installer and minimize your electrical work.

A Virtual Tour of Heat Pump Water Heaters

Before delving into more tips and pointers I want you to see what they look like in our homes how they have been installed..

Some installations look like this one in Barron Park where the heat pump water heater replaced a gas water heater in a small closet. In this particular case a garage had been converted to a family room years ago and space for the gas tank water heater was carved off in a small closet.



50 gallon heat pump water heater in exterior closet

The main elements of the water heater are shown in the annotated photo below.

The heat pump draws in air extracts the heat (with the help of a refrigerant) to warm the water and blows out cooler air. You can see in this installation that the air intake is drawn from the attic (A) where the air is generally warmer than it is outside. That makes the heat pump more efficient. The cooler air that is emitted leaves through a small vent in the closet door (D).

You can also see that the top portion of the appliance holds the heat pump and the bottom part holds the water (C). The hot water floats on top of the cold water so the pipe carrying hot water out leaves from the top of the water area (B) and the cold water coming in enters at the bottom (I). This allows a user to draw hot water from the tank even when all the water is not yet hot.

A few additional lines leaving from the tank include a condensation line (G) and a relief valve line (H). The water heater needs to be placed somewhere where these can drain (in this case through the exterior wall).

You can listen to the sound that this tank makes here. The heat pump is turned off towards the end of the 15-second clip so you can hear the difference. It is a low steady sound something like a microwave might make. This heat pump is rated at 49 decibels. It is located adjacent to a room where the homeowners like to listen to music and watch TV. The wall is not insulated (it is actually a hollow door that separates the two) and they could hear the hum inside sounding like one of the speakers might be on. So they adjusted the schedule of the heater so it didn’t go on in the evening when they are in that room.

Below is a picture of a similar installation this one in Midtown.



80 gallon heat pump water heater installed in exterior closet

In this case both the air inflow and outflow are through louvres in the door and adjacent exterior wall (not shown). I asked the homeowner if she had adjusted the schedule and she confessed that she hadn’t even downloaded the app. “It just works” was her overall impression. She said that if she listened for the hum she could hear it inside but it was really not noticeable (unlike the wine refrigerator they had installed…). She also mentioned that her family of four with two teenage boys never runs out of hot water. In fact at one point they had five houseguests and they still did not run out of hot water though they were thoughtful when planning their showers. This installation has an 80-gallon tank. (BTW can you see one oversight in this installation that would make it more efficient?)

Other installations I looked at had the heat pumps in the garage. Below are a few examples. The older model on the left has water inflow and outflow from the top of the tank. The middle one is a more complicated setup due to a solar hot water installation. The one on the right has been in some real-world tours as you can see from the signs!



50 gallon heat pump water heaters of various vintages installed in garages

Two of the homeowners mentioned that their garage is cooler when the heat pump is running which can be great in the summer and less great in the winter if you are working in your garage. You can hear the sound of the middle pump and the right pump. (We were not able to turn off the pump in that first video.) The GeoSpring heat pump on the left is the loudest of the three and is the oldest model though good wall insulation meant it was not noticeable inside.

Tips from Heat Pump Water Heater Installers

As far as I can tell the installations are pretty straight-forward. You need access to a 240v circuit and a place for drainage. If the heat pump is located near a sound-sensitive space the homeowner can set a schedule or add some insulation or soundproofing to the adjacent wall. Maintenance is minimal with an easy-to-access air filter that could be cleaned out every year or so. And the garage or utility closet feels safer with one less gas appliance. The most important tips that I heard from installers were:

– Plan ahead. Some installations cannot be done in a matter of hours. A 240V circuit with adequate current is sometimes easy to set up but sometimes more involved. Finding a good space for the heater can take some time if you currently have a tankless version. Home Depot or your contractor may not have the heat pump heater that you want since these are still relatively new. Look into replacing your water heater before it fails for example when it is 8-10 years old. Or at least set up the appropriate circuitry. The longest lead time (and expense) happens if you need to upgrade your electrical panel. That can take months but fortunately it is rarely necessary especially with newer low-powered options.

– Choose a model that uses only 15 amps. This will make it easier for the heat pump water heater to fit into your electric panel. There is almost no downside to the 15-amp models. Menlo Park Environmental Quality Commissioner Tom Kabat insists “California should just outlaw the 30 amp models.” Kabat has developed considerable skill in finding room in electric panels. You can learn more about his tips in this video. You can also download Kabat’s “Watt Diet Calculator” spreadsheet. (3)

– Consider a 120-volt model. If you live in a temperate climate one of Rheem’s two new 120-volt models might make sense for you. These significantly reduce the electrical installation work needed. One model works with any standard electrical outlet and one requires a dedicated 120-volt 15-amp circuit. They may take longer to refill than the 240-volt models but to mitigate that one model has an extra large compressor for faster refill speed and the other (Hydroboost) model has a mixing valve (see below) to reduce the emptying rate. Review the specs to see if one of these is a good fit for you.

– Choose a larger size than you might normally choose. Since heat pump water heaters warm water more slowly than a gas-fired water tank additional gallons can serve as a buffer.

– Consider installing a mixing valve. This allows you to heat your water to higher temperatures and then mix the extra-hot water with cold on the way out effectively increasing the size of your tank. (4) It also allows you to schedule the tank to run during cheap electricity hours and then have it idle during the more expensive hours though in practice the hot water won’t lose much heat over the expensive period anyway.

Installers Rebates and Costs

You can find plenty of information from your local utility about heat pump water heaters and rebates:

– Silicon Valley Clean Energy has a helpful guide linked from their webpage. They offer a $2000 rebate to replace a gas heater plus an additional $1500 if you need to upgrade your panel.

– Peninsula Clean Energy’s webpage is here. They offer a $2500 rebate (you need to use a BayRen-approved contractor) plus an additional $750-$1500 if you need to upgrade your panel.

– The City of Palo Alto provides information here. They offer a $1200-$1500 rebate.

Silicon Valley Clean Energy has a terrific spreadsheet of installations that you can download to get an idea of contractors and prices. (I will discuss costs in more detail in the next blog post.) The Bay Area Regional Energy Network (BayREN) provides a list of qualified contractors among other things. And the new SwitchIsOn initiative from California’s Building Decarbonization Coalition has information about rebates contractors and more for all kinds of electrification including heat pump water heaters.

From what I have seen and learned heat pumps are a terrific and simple alternative to gas fired water heaters. But in many cases they will cost $1000 more even with the rebates. That is largely because of installation costs including electrical work and permits. The homeowners I spoke with acknowledged the additional expense but felt it was a relatively minor investment in exchange for decreasing their home’s emissions by 33% for all the years to come. A $1000 environmental donation might instead be diverted to a heat pump water heater installation this year. It’s not deductible but it supports the burgeoning local clean energy industry while carving away at your home’s emissions. There is also an interesting new study from Nature Energy showing that heat pump heaters may in fact boost home sales prices. I will talk more about costs in the next blog post. See also my posts on price gouging and how to combat it and what to do if you get a noisy Rheem heat pump water heater.

I’d love to hear your questions about these appliances or any other stories or tips you have to share. I’d like to give a special thank you to homeowners Bryna Chang David Coale Cedric de La Beaujardiere Larry Reeves and John Sack for taking the time to introduce me to their water heaters with particular thanks to David Coale for arranging most of these visits.

Notes and References

1. Gas water heaters use about one-third of the gas in our homes resulting in about one-third of our home’s carbon footprint.

2. The bills are much lower if you have your own solar power. Otherwise they are just “a little” lower. More on this in the next blog post.

3. I plan to do a post on electric panels at some point. They are increasingly important parts of our homes that we need to understand and either upgrade or adjust to fully electrify. More tools are becoming available to allow homeowners to make better use of their panels.

4. This mixing valve is required if the tank is used as a backup for solar hot water since that water enters the tank very hot.

5. Nearly all of the homeowners I spoke with were using a Rheem heat pump water heater. You can find an informative brochure with some comparison information on the last page here. The City of Palo Alto has a spreadsheet with some comparison specs here. SVCE’s “Appliance Assistant” for heat pump water heaters is here. There is also a lot of good information on CleanTechnica though the page is several years old.

Patricia Gallagher 64 entered a plea of not guilty Jan. 8 in Lake County Court to a charge of driving under the influence.

Two Fruitland Park police vehicles had been involved in a traffic stop shortly before 9 p.m. New Year’s Eve at the intersection of County Road 466A and Drake Drive with their emergency red-and-blue lights flashing. Gallagher attempted to turn onto Drake Drive even though there was not enough room for her vehicle to pass through due to the police cars involved in the traffic stop. She came “within inches” of hitting one of the patrol cars according to an arrest report from the Fruitland Park Police Department.

When officers spoke with the Ohio native they noted her speech was slurred and her face was flushed. When asked if she had been drinking she said she had consumed “one vodka soda.”

Officers asked her to participate in field sobriety exercises on Drake Drive and put down solid white two-inch tape for the walk-and-turn portion of the test. She failed the exercises and was handcuffed.

She provided two breath samples both registering .170 blood alcohol content. She remains free on $1000 bond.

A local Chilliwack charity will be able to help even more at-risk and homeless youth thanks to a donation from a Canadian foundation.

A total of $7230.85 was raised for Chilliwack Community Services as a result of The Home Depot Canada Foundation’s Orange Door Project in December 2020.

Nationwide the annual fundraiser in support of critical housing and support programs for at-risk and homeless youth in communities across Canada brought in a total of $1162195.

Funds came from in-store and online donations at several Home Depot locations across Canada and all the money raised at each store stays within that community.

Here in Chilliwack customers donated $5230.85 and The Home Depot contributed an additional $2000 for Chilliwack Community Services.

In B.C. more than $190000 will be distributed to 26 charities throughout the province.

“This year has been challenging for so many Canadians and I want to thank all of our customers for their generous donations” said Pamela O’Rourke chair board of directors The Home Depot Canada Foundation and vice president of merchandising The Home Depot Canada. “Our charity partners urgently need support which is why 100 per cent of every customer donation stays in the community it was raised to support local at-risk and homeless youth.”

The Orange Door Project took place between Dec. 1 and 20 2020. The funds raised are distributed to 125 organizations across Canada that are committed to preventing and ending youth homelessness. The Home Depot Canada contributed an additional $2000 on behalf of each store to address COVID-19’s impact on charitable organizations.

In a November 2020 survey of its charity partners 87 per cent reported there has been increased demand for services since the pandemic began. Of that group 80 per cent found it’s more challenging to provide effective services under the current conditions and one hundred per cent feel that donations are needed now more than ever.

About The Home Depot Canada Foundation:

The Home Depot Canada Foundation is committed to helping prevent and put an end to youth homelessness in Canada. On any given night more than 6000 young people are without a place to call home making youth homelessness one of the most urgent social issues facing Canadians today. Through The Orange Door Project initiative the foundation has pledged $50 million by the end of 2022 to improve housing options support life-skills development programs and invest in research that ensures funding is directed to the most effective solutions designed to help youth build brighter futures.

Orton is a project manager for Honeywell for whom he’s worked the past 10 years after previously interning with the company while attending WPI.

Based in his hometown at a field office on Grove Street Orton oversees energy saving and renewable energy projects across the city that have employed more than 400 workers since Worcester signed a 20-year multimillion deal with Honeywell in 2011.

“I manage the installation team coordinate schedules have access to all the buildings and report the status to customers among other things” Orton 33 said Wednesday. “But primarily I’m responsible that the scope of the project gets completed within the schedule we promised the customer.”

Those projects have included converting all 14000 street lights in Worcester to LED installing solar panels at nearly a dozen schools and turning the Greenwood Street landfill into a 92-acre solar farm.

“I really enjoy the job” said Orton who has also worked on projects in Grafton and Boston. “It’s a lot of out-of-the-office type of work. I’m in the field on a daily basis and I get to see a lot of new people and experience a lot of new projects so it’s good.”

Orton gave basketball and baseball brief tries and played volleyball for three years at North but it was football where he carved out his athletic legacy.

After suiting up each week but seeing limited varsity action as a freshman for a 9-2 team Orton went on to start every game at quarterback over his final three seasons.

He teamed up with the likes of Shawn Jackson Anthony Ustinovich Jermaine Watkins John Pepi and Anthony Black to lead the Polar Bears to records of 12-0 10-1 and 11-1 including a pair of Super Bowl victories. That’s a cumulative mark of 33-2 for a sterling winning percentage of .943.

“A lot of pride in that” Orton said. “Those were really some of the best days of my life. I wish I could go back and relive it. I haven’t played football in a long time but wish I could suit up again. It was a great time.”

Orton played tight end for the Worcester Cowboys youth teams before his coach in need of a quarterback asked one day who knew the plays. Orton raised his hand and was soon handing off.

But when he arrived at North Orton hoped to play running back. Coach Mike Ross would have none of it seeing Orton’s athleticism humbleness and unselfishness as good reasons to have him direct the Polar Bears’ double-wing offense following a one-year apprenticeship.

“He did what he had to do to be a teammate” Ross said. “Some kids wouldn’t have liked it but he did what was best for the team. And what was best for the team was to play quarterback.

“He was a better runner than thrower for sure but he was a stud. And he’s a success (today).”

Orton who checked in at 5-foot-9 and 185 pounds rushed for 722 yards and eight touchdowns and passed for 712 yards and nine TDs as a senior. But a closer look reveals his big-play ability as he averaged 12 yards a carry and while attempting about three passes a game 42 yards per completion.

“Our passing scheme when we did pass was the deep ball” Orton said. “We’d only throw a couple of times a game but it would be downfield for 30 40 yards at a time.”

The Polar Bears had never been to a Super Bowl and hadn’t gone undefeated in 45 years when they accomplished both feats in 2002. But it was a game earlier that season that remains the most memorable moment of Orton’s high school career.

Senior running back John Connolly scored a touchdown early in the fourth quarter to pull the Polar Bears within a point at 7-6 of crosstown rival Voke in a Week 2 matchup. Ross elected to go for two and called for Connolly to get the carry.

Here’s where Orton who was a sophomore at the time picks up the story and — spoiler alert — the ball.

“At the snap I kind of fumbled the ball and missed the handoff to the running back John Connolly” he began. “The ball fell on the ground and I picked it up and scrambled for the pylon and was able to save the score. That won it and it was huge for the team.”

In addition to quarterback Orton also started at cornerback on defense and contributed on special teams as a kick and punt returner long snapper holder on extra points and member of the kick coverage unit.

He was named to the T&G Super Team on defense as a senior.

“As long as the varsity was in I was on the field” Orton said. “I always had a position.”

After graduating from North with honors in 2005 Orton headed off to study mechanical engineering and play football at WPI.

Orton initially was used at defensive back by the Engineers before being switched — finally! — to running back as a sophomore scoring four touchdowns in nine games. A torn hamstring limited him to 20 carries and six games as a junior in 2007 a year during which he married his high school sweetheart Amanda Friend and became a dad.

That brought a close to his football career.

“I made that pretty tough decision to put football aside to provide for the family” said Orton who held jobs on and off campus as a senior before graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering in 2009.

With job prospects bleak during the Great Recession Orton returned to WPI and doubled up on his class load earning his master’s in one year. He worked for General Dynamics Electric Boat for a year before landing with Honeywell.

Orton and his wife reside in Worcester where they own a two-family home on Grafton Hill and are proud parents to three creative and active children: Alivia 13 Ayla 8; and Alix Jr. 6 who goes by AJ.

Alivia really enjoys art and music; Ayla attends the Gymnastics Learning Center in Shrewsbury and did very well in her first competition on New Year’s Eve; and AJ is into baseball the lefty having got a taste of the game playing T-ball in the Jack Barry Little League along with golf.

Holstein said this after the board hosted a presentation on school board ethics by New Jersey School Boards Association representative Kathy Helewa.

The presentation followed the board's recent enactment of a policy ordering Capone to limit his use of the school's phone alert system to emergencies and other priority communications. The policy was passed after he sent robocalls criticizing individual board members by name over some of their votes.

Capone however has since taken to social media where he again criticized the board member who first proposed that policy. His Facebook post on Tuesday stated that the board member as well as a district parent critical of some of his actions had been non-renewed from their teaching positions in other districts.

Holstein observed that Capone's comments were posted using a Facebook account set up as ""Timothy C. Capone CSA"" and described as ""a page for communication from the Superintendent"" raising the additional question of whether they were written in his official capacity as chief school administrator.

At a Montague board meeting Capone accused some members of violating school board ethics by publicly discussing these concerns. Several residents responded that it was hypocritical of Capone to criticize people publicly while demanding that criticism of him be kept private and urged the board to put a stop to his ""bashing.""

Parent Stephanie Guida said many have other concerns including when the school will reopen as well as the botched implementation of a federally funded meals program enacted in response to COVID-19. The school has not had in-person classes since last March but fear of being called out by Capone is discouraging parents from bringing these and other concerns to the board's attention she said.

Holstein said the board is looking to develop ""a strong policy"" on social media use by the superintendent and other school officials. The policy also is expected to address how the superintendent communicates with board members.

""Nobody at this table should be writing about each other on social media. I think that's completely inappropriate"" said board member Danielle Christmann.

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Strategic divestitures and a focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels position Host for competitive advantage.

Recent acquisitions signal a forward-looking growth strategy amidst a challenging economic landscape.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands.

Operating profit surged by 17.3% and the operating profit margin under GAAP improved by 180 basis points to 19.8%.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4 percent on the property’s 2024 estimated results. Other terms were not disclosed.

The property is expected to be among Host’s top-25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results with expected combined RevPAR of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $585502 further improving the quality of the company’s portfolio.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

The Property has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75 percent suite mix. It offers seven separate food and beverage outlets including Harriet’s Rooftop which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City’s skyline in an elevated nightlife setting. Among other amenities the property has a Bamford Wellness spa with six treatment rooms two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space including a 9400 square foot ballroom and 9300 square feet of pre-function space.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTE1Mzc0NTIwL2hvc3QtaG90ZWxzLWJ1eXMtMS1ob3RlbC1uYXNodmlsbGUtZW1iYXNzeS1zdWl0ZXMtZm9yLTUzMC1taWxsaW9uLWNhc2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels Buys 1 Hotel Nashville Embassy Suites for $530 Million Cash,"Host Hotels & Resorts bought the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for $530 million in an all-cash deal.

The Bethesda Maryland-based hotel real estate investment trust said in a news release that the price represents a 12.6-times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or a capitalization rate of approximately 7.4% on the property's estimated 2024 results.

The sellers of the properties were Starwood Capital Group Crescent Real Estate and High Street Real Estate Partners.

1 Hotels is a brand under SH Hotels & Resorts which is the operator of the 1 Hotel Nashville. Starwood Capital owns SH Hotels & Resorts. Davidson Hospitality Group operates the Embassy Suites property.

Host Hotels expects the hotel will be among its top 25 properties based on estimated full-year results. It has an expected combined revenue per available room of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $58550.

Host President and CEO James Risoleo said in the release REIT executives are excited to add both properties to the portfolio. The property built in 2022 has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had a RevPAR compound annual growth rate of 7.7% from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply.

Risoleo also cited the popularity of Nashville as a leisure destination and its No. 2 ranking as a convention destination in the U.S.

""With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the property will generate outsize growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders"" he said.

Wearables Are Real — Even At Virtual CES Are wearables real if you can’t see them and wear them in person at CES? Fortunately the answer is yes they are very real and there were plenty on display at this year’s virtual CES 2021. Wearable technology on display at this year’s CES ranged from fitness trackers and hearables to smartwatches and augmented reality glasses. [Related: 20 Hot New Products At CES 2021] While many of the wearable devices are geared toward consumers some of them are designed to address various health problems including stress and urinary incontinence. What follows are the coolest wearable technologies that made waves at CES 2021 this week.

Cove Cove is marketed as a “stress-canceling” wearable that sends gentle vibrations behind the ears to “activate the part of the brain that regulates emotions.” The device’s maker Feelmore Labs said Cove should be used 20 minutes a day to improve the user’s ability to deal with stress and that it can be used during other activities. The company said Cove is based on research by experts in neuromodulation mood disorders and sleep science. In clinical studies the company said 90 percent of 3500 participants using Cove reported 41 percent stress reduction and 50 percent sleep quality improvement. Cove connects to a companion app for setup and tracking use. The device is available now and it costs $490.

Bioheart The Bioheart is a personal heart monitor that vendor Biotricity calls an industry-first providing individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease the ability to monitor and track heart performance. The device is worn using a breathable chest band and it uses dry lead electrodes to collect ECG data. Biotricity said the device — which also collects data on respiration physical activity and calorie burn — is the only one that provides continuous three-channel recording of ECG data unlike other devices that only use one channel and do not record continuously. The device will be available for $199 in June.

Fossil Gen 5 LTE Touchscreen Fossil used CES 2021 to introduce its Gen 5 LTE Touchscreen Smartwatch an Android-based device that is the company’s first product in the cellular wearables market. The Fossil Gen 5 LTE Touchscreen leverages LTE connectivity from Verizon the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100 platform and Google’s Wear OS to let users make calls and do texting without a mobile phone. When an additional data plan is purchased from Verizon the watch can be synced to the user‘s mobile phone for voice and text using the same number as the mobile phone. The Gen 5 LTE Touchscreen Smartwatch can also be set up either in-store or remotely via the integrated eSIM chip.

Innovo The Innovo is an FDA-approved non-invasive wearable from Atlantic Therapeutics that uses neuromuscular electrical stimulation to exercise the pelvic floor to treat urinary incontinence and bladder weakness. Atlantic Therapeutics said 80 percent of Innovo users have reported a significant improvement in bladder issues after four weeks and 87 percent of users reported being dry or near dry after 12 weeks. The wearable is worn like a pair of shorts and it comes with a handheld device for 30-minute Kegel exercising session. The device is available for $449.95.

Jabra Elite 85t Jabra showcased its Jabra Elite 85t wireless earbuds featuring Active Noise Cancellation which can be adjusted from fully transparent to complete noise cancellation. The earbuds include six microphones and offers wind protection for clarity — plus it has a battery life of up to 5.5 hours. The Elite 85t earbuds can also be charged via their compact charging case or via a Qi-certified wireless charging device. At CES 2021 Jabra introduced four new colors for the earbuds — black grey gold/beige and copper/black—which join the previously released titanium black model. The ear buds cost $229.99.

Jlab JBuds Frames Jlab Audio used CES 2021 to introduce its new JBuds Frames a device that discretely attaches to a user’s glasses to provide wireless stereo audio on the go. The JBuds Frames consist of two independently operating Bluetooth wireless audio devices which include 16mm drivers that produce sound that can only be heard by the wearer not by others. In addition the device can easily be detached and mounted on other frames when needed. The device costs $49 and will be available in the spring.

HP Elite Wireless Earbuds HP used CES 2021 to launch its first-ever earbuds product the HP Elite Wireless Earbuds with a focus on enabling collaboration for business users. The earbuds offer Active Noise Cancellation presets for different environments and customized sound tuning using an app that calibrates the earbuds to the user’s hearing profile. The HP Elite Wireless Earbuds also feature the ability to connect to multiple devices—across Windows 10 iOS macOS and Android—and enable simplified switching between devices. The HP Elite Wireless Earbuds are expected to be available in April.

Lenovo ThinkReality A3 Lenovo used CES 2021 to launch a new version of its augmented-reality smart glasses with the debut of the ThinkReality A3. The device is aimed at enabling improved workflows and training—for instance by overlaying information atop the real-world view to assist with the task at hand. The ThinkReality A3 represents “one of the most advanced and versatile enterprise smart glasses to come to market” Lenovo says. The company announced several variants of the smart glasses including the ThinkReality A3 PC Edition which tethers to a Lenovo ThinkPad laptop or mobile workstation. This version of the smart glasses can display customized “virtual monitors” which enable the use of Windows applications that are placed in the user’s field of view. The virtual monitors “expand the value of PCs creating more productivity privacy and immersive experiences for industries like finance architecture and engineering” as well as for remote and mobile workers who have limited space Lenovo said. Meanwhile with the ThinkReality A3 Industrial Edition—which tethers to certain Motorola smartphones—provides AR support for tasks in challenging work environments. Lenovo ThinkReality A3 smart glasses are expected to be available in mid-2021.

Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro Along with unveiling its Galaxy S21 series Samsung this week announced its latest pair of wireless earbuds the Galaxy Buds Pro. With Active Noise Cancellation an 11 mm woofer and a 6.5 mm tweeter the Galaxy Buds Pro provide “Samsung’s best audio experience yet” the company said. Several improvements with the Galaxy Buds Pro are targeted at those using the earbuds for work purposes including with features such as a Voice Pickup Unit and the inclusion of three microphones to enable the user to be heard clearly. One mic on the earbuds comes with a high signal-to-noise ratio to further reduce background noise while the Galaxy Buds Pro also come with Samsung’s “wind shield” technology. Another key feature is that the earbuds can detect when you are speaking—and can automatically turn down your music when you do so. On battery life the Galaxy Buds Pro offer up to eight hours of usage on a charge with 20 additional hours available in the charging case. The Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro are available starting today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvcmV2aWV3cy9ocC1zcGVjdHJlLXgzNjAtMTQtcmV2aWV3LWZpbmFsbHktMzItZGlzcGxheXMtYXJlLWNvbWluZy10by1tb3JlLWRldmljZXMv0gFkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmVvd2luLm5ldC9hbXAvaHAtc3BlY3RyZS14MzYwLTE0LXJldmlldy1maW5hbGx5LTMyLWRpc3BsYXlzLWFyZS1jb21pbmctdG8tbW9yZS1kZXZpY2VzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Spectre x360 14 review: Finally 3:2 displays are coming to more devices,"Back in October HP announced a refresh for its smaller Spectre x360 PCs which is typically just the 13.3-inch model. But for the first time the company introduced the Spectre x360 14. Now you might be thinking that the '14' indicates that it has a 14-inch display. It doesn't; rather it indicates that '13' is already taken as this PC actually has a 13.5-inch screen.

It's not just any 13.5-inch screen though. It's got a 3:2 aspect ratio something popularized by Microsoft's Surface PCs. In fact taller screens are becoming more and more common throughout the industry. HP also has an OLED option a first for a 13.5-inch screen.

Of course that's not all that's new here. It has Intel's 11th-generation processors with Iris Xe graphics Thunderbolt 4 and more.

Day one

Design

I've said this many times before but HP's Spectre x360 series is the sexiest line of PCs on the market. Honestly these are great laptops but the design is absolutely a differentiator. This is the type of PC that if you use it in public people are going to notice it. It's a long way away from the boring old MacBook clones that we still see a lot of and it's really impressive how it's evolved over the years.

The color of the model that HP sent me is called Poseidon Blue and it has Pale Bronze accents. This is actually the first time that the company has sent me a Poseidon Blue Spectre which is pretty cool. It also comes in Nightfall Black with Copper Luxe accents and that one is also stunning. And finally there's boring old Natural Silver a color that HP actually killed off one year and then brought back due to popular demand.

The Pale Bronze accents actually look silver so it's very pale. You'll notice the chrome-colored HP logo stamped in the lid. You can also see the Pale Bronze hinges in the image above; what you can't really see is that the sides are also this color along with other parts.

It also has gem-cut edges adding to the style that you find in the Spectre x360. Note that this design is the same as we saw with the last couple of generations of the Spectre x360 14 just adapted for the larger form factor.

You'll notice on the right side that there's a microSD slot a 3.5mm audio jack and one USB Type-C port. That USB Type-C port is Thunderbolt 4 which frankly isn't all that different from Thunderbolt 3. They both support 40Gbps data transfer speeds or up to two 4K monitors on a single port. The difference is that Thunderbolt 3 had a minimum spec that used two lanes instead of four supporting half of that and there was no easy way to know what you were buying. HP always supported the full spec so nothing is really changing here. That's a good thing by the way.

Tucked in the corner there is a second Thunderbolt 4 port. The cool thing about that one is that it's designed to keep the cable out of your way and you can fold the display back without the cable getting in your way as well.

On the left side there's a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A port which gets speeds of 5Gbps. If you're unfamiliar with USB 3.2 Gen 1 you might know it better as USB 3.1 Gen 1 or USB 3.0 because they're exactly the same and it just keeps getting rebranded. I'd like to have seen USB 3.2 Gen 2 (or USB 3.1 Gen 2) on here. After all this is a premium laptop and other PCs are getting it so I'm not sure why we're getting last-gen ports.

Also notice that while one of the back corners has a USB Type-C port the other corner is empty. In previous designs there was a power button here but this has been moved to the keyboard.

But most importantly this convertible laptop is sexy. When it comes down to a laptop that I want to carry with me the Spectre x360 is it and a big part of that is because of the design.

Display and audio

Like I said earlier the Spectre x360 14 has a 13.5-inch 3:2 display. If you don't like taller displays don't worry because the Spectre x360 13 was refreshed alongside this. You can still get a 13.3-inch 16:9 screen if that's what you want. Keep in mind though that this isn't just 0.2 inches larger. Screens are measured diagonally so the change in aspect ratio means that it's actually a much bigger display and it's 25.6mm taller.

This is also a better aspect ratio for portrait orientation. The wider screen is great for a laptop use case but this is a convertible. This is meant to be used as a tablet just as much as a PC. Now it feels more natural that way.

There's also an app pre-installed called HP Display Control which has different settings for the display. This something that the company started using when it introduced OLED displays on its Spectre lineup because while OLED produces vibrant beautiful colors they're not necessarily accurate. HP's display calibration software solved that issue and now it's available for all screens.

The viewing angle is a full 178 degrees meaning that you can look at it from any angle without any visible distortion. Also it's worth noting that this display does come in a 4K OLED variant. While we're starting to see more and more 3:2 laptops hit the market this is the only one I've seen with an OLED option. I believe that HP did send OLED to some reviewers but not this one. The company did say it was working on getting me one a few weeks ago but frankly I couldn't hold back this review any longer.

Also there's a 1000-nit Sure View Reflect option. That's HP's privacy screen technology which is designed to prevent people from looking over your shoulder and being able to see what's on your screen.

Once again HP partnered up with Bang & Olufsen for the speakers of which where are four. There's a speaker bar right above the keyboard something that actually went away on the 13.3-inch model thanks to the footprint shrinking so much. But thanks to the taller display on the 13.5-inch version it's almost like HP can just use the old chassis.

There are also speakers underneath the device. That way no matter what orientation you're using the Spectre x360 in you have sound firing at you.

The speakers are loud and they're clear creating a pretty solid media consumption experience. Whether you're listening to music at your desk or you're playing a game this gets the job done.

Keyboard and trackpad

The keyboard spans edge to edge on the deck and it's the same as it is on the 16:9 one. Like I said the key difference is that it once again has the speakers above it. This keyboard has grown into being one of my favorites for a consumer PC. HP had originally produced what I believe to be the best keyboard on a laptop in its EliteBook 1000 series but now it's bringing it to more devices.

The keys don't feel wobbly at all and they seem to have the perfect amount of resistance to be comfortable. It's also a particularly quiet keyboard something that's really nice if you're like me and tend to hit the keys too hard at times.

HP also moved a lot of other parts to the keyboard. There's no switch on the side of the chassis for a physical camera shutter anymore and like I said above there's no power button on the corner anymore. The way the camera shutter works has changed too. Previously HP disconnected it internally an elegant solution that probably wasn't convincing enough for a feature that's designed out of distrust. Now it disconnects it internally but it also shows a physical block over the camera.

The fingerprint sensor is part of the keyboard now too. Previously it was to the bottom-right of the keyboard. Adding these keys to the keyboard is a design change that we're seeing across HP's lineup.

The touchpad is a Microsoft Precision touchpad something that HP took longer than its competitors to adopt. That means that it's faster it's more responsive and it supports the gestures that you're used to.

Performance and battery life

The Spectre x360 14 that HP sent me includes an Intel Core i7-1165G7 and 16GB RAM. The CPU is a quad-core chip with eight threads from the Tiger Lake family. Tiger Lake is Intel's second-generation 10nm family the first of which was Ice Lake so the process has been refined a bit.

But also it includes new Iris Xe graphics. Last year's Ice Lake chips began a focus from Intel on its integrated graphics so that's being taken to a new level now. Yes you can play FHD games on this machine and it's pretty impressive. I'm doing things on thin and light PCs that I'd previously never have done without dedicated graphics.

And if you do need dedicated graphics you can use Thunderbolt 4 to plug in an external GPU. That's a major benefit of Thunderbolt which is more or less exclusive to Intel PCs. You can take this on the go and have the power of Iris Xe graphics and bring it home to a desktop setup that has two 4K monitors and an external GPU all running off of the two Thunderbolt 4 ports.

For battery life that's impressive as well. Doing regular work I got at least eight hours out of it although I wasn't able to stretch it to 10 hours. This is with the power slider one notch above battery saver and the display brightness at 50%. Of course this is the FHD model so that number will suffer if you get the UHD OLED model or the 1000-nit Sure View configuration. One thing that I can say about HP is that it absolutely cares about battery life in its products and it rarely lets me down. This is definitely among the best battery life in its class.

For benchmarks I used PCMark 8 PCMark 10 and Geekbench 5.



Conclusion

HP's Spectre x360 is my favorite family of PCs just because they're so unique and sexy. Now that the smaller model comes with a 3:2 display I'll tell you what I really want. I want HP to do this with the larger 15-inch model. Give me something with a 45W CPU and dedicated graphics with a bigger 3:2 display but I digress.

My only complaints are that it's using a last-gen USB Type-A port and also that there's no cellular option. HP did announce the Spectre x360 5G at the same time that it announced this but that's still using the 16:9 display. If you want 3:2 there's no cellular option for the first time in years.

But this is an awesome PC even aside from the design that I can hardly get over. I'm happy to see the speakers return to the keyboard deck and speaking of the keyboard this is probably my new favorite on a consumer laptop. It's phenomenal.

Everything about the Spectre x360 14 is phenomenal and as always I totally recommend it. You can find it on Hp.com here.

HUBB,Hubbell Incorporated,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlYW11c2EuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9qYW51YXJ5LzE3L2h1YmJlbGwtZG9ub2h1ZS13cmVzdC11cy1pY2UtZGFuY2UtdGl0bGUtZnJvbS1jaG9jay1iYXRlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hubbell Donohue Wrest U.S. Ice Dance Title From Chock Bates,"Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue compete during the U.S. Figure Skating Championships at the Orleans Arena on Jan. 16 2021 in Las Vegas Nevada.

The decade-long ice dance rivalry between Madison Chock and Evan Bates and Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue wrote yet another chapter in Las Vegas.

While their style and athletic strengths are different rarely have teams been more closely matched competitively. Both have won two world medals. Since 2018 they have trained together in Montreal sharing coaches Marie-France Dubreuil Patrice Lauzon and Romain Haguenauer.

When they arrived at the Orleans Arena for the 2021 U.S. Figure Skating Championships part of the Team USA Champions Series presented by Xfinity each couple had won two U.S. titles. And following Friday’s rhythm dance the teams were in nearly a dead heat.

Now Hubbell and Donohue have bragging rights: following Saturday’s free dance they defeated their friends and training partners by 1.63 points about the margin of a missed twizzle (fast one-foot turn) by Bates.

“We all know it is tough to go back and forth year after year” Hubbell 29 said. “We know every year when we come to nationals or any other event it is going to be hard to beat one another. Last year we were there to give them a hug and this year they were there to give us a hug. We know that competitiveness will continue until we retire.”

After grappling with their material much of last season Hubbell and Donohue hit their stride this fall with a sensitive free-flowing and powerful free dance to a medley of the Jeff Buckley and k.d. lang renditions of “Hallelujah.”

Choreographed with two-time Olympic ice dance champion Scott Moir the program won rave reviews at Skate America in October and was far smoother and more emotionally captivating on Saturday. The seven judges assigned positive grade of execution marks across the board for all of its elements and it earned 134.90 points a new U.S. record for a free dance. Hubbell and Donohue’s total score 224.56 is also a new U.S. record.

“Third-time national champion has a really nice ring to it” said Hubbell who with Donohue also won the 2018 and 2019 titles. “We worked really hard this year and through all the struggles it’s actually been a really productive year for us. It was not the easiest performance for us tonight we definitely had to just keep calm and skate on but we couldn’t be happier to be here and have accomplished this big goal.”

Chock and Bates performed an inspired outing of the exotic intricate free dance they call “Egyptian Snake Dance.” While their lifts as usual were stunning highlights Bates fell out of a twizzle. The error likely cost them about two points. With Hubbell and Donohue bringing their “A” game the slight stumble was more than enough to lose the title they won for a second time last season. They also won the 2015 U.S. crown.

“I really don’t know what happened. Even reflecting back on it I didn’t feel like I did something to make it go haywire but it certainly did go haywire” Bates 31 said. “I just kept going the way we always do when we make mistakes in training.”

He added “It’s just part of being an athlete for many years you succeed sometimes and fail other times. I wouldn’t say today is a failure by any means but I certainly wish I had not made the mistake.”

Chock and Bates are fortunate they were even able to compete. Chock suffered a concussion in Montreal over the summer when dehydrated and having skipped breakfast she fell while out walking with Bates. She was off the ice for a month prompting the couple to withdraw from Skate America.

“Madi and Evan had quite a difficult time preparing for this competition” Lauzon said. “We weren’t sure if they were going to be able to come so I was proud of the performance that they put on the ice.”

Lauzon noted that all of his teams seemed more jittery than usual.

“I felt everyone was very nervous nobody has skated a lot this season” he said. “For everybody it’s been a difficult year to train. I could feel that nervousness so it made me nervous.”

The third team in the Montreal trio Kaitlin Hawayek and Jean-Luc Baker performed to a haunting remix of Blondie’s “Heart of Glass” and contemporary composer Philip Glass’ “First Movement.” The couple placed third in the free dance and ended the event with 212.55 points to win their third straight U.S. bronze medal.

Hawayek explained that instead of a story or character-driven program she and Baker wanted to create art that sprang from deep within.

“It’s a lot more rewarding at the end of the day for us to finish a program and feel like it came from within us out onto the ice and through our bodies than to hope that people understood a program” she said. “So that was the biggest step for us this year and it’s been really rewarding.”

Knierim Frazier Continue Ascent With First U.S. Title Together

The newly minted pair of Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier won the U.S. title by a whopping 22.81 points over training partners Jessica Calalang and Brian Johnson.

“We are elated with our performance” Knierim 29 said. “We are just very very pleased with it we are proud of what we put out there and we are excited for the future.”

“One year ago I was (in the media mixed zone) after my free program trying to fight back tears” Frazier 28 said. “Now I’m trying to fight back tears for a different reason.”

The skaters who teamed up last spring have taken the U.S. pair ranks by storm. In October at the same Orleans Arena the duo won Skate America.

On Saturday in their free skate to Andrea Bocelli and Matteo Bocelli’s “Fall on Me” they were even more polished and secure gaining fine ice coverage with their lifts and landing triple toe combinations and triple salchows as well as two huge triple throw jumps and a solid triple twist.

Their 150.64 point program gave them a scoring hat trick: new U.S. records for a pairs short program free skate and total score. They had to fight for it every step of the way.

“There were several elements like the death spiral that got real tight” Frazier said. “Toward the end our second lift didn’t have a good (lift) up so that was a fight there I wasn’t balanced well. During the choreographed steps a lot of emotions were going through us at that point. It was a long week and the body gets tired and we both just really had to reach down deep.”

The skaters have won a combined five U.S. titles: Knierim won three with husband Chris (2015 2018 2020) while Frazier is the 2017 U.S. champion with Haven Denney.

“Every time you win a national championship it means something different to you” Alexa Knierim said. “This one is extra special because it isn’t something we expected when we first teamed up. I am kind of speechless. If I can say anything at all it feels great to win with Brandon. And to be honest I felt like Chris was out there in my heart every glide of the way so I just feel fortunate to have two great guys who support me.”

Calalang and Johnson who train alongside Knierim and Frazier in Irvine California won their second straight silver medal with speedy refined program to the Tenors featuring Lindsey Stirling’s version of “Who Wants to Live Forever” but trouble with both sets of triple jumps as well as an uncharacteristic bobble on the dismount of their final lift likely cost them nearly 10 points. They placed third in the free skate and fourth overall with 205.29 points.

Last season as relatively new kids on the block — they teamed up in April 2018 — Calalang and Johnson were thrilled with their second-place finish. This time around they were disappointed.

“That performance was not exactly what we have been training for” Calalang 25 said. “There were quite a few mistakes in the program but we really tried to put them aside and keep our performance strong all of the way through.”

“All the hard work we put in this year on the expression skating skills stamina all that stuff was done really well” Johnson also 25 said. “So even though we might not have been the happiest with it in our minds we also showed improvement in many ways and we’re looking forward to adding on to that.”

This is the second consecutive season pairs coached by Jenni Meno and Todd Sand three-time U.S. champions who competed together at two Olympics (1994 1998) took home gold and silver and medals. Last season Alexa and Chris Knierim won their third U.S. title shortly before Chris retired from competition.

“Our hope is that both teams skate the absolute best they can and today that didn’t happen for Jessica and Brian but I think they will go away from this and they will learn something and it will make them stronger for the future” Meno said. “But we got the result we wanted for the teams first and second so we’re happy with that.”

No U.S. pair has won a medal at the world championships since Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman in 2002. The last U.S. Olympic pairs medal was in 1988 when Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard took bronze.

Meno and Sand want to change that.

“This is how they train at home what you saw this week” she said of Knierim and Frazier. “They will continue to develop as a team continue to get to know each other on the ice and continue to skate as one. There are so any things they can improve on to compete with the top teams in the world. That’s our goal to get the U.S. teams back on the podium at worlds and at the Olympics.”

The bronze medal went to Ashley Cain-Gribble and Timothy LeDuc who won the U.S. title in 2019.

The Texas-based skaters known for their tall matching lines placed second in the free skate with a sophisticated and dramatic program set to Rachmaninoff’s “Piano Concerto No. 2.” Their only major mistake was LeDuc’s fall on a triple loop and they amassed 200.52 points.

“In that performance I felt like I finally let go and became the athlete I know that I am” Cain-Gribble said. “I think this is a huge step forward in our building blocks for next season.”

“My partner coming off of the ice feeling like that is the biggest win I could get” LeDuc said.

Audrey Lu and Misha Mitrofanov who train at the Skating Club of Boston dropped from third place after the short program to fourth overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The only time they played together was at the 2020 California Cup where they finished third.

And now being back together seems like a breeze.

""This makes me so happy. First week of training complete and happy to be reunited with the team. Feels so good"" Humana-Paredes posted on her Instagram in early January.

Pavan also chimed in in her own Instagram account: ""It feels so good to be back on the sand with the team as we take on Olympic Pre season Part 2 week 1 is in the books.""

Before reuniting in 2021 Humana-Paredes had no access to beach volleyball. All throughout the lockdown in Canada she had to train by herself prepping for when she was able to meet Pavan on the sand once again.

""[I am] have really good routine and training really really hard in the gym. And this is the time to do that. Like this is the time for both Sarah and I to really put on strength and muscle and power so that when we reunite and we get back on the sand things start clicking like this"" she told Tokyo 2020 in December last year.

Despite many months of competition downtime Humana-Paredes says that Pavan and herself are keeping each other motivated.

""We have so much drive within both of us. We know individually what we need to work on and we know our role on the team. We also have a lot of accountability. And so a lot of the time when I'm thinking of training or improving myself and improving my game I'm also thinking about Sarah as well.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

She joined IBM as a systems engineer in Detroit in 1981 and stayed on for four decades. Ginni Rometty rose through the ranks and technical sales and then management jobs. In 2012 she became IBM CEO president and chair the first woman to hold the job in history after steering the company through major technological transformations and ups and downs from the rise of mobile to A.I. and the cloud. Ginni Rometty bids a fond farewell to one of the great loves of her life. This is her exit interview. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 former IBM CEO and chair Ginni Rometty. You are leaving IBM after an eight year tenure as CEO and nearly 40 years at the company. How does that feel. It's almost surreal in some ways. Obviously it's a company I loved. I wouldn't have stayed here for 40 years. So it feels like it's a great moment because we've just really been through quite a transformation. So on one way you're on one hand it's bittersweet. On another hand I leave with really great confidence for the company. What are you most nostalgic about and what are you most excited about. Well I'm certainly most nostalgic about the people in the platform of the company. I mean I really do believe IBM stands for the gold standard a good tech. And what we do most systems of the world wouldn't run without us. So it's the people that do that work. I'll be most nostalgic about and the clients who have been decades of relationships. But as well what I'm going to look forward to because it's I think it's been one of the great things I've had a chance to work on is a lot about making an inclusive workforce. So one of the things I'm going to do in my retirement is to lead up with Ken Frazier from Merck an initiative called 110 to place a million black employees over the next 10 years into our companies with 110. This organization you know three dozen or so companies is pledging to hire train and promote one million black workers over the course of 10 years. How did you come to be involved in this initiative. As I worked on the digital economy and saw a digital transformation what was happening to me it was really clearer. A large segment of top of the population will be left behind. So we had started some work which we can talk about on a bridging this education gap because we needed the employees too but they couldn't get college degrees fast enough. So was there another way to hire a whole swath of of of people out there that could be prepared with a high school degree and maybe an associate degree. So pause there. But then as the pandemic happened and then obviously with the killing of George Floyd and really coming back to the surface around systemic racism can Kenshin all from American Express. Ken Frazier of Merck as well as Charles Phillips and Kevin Scheer from Amgen came together and we all started saying what do we do best is companies. What we can do is hire people and economic opportunity is the best equalizer. That's just the beginning because then as the supply chains. And very simply it's just putting supply and demand together in all of the supply subscale for black employees. And we're going to help grow that. What do you think is broken about the way companies hire promote and train their workers. On one hand you have an education system that you may have gotten a lot of debt for an education yet you really don't have employable skills yet. So one is to work with the schools and then on the employee side. It's really breaking down a barrier of a perception that gee if I bring people into my company that don't have a college degree I'm in some form dumbing down the workforce. It's not true. I mean now that I've been at it eight nine 10 years what we've learned is that great aptitude just didn't have the same access as everyone else at the same time. These are our best employees. And by the way as they've been around lots of other people. Seventy five percent now have college degrees and we just had our first HD. So the biggest thing we're going to work with all the employers on is you've got to change your job recs. It is a systemic barrier meaning of every job you offer out there loose a whole set of college degrees required. You have completely blocked out large segments of the United States population. 60 percent of Americans do not have a college degree. Eighty percent of black Americans do not have a college degree. So you've just completely taken them off your radar screen. Now if you would change that and say higher skills first a different paradigm well then you're going to open your aperture to some great employees. And so when you say what is broke I think it's this view that it's a degree only versus skills first not just a degree. Do you think that companies and the tech industry in particular do they value differences in race differences in gender differences in age as much as they should. Well look the numbers don't lie about that. And so it be hard to answer that the system works. Right. But now look I do come from a company. I feel like I stand on the shoulders of giants on this topic. Right. It was eighteen ninety nine or one of our predecessor companies had their first woman and first black. Right. So it was 1935 equal pay 1953 equal opportunity. So I am used to that. All that said all of us have to do better. I mean I'm so proud. You know I mean we had record record diversity inclusion numbers in my last year and this year again at IBM. And so that takes though not one deed. To me it is like a million things that you have to be so consistent in. The word is authentic. You've got to authentically believe that this will make you a better company. It will make you know better innovation better products. And you know in my heart I believe that. And I think as a company in its DNA it believes that it. And how much does it it matters that the CEO is a leader that makes this a number one priority. I think it's imperative. Point blank and in fact actually the 110 initiative I'm working on it is only CEOs allowed in. So I don't mean that in an exclusionary sense. We mean it as if you're going to actually change paradigms remove barriers. You've got to have someone at the top say no no no this will be important. Diversity is a number. Inclusion is a choice. And you have to show people who make that choice over and over. Absolutely. You joined IBM in 1981 when Apple was in its infancy. Facebook Google Amazon didn't even exist yet. You have seen so many technological shifts whether it was the rise of the P.C. or smartphones or more recently the cloud. A.I. quantum computing. Which of these shifts has surprised you most or does anything surprise you anymore. I'm not sure anything surprises me anymore but I do think more current in this sort of last era. Not a surprise but it is absolutely the speed at which these have happened and that there's been multiple shifts at one time because you could say you saw cloud you saw mobility you see A.I. data all this at one time. And I think that's actually been what's made this digital transformation era the one that has had the most impact and most impact on IBM. I mean clearly when I took over I had to refocus the company for cloud and data and it the speed at which those were moving in. And for us that's that's been a journey right. It's clearly been our most historic transformation where we've had to divest businesses overall almost over 10 billion dollars of businesses to give you fuel. And then we did in my time. Forty five billion of our. Indeed. And then another sixty five acquisitions. IBM reacted very quickly when the pandemic arrived in early March. How unexpected and unprecedented was that for you as a leader. Did that surprise you. You know I have to say at a personal level to some degree yes. Intellectually no. And and I'll give you this example. So here because we're global 170 countries we were obviously participating with this with our Chinese workforce and Japanese workforce. We see Italy. We're everywhere. And I am proud by the way every country we were able in days. Ninety five percent of IBM ers were working remotely. So I'm very proud of what this says about the infrastructure how we do our work our customers. That said I can remember it was middle of March. I've done some TV interviews and that was my fortieth wedding anniversary. And I was going to fly to meet my husband for a weekend. And as I left I only packed for four days to go down to that house to see him. And never did. I really sort of realized nope I might not actually come back after this and stay at home right into this. I mean so intellectually I think we all saw it. Everyone I know right that I I've talked to sorta has a similar story about the speed at which it then moved that we really did need to stay in place. First thing is OK how do you help people. Right. So of course your own employees obviously we all worked on that for us to put. That is job number one. We do on the Weather Channel. And we had a site immediately put up that you could see in your zip code. You know what were the cases. How many desks. The case is growing. Check on your parents your kids whatever it was. But one source truth full data that was out there. We did that the second immediately in parallel. And this is still going now is work on the cure. What could we do. That's us. You know like authentically us. And it was we sponsored for the government put together a high performance computing consortium which now has 40 people who've donated their high performance computing. We do have the top supercomputers in the world. Think of it as if you could overnight buy a billion dollar computer. That's what it is that we've put together 600 PDA flops and there's 100 world class scientific teams that are running all of their analysis on this. So they've contributed to the cure. We took Watson an A.I. Twenty five countries asking questions everything. You can remember those days like how much misinformation was out there about Cove ID and so all that got underway. Then we had to quickly move to another phase. That quickly it was months. But how do you return to work safely. Other CEOs has used the words terror and fear and felt like we got hit by a torpedo. Was there any amount of fear for you as a leader as somebody who was in charge of these tens of thousands of people. Three hundred fifty thousand and. No no. Those are not words in my vocabulary basically. And I think because we do mission critical work I've always felt that when things got the most tense I'd become the most calm. And it is in those moments that people look to you to steer them through something. So it is a determined calm is how I would describe it. Where does that come from. And you. You know I guess I've often thought about that and I think it comes from my you know my early time I talked with you I think before about my mother and single mom found herself raising four children. Suddenly she didn't have an education. We spent time on food stamps. My mother was determined not to let that be the end of the story. Found her way out with an education. Out of that the rest of us all turned out well by watching her. And in that moment it taught us you know never let something define you only you define who you are. So you take control of that. And I think that that is what is stayed with me through all this time. And whether it's a crisis or whether it is actually the reinvention of a company or myself. The idea that only you define who you are not someone else. You've seen so much innovation so much evolution in your time at IBM. How do you think IBM is a different company today than when you took over as CEO. We now have our next enduring technology platform. That's what the team is built. Hybrid Cloud and A.I. IBM does its best when it has a physical technology platform. So things like the mainframe was there for decades. Still we'll be there for decades. Modernized modernized. Its on Z 15 16 and into me hybrid cloud II. Is this company's next platform. And because there is a very serious set of work we do that requires the ability to run work wherever you need to run it whether it's a private cloud multiple public clouds build something once run it anywhere get a scale advantage from that not be locked in. Get open innovation. This was all behind our open hyper cloud. I would love it if you would humor us and go back a bit more in time and paint the picture for us of a young Ginni Rometty walking through the doors of IBM as a systems engineer in Detroit in nineteen eighty one. I came from a single mom who to get us off of food stamps found her way back to get an associate degree so she could get a job so we could all go to school. So I start there. I'd had a scholarship from General Motors bless them through Northwestern University. So I first did work there. So before that then I went to IBM. So I worked there a year. But as I told Mary Barra I love what she does and she is passionate about cars. I wanted to apply technology a lot of things. So I went to IBM and here's what I remember of that first day. Of course I did not have a blue suit. All right. Had not had one. I never had any suits actually. But this is this is back in time right. So this is 1981 out of blue suit. I can remember coming home from work taking my jacket off putting on the couch and my husband saying do you realize the price tags are still on your suit. And that's how I remember my first day. And I thought how gracious. There wasn't a single person who said anything about that. Your mom how influential. Why she over the years and she showed us that nobody defined your future. You do it. And we watched that and learned that by just looking at what she did. I remember when you took this job in 2011 The New York Times wrote this big piece about your husband and how he was your support system and as all husbands should be. And it had a big impact on me because I think we often think our support system should be invisible but then we don't learn how other people do it. And I'd love to know more about how that partnership evolved over the years especially as you were CEO. I just had my fortieth wedding anniversary and so 40 years. And you know what I say about Marc. He is he's my biggest fan. And that you know I think that makes all the difference in the world. And so that it's a partnership. And I know not everyone has been blessed like I have to have that kind of relationship where not only you know I so when you become CEO it's a family job. It isn't as if it's just one person. So it's impact on time. My whole life I traveled for my position as an example. We always had a rule that never be more than two weeks apart from each other. And we oh we never broke that rule. And 40 years of my traveling. And so those are the kinds of things that I think you know they keep you together build it stronger. And I have been really blessed and lucky to have someone like that by my side who took as much pride and was as is you know tried to learn as much about IBM and beards as ambassador. Right. I feel he was IBM's ambassador and took as much interest in my clients as I did. So it was a real partnership. And and clearly I did nothing else but work. So I have such great empathy for women that you know have children and all these other responsibilities. I worked in and Marc really did take care of everything else. Well I did work so I was lucky from that sense. Well I'm sure you're selling yourself a little bit short. And he is very lucky to have you as well. I say that. You've said you've never thought about yourself as being a woman CEO but that is how others have often thought of you. Did you find that frustrating over the years or unfair in any way. So that. That's an interesting question from two perspectives because I've often felt when I first became CEO I really did not want to be labeled that I wanted to be recognized for what I could accomplish. I think many women feel that way. I think many people feel that way. But I will tell you a different side of that story that as time went on I did begin to realize this obligation to be a role model. And you could see so many people that would react to not just what I did or what I said but that it was you were a role model for their children their daughter someone themselves. And this idea that you cannot be what you cannot see. I began to internalize that and did feel it was an obligation. And I've changed my view about that. And as my tenure went on. You saw me become more vocal about that and more involved in things because I realized in whether it's a woman or any group people have got to have role models to see what's possible. And that is in a positive way an obligation there. Now with it becomes I've said to other women as they've taken on their CEO roles I said get ready because everything you do is magnified. Everything you do is personalized. I can't tell you that that's fair. But it's what happens. And so just power through and do what it is you think must be done. So what is your advice to young women out there who want to be you who want to be leaders. It's probably the one piece of advice I am best known for Emily around the world. And it is my husband that taught me the lesson. It was early in my career. I had interviewed for a job was offered it and I was very nervous about taking it. I didn't think I was ready. I thought I needed a few more years. And markets said to me when I came home he said because I told the person let me think about this. And I'd come home. And Mark said to me Jenny do you think a man would have answered the question that way. And in those moments what I remember is that growth and comfort will never co-exist. And so everyone I talked to I say look you just get really comfortable with being uncomfortable in that. When you're uncomfortable that means you're learning and growing. And so to your earlier question about fear I view those moments as like wonderful learning opportunities. And that's my biggest advice. So have you replayed that story to yourself over the years as as you've had moments where you're saying inside your time a man would not do this. Well I would. I've replayed to myself more is go put yourself at risk. Don't worry if you're nervous about something fantastic or if you're not nervous. Equally a concern. Be sure you take on something different and go learn something new. Ideas shares declined during your tenure as CEO. And I wonder if that was frustrating to watch. I know you're you know CEOs always tell us they don't pay attention to the share price but but it has to be distracting. And I wonder is there something you think investors just didn't get. We'll look at it. We did return 43 billion dollars to shareholders during my time frame with dividend and actually the dividend grew by 100 percent. But but clearly obviously you would want your share price to grow. So of course to that end I think the piece in what we had to undertake was the hard work to reinvent IBM for the long term. And that's what we went about and did. We had a tall order to Duras. We did it. And so I'm really looking forward to now this next chapter for the company. IBM is hanging a lot of its future on hybrid. How will the company and how should the company differentiate itself from rivals in hybrid like Microsoft. OK. Well we're clearly the one that defined hybrid and we are clearly the one I would say the others have joined us now in this conversation. And so how we're clearly distinguish we are the only one with an open hybrid cloud. So think of it real simple for a client. This means if it's open technologies open source open technologies you can get access to innovation anywhere. Oh so I get more innovation be I can write something once and it can run anywhere. It can run on another cloud is long as you have that hybrid open layer there. And that means it could run on any number of public clouds. It could run on your own cloud. It can run on your private cloud your on premise. OK. Perfect. So when a pandemic hits and I worry about thing where things are operating and need to move them I am fit for purpose. Ready. And then once I do that there's a skills battle out there. Well all better that I can only have one set of skills no matter what I do. And then of course you could guess it's two and a half times less operating costs. So we are the only short answer. We are the true open hybrid cloud. The tech industry more broadly is under fire for stifling innovation. Apple. Google. Amazon. Facebook. Having seen so many generations of technology do you believe we're in a different space. Do you believe these companies are stifling innovation. Do you believe that legislation for a breakup is in order. Yeah I don't think it's that simple of a question. And I don't know about stifle innovation because I take it back a few layers from that. I can remember early on defining. We don't believe we own a customer's day to day do we. Will only use it with their permission. Data belongs to the creator. We in fact even the algorithms that either comes drives out of it it belongs to them. So you make your choices and then you hold yourself to be audited against him. I think this is more about companies being clear what they believe and then standing up to those things. That's how your competition at IBM is. Competition is formidable. What do you think are the biggest challenges that your successor Marvin Christmas will have to deal with. Well look I have extreme confidence in Arvin. He is exactly the man. He's a brilliant technologist. Architect sees exactly what this means to be an open hybrid cloud. And so now Urban's transition will be as we first spin off the manage infrastructure business and then reposition IBM into growth. I mean we're positioned in now as he said to everyone. This is about a growth mindset and a culture of radical candor. And because he now takes it to that step of growth. When you look back is there anything that you would have done differently. I don't think about life that way. Right. Because I always believe in that moment you'd make the very best decisions you can with everything that's happened then IBM has and and so many futuristic technologies whether it is quantum computing or A.I. it's often so hard to imagine how these technologies are going to actually change our lives in concrete ways. And given what you've seen over the last 40 years I'm wondering if you would take us 40 years ahead. How will our lives be different in 2016 because of technology. Well first off there'll be a lot of technologies you won't even know yet. They have not yet been invented. So I will tell you that. Right. So on one hand you should expect a lot of things you didn't know today. But I do believe that we're going to solve some really tough problems for humanity over these next decades. Look A.I. is in its really early stages still of deployment. And so you've yet to see the real benefits of A.I. to come in front of us. And in that time frame Quantum will be flourishing. And so you know Quantum the great tides of quantum are things like drug discovery materials discovery that will be out there drug you know the speed of how it's done.

As well anxious Twitter employees compared the situation to IBM's work for the Nazis during World War II pleading with him to ban Trump.

Dorsey was working remotely a private island in French Polynesia on January 6 when Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and his top lieutenants pushed to suspend the president's account according to an account in the New York Times.

Twitter was the first social media company to act against Trump after the Capitol riot locking his account for 12 hours before ultimately issuing the permanent ban. Facebook its subsidiary Instagram and Snapchat quickly followed suit with indefinite bans.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was reportedly reluctant to ban President Donald Trump's account and only acted after his team said that Trump's tweets were inspiring calls for violence

Twitter was the first social media company to act against Trump after the Capitol riot locking his account for 12 hours before ultimately issuing the permanent ban

How did IBM help Nazis during WWII? Both the U.S. government and Nazi Germany used IBM punch-card technology for some parts of their internment camp operations and record keeping. IBM's German subsidiary was accused of helping with records at Nazi concentration camps. IBM says its German operation along with those of other foreign companies was effectively seized by the Nazis during the war. Advertisement

According to the Times Dorsey signed off on the permanent ban after two of Trump's January 8 tweets were seen to be inspiring radical responses among his supporters.

In one of the tweets Trump said that he would not attend the presidential inauguration on January 20. In another he called his supporters 'great American Patriots' and said they would 'have a GIANT VOICE' in the future.

The tweets were not explicit calls for violence but Twitter's safety team monitored the response on alternative social networking site Parler which is popular among right-wingers and told Dorsey that Trump's supporters had seized on Trump's latest tweets.

One Twitter employee saw a Trump fan on Parler urge militias to stop President-elect Joe Biden from entering the White House and to fight anyone who tried to halt them according to the Times.

Twitter's safety team alluded to the two Trump tweets in a public blog post about the ban saying that they 'were highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts that took place at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 2021.'

Many Twitter employees had long called for Trump to be banned from the platform but Dorsey was reluctant to take such a step.

Dorsey had long defended the company's policy of protecting the accounts of world leaders arguing their public statements were newsworthy even when their tweets violated the company's policies.

Prior to January 6 Twitter had only deleted the tweets of a world leader on two occasions when the leaders of Brazil and Venezuela promoted fake cures for coronavirus.

Following the events of January 6 furious Twitter employees began circulating an internal petition calling anew for Trump's ban.

Several invoked IBM’s collaboration with the Nazis saying that history would judge Twitter in the same light current and former employees told the Times.

Dorsey acquiesced but his mixed feelings on the issue were apparent in a lengthy public statement he issued on January 13 saying Twitter made the 'right decision' but adding the ban sets a dangerous precedent.

'Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation. They divide us. They limit the potential for clarification redemption and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation' Dorsey wrote.

Following its ban on Trump Twitter broadened its crackdown last weekend banning 70000 accounts it said were linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory which proposes that Trump is fighting an evil global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles.

Twitter said in a statement it had initiated the broader bans to 'protect the conversation on our service from attempts to incite violence organize attacks and share deliberately misleading information about the election outcome.'

On Thursday Dorsey held a virtual company meeting addressing the bans video of which was quickly leaked by an employee to the conservative activist group Project Veritas.

His message to employees appeared to be that the ban on Trump was just the beginning of a sweeping new approach to moderation.

He told staff in the clip: 'You should always feel free to express yourself in whatever format manifestation feels right.

'We do intend to do the full retro as I said in my note it is going to take some time.

'And then the other thing just to close out a little bit: we are focused on one account right now.

'But this is going to be much bigger than just one account.

'And it's going to go on for much longer than just this day this week.

'And the next few weeks and go on beyond the inauguration. We have to expect that we have to be ready for that.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vZnJpZW5kcy1tb3Vybi1hcy1yb2JiZXJzLWtpbGwtd2lubmVyLW9mLWlibS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1pbi1sYWdvcy_SAVlodHRwczovL3B1bmNobmcuY29tL2ZyaWVuZHMtbW91cm4tYXMtcm9iYmVycy1raWxsLXdpbm5lci1vZi1pYm0tY29tcGV0aXRpb24taW4tbGFnb3MvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Friends mourn as robbers kill winner of IBM competition in Lagos,"Eniola Akinkuotu

A 22-year-old Computer Systems Engineer David Ntekim-Rex has been killed by armed robbers in the Jibowu area of Lagos State The PUNCH has learnt.

Ntekim-Rex according to a 2018 statement by IBM had beaten 17000 others from around the world including finalists from Brazil Germany India Japan Nepal and the United States to emerge as the co-regional winner of the annual Master the Mainframe competition organised by AngelHack and IBM Z Academic Initiative.

The deceased who was described as a tech guru by friends bagged several certificates and accomplishments before graduating from the Department of Systems Engineering at the University of Lagos in 2019.

He was working as a Product Designer at a Financial Technology firm Crevatal before his demise according to his LinkedIn profile.

The deceased who was the son of Dr. Yewande Ntekim-Rex a senior lecturer at the English Department at the University of Lagos was said to have been gunned down around 8 pm on Friday.

A relative of the deceased who tweeted with the handle @Magnanimous_ said the police failed to help Ntekim-Rex when he was shot.

He alleged that the police continued to cause unnecessary delays as life slowly left Ntekim-Rex.

He tweeted “My ‘auntie’ has three sons. She’s always crazy about them. The middle child David is the most promising. He is a tech guy; very young very brilliant. David was on his way home on Friday night when he was robbed shot and killed around Jibowu. Please say a prayer for my aunt.

“David got shot around 8 pm. The police were called David hadn’t died yet. The Nigerian police took pictures instead and were more concerned with why he a tech guy was carrying a laptop. Nigeria failed you David.

“David was taken to the military hospital around the area. It took a senior nurse to come out and start checking for a pulse. He had lost a lot of blood at this point.

“The police then took David and his family to Sabo (police station) where they looked for the laptop that he had on him instead of giving them a police report. He was finally released to his family and they got to LUTH around 12.30 am.

“He was there till the family was convinced he couldn’t be alive because he had no pulse. The country failed David. The doctors failed David. The police failed David. The system failed David. Rest in peace David Ntekim-Rex.”

A friend Oluwatifunmi Omotimomake said on Twitter that the death of Ntekim-Rex was a huge loss.

“It breaks my heart to see your life cut short by the actions of robbers and a failed government system. May your soul continue to rest in peace. Heaven has heard your cry. Justice will come.”

Friends revealed that days before he was killed Ntekim-Rex had created an app for monitoring the success of New Year resolutions.

A friend @koderholic said on Twitter that she communicated with the deceased on the day he was murdered.

“Who would have known that would be the last time we would converse? David Ntekim-Rex may we meet again. Say hi to Jesus.”

Confirming the incident the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer Muyiwa Adejobi said Nketim-Rex was dead before the police were notified.

Adejobi added that the Divisional Police Officer and the Area Commander both intervened but there was nothing that could have been done to save the deceased.

He said “On January 15 2021 we were informed around 11.20 pm. On getting to the scene policemen met his lifeless body but relations insisted that he was not dead. So police took him to Military Hospital Yaba but the hospital said they could not treat him and then referred him to LUTH.

“He was accepted at LUTH and he was confirmed dead. The family returned to the police to get extracts at the station for mortuary. So the allegation of the police abandoning him is not true. The incident is unfortunate and we sympathise with the family but we did what we could.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vY2Evb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVnbG9iZWFuZG1haWwvbmFtZS9iZXJuZC1rdWVobi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD00MDQ4MDYxM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bernd KUEHN Obituary (1928 - 2020) - Toronto ON - The Globe and Mail,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/ca/obituaries/theglobeandmail/name/bernd-kuehn-obituary?id=40480613 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vY2Evb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVnbG9iZWFuZG1haWwvbmFtZS9iZXJuZC1rdWVobi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD00MDQ4MDYxM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Unlike the usual battle-type Pokémon game that we all enjoy New Pokémon Snap lets players assume the role of an avid photographer taking candid photos of the cutest and most majestic Pokémon they could find.

The original Pokémon Snap took a more scenic approach that mimicked a safari adventure where players would take pictures throughout a mapped out route. Perfecting the rail shooter mechanics and actual 3D renders of your favorite Pokémon the photography-based game became an instant hit selling around 1.5 million copies in its release year.

While it may seem like a fresh take on the franchise New Pokémon Snap is actually a sequel to the 1999 Nintendo 64 classic Pokémon Snap.

Now let’s take a look at the differences and improvements that we can expect from New Pokémon Snap.

The Lental region is your newest landscape

New Pokémon Snap takes you to the brand new region of Lental a more expansive location compared to the original game’s Pokémon Island. As an archipelago Lental features larger ecosystems of the usual jungles beaches and deserts that players can explore.

The new region also introduces a new character in Professor Mirror. Not much has been revealed about him yet but Mirror will likely have the same intentions as Professor Oak did in the original game. For those who haven’t played Pokémon Snap Professor Oak hired the protagonist because he needed quality pictures to go along with his scientific findings.

There are thrice as many Pokémon to photograph

Coming out only a few years after Pokémon’s first generation Pokémon Snap had a limited roster that featured only 63 of the original 151 Pokémon. To the delight of the original game’s avid fans Nintendo has almost tripled the total with over 200 variants for New Pokémon Snap.

From the recent trailer you can see the likes of Toucannon (Gen. VII) Grookey (Gen. VIII) and even Hippowdon (Gen. IV) hanging out in their respective habitats.

Adding a nostalgic feel to New Pokémon Snap the official game site also gave us a sneak peek at an Alolan Pikachu surfing on its tail possibly hinting at more regional Pokémon in the game. That’s bound to give you some extra style points.

You can take a lot more pictures

In terms of gameplay the trailer hinted at a bigger camera roll for all you shutterbugs.

With more places to visit and Pokémon to shoot Nintendo and Bandai Namco have bumped up the standard capacity of your camera to around 70 photos. Now there’s no reason to panic if ever there’s a final hidden Pokémon at the end of your route.

With the game supporting online play we’re also keeping our eyes peeled for a possible in-game photo-sharing mode that’ll have your friends fawning over your frame-perfect captures.

You are now a bona fide Pokémon photographer

New Pokémon Snap offers a more personalized experience along with a more modern look. Whereas in the original game players took on the role of fictional photographer Todd Snap New Pokémon Snap’s trailer showcases both male and female trainers hopping into the buggy — implying that there might be more personalization options at the beginning of the game.

Nintendo has also replaced the three-wheeled Zero-One buggy with the sleeker floating Neo-One. Based on the gameplay trailer New Pokémon Snap looks like it will keep the original rail shooter mechanic to stay true to its predecessor.

You’ll discover glowing Pokémon and vegetation

A new gameplay aspect of New Pokémon Snap is the Illumina phenomenon. Players can look forward to sightings of glowing Pokémon and vegetation throughout their runs. There’s no real explanation for the mysterious regional experience but Nintendo has teased that your photos and observations might help in learning more about it.

The trailer featured a night-time cinematic of an Illumina Meganium (Gen. II). Before the sighting the trainer could see light particles floating around him which could be a potential indicator in the actual gameplay.

The Illumina’s rainbow-like aura might be a subtle nod to Pokémon Snap’s Rainbow Cloud stage in which players had to snap all six Pokémon signs to unlock a Mew-only course. We’re hoping that there’ll be a secret achievement or stage after discovering what the Illumina phenomenon is all about.

New Pokémon Snap will be available for the Nintendo Switch starting April 30. For more information you can check out its official game site.

Intel responded to our question 'Does that mean Intel has effectively ended its Optane-only product lines for consumers?'

""Your statement is technically correct but consumers do benefit from Optane based-solutions like the Intel Optane Memory H20 since it is for mobile consumer."" - Intel representative.

As noted in the article below the Optane Memory H20 is a Flash+Optane module that doesn't offer comparable performance to the Optane-only drives for the desktop PC. The H20 is only compatible with mobile 11th-gen Core U-series chips or later and not with desktop PCs. Intel's statement also clarifies that those drives are destined for mobile applications marking the end of Optane solutions for desktop PCs.

Original Article:

In a surprising move with little fanfare Intel announced that it is discontinuing all of its Optane-only SSDs for the consumer market. Surprisingly the company says those drives aren't going to see Optane-only replacements apparently marking the end of its enthusiast-geared Optane SSDs for desktop PCs.

Intel discontinued the Optane Memory M10 800P 900P and 905P SSDs representing the entirety of its Optane-only family for desktop PCs. Intel's 900P and 905P discontinuation notice states:

""Intel will not provide a new large capacity Optane Memory SSD as a transition product for the client market segment. Intel will focus on the new Optane Memory H20 with Solid State Storage for the client market segment.""

The discontinuation notices for the M10 and 800P series also point Intel's customers to the Optane Memory H20 drives. The H20 drives come with Optane memory paired with QLC flash on the same device. These caching drives aren't nearly as fast as Optane-only drives (they aren't even in the same league) and are designed primarily for laptops and the OEM market.

Intel's discontinuation period is incredibly brief too with all discontinued drives no longer offered as of the publication date of the notices or a few days prior as we see with the 800P series:

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Discontinuation Posted Last Order Date Last Shipment Date Intel Optane Memory 900 and 905P Series January 15 2021 January 15 2021 February 26 2021 Intel Optane Memory 800P Series January 14 2021 January 11 2021 February 26 2021 Intel Optane Memory M10 Series January 13 2021 January 13 2021 February 26 2021

The last orders will ship on February 26 2021 for all models. All of Intel's discontinued consumer drives come with the first-gen Optane Memory (3D XPoint) but the company recently unveiled its new Optane SSD P5800X for servers. This new drive brings second-gen Optane to market for the first time signaling that Intel remains committed to using the exotic memory for the enterprise market. For now it doesn't appear that the second-gen Optane will come to the desktop PC.

The list of discontinued drives spans all form factors and families for the desktop PC. Here's a list of the discontinued drives:

Optane Memory 900P and 905P - AIC - 280GB 480GB 960GB and 1.5TB

Optane Memory 900P and 905P - U.2 - 280GB 480GB 960GB 1.5TB

Optane Memory 905P - M.2 - 380GB

Optane Memory M10 - M.2 - 16GB 32GB 64GB

Optane Memory 800P - M.2 - 58GB 118GB

Intel is at the beginning of a multi-year journey to sell its NAND business to SK hynix but it will retain its Optane memory business and IP. That isn't surprising given that the exotic underlying 3D XPoint technology is jointly-designed by Intel and Micron and not available to other memory producers giving Intel a differentiated product for the high-margin enterprise market.

Apparently Intel's decision to reduce its exposure to the NAND storage market comes along with a new focus on the enterprise market for the Optane brand. Intel's Optane products for the data center also include its persistent memory DIMMs that can function as an adjunct to main memory - a capability that only Intel offers.

Intel's Optane Memory drives for the consumer market are hands-down the fastest SSDs on the planet laying waste to competing NAND-based SSDs in nearly every conceivable metric - except cost and capacity. As we often see 'cheap and good enough' tends to win in the market and the pricing and capacity advantages of garden-variety TLC SSDs paired with the good-enough performance for most consumers relegated Intel's Optane drives to a niche category for either the most hardcore enthusiasts or the workstation market. However despite those challenges Intel's Optane remained the only 3D XPoint-powered SSDs on the market giving the company a completely unique offering in the consumer storage market.

Given the demise of the consumer-focused Optane drives it appears that Intel will rely upon its enterprise-class Optane drives to address all professional segments including the workstation market. Intel currently doesn't manufacture Optane memory in high volumes – it simply purchases the underlying 3D XPoint memory from Micron. As of yet Micron doesn't have any 3D XPoint SSDs or DIMMs on the market.

There is an outside chance that Intel has future Optane SSDs in development for the consumer market and isn't ready to release them yet but that would make the discontinuation an odd maneuver. Intel traditionally doesn't discontinue products until its new models are already shipping. We've followed up with Intel for more detail and will update as necessary.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLWNvcmUtaTktMTE5MDBrLXZzLWNvcmUtaTktMTA5MDBrLTUtMi1naHotb3ZlcmNsb2NrLWJlbmNobWFya3MtZ2FtaW5nLWxlYWsv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vaW50ZWwtY29yZS1pOS0xMTkwMGstdnMtY29yZS1pOS0xMDkwMGstNS0yLWdoei1vdmVyY2xvY2stYmVuY2htYXJrcy1nYW1pbmctbGVhay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9-11900K 8 Core Rocket Lake Flagship CPU Benchmarked at 5.2 GHz Faster Than Core i9-10900K In Single-Core But Slower in Gaming & Multi-Threaded Apps,"Well the latest benchmarks of Intel's Core i9-11900K 8 Core Rocket Lake CPU have just leaked out by a Chinese TechTuber and the results are a mixed bag for the 11th Gen flagship. The difference between these and the earlier benchmarks is that the previous results were evaluated using an ES chip while the latest benchmarks are performed on a QS chip which should be close to the retail unit.

Intel Core i9-11900K vs Core i9-10900K 5.2 GHz Overclock Benchmarks Leak Out - 8 Core Rocket Lake Flagship Only Faster In Single-Core Apps Lacks in Gaming & Multi-Threaded Performance

The Intel Core i9-11900K is now confirmed as the flagship 11th Gen CPU. The company showed off some gaming performance numbers where it was outpacing an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPU by up to 8% but we always advise to take official performance metrics with a grain of salt. So here we are with the latest results that were done with a QS chip that gets rid of the stuck PCIe bug that was an issue on the ES chips. As such the gaming performance you are looking at here should be close to the real thing.

Intel Core i9-11900K 8 Core & 16 Thread Rocket Lake Desktop CPU Specifications

The Intel Core i9-11900K will be the flagship 11th Gen Rocket Lake Desktop CPU. The chip is going to feature 8 cores and 16 threads. This will result in 16 MB of L3 cache (2 MB per core) and 4 MB of L2 cache (512 KB per core). The CPU has a base clock of 3.50 GHz and a boost clock of up to 5.2GHz (1-core) & 4.80 GHz (all-core).

The chip will also feature Thermal Velocity Boost which should deliver a 100 MHz jump in the max clock frequency. This should lead to a single-core boost clock of 5.3 GHz making it the first CPU to ever hit such a high frequency out of the box. However do remember that regardless of using the Cypress Cove cores the Core i9-11900K will feature lower cores and threads than the Intel Core i9-10900K. This is partially due to the backporting of Cypress Cove on the refined 14nm process node.

The CPU is said to feature a 1st stage power limit of 125W which is standard for a flagship Intel SKU and the 2nd stage power limit or PL2 is rated at 250W. This means that when hitting its maximum advertised clock speeds the CPU could indeed be pulling the said amount of wattage from the PSU making it one of the most power-hungry 8-core chips ever produced. This might also explain why Intel didn't go 10 cores and 20 threads on its 11th Gen lineup since it would've turned out to be a power-hungry monster of a chip breaking even past the 250W power limit.

Intel Core i9-11900K 8 Core vs Core i9-10900K 10 Core CPU Benchmarks With 5.2 GHz Overclock

Coming straight to the performance numbers both CPUs were tested at an overclock frequency of 5.2 GHz across all cores. Do note that the Intel Core i9-11900K features a brand new architecture but has 2 fewer cores than the Core i9-10900K which relies on an enhanced Skylake architecture. Both CPUs were tested on a Z490 motherboard and the memory featured was 16 GB DDR4-3600 due to a lock on Rocket Lake. The Core i9-11900K voltage was set to auto and hit 1.48V. A chiller was required to maintain the 5.2 GHz overclock.

Intel Core i9-11900K vs Core i9-10900K 5.2 GHz OC App Benchmarks:

2 of 9

In CPU-z the Intel Core i9-11900K is 11% faster than the Core i9-10900K in single-core tests but ends up 12% slower in multi-core tests. In Cinebench R15 the Intel Core i9-11900K once again takes a 12% lead over the Core i9-10900K but also ends up 12% slower in multi-core tests. The Cinebench R20 & Cinebench R23 results show a 16% gain for the Core i9-11900K over its Core i9 predecessor but again when it comes to multi-threaded performance the CPU is no match to its predecessor.

In x264 1080p the Intel Core i9-11900K loses to the Core i9-10900K by 5 FPS. The same is true for V-Ray where the Core i9-10900K outpaces the Core i9-11900K by 14 more MPaths. Moving over to 3DMark results our friend over at Twitter Harukaze5719 has compiled a chart that compares the performance of the Core i9-11900K and Core i9-10900K in all said tests. The Core i9-11900K loses to the 10th Gen flagship in all tests.

Lastly we have gaming performance tests and the results here are underwhelming for the Rocket Lake flagship. The Intel Core i9-11900K seems to be just slightly better or on par with the Core i9-10900K but there are also titles that show performance reduction versus the Core i9-10900K. The previous benchmarks also showed similar performance numbers and further mentioned how hot and power-hungry the flagship Rocket Lake CPU is going to be.

Mobileye's CEO revealed its upcoming lidar tech at CES 2021 and marked an exciting differentiating strategy between the industry's leading giants.

The world of self-driving vehicles is roughly hewn into two factions: companies that believe fully autonomous vehicles will naturally evolve from advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and those that expect the two will exist in concert fulfilling different niches.

The latter is currently led by Alphabet's self-driving outfit Waymo which has a testing ground of self-driving taxis in the suburbs of Phoenix as well as scattered tests within San Francisco. The former however is where companies like Tesla reside as well as their main lesser-known competitor in this space an Intel division called Mobileye.

These two exist in a hypothetical space where they race for dominance over the inevitable self-driven future of automotive travel. While it is possible that they are scrying the future of this industry correctly their tactics and investments are quite different.

Israeli tech firm Mobileye was acquired by Intel in 2017 for $15 billion and has become the largest supplier of ADAS systems installed in modern cars. Mobileye had a big CES showcase this year to explain how they believe their strategy for comprehensive self-driving vehicles will not hit the ""glass ceiling"" that awaits Tesla according to Mobileye's CEO Amnon Shashua.

Creating a system for self-driving vehicles requires a large foundation of data to train a company's proprietary AI which will allow a vehicle to recognize and react to variation on the road faster than a human is capable of. Shashua and Tesla's Elon Musk approach this challenge differently.

Tesla's datasets comprise countless hours of video information recorded by its fleet of cars which the vehicles selectively send to Tesla engineers when Wi-Fi is readily available. Tesla's team can then query this information and extract clips which are the most optimized for training its platform. An alternative to this video-only strategy is to use more expensive lidar sensors. Back in 2019 however Musk was quoted saying ""anyone relying on lidar is doomed.""

Mobileye's Shashua believes that a more practical reliable system would utilize both. Their ubiquitous ADAS systems do not currently use lidar but in an interview this week the CEO showed off a new lidar-based system which would be implemented into their vehicles by 2025. Mobileye used to be a Tesla partner up until 2016 but today it's working with several automakers including BMW Ford Nissan and Volkswagen.

The Intel subsidiary does not believe they need to use the ""brute force"" strategy of AI video-training that Tesla implements but rather the ""semantics of the road"" can be discerned through more targeted means. Their current systems record video data which it processes locally to understand the geometry of its environment then sends those small packets of information back to Mobileye to help construct massive 3D maps. These maps provide detailed geometrical data as well as contextual behavioral data in local regions of the city or street they were taken.

Mobileye does not expect to combine its lidar and video technology until both are ready for prime time at which point it aims to provide one comprehensive system for self-driving vehicles. Only time will tell if their strategy to partner with large automotive companies and develop maps of cities around the world will outcompete the brute force of Tesla's video-based system on its own vehicles.

If lidar proves essential in future then Tesla might see difficulties ahead. Waymo too may find trouble expanding their solution if their technology is too specialized to the regions in which they test. Mobileye a firm with lesser name recognition than the former two may have a platform that is comprehensive and global enough to outlast or even surpass its competition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90ZWNoLW5ld3MtdGVjaG5vbG9neS9pbnRlbC1jb25maWRlbnQtYXBwbGUtZG9lc250LWhhdmUtdGhlLWFtbXVuaXRpb24tdG8tc2NvcmUtaW4tZW50ZXJwcmlzZS1tYXJrZXQteWV0LTcxNDk2NjYv0gGiAWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2ludGVsLWNvbmZpZGVudC1hcHBsZS1kb2VzbnQtaGF2ZS10aGUtYW1tdW5pdGlvbi10by1zY29yZS1pbi1lbnRlcnByaXNlLW1hcmtldC15ZXQtNzE0OTY2Ni9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel confident Apple doesn’t have the ammunition to score in enterprise market yet,"Intel does not think that the launch of Apple’s own silicon the M1 will impact the chipset maker’s dominance in the lucrative enterprise PC market. In fact Intel says the debut of its new 11th Gen Core vPro processors for business at the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show earlier this week gives it an edge over competitors including Apple and AMD.

“They [Apple] do have aspirations to get in… but I think most businesses will tell you until there is a broader ecosystem of business-related solutions it’s not really a viable solution yet” Stephanie Hallford Vice-President and General Manager of Business Client Platforms Client Computing Group Intel told indianexpress.com over a Skype call.

Despite reports claiming that the M1 chip is the new benchmark in personal computing Hallford dismissed those claims by saying “the benchmarks are a little fuzzy…. they are in corner cases they are not broad.”

Hallford who has been with Intel since 2000 said the company is trying to educate its customers about real-world experiences and how its chipsets are better suited for business world applications and work with office users without compromising on the security. “These are all things that the legacy systems such as Intel Microsoft and all of the app developer world have created over the years there’s a lot still missing in that experience from the Apple side” she said.

Intel’s new business-focused processors build upon the strengths of its 11th-Gen mobile processors and are designed to power premium thin and light laptops including the Dell Latitude 9420. Features like security and remote manageability are critical to IT departments during pandemic times and Intel isn’t shying away from highlighting them. Intel said more than 60 new laptops will be launching this year with the new vPro processors and some of them will have the Intel Evo vPro brand.

While Intel welcomes competition from Apple Hallford said she still strongly believes that larger enterprises and businesses will always favour Intel-powered systems because of the cost factor and the ease of getting things done. “We have discussed that with a lot of our IT departments who find that it’s expensive for them not only to purchase but to upkeep” Hallford said.

But in the post-pandemic world where most firms are preparing to adopt a “hybrid” office model where people split work time between their home office and the office the needs of enterprise IT will also change. As Hallford pointed out the rise in the purchase of notebooks has far outstripped the desktop form factor and that shows how corporate PC buying behaviour during the pandemic has changed. While the desktop form factor will serve specific needs the notebook form factor will explode further thus opening up more competition from new MacBooks with the M1 chip and AMD’s Ryzen Pro-powered notebooks.

Intel’s expectation is that the launch of an updated vPro platform for its “Tiger Lake” 11th Gen Core processors as well as expanding the Evo program into vPro might help it differentiate notebooks that cater to corporate environments. “We think a lot of our Evo platforms which are coming out with the display and the audio and the battery life and thin and light are really very worthy competitors of those that require that very ultimate mobility that many of the Apple Macs have been known for” she said.

Intel has been increasingly facing stiff competition from Apple and AMD in the PC market. Apple announced plans to transition to its own silicon back in June last year while AMD is eating Intel’s market share in both desktop and laptop CPU segments. Intel announced earlier this week that its current CEO Bob Swan is stepping down from the position next month set to be replaced by VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger. Gelsinger is an Intel veteran who previously has worked at the chip maker for 30 long years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzE2L25ldy1jZW8tcGF0LWdlbHNpbmdlci1tdXN0LWNoYW5uZWwtYW5keS1ncm92ZS1yZWNyZWF0ZS1pbnRlbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New CEO Pat Gelsinger must channel Andy Grove and recreate Intel,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://siliconangle.com/2021/01/16/new-ceo-pat-gelsinger-must-channel-andy-grove-recreate-intel/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzE2L25ldy1jZW8tcGF0LWdlbHNpbmdlci1tdXN0LWNoYW5uZWwtYW5keS1ncm92ZS1yZWNyZWF0ZS1pbnRlbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Dancing On Ice is back for the 2021 series with an incredible line-up of celebrities and their professional skating partners.

This year will see judges Torvill and Dean John Barrowman and Ashley Banjo resume their roles on the expert ice panel while Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield return to present.

There will be some changes however with perspex screens between judges and the removal of a live audience due to the coronavirus pandemic. You can read more about this here.

And as the new series kicks off many will be trying to cast their minds back last year's competition. Here's what you need to know.

(Image: ITV)

Who won Dancing On Ice 2020?

Former EastEnders actor Joe Swash and his professional partner Alex Murphy won the competition last year.

Originally Alex was due to be paired with Michael Barrymore but he sadly had to pull out of the competition after breaking his hand in training.

Meanwhile Joe was partnered with Alexandra Schauman but after she also suffered an injury Alex stepped in from week four leading Joe all the way to victory.

The pair were up against Perri Kiely and Vanessa Bauer in the final but the public vote saw Joe and Alex's Bolero come out on top.

Why is Alex Murphy no longer on Dancing On Ice?

Despite winning the 2020 show the pro skater revealed she'd been axed from the ITV competition in June 2020.

Sharing the news on Instagram she said: ""It is with a heavy heart that I release the following statement: ""For the last three years Dancing On Ice has not only been my job but also what I considered to be my family.

""I am broken hearted to announce that I have recently been informed that I will not be re-contracted for Dancing On Ice 2021 series.

""This decision has come as a huge shock to me. I absolutely love the show and had hoped to go back for 2021. I have been left feeling bewildered lost and devastated.

""I am so grateful for the three years that I had on this incredible show and I will wholeheartedly miss everyone and everything about it.

""Though I am heartbroken I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and although this hurts right now I will pick myself up and look forward towards the future.

""Thank you so much to all my colleagues at DOI and most importantly the viewers for the constant support and love that you have shown me the last 3 years.""

Alex first appeared on the show in 2018 alongside Love Island's Kem Cetinay and then again in 2019 with former Westlife star Brian McFadden.

An ITV spokesperson told Mirror Online at the time: ""Each series the Dancing On Ice team looks at our existing line up and explores opportunities to potentially introduce some new faces to the skating professional team.

""Alex Murphy will not be appearing in the next series and we wish her all the best for the future.""

Who are the 2021 professionals?

Also axed from the 2021 series were Alexander Demetriou and Carlotta Edwards.

This year continuing dancers are Alexandra Schauman Lukasz Rozycki Mark Hanretty Hamish Gaman Brendyn Hatfield and Vanessa Bauer.

While Andy Buchanan and wife Robin Johnstone will also be returning to the ice having last competed in the ninth series.

New skaters include Angela Egan Klabera Komini and Yebin Mok although Yebin is currently out of the competition after suffering a ""freak accident"" in rehearsals. You can read more about the injury here.

Karina Manta will now step in for Yebin Mok while her skating partner Joe Johnson will lead professional group performances.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sky News understands that Hambro Perks will announce the purchase of principally biotech and energy company stakes from Invesco early next week.

City sources said that the deal would take place at a ""very substantial"" discount to earlier valuations placed on the holdings by Invesco.

Some of the positions were accumulated by Neil Woodford the fallen star fund manager whose empire exploded in 2019 and managed by his successor the now-departed Mark Barnett.

The portfolio includes stakes in First Light Fusion an Oxford University energy generation spin-out and Gelesis which develops therapies for treating gastrointestinal diseases.

In total Hambro Perks is acquiring 17 private holdings which include assets in the digital media sector.

The deal is being financed by its Special Opportunities Fund.

It is the second such transaction engineered by the firm's co-founder Dominic Perks in as many months.

In December it acquired Ombu a portfolio of seven early-stage companies which had previously been part of Mr Woodford's empire.

Hambro Perks drafted in Sir John Rose the former boss of Rolls Royce Holdings to oversee the vehicle in which those positions sit.

The firm also counts prominent start-ups such as By Miles a motor insurance app the fintech Tide and PrimaryBid which aggregates retail orders for share trades among promising British tech companies it has backed.

Invesco has been trying to dispose of its illiquid portfolio for nearly a year following a slump in the size of some of its biggest funds.

A wave of investor redemptions and weak performance led to Mr Barnett's exit last year.

Invesco initially came close to a deal with Goldman Sachs to buy the illiquid holdings but those talks fell apart some time ago.

Invesco said last March that it was continuing to ""explore the realisation of the unquoted assets in the portfolio"".

""Once realised this capital will be reallocated to publicly listed equities which in our view have been heavily discounted due to the fall in equity markets as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak.

Neither Hambro Perks nor Invesco could be reached for comment on Saturday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcmJyb25jb3MuY29tL25ld3Mvc2FmZXR5LWluLW51bWJlcnMtdGhlLWNhc2UtZm9yLWpvaG4tbHluY2gtdG8tYmUtZWxlY3RlZC1pbnRvLXRoZS1oYWxsLW9mLWZhbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Safety in numbers: The case for John Lynch to be elected into the Hall of Fame,,,,,,,,,,

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 10 biggest questions in life. Life is a funny thing. We are born we go to school we graduate get a job get married have kids raise them and then just die. Of course I’m missing quite a few steps but that is the usual path many of us take. We go through these motions almost naturally because that is what we’re supposed to do right? That’s what our parents did anyway. And their parents before them. And their parents before them. The chain goes on. Of course many a times we find people who chose a different path and its becoming more common as we evolve to stray away from certain traditions. While unacceptable in the beginning to most many parts of the world are now accepting these changes in tradition. Far from being something bad this actually shows diversity and sociological differences in people. It should be supported as long as it isn’t hurting anyone. For example many people are now choosing to not marry many are choosing to adopt their offspring rather than procreate while there are some who don’t want a family anyway.

Then there are people who are choosing a different way of life. Living green helps the environment. Some people dedicate their whole life to curb the negative effects of Global Warming. Their efforts not only help them they help everyone on planet earth in the long run. Some of these people have even made avenues so that others could follow suit. There are a lot of businesses working in this field to help the earth. For example if you want to switch to renewable energy you have options like Brookfield Renewable Partners ((NYSE:BEP) who deal in hydroelectric wind and solar energy generation facilities as well as energy storage assets. First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is another business helping the environment. They deal in thin film solar panels and are one of the leaders in the field. Another company NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) produces more energy from the wind and sun than any other company in the world.

An important part of building a life in this world are houses. All this struggle we do how we plan our life how hard we struggle to earn our livelihood a part of all this amounts to acquiring a house that we can call home. If one doesn’t have something to call home well there isn’t a big chance that they’re happy. Of course there must be exceptions but the large majority amount settling down into their homes as being part of the formula to happiness. Especially due to the culture of moving out of parents’ house when we reach adulthood it is important to start thinking about our own place as soon as possible. Thankfully we live in an ear where we can get help in this department from professionals. This is where the business of Real Estate comes in. These business don’t just help you find a house they help you find the perfect or near to perfect house.

We go through life trying to find the perfect fit for everything. We want the perfect marriage the perfect home the perfect lifestyle the perfect job etc. In a sense we’re all different from each other according to our preferences and our choices but at the heart of it all we’re all human beings and there are a lot of things that bind us together. It can be our love for music our love for humanity our optimism for the future our humility etc. We’re all seeking answers to life’s biggest questions in our own ways. Here we have compiled a list for the 25 biggest questions in life. The questions have been compiled from Conversation Starters World the emotions machine and Reddit.

25. How would life be different if you were born in a different country?

Starting off with number twenty five we have a question that we often find ourselves wondering about as we grow older. Would we be leading a different life if we were born in another country? Will we be different people? This question has different implications according to the state of one’s country. A person from a third world country might be wondering if life would be easier if they were born in a first world country. Someone from a better background might wonder the opposite.

24. Is suffering a necessary part of the human condition? What would people who never suffered be like?

Ah this. Every time something bad happens to us or if we’re going through a particularly bad time we hear the term “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”. But what about those who’ve never had to deal with a bad situation be like? It’s rare to come across anyone who hasn’t had a bad break at least once in their life. Even the most privileged have their own set of problems.

23. What is the best way for a person to attain happiness?

The age old question. We’re all trying to find the formula to happiness. But the truth is there is no fit all solution available. We all have different destinations different preferences hence different answers to the question. It just takes a long time for most of us to get there. Often times what we think will bring us happiness turns out to disappoint us.

22. Would you break the law to save a loved one?

Well would you? Ask yourself would it be worth risking the wrath of the state in order to save to spare someone you love? It probably depends on how much you love the person to put yourself under that kind of risk. Hopefully none of us have to answer this question.

21. If a child somehow survived and grew up in the wilderness without any human contact how “human” would they be without the influence of society and culture?

Like Mowgli? Fans of the Jungle Book might immediately think of the sweet kid in the franchise who grew up in the Jungle. But what this question ultimately points towards is what makes a human a human? Is it really the society or the norms which influence us or do we have instincts that set us apart from other species? Is it nature or nurture? Another popular character that comes to mind is Tarzan.

20. How long will you be remembered after you die?

This is a particularly difficult question as it involves thinking about your own death. But often times you can’t help yourself. When with a loved one or even when alone you often find yourself wondering will it matter if I die? How long will people remember me miss me? It doesn’t make sense why it matters since we’ll be dead but the mind can’t help but wonder.

19. Do extraterrestrial life forms exist?

We answered this question amongst others in 20 biggest questions in science from a scientific perspective. Man is a social animal and it seems weird to thing that we are alone in the universe. There have to be other worlds right?

18. How would life be different if you were born the opposite gender?

You’re lying if you say you’ve never thought about this before. Especially due to the social norms stuck to gender roles one can’t help but wonder how different would life be if we were born as the opposite gender? This wouldn’t just mean a different name it would mean different clothes different friends probably different activities and aren’t these the core of what develop our lives?

17. What happens after we die?

Many people turn to religion for the answer. Some believe in heaven and hell and the Day of Judgment according to their respective religions while some believe that we just disappear into nothingness. There are some who believe that we go back into the earth and become a part of it. There is of course no way a fellow human being can tell us because they’ll be dead. Unless you believe in psychics and mystics of course.

16. When is silence better than words?

A question we should probably ask ourselves more often than we already do. When should one stay silent save their breath? This often depends upon personal choice but both options usually have drastically different consequences. Hence making this an extremely important choice.

15. Can world peace ever be achieved?

Humans have dedicated an enormous amount of time to answer this question but at the same time very little efforts from our population as a whole to make a positive answer possible. With constant wars genocides and other forms of violence it seems that we are far from getting even half an answer.

14. Is the meaning of life the same for animals and humans?

Our base instincts are probably the same. Both species need to survive and reproduce. But it’s the details that make us different. We have the ability of thought which animals don't who only go about fulfilling their basic necessities for survival. Our brain power is what distinguished us from humans and animals after all.

13. Is it possible to live a normal life and not ever tell a lie?

Most of us have this belief that lying is a sin. Even people who aren’t religious adhere to the notion that lying is deception which is wrong. But one can’t really say in all honesty that they’ve never lied. We’ve all told a little white lie here is there. Why is it so hard not to lie?

12. How will humans as a species go extinct?

Will the world end in an explosion or will we finally kill each other in world wars? Scientists have proposed a lot of theories in this matter but the truth will only come out when everything does end. Though we likely won’t be there to find out.

11. Where does your self-worth come from?

A theory suggests that our self-worth comes from our abilities and other activities that we deem to be important. But most of us have different notions or yardsticks as to what really encapsulates the worth of a human being. We might never have a unanimous answer and that’s probably a good thing.

According to a press release from Sheriff Jeff Burkett the inmates removed a large block from the cell wall to escape. They reportedly fled on foot.

Authorities are searching for Tracy Brown 57 whose last known address was Iron Mountain Lake; Dwight Abernathie 36 of Ironton; and Samuel Gillam 35. Court records list Gillam with a Fulton address but the Highway Patrol said he had been living in Ironton; Gillam also has ties to Park Hills.

As of Sunday evening the trio was still on the lam.

The United States Marshals Service is assisting in the fugitive investigation of Abernathie rown and Gillam. Rewards have been authorized up to $5000 for information leading to the arrest of any of the escapees. Tips can be called into the U.S. Marshals Tip Line at 1-800-336-0102 or 1-877-WANTED2. All tips will remain anonymous. You may also contact the Iron County Sheriff’s Office at 573-546-4000.

Do not approach the subjects call your local law enforcement if spotted. According to authorities the men are known to be armed and dangerous. That does not mean that they are armed at this time according to authorities.

Ironton PD officers along with the U.S. Marshals U.S. Forest Service Missouri State Highway Patrol Missouri State Park Rangers Missouri Department of Corrections and the Pilot Knob Police Department assisted the Iron County Sheriff’s Office with the manhunt Saturday.

“Officers followed up on over 50 leads throughout the day” reads a post on the Ironton Police Department’s Facebook page. “Those leads did not result in the subjects being returned to custody but information was obtained and additional follow up will occur until the subjects are back in custody.”

Brown is described as a white male 5-foot 9-inches tall with green eyes. He has salt and pepper hair and is balding on top. Brown was last known to be wearing a black and white jumpsuit.

Brown was being held in the jail on charges of burglary. He had been in the jail since Nov. 4 according to Casenet.

Abernathie is described as a white male 6-foot 1-inches tall with blue eyes and red hair. He was last known to be wearing a white t-shirt and grey sweatpants.

Abernathie was being held in jail on first-degree assault charges. Abernathie had been jailed since Sept. 18 according to Casenet.

Gillam is described as a white male 5-foot6-inches tall with blue eyes and brown hair. He was last known wearing a white t-shirt and striped pants.

Gillam was jailed on charges of interference with custody.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

From thousands of stocks 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5 Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand soaring 2022 earnings estimates and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares retail investors could jump in at any time.

This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Jacobs came off the screen at the top of the key took two quick dribbles to the basket and scooped in a reverse layup.

It was one of many smooth finishes for the 5-foot-8 junior guard. He and his older brother Tadarius ""T.D."" Jacobs combined for 39 points in Bartlett's 77-68 win on Friday over Arlington which entered the game unbeaten and ranked No. 2 in Class AAA.

The brothers are settling in nicely at Bartlett after transferring from East. Terrance Jacobs said that they moved into Bartlett's zone before the start of the season. And they've been making their mark ever since.

""Both of them can handle the ball. Both can score the ball. Both can defend very well"" Bartlett coach Dion Real said. ""Their impact on the team and even like I said we’re talking about culture years from now hopefully their impact will make all of us better.""

Real said that he often finds the brothers playing one-on-one against each other in the gym before practice. The competition level is intense and they ""really go at each other"" Real said. Tadarius Jacobs said it's been like that since they were young.

Before they transferred the brothers were like many athletes in the area waiting to see if Shelby County Schools would play basketball. Terrance said he was angry when he heard the news that sports were indefinitely suspended due to COVID-19. Tadarius who is a senior said that he just wanted one last chance at making a playoff run with his younger brother.

Another SCS transfer:Bartlett's Amarr Knox shows impact of Iverson Classic after picking up Memphis offer

SCS Charter schools can play:Shelby County Schools sports are indefinitely suspended. Here's why a charter school is playing basketball

Tadarius was a freshman on Memphis coach Penny Hardaway's last East team which won the state title in 2018 and finished 29-3. He didn't play much that season with a team featuring James Wiseman Chandler Lawson Johnathan Lawson and Alex Lomax among others. Tadarius' minutes picked up the next season as East fell in the Class AAA state title game to Bearden.

Tadarius and Terrance finally got their chance to start together last season. East went 21-9 but fell to Whitehaven in the Region 8-AAA semifinals and missed the state tournament for the first time since 2014.

""Hooping with him (Wiseman) was the easiest thing in the world"" Terrance Jacobs said. ""He was the best player in high school it made our jobs easier. All the focus was on him and he helped us. Playing without him was tough he was a big part of what we did.""

And now with their move to Bartlett the brothers have one last shot at playing together in high school.

""Missing state last year we really wanted to keep it going but since it didn’t happen this is my senior year and I’m trying to go back to state for one last go. And I know my little brother wants the same"" Tadarius Jacobs said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xMG5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9yZXAtc2FyYS1qYWNvYnMtY2FsbHMtZm9yLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24taW50by1hY3RpdmUtbWlsaXRhcnktbWVtYmVycy1pbnZvbHZlZC1pbi1jYXBpdG9sLXJpb3Rz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rep. Sara Jacobs calls for investigation into active military members involved in Capitol riots,"SAN DIEGO (KGTV) -- San Diego Congresswoman Sarah Jacobs is calling on the Department of Defense to investigate whether current military service members were involved in the attacks on the U.S. capitol on January 6.

Jacobs and Congressman Ruben Gallego wrote to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller on January 10 stating that “any current or former military members who may have participated have disgraced themselves and committed serious crimes against the people of the United States. Any such individuals should have the book thrown at them for violated their oaths and duty to the nation.”

Jacobs says she has not received an official response from the Department of Defense but this will be a topic of discussion in future House Armed Services Committee hearings.

She said she was spurred to action by hundreds of calls from her constituents ""they wanted us to make sure we looked into it and that we held these people accountable really to uphold their oath and their honor because they felt it was being besmirched by all of these people they were hearing about.""

When asked what message she hopes the letter sends she responded ""I think it's important that the Department of Defense takes very seriously the extremism and violence against women we've seen in the military. There are very very very many incredibly honorable people serving in our military and they themselves are the ones that want to root out this kind of ideology and this behavior.""

Jacobs believes more training teaching troops how to identify and root out bad apples coupled with supportive programs could prevent this from happening again.

""A part of why this has become such an issue is because of the forever wars where we're having these constant deployments we're putting such a burden on the troops we're not giving them the kind of mental healthcare that we need not to excuse any of this behavior but looking forward to make sure we put some of those programs in place"" she said.

Jacobs is a third generation San Diegan with a grandfather who served in the Navy. She said she's saddened to know military members were involved in the Capitol riots.

She hasn't left the Capitol since the riots and will attend Joe Biden's Inauguration. She said it's important not to let fear stand in the way of democracy.

Jacobs said current and former military members are held under an extra set of rules called the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vYWlycG9ydC13b3JsZC5jb20vd2JwLW5ld3MtNC_SASlodHRwczovL2FpcnBvcnQtd29ybGQuY29tL2FtcC93YnAtbmV3cy00Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WBP News,"We shine the spotlight on a handful of technology driven initiatives designed to improve the operational efficiency of airports and hasten their recovery from the global pandemic.

Reinventing the management of airfields

Jacobs has developed a new proprietary cloud-based platform designed to enable the effective asset management of airfields.

Indeed based on the success of trials across the world it believes that the solution called Pavy will reinvent the way airports manage airfield pavements.

It states: “Airfield pavements are complex and extensive and understanding how they perform is key to planning investment. Now more than ever with the need to adapt to COVID-19 impacts airport operators are looking for smarter ways to make strategic cost-efficient decisions about their most important airfield assets.

“Built on the insight and experience of a network of aviation and asset management professionals at Jacobs Pavy is a customisable platform that puts the airport in control enabling strategic data-led decisions about airfield investment.”

The asset management principles behind Pavy were originally conceived when London Heathrow commissioned a team of Jacobs specialists to create a solution to manage its four million square metres of airfield pavement.

Devise investment strategies over 5-year periods connecting engineering and finance teams to help balance costs risk and performance particularly in the wake of the pandemic;

Work with optimised CAPEX spend profiles whilst receiving client-decision support immediate feedback and basic scenario forecasting combined with visual plans;

Harness the power of their data to build stronger business cases for additional funding requests.

“We work every day to tackle our clients’ toughest challenges and airfield asset management is a recurring issue in the aviation industry even more so now as operators look for more agile ways to manage their operations effectively in response to COVID-19” says Donald Morrison Jacobs’ senior vice president and general for people and places solutions Europe Middle East and Africa.

“With Pavy our new cloud-based platform airports around the globe can better plan pavement investments and prioritise critical interventions.”

Security upgrade at Hamad International Airport

Qatar’s Hamad International Airport (HIA) continues to innovate recently becoming the first airport in the Middle East to install Smiths Detection’s HI-SCAN 6040 CTiX machines which utilise Computed Tomography (CT) technology to X-ray screen carry-on baggage at security checkpoints.

The new additions are expected to help expedite the security screening process by allowing passengers to keep electronic devices and liquids in their hand baggage subsequently reducing wait times and boosting customer satisfaction levels.

The airport’s vice president of security Saeed Yousef Al-Sulaiti says: “Smiths Detection has a reputation for providing market leading solutions with world-renowned standards for quality.”

Stuttgart embraces cloud technology

Stuttgart has become the first airport in Germany to embrace Amadeus’ cloud computing technology for passenger services.

More than 200 check-in counters and gates as well as 30 self-service kiosks have transitioned to the new technology which Amadeus says ensures a smoother check-in experience.

Thanks to this technology the migration was handled largely remotely with only a skeleton team of engineers needed on-site at the terminal.

The major IT modernisation sees Stuttgart increase passenger self-service options with the installation of 30 self-service check-in kiosks from ICM Airport Technics an Amadeus company as well as introducing self-boarding gates and Amadeus technology for passenger payments for additional services such as excess baggage.

The airport’s director of infrastructure and CIO Dirk Spengler commented: “We are an essential industrial and business hub for the entire region and we’re committed to delivering a pleasant passenger experience.

“We especially appreciate that the new IT solution saves energy and will contribute to our sustainability efforts at Stuttgart Airport.”

Making air travel safer for all

AirAsia has become the first airline to deploy GrayMatter’s Scan2Fly digital solution that enables passengers to prove that they are COVID-19 free and fit to travel by scanning and uploading negative test results if required and other medical certificates during the online check-in process.

Javed Malik AirAsia’s group chief operations officer says: “AirAsia is all about value choice and innovation. This system is highly effective for our airline our guests and the respective government agencies particularly in the current COVID constrained travel environment as it makes flying with AirAsia even safer and more convenient than before.

“We are looking forward to developing the use of this new technology system across all of our relevant destinations which will play an important role to help ensure that air travel continues to be safe and more seamless than ever.”

The solution is designed to recognise multiple templates of medical documents across various countries even if the format is different from one country to another. The solution says GrayMatter is underpinned by machine learning and text analytics.

Its cloud-hosted system is very tightly integrated and tailored to AirAsia’s applications and is equipped with robust information security.

The technology also provides reports based on the details of the medical documents uploaded and the approval/rejection status including the reason for any rejection.

GrayMatter Software’s CEO Vikas Gupta notes that the system has already gone live for a number of AirAsia flights from Malaysia’s Klia2 Airport to Singapore as well as to Surabaya and will soon be introduced for services to and from Jakarta.

He adds that the new technology will eventually be introduced to other AirAsia destinations where valid travel documents are required prior to travel.

Gupta says: “We are glad to have had the opportunity to work with AirAsia for a pertinent cause like COVID prevention. I am happy to see GrayMatter delivering more and more value to the aviation ecosystem.”

That trend continued on Saturday as the Kentucky Wildcats traveled to Auburn and fell 66-59.

The Wildcats mustered just 25 points in the first half though their defense held true by holding Auburn to just 21 first half points. However one team adjusted and executed while the other didn't. The Tigers came out and eventually pulled away to win the second half by a margin of 11 and take the victory.

Kentucky’s offense shot 40% from the field 25% from behind the arc 56% from the free throw line and coughed up 17 turnovers. It’s an offense that doesn’t have any identity and has proved time and time again that they can’t shoot themselves out of deficits.

Sure Kentucky is more than talented enough to go out and narrowly win a game or two in a so-so Southeastern Conference. But in terms of this team’s long-term upside you could say there isn’t much at all. Here’s what head coach John Calipari and his team had to say following the loss.

John Calipari

On the team fighting today but coming up short …

“All the tough plays and rebounds we needed to make I just took guys out today. If you get beat to the ball get out and let someone else play. We defended the way you defend to win games and no one wanted to shoot. They passed up until I yelled at them to shoot the ball. We missed wide-open shots and we had our chances. I’m disappointed. We came out of a couple of timeouts and didn’t do what we were trying to do. We let one slip away on the road. We should have been up big at the half and I can’t believe we weren’t. How we came in and guarded the things we did we gave up two critical 3s. Guys just didn’t leave their feet. We were running through guys. We aren’t going to have that much gap on anyone we play from here on in.”

On how he gets his team to peak as he has normally done to make the NCAA Tournament …

“If we are skilled basketball players we could have made easy plays and we didn’t. We made the hardest one. In a game like this three baskets break the game open. We were still not there yet. The toughness on drives. We said we are going straight up and we are not trying to block any of these drives we had three guys go like that. We have to figure out what’s next and how we get this thing on offense. We are a different kind of team. Inside-out 3s and how we play we are built differently. But when you’re trying to throw to the post and that guy isn’t catching it that becomes tough. Olivier (Sarr) has got to start dominating games. I’m telling you stop worrying about offense and go rebound. Drive to get fouled instead of flipping and avoiding. There are points in the game where I’m proud of these guys and there are other points in the game that I’m thinking what in the world are we doing?”

On why Dontaie Allen didn’t play more and the decision to go big …

“At the end of the day we were running plays for Dontaie and he wouldn’t shoot the ball. That’s why I took him out the first time. One time we ran two things for him with shots and he wouldn’t take them. Dontaie wasn’t the issue. When you defend like we are defending you have to figure out how to space the count play offensively. How do we make them place extra passes and low turnovers? I tried to go zone and then I had a guy break down during the zone. You can see I’m frustrated. We are here. We still have our chances. Not giving up on anybody. Trying to figure it out. The toughness this team needs to play with. First half they had 10 or 12 offensive rebounds. What?! We should be a better offensive team. It got rough and we should be able to battle back.”

On why Dontaie Allen and Jacob Toppin didn’t start the second half after leading the team in scoring in the first half …

“One of the things we talked about – with Lance (Ware) too – I want to win every game I coach but on the other side I’m not trying to take anyone’s heart away. You can sub them three minutes in and go. We didn’t start the half that bad. That wasn’t the case. It’s not like substituting a quarterback; he played a bad quarter so I’m going to play a different one. You don’t coach that way. What you do is sub them in. Dontaie got great looks in the second half. He got fouled but they were going at him defensively. We had a lot of breakdowns and could have changed lineups. At the end of the day we got out-toughed.”

On if he’s at a point where he’s accepting that this isn’t a great offensive team …

“I’ll never stop tweaking and changing. So it clicks in their minds. They have to feel all of this and how we have to play for each other. We aren’t good enough to go run by people. If we create space and assists we should be averaging at least 18 assists on our baskets maybe more. Everyone was trying to score instead of creating shots for each other. We are one of those teams that are trying to figure it out. You can’t just ride one or two guys. And I’ll be honest with you it may be game to game. Who’s getting more looks and shots. What I like about Lance is that he will fight. Our guard play was just OK. Defensively what we did with their point probably will be the game plan. Offensive rebounds that’s what they got and that’s how the game was close. We have to make some open shots. They played well enough to win. They did what they had to do. We gave ourselves a chance at the end and the tie-up with Keion (Brooks Jr.) I can’t wait to watch it on tape to see if it was foul because it ended the game.”

Jacob Toppin

On what the ideal offense looks like for them …

“Basketball. We have to drive and find the open man. Once we buy into team basketball and finding the open man that’s when we will start winning games.”

On limiting Auburn’s Sharife Cooper in the first half and what changed in the second half …

“Other players on the team were hitting shots and making plays so we had to change up things. We had to stop other players because Sharife wasn’t doing anything in the first half and others were.”

On how they stay positive …

“We know what kind of team we are and we have shown it in a couple of games. We have to be more consistent and play team basketball. We have to become more consistent and we will start winning.”

On how they find open shots …

“Some players don’t take the shots when it’s open. Maybe it’s mental because they missed the previous one. Once we get mentally strong and do not worry about getting the last shot we will start making them. We need to focus and dial in more.”

On if missing shots is contagious …

“Maybe. When one person is missing another one is making shots so I don’t think it’s contagious. We all have to step up and make shots and that’s when we will start playing basketball and winning games.”

On why players wouldn’t be bought in at this point in the season …

“I think everyone is dialed in but we have to become more consistent. Sometimes when we are playing some players will go off and play “me” basketball and that’s what we don’t need. We will figure it out and stay consistent.”

On why the team stood for the national anthem today after kneeling at Florida last week …

“We stand for what we believe in. There was no discussion. We decided to lock arms because we are going to stay united and we will fight for what we believe in even if it looks different from what we did before.”

On what Coach Calipari’s message was after the game …

“Toughness. We are supposed to be the tougher team every time and today we weren’t. We did play with effort but not enough toughness. In the first half they had 12 offensive rebounds which is unacceptable for any team. We need to find a way to get tougher and play with more grit.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pb2wuY28uemEvc2F0dXJkYXktc3Rhci9uZXdzL2h1bWJsZS1idXQtZGV0ZXJtaW5lZC1hLXRyaWJ1dGUtdG8tYXdhcmQtd2lubmluZy1zYS12aXJvbG9naXN0LWRyLWdyYWVtZS1qYWNvYnMtMTBkODA5NDQtOThmZC00MmY3LWIxNDAtNjFmYWE1ZjVjMjIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Humble but determined' A tribute to award-winning SA virologist Dr Graeme Jacobs,"Award-winning virologist Dr Graeme Jacobs was born without a heartbeat but went on to carve out a glittering academic career for himself. He died last Saturday from Covid-19. The youngest of two children born to Lawton and Mildred Jacobs he was born via an emergency Caesarean section on April 14 1982 but would go on to matriculate with distinction from DF Malan Hoërskool in Bellville at the age of 17 in 1999.

Proceeding to Stellenbosch University he graduated with a BSc in medical technology in 2002 followed by his Honours degree the next year and MSc in virology in 2005. His academic prowess was such that he was awarded a scholarship to pursue a PhD at the Institute for Virology and Immunobiology at the University of Wuerzburg in Germany where he graduated magna cum laude receiving full marks for his thesis on HIV/Aids. The new Dr Jacobs returned home to South Africa as a post-doctoral fellow in Stellenbosch University’s medical virology division at Tygerberg hospital under the mentorship of Professor Susan Engelbrecht before being appointed senior lecturer and research scientist under the National Research Foundation (NRF)’s Next Generation of Academics Programme (nGAP) in February 2019. He mentored many post-graduate students collaborated internationally and published copiously yet still continued to study. This year he would have received his MBA degree from the University of Stellenbosch’s Business School. He had also just been approached to consider collaborating on a virology project by a member of Dr Anthony Fauci’s staff after Fauci who had just been named incoming US President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser read one of Jacobs’s research papers.

Highly regarded by his peers colleagues and students as a scientist and an academic Jacobs was also a much-loved family man. He married Estronita Swartz in December 2017. The last family picture. Supplied. “As a family we are extremely proud of all his achievements in the science world and accomplishments in his career but what we are most proud of is the person he grew up to be: a humble and caring human being to all who crossed his path extremely down-to-earth but determined to succeed in the field of science” the family said. A passionate and patriotic South African he returned home to make a difference to the lives of its citizens to help encourage other South Africans to become scientists and find solutions for the HIV/Aids pandemic as he explained in a poignant tribute in 2014 to the late Professor Axel Rethwilm who had been instrumental in getting him to Wuerzburg in which he shared his vision for a successful and sustainable post-apartheid South Africa (see below).

* Jacobs leaves behind his wife Estronita his parents Lawton and Mildred his sister Chantal Carls brother-in-law Hayden Carls and nephew Troy Carls. Life as a scientist in post-apartheid South Africa

A tribute to Professor Axel Rethwilm (Institute for Virology and Immunobiology (Born August 3 1989 - died JuIy 29 2014). I was 12 years old when apartheid ended in1994. As I was still a child apartheid didn’t phase as much and I knew very little about my surroundings at that time. I knew that as a person of colour a person of mixed race we were only allowed to go to certain schools and have certain jobs. I was generally protected and unaware of the conditions in our black communities and the horrible poor conditions faced in everyday life in the townships or squatter camps. Aspirations of becoming doctors lawyers businessmen leaders and even sport stars were generally reserved for white people although not impossible to achieve. I come from a highly educated family as my mother is a teacher and many other family members as well. My parents believed it was imperative to have a good educational background in order to rise above our circumstances of the time.

To quote our beloved leader and world icon Nelson Mandela “Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world”. Thus in 1994 when South Africa entered its democratic era me and my sister were sent to what was then known as “Model C” schools schools with education systems previously reserved for only the more privileged. This gave me the opportunity to excel in my education giving me an advantage to achieve success in whatever career path I chose. I always had a love for the world of micro-organisms and the diseases they cause. Therefore I chose to study molecular biology at the University of Stellenbosch.

As HIV/Aids touches everyone in South Africa I decided to specialise in medical virology during my postgraduate studies. In 2005 while presenting my Master’s work at a conference in San Francisco US I was approached by Professor Axel Rethwilm offering me the chance to do my PhD at the Institute for Virology and Immunobiology at the University of Wuerzburg Germany. He was tasked with initiating collaborations with universities in the Western Cape and with South African scientists working on HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases. This led to a fruitful collaboration between Germany and South Africa with many research projects still in progress. After completing my studies in Germany I returned to South Africa as this is my home and I feel this is where my knowledge and expertise are most needed.

With 11 official languages South Africa is a dynamic multi-cultural country with ample resources such as gold diamonds platinum and copper. It has the second biggest economy in Africa after Nigeria. However crime levels are still extremely high especially in the poor communities. The levels of inequality caused by apartheid are still visible in everyday life. Good quality education is still lacking and is sometimes only accessible to the more privileged middle and upper class.

“According to the World Economic Forum report South Africa ranks second last in mathematics and science education in the world. The poor who want to educate themselves at higher education institutes still mostly rely on government grants private funding or high bank loans which often take years to pay off.” Thus there are many challenges that South African scientists face today. As a result of apartheid and the education system we still lack many good quality scientists. Those who are qualified often leave our shores for more lucrative job opportunities in places like England Europe US and Australia. There is a push from the government to increase the number of PhD-qualified South Africans and to keep qualified professionals in the country.

However it will probably take many more years to achieve education levels as seen in the First World. As a medical scientist we are faced with the task of doing research to help improve the quality of health in South Africa. Diseases such as H[V/Aids tuberculosis and heart diseases are all common. Research in these fields is not always supported as many of the local cultures believe in traditional medicine rather than taking the medicine and d*gr from the Western backed pharmaceutical companies. For myself the biggest challenge is to use my knowledge and scientific background to teach others from all cultures and races to uplift and empower themselves through education despite their social and economic backgrounds. I sincerely hope that my research into HIV/Aids in South Africa makes a valuable contribution towards curbing the epidemic we are fighting every day in my country.

Before becoming an architect at age 37 Johnson ran the architecture department at MoMA and the spare luminous building which he inhabited for over half a century embodies the Modernist International Style that he helped define in a landmark exhibition at the museum in 1932. The home also established Johnson himself as the paragon of a specific type of New York architect: erudite absolutist in his refinement and formidable in his influence wielding shaping careers institutions and public opinion like few others in his field.

But since the National Trust of Historic Preservation opened the Glass House to the public as a museum in 2007 visitors have discovered there’s more to the place than its namesake centerpiece. By the time Johnson died in 2005 the five acres he’d bought in 1946 had grown tenfold to encompass 14 structures including experimental follies a subterranean painting gallery and three wooden homes from earlier periods including a shingled 18th-century dwelling that Johnson and his partner the curator David Whitney would use as a refuge in hot weather. For the past 15 years however a pivotal part of the estate has remained semi-concealed: Johnson’s guesthouse known as the Brick House and situated just 80 feet from the site’s main attraction has been closed to the public because of water damage. Now after an extensive restoration and in time for the Glass House’s 75th anniversary the building has finally been unveiled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFzdHJpYnVuZS5vcmcvMjAyNC8wNS8wNC90ZXhhcy1lbGVjdGlvbnMtMjAyNC1zcGVjaWFsLXNlbmF0ZS1kaXN0cmljdC0xNS1oYXJyaXMtY291bnR5LWhvdXN0b24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Molly Cook wins Texas Senate special election,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YWhvby5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9kd2F5bmUtam9obnNvbi1pcy1kaWZmaWN1bHQtdG8td29yay13aXRoLXJlcG9ydC1jbGFpbXMtdGhlLXN0YXItaGFzLW1vdW50YWlucy1vZi1wdWJsaWMtZ29vZHdpbGwtdG8tb2Zmc2V0LW5lZ2F0aXZpdHktZXhwZXJ0LXNheXMtMTcxNDAyNDM4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dwayne Johnson is difficult to work with report claims. The star has 'mountains of public goodwill' to offset negativity ...,"Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson’s nice guy reputation has been taking some hits — but the “mountains of public goodwill” he’s built over the years should outshine the drama an expert tells Yahoo Entertainment.

A recent report from the Wrap saw more than a dozen people who worked with Johnson on the upcoming holiday action-comedy film Red One criticize his “chronic lateness and lack of professionalism on set.”

Insiders claimed the Black Adam actor — who co-stars alongside Chris Evans and J.K. Simmons — “was late an average of seven to eight hours per day and missed several entire days of production” resulting in the movie running at least $50 million over budget. They pointed fingers at the film’s “inexperienced” lead producer Hiram Garcia who is Johnson’s ex-brother-in-law and ex-personal assistant for letting things spiral. An insider called the situation “a f***ing disaster” and claimed “Dwayne truly doesn’t give a f***.”

Sources claimed Johnson’s lateness is a pattern saying he had a “huge fight” with an “infuriated” Ryan Reynolds after showing up five hours late to the set of their movie Red Notice in 2020. There’s also a wild story about him urinating in water bottles (something he previously copped to doing).

A spokesperson for Amazon MGM the film studio behind Red One denied the claims in the report calling Johnson and his production company Seven Bucks “incredible partners.” Johnson insiders told the outlet he “averaged no more than one hour late” and “the budget did not deviate much from the agreed-upon figure.” Johnson’s rep did not respond to Yahoo’s request for comment.

Despite the scathing report a crisis and PR expert doesn’t expect this to cause lasting damage to Johnson’s reputation.

“There is a better chance of Martians landing on the lawn of the Biden White House than this ever permanently hurting the Rock” Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants tells Yahoo.

What’s going on with Johnson?

In addition to being one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood Johnson is one of the most likable celebrities — and a large part of that is due to his strong work ethic. Johnson brands himself as a hard worker — his Instagram with 397 million followers shows a dizzying schedule of gym time movie shoots meetings adorable girl dad moments and philanthropy.

Johnson’s production company Seven Bucks is a nod to his bank account balance when he was cut from a pro football team at age 22. It made the then broke star pivot to a career in wrestling rising through the ranks at the World Wrestling Federation (later called World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) before crossing over to Hollywood and starring in the Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises. In 2016 Forbes listed Johnson as the highest-paid actor and currently estimates his net worth at $270 million between his movies production company wrestling endorsements and brands. A key part of his success is being able to connect with the masses but not forgetting his roots which is why many want to see him run for president.

It seems that over the last year-plus however there have been some negative headlines. The biggest prior to now was in September when he and Oprah Winfrey faced backlash after asking people to donate to their Maui wildfire fund — instead of giving more of their own money. He acknowledged the criticism and he and Winfrey quietly donated more than they had pledged.

The drama has been simmering elsewhere: His bankability took a small hit with 2022’s Black Adam which didn’t perform as well as anticipated and he faced criticism over how he handled it. The Wrap story also seemed to confirm that Johnson attempted to have his production company take over the DC films universe in 2022. It didn’t happen and Johnson going around others for the secret meeting didn’t sit well. Variety reported on that in 2023 with an insider saying Johnson’s “demands” — including having his brand of tequila served at a premiere of PG-13-rated Black Adam — “increased and the returns just weren’t there.”

This year Johnson made a big return to WWE and was appointed to the board of its parent company TKO but he was booed by fans for being almost two hours late to an April event. Recently he’s been hamming it up to play the villain in the pro wrestling storyline. The same week the View audience jeered the mention of his name for saying he won’t be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. (He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but said he learned that sharing his political opinions only causes division.)

The Wrap story has brought back into conversation Johnson’s infamous feud with his Fast and the Furious franchise co-star Vin Diesel. If Johnson really does show up eight hours late to set — or not at all — that could certainly fuel tension (though reports at the time also cited Diesel’s lateness). The article also surfaces drama with Reynolds noting that the co-stars “didn’t speak for years” after their fall 2020 blowup but have since patched things up.

There’s been counterprogramming to the Wrap story. An unconfirmed report from Puck suggests that “unflattering” press about Johnson may stem from a former publicist. People magazine ran a story about Johnson’s “flourishing career” and how he’s found “success in many areas” with an unnamed source saying “People love him.” And the Rock’s own Instagram feed has been filled with sweet fan encounters and charitable endeavors.

Years of building a good reputation will ‘offset these recent damaging allegations’

It’s true — people do love Johnson who has spent years cultivating a good reputation and it should help see him through this negative patch of press.

“The best strategy for the Rock is to tackle the bad press in a setting where he can poke fun at himself and the facts of his situation” says Schiffer. “The Rock is beloved globally and has built mountains of public goodwill that can offset these recent damaging allegations.”

How does a star like Johnson who will voice the Maui character in the Moana sequel out later this year break the cycle of bad press? By “addressing the negative items with empathy and truth owning your part in it and then showing what you learned” says Schiffer.

He adds “The Rock did that well with the outcry in Hawaii and will likely do the same with the hits on being late on the set of his film.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvc2VhbmRncmFoYW0uY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcm9nZXItam9obnNvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roger Lane Johnson Obituary 2024,"Garner NC: At 5:14AM on May 5 2024 Heaven gained another angel when Roger Lane Johnson age 72 known to many as “Rog” or the “Running Man” won his battle with cancer.

And with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) emerging as the poster case of the cost of almost wilful failure to implement corrective measures there’s a call for Parliament to do more than just talk when its key committees make recommendations to improve the administration of public resources.

Last Tuesday the Auditor General’s Department (AuGD) report for the 2019/2020 financial year was tabled in the House of Representatives which included 44 audits that focused on 20 government ministries or offices.

Auditor General Pamela Monroe Ellis’ findings centred around billions at risk in areas of procurement resource and project management and governance.

Very few entities – such as the Kamina Johnson Smith-led Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade – received a clean bill of health as the 2020 report lamented the troubling breakdown of internal controls in government departments.

Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.

Nowhere was the picture more stark than in Karl Samuda’s MLSS which the auditor general argued has been persistent in ignoring recommendations over the years to improve its stewardship of public funds.

That ministry alone accounted for the exposure – what the AuGD calls “unresolved monetary risks” – of $3.3 billion.

“Recurring violations of established guidelines” undermines transparency and accountability in financial management the auditor general pointed out in an instance where the ministry failed to seek approval for reallocation of money to pay excess expenditure for the period 2016- 2018.

Tardiness was a constant adjective used to describe several of the alarming revelations at the ministry which has been served a budget of more than $36 billion in recurrent and capital funds since 2018.

In another instance transactions amounting to $173 million could not be verified because of inadequate supporting documents.

Then there was what appears to be the ministry’s disregard for its own internal audit reports and recommendations based on the AuGD’s review of those done between March 2017 and December 2019.

The internal audit unit of the ministry identified “significant internal control deficiencies” but up to the time of reporting the ministry “was yet to respond” to 60 issues of systemic weaknesses stretching back to 2017.

The lack of appetite to fix the problems at the ministry has been flagged over the years not just by the internal auditor but also by the auditor general going back even as far as 2011.

Since 2011 Derrick Kellier Dr Fenton Ferguson the late Shahine Robinson and for a few months Mike Henry have presided over the ministry which has responsibility for some of the most vulnerable populations in the country – pensioners and some of the poorest citizens.

Samuda took over the reins in the new Cabinet formed after the September general election last year.

The labour and social security ministry administers the National Insurance Fund (NIF) which is supported by national insurance contributions and is the source from which pensions and other benefits under the National Insurance Scheme are paid.

In a damning 2018 audit Monroe Ellis found that in 2017 without permission the NIF spent $27 million to purchase company shares owned by the spouse of a senior executive.

Alleged $600m fraud

There was also a case of alleged fraud involving more than $600 million that was uncovered in 2018.

Other issues raised in the 2020 AuGD report include $10 million in overpayments under the Programme of Advancement Through Health and Education a cash-transfer poverty alleviation programme; poor procurement highlighted in 2017 in the payments of $50 million for janitorial and security services without valid contracts.

There was also the inability to properly account for $99 million in goods; tardiness in having bank reconciliation of $11 million.

All of those helped to push the exposure of taxpayers’ money to near $35 billion based on the 2020 report. For 2019 the figure was at least $5 billion. The data for previous years could not be immediately ascertained.

Sunday Gleaner questions sent last week to the ministry’s permanent secretary Colette Roberts Risden and copied to Samuda are yet to be acknowledged.

... Stemming the haemorrhage

The continued disregard for recommendations to stem losses could have been caught at several points along the state’s accountability chain.

This includes what Parliament does with reports that go before its two main oversight committees – the Public Administration and Appropriations Committee (PAAC) and the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) – to which AuGD reports are mainly referred.

The PAAC and the PAC are also the two busiest having met a combined 206 times between 2012 and 2020.

However except for the more than a dozen reports on the Budget which have to be considered for the estimates to be approved the House of Representatives rarely debated recommendations from either committee.

“I agree that there is a problem with that” said a senior Holness administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

“But think about it. [Would] a ruling party have any interest in debating a report that speaks to maladministration at an agency under a cabinet member’s leadership? You’re not likely to get that.”

In the last 15 years none of the PAC’s annual reports have been debated by the Parliament the Jamaica Accountability Meter Portal (JAMP) a local transparency lobby which tracks recommendations has noted.

“They have been tabled but they have never made it to the agenda” argued JAMP’s executive director Jeanette Calder. “So the business leader of the House is going to have to begin to explain to the people of Jamaica what is it about these reports and the magnitude of the losses that has not ... once for the last 15 years triggered it appear on the agenda of the House for the Parliament to discuss and debate.”

The advocate argued that this lack of action by the Parliament creates the environment for entities like the labour ministry to routinely ignore reports both from their internal watchdogs as well as external ones.

“We’re in a matter of COVID now where every single penny of the people’s purse matters” Calder lamented noting that the particular findings of the labour ministry warrant a special enquiry.

The MLSS noted in response to the AuGD that units on procurement and property management have been established matched with the usual promise to address findings.

A deeper examination of the ministry is required however Calder said.

“We need an audit commission of enquiry to be done on the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to tell the people of Jamaica what exactly is happening” she said.

The Opposition’s Julian Robinson who took over as PAC chairman last year admits that Parliament needs to strengthen its oversight to ensure losses are curbed and gaps in accountability plugged.

“It’s the responsibility of the full House once reports are received to discuss deliberate but more importantly to ensure that we hold the ministers agencies and departments accountable to implement what is recommended” he told The Sunday Gleaner.

The imposition of surcharges to penalise officers for the loss of money and the delegation of disciplinary powers to permanent secretaries are also among the arsenal of accountability.

JAMP and the Zahra Burton-led investigative newsletter 18 Degrees North have produced data acquired through access to information requests suggesting that surcharges have been underutilised.

The financial secretary who can require public officers who incur losses to pay it back (surcharged) has not recommended surcharges for almost eight years Burton’s probe last December revealed.

The Financial Administration and Audit Act stipulates that recommendations for surcharges should come from the auditor general or the accounting officer who are mostly permanent secretaries.

The question of holding people accountable for things you do not oversee directly is a major concern said one permanent secretary who did not want to be named.

With the rollout of vaccines underway and a new round of economic stimulus landing soon JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup each said on Friday that they had begun to pare back the enormous reserves they had socked away in case of an economic disaster.

Citigroup’s chief financial officer Mark Mason cited the vaccines the most recent round of stimulus and the election outcome — which is likely to result in a bigger stimulus package — as drivers of the bank’s decision to raise its economic forecast lower its expectations for the unemployment rate in 2021 and release some rainy-day funds.

“There are a lot of favorable indicators that support the direction of the variables and make for a more positive outlook in 2021” Mr. Mason said on a call with journalists to discuss the bank’s results adding that things had improved even more since Citi had closed its books after calculating its fourth-quarter performance and its economic forecast this month.

Some of the changes that banks are making to their forecasts could be temporary. New accounting rules force them to tweak their reserves and their forecasts more frequently to keep up with changes to conditions in the financial markets and the economy. But their brighter outlook was not just confined to the paper on which their quarterly results were printed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2UtbWluaS1kb3ctam9uZXMtaW5kdXN0cmlhbC0wODMyNTc4NzMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM) Futures Technical Analysis – Potential for Steep Break Under 30233,"March E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures finished lower on Friday with Dow component JPMorgan Chase & Co weighing on prices and weakness in Exxon Mobil Corp dragging down constituent Chevron.

JPMorgan Chase on Friday beat analysts’ estimates for fourth-quarter profit on record trading results and a boost from releasing money previously set aside for loan losses. The sell-off was part of a price slide in the banking sector led by weakness in Wells Fargo and Citigroup.

Shares of Exxon slipped more than 5% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation into the oil giant over how it valued a key asset in the oil-rich Permian Basin. The bad news quickly spread to other stocks in the energy sector including Chevron. Lower oil prices also weighed on the stock.

On Friday March E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures settled at 30720 down 189 or -0.62%.

Daily March E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average

Daily Swing Chart Technical Analysis

The main trend turned down on the daily swing chart on Friday when buyers took out 30638 breaking a higher-top higher-bottom chart pattern that had been intact since January 4. The main trend will change to up on a move through 31116. Taking out 31148 will reaffirm the uptrend. The downtrend will be reaffirmed on a trade through 29318.

The first minor range is 31148 to 30506. Its 50% level at 30827 is potential resistance.

The second minor range is 29760 to 31148. Its 50% level at 30454 is the first potential support level.

The short-term range is 29318 to 31148. Its 50% level at 30233 is the most important support level. It’s the last potential support level before the 23918 main bottom.

The main range is 25872 to 31148. Its retracement zone at 28510 to 27887 is controlling the near-term direction of the Dow.

Short-Term Outlook

Given the close at 30720 we’re looking for an upside bias to develop on a trade over 30827 and for the downside bias to resume on a trade through 30454.

Bullish Scenario

A sustained move over 30827 will indicate the presence of buyers. This could lead to a test of the pair of tops at 31116 and 31148. Taking out these levels will signal a resumption of the uptrend.

Bearish Scenario

A sustained move under 30454 will signal the presence of sellers. This could trigger a break into 30233. Buyers could come in on the first test of this zone but if it fails be prepared for an acceleration into a minor bottom at 29760.

The main bottom at 29318 is the last potential support before the 28510 – 27887 retracement zone. This area is controlling the near-term direction of the Dow.

There was no possible upside only risk. But the apolitical CEO is one of the many norms shattered by Donald Trump. In many respects the 45th President has made it easy for corporate leaders to be more outspoken. It’s sort of a no-brainer to speak out as National Association of Manufacturers president and CEO Jay Timmons put it on Jan. 6 against “armed violent protesters who support the baseless claim by outgoing President Trump that he somehow won an election that he overwhelmingly lost.”

There are a number of factors driving CEOs’ new embrace of the bully pulpit. For one insurrection sedition and violence in the streets is bad for business. Big organizations require stability. Tear gas and bear spray make it hard to achieve the “visibility” into future earnings much prized by Wall Street. “With our country in the midst of a pandemic business leaders recognize that ongoing division and distrust in our political system threatens the economic recovery and job creation our country desperately needs” says the Business Roundtable an organization made up of the CEOs of the nation’s biggest corporations including Apple JPMorgan Chase GM and Walmart.

On its most basic level Trump’s persistent assault on the rule of law and the degradation of a federal election risked undermining the foundations of the system that made the American economy the most dynamic and successful on earth. The primacy of U.S. capital markets and the nation’s standing as a safe haven for global investors were at risk with Trump’s attacks on the norms of good governance. An authoritarian government and a free market can’t co-exist. At its heart the capitalist system requires honoring contracts which made Trump’s flouting of rules a profound threat to financial institutions capital markets and corporate governance. “We believe in investment in the rule of law not the law of rulers” says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld senior associate dean of leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. “CEOs say that about investing abroad—now that has to apply that at home too.”

Defending that system helps explain in the week after the Capitol attack a who’s who of the nation’s most prominent blue-chip companies including Marriott AT&T American Express and Amazon said they would halt campaign donations to members of Congress who voted to challenge the presidential-election results. Unsentimentally Hallmark Cards which is based in Kansas City Mo. took the additional step of asking Republican Senators who objected to certifying the results to refund the company’s previous donations. Other companies including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup called a temporary halt to donations to both Republican and Democrats.

“We are taking a pause on federal contributions and using this as an opportunity to really evaluate the candidates that we have supported and do their actions and values align with ours” Lynn Good CEO of Duke Energy said in an interview with TIME. “We felt like this was an important one for us to weigh in on as a company.” Good said the decision came after careful deliberation and was informed by the strong reaction of many of the company’s employees and customers. “Everyone was watching with some degree of dismay and shock” says Good. “We are not a supporter of violence being used as a way to voice an opinion on an important topic.” (One could ask whether corporations should play such an outsize role in funding candidates but that’s a separate topic for another day.)

Additional moves may be forthcoming. Sonnenfeld who has convened three emergency summits with CEOs since the election said the majority of CEOs at a recent meeting said they would “reconsider their investments in states of seditious Congressmen.”

Business leaders are stepping in to fill a void left by the erosion of trust in government and other institutions. Communications firm Edelman which annually measures trust in institutions including government NGOs business and media found in its new study that business is the “only trusted institution … and the only institution seen as both ethical and competent.” The report concluded “The heightened expectations of business bring CEOs new demands to focus on societal engagement with the same rigor thoughtfulness and energy used to deliver on profits.”

One marker of a sea change is the emergence of a new vocabulary. Deplatforming—kicking bad actors off the tech infrastructure—has become a mark of corporate activism. Twitter Facebook and most recently YouTube have deplatformed President Trump. On Jan. 12 YouTube said in a statement “After careful review and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence we removed new content uploaded to the Donald J. Trump channel … We are also indefinitely disabling comments under videos on the channel.”

Other tech giants up and down the digital food chain took similar steps in the wake of the Capitol attack. Amazon’s immense cloud-services businesses (in the most recent quarter they generated nearly $10 billion in revenue) kicked right-wing social network Parler off its web-hosting servers earlier this month. (Parler has sued for breach of contract.) Apple and Google which removed Parler’s app from its app stores have moved to dismantle the infrastructure of hate. And Stripe a high-flying fin-tech startup said it would no longer process payments for Trump’s campaign website in the wake of the Capitol riots for violating its policies against encouraging violence.

Whether this was a bold act of corporate leadership—or the equivalent of closing the digital barn door after the rabid horse had already kicked the stable manager in the head and flung its rider to the ground—is a complex question. The deplatforming largely resulted in a collective short-term sigh of relief but was a stark demonstration of the inordinate and lightly regulated power of a handful of tech giants based in Silicon Valley. Global leaders including the heads of state of Germany and Mexico expressed concern over private companies’ ability to censor speech. Forging a new paradigm around the complicated questions of free speech market concentration and tech regulation will be one of the most consequential global policy debates of our time.

A final driver forcing CEOs to come off the sideline is the expectation of today’s more politically engaged younger workers. The Edelman survey found that 86% of respondents expected CEOs to speak out on societal issues. “We govern with the consent of the governed and the governed are restless” one CEO of a small firm told TIME voicing concern over the expectation that a CEO statement was now considered de rigueur after any development of note. Speaking out is fine on big issues like climate change or illegally closing the borders to people of one religion according to the CEO. But there is a growing unease about where it will lead particularly with issues that hit closer to home like executive compensation and the wealth gap. In a post-Trump Joe Biden world “no comment” is no longer an option.

We're all worse off for it.,"When Democrats took back the House of Representatives in 2018 a number of the freshman representatives quickly emerged as media stars. One was Katie Porter who used her platform on the Financial Services Committee to highlight the ways in which the banking and finance industries could take advantage of Americans.

The company is targeting an operating margin of more than 3% by 2023 and at least 5% by mid-decade according to a statement last week. This compares with a 4.8% return in 2019 before the manufacturer racked up record losses in the midst of the health crisis.

De Meo 53 faces the difficult task of rationalizing a bloated cost structure and excess production capacity while pacifying the French state Renault's largest shareholder. The CEO said the expense reductions the company laid out just before he joined from Volkswagen in July will be achieved ahead of schedule and set fresh objectives for four years from now while avoiding any new job cuts.

The plans ""may seem to lack ambition"" but are ""rock-solid"" and can be achieved even in the worst conditions de Meo told analysts. Renault shares erased initial declines and were little changed in Paris after the news.

""We see the 2025 financial targets as conservative"" Jose Asumendi a JPMorgan Chase analyst who rates Renault the equivalent of a buy said in an email. He estimates that the objectives could be achieved by 2022.

Renault's margins will be constrained by high levels of depreciation Deputy CEO Clotilde Delbos told analysts on a conference call. While the company was an early mover with regard to electrification the bulk of its industrial assets are tied to internal combustion engine-powered vehicles.

Of the 24 models Renault plans to launch by mid-decade half will be in larger-vehicle segments that tend to be more lucrative and at least 10 will be fully electric. Its CEO turned around Volkswagen's Spanish brand Seat before taking the top job at Renault after its ouster of Thierry Bollore a protege of longtime chief Carlos Ghosn.

While de Meo has coveted the turnaround achieved by Renault's French peer PSA Group his targets for profitability fall short of the levels his company's archrival achieved before covid-19 ravaged the industry. The maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars is now on the cusp of merging with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles after the French government scuttled the Italian-American company's attempt to combine with Renault.

De Meo's strategic plan is the first Renault has delivered since the departure of Ghosn whose arrest in Japan in 2018 triggered an unprecedented crisis within the French company and its partner Nissan Motor Co. The more than two decade-long alliance nearly unraveled after factions within Nissan waged a campaign to unseat the chairman and cooperated with prosecutors in Japan.

In a bid to demonstrate cohesion within the alliance the heads of Nissan and Mitsubishi spoke at Renault's presentation about backing the turnaround plan and closer ties between the companies.

Nissan and Renault made plans last year to each cut more than 14000 jobs worldwide though de Meo and Chairman Dominique Senard have had to tread carefully. They've come under considerable pressure from the state after Renault took out a 5 billion-euro government-backed loan to weather the covid-19 crisis."

Frankly this could very well be someone’s dream job.

Kraft Heinz is looking to hire a new team of Hotdoggers (yes that’s what the job posting says) to drive its famous hot dog-shaped Wienermobile across the country for a year.

An ideal Hotdogger is an “outgoing creative friendly exuberant college graduate who has an appetite for adventure and is willing to see the country through the windshield of the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile for one year” the job description reads.

Hotdoggers will hit the open road in the 27-foot orange and yellow vehicle stopping at more than 200 events according to the job posting.

They’ll also appear on local television and radio and do newspaper interviews and they will create content for social media.

They will sleep in hotels or short-term corporate housing across the country.

In March 2020 all Wienermobile events were canceled because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Despite the hiatus the Wienermobile garnered attention in September when a Hotdogger who goes by the name “Zach n’ Cheese” proposed to his girlfriend at Yellowstone National Park next to the famous hot dog bus.

In October the Wienermobile set out again.

CNN has reached out to Kraft Heinz to ask about Covid-19 safety protocols for Hotdoggers.

The Wienermobile has evolved since the first one was created in 1936 by Carl Mayer according to the company.

The 1969 model featured Ford Thunderbird taillights and a Chevy motor home frame and averaged 187 “smiles” per gallon according to Oscar Mayer.

In 2017 the company unveiled an entire Wienerfleet including a hot dog-shaped drone.

The job description on the company website says they are seeking “an outgoing creative friendly exuberant college graduate who has an appetite for adventure and is willing to see the country through the windshield of the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile for one year!”

A clean driving record is an understandable requirement and the job duties include helping execute a planned 200 events around the country driving and maintaining the 27-foot hot dog on wheels creating content for the brand’s social media accounts and pitching stories to local media and serving as brand spokesperson for newspaper radio and television interviews.

(WRIC) — Videos show an unmasked person yelling and cursing at a security guard inside a Kroger in Richmond Virginia.

Two incidents are in focus at the Lombardy Street Kroger — the most recent occurred just two days ago.

Often inaudible the shopper can be heard shouting expletives at the officer who attempts to escort the person out the front door.

They “just flipped out. Started calling me b-words” Nigel Norwood told NewsNation affiliate WRIC the SSGIS private security guard who recorded both incidents on his cell phone.

Norwood said the person was causing a disturbance inside the store in May–yelling and cursing. Prompting him to ask them to leave and not return.

“Out the store sir” Norwood can be heard saying multiple times as the shopper continuously repeats the same expletives.

When asked about how he remained calm and collected Norwood — a U.S. Marine — said “it’s up to you to carry it [the situation] in the most professional way possible especially when you represent a company and when you represent a business that’s been around for a very long time who is entrusting you to keep the store secure.“

Once the pair reach the checkout area during the most recent incident on Wednesday Norwood handed-off his phone to a friend who happened to be there because he was uncertain how the person may further react.

“I made sure that the camera was rolling because I already knew that the approach and the response that I was going to get wasn’t going to go my way” he said.

“If it did go right then you know the footage would not be out.”

Even once the person and Norwood made it outside both times the shopper continued to yell expletives.

Friday night the Lombardy Street Floor Supervisor Ariel Christian said the person causing all the commotion was put on a “trespassing” list in-house after the first incident.

Christian said behavior typically does not rise to the level of having to be on that list but the May incident was an exception.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaWNrMmhvdXN0b24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9jaGVjay15b3VyLXRpY2tldHMtMi1wb3dlcmJhbGwtdGlja2V0cy13b3J0aC0xbS1zb2xkLWluLWhvdXN0b24tYXJlYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Powerball tickets worth $1M sold in Houston area,"HOUSTON – Houston-area residents purchased Powerball lottery tickets worth $1M at a Sugar Land Kroger and a Houston convenience store Texas Lottery officials said.

The individuals bought Powerball tickets that matched five of the numbers picked in Saturday’s Powerball drawing -- 14 20 39 65 and 67- though they did not match the Powerball drawn which was 2.

One individual bought a Powerball ticket at a Sugar Land Kroger located at 18861 University Blvd. and another individual purchased a Powerball ticket at a Houston Quick Stuff Convenience Store located at 8055 North Sam Houston Pkwy.

Another Powerball ticket sold in Texas matched five of the numbers drawn Saturday. The ticket was purchased at Weimar Food Mart located at 202 N Center St. in Weimar.

The winners can claim their prizes within 180 days of the draw date.

The Powerball jackpot grew to an estimated $730 million after no one matched all five numbers and the Powerball in Saturday’s drawing. If a lottery player wins in the next Powerball drawing on Wednesday Jan. 20 it would be the United State’s fifth-largest jackpot of all time according to the Associated Press.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3BhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2NvbHVtbnMvMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9jb3ZpZC0xOS1kaWFnbm9zaXMtcmFwaWRseS10dXJucy1mYW1pbHktbGlmZS1pdHMtaGVhZC80MTUxMzA2MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID-19 diagnosis rapidly turns family life on its head,"For a long time I was betting that the Deckers would evade COVID-19.

We did our part from the start tried to limit our movements as best we could. We wore our masks and made hand sanitizer a habit. We haven't sat down in a restaurant in months. We canceled family gatherings first for Thanksgiving and then Christmas.

With the turn of the new year I was cautiously optimistic that we might ride out the pandemic and make it to the point that a vaccine became widely available.

More:Kroger Drug Mart and everywhere else you can get a COVID-19 vaccine in Ohio. See the map

So much for that. The damn virus wormed its way into our lives.

The stealth of the coronavirus has been one of its more vexing traits. With so many asymptomatic carriers it seemed largely impossible to figure out where you might have picked it up.

In our case the probable entry point is not difficult to deduce.

While I've worked from home since March my wife has gone to work at a veterinary hospital every week since the pandemic began. Vet clinics were deemed essential services and stayed open. People love their pets.

The hospital changed up its business procedures and for months my wife and coworkers have been running out to the parking lot to pick up pets drop off meds and pass paperwork through car windows.

There's no way to know if a client ultimately was the source of infection though. An employee might have brought the virus in from their own personal circle. What is clear is that once it breached the hospital it gained a foothold. Within a few days employees were falling ill and the hospital closed.

More:You may have to wait longer for a vet appointment during the pandemic. Here's why.

My wife started coughing on Wednesday; enough that she called her doctor to arrange for a test.

By the time of her test on Thursday morning she was fairly sick with all the symptoms of a bad flu. I'm a wimp when I'm sick. She is not. So when she spent Thursday in bed I knew she was hurting. The positive test results came in late Thursday night.

By then I was running a low-grade fever and feeling ""off"" myself. On Friday morning I went for my test. As of this writing I don't know the results but they already seem moot. I've started to cough and the lymph node below my right ear hurts like hell.

So far the kids are not showing any symptoms. From the beginning of the pandemic my wife and I have preached precaution not paranoia to them.

Today I'll admit that the paranoia is creeping in.

About 400000 Americans now have died from COVID-19 with many more left seriously ill. Even so the rational part of me recognizes that the vast majority of infections seem to pass without severe implications or even without notice. No one in my family thank goodness falls into a truly high-risk group.

But I worry that we already have passed it on to those who do without us knowing. And my wife has autoimmune issues. My daughter has exercise-induced asthma. And as you can tell from my picture or know from reading my column I am not the portrait of physical fitness. I'm overweight and have high blood pressure. About a year ago I officially became diabetic. All those are pre-existing conditions that likely increase the risk of developing serious symptoms from COVID-19.

If I made the right choices since the pandemic's onset I have to own the fact that I've made poor health choices for years that now put me into a higher-risk category. We reap what we sow.

I hope you heed the messages broadcast recently on those Department of Transportation freeway signs.

New year same virus. Mask up Ohio.

Stay healthy folks. Be smart and be kind to one another.

That’s commonplace for a gaming conglomerate with operations on two continents a worldwide workforce of more than 50000 and a market capitalization of $45 billion.

The question however is who oversees the playbook for Las Vegas Sands going forward?

The company is involved in gaming expansion discussions in two states is considering the possible sale of its Las Vegas Strip holdings and is spending $5.5 billion to renovate and grow its casino holdings in Macau and Singapore.

At the same time Las Vegas Sands is looking to rebound from the heavy economic toll the COVID-19 pandemic inflicted on its casino operations. The company’s revenues are down more than 47 percent and it suffered a net loss of more than $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2020.

For now it seems the Sands’ future is in the hands of Miriam Adelson 75 who has control of 56.6 percent of the company’s outstanding stock through personal ownership and several family trusts in which she is one of two trustees.

Under Nevada gaming regulations Miriam Adelson is now viewed as the company’s controlling shareholder. Before her husband’s death she owned more than 10 percent of Las Vegas Sands which also could have required licensing. Several Nevada gaming lawyers speaking on background said the current ownership state places her in a “mandatory licensing situation.”

According to the company’s 2020 proxy filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Sheldon Adelson and family members owned more than 432.6 million shares of Las Vegas Sands stock. Sheldon Adelson controlled 10.4 percent of the company and Miriam Adelson controlled 43.3 percent with the rest of the family’s shares tied up in the trusts.

Sheldon Adelson was licensed as the company’s controlling shareholder. Despite her ownership percentage Miriam Adelson wasn’t licensed by Nevada gaming authorities.

An Israeli-born doctor who specializes in treating substance abuse Miriam Adelson was married to Sheldon Adelson for almost 30 years.

She was licensed briefly by Nevada gaming regulators from November 2004 until April 2005 for trusts that covered two of her children. The Sands went public in December 2004 which led to the trusts being dissolved. She has not been licensed since.

The matter may not be cleared up until after the traditional week-long Jewish mourning period and the reading of Sheldon Adelson’s will. He was buried on Friday in a private ceremony in Jerusalem. Las Vegas Sands spokesman Ron Reese declined to comment on the potential licensing matter.

Miriam Adelson has been viewed as a co-partner to Sheldon Adelson. He often said the inspiration for the Venetian was the couple’s honeymoon in Venice Italy.

She was listed as a co-contributor in the millions of dollars the Adelsons donated to the GOP over the years. After the Adelsons contributed some $123 million to GOP causes in 2018 Miriam Adelson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump. A year earlier the Adelsons had prominent seats at Trump’s inauguration.

Miriam Adelson influenced her husband’s support for Israel both financially and politically.

Longtime Nevada gaming attorney Tony Cabot who is now a Distinguished Fellow in Gaming Law at UNLV’s William S. Boyd School of Law said in certain cases the chairman of the Gaming Control Board “can administratively approve a person’s involvement in a trust as a result of a transfer” as long as that person has already obtained a gaming license.

Irwin Chafetz 84 a Las Vegas Sands board member since 2005 is the other trustee on the Adelson family trusts. A longtime Boston businessman he was an original investor when Sheldon Adelson acquired the Rat Pack-era Sands Hotel Casino on the Strip for $110 million in 1989.

Current leadership

There has been just one leader in Las Vegas Sands’ history. Sheldon Adelson who died at age 87 of complications during the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma on Jan. 11 changed the Las Vegas Strip landscape and led the U.S. gaming industry’s expansion into Asia. At the time of his death Adelson was 19th on the Forbes 400 with an estimated net worth of $35.9 billion.

For now the company is in the hands of its top two corporate executives — Rob Goldstein and Patrick Dumont.

Goldstein who held a variety of leadership roles since joining Las Vegas Sands in 1995 and has been the company’s president since 2015 was appointed acting chairman and CEO on Jan. 7 when it was announced Adelson was taking medical leave.

Goldstein is also acting chairman and CEO for Sands China the company’s Hong Kong-based subsidiary that operates its five casino-resorts in Macau.

When Adelson was first sidelined with non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma in March 2019 he never stepped aside. But Goldstein served as the de facto CEO overseeing quarterly earnings conference calls and the company’s operations until Adelson returned.

Dumont has been chief financial officer of Las Vegas Sands since 2016 after serving in several senior level operating and finance positions starting in 2010. He is married to one of Miriam Adelson’s daughters from her first marriage Sivan Ochshorn.

Dumont has more than 20 years in finance corporate strategy and management and worked in investment banking at Miller Buckfire & Co. and Bear Stearns & Co. His public profile through the company has increased over the past few years.

Both Goldstein 65 and Dumont 46 are members of Las Vegas Sands’ 11-person board of directors. Goldstein has long been licensed by the Nevada Gaming Commission in various roles. Dumont was licensed as CFO in 2017.

In Macau Wilford Wong remains president of Sands China a position he has held since 2015. Last summer his contract was extended until 2024.

“Mr. Adelson built a strong and loyal culture with appointment and ascension” Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said last week. “The executive structure has long been in place and is well positioned for transition.”

Beynon suggested the company could look at potential casino acquisitions which would be a change in philosophy given Adelson’s “preference of developing assets not acquiring.”

Jefferies gaming analyst David Katz told investors not to expect any changes in the corporate management structure.

Three corporate events however could shake the outcome of Las Vegas Sands – a potential sale of the company’s large holdings in Las Vegas; the future of the Las Vegas Sands’ gaming concession in Macau (the Macau government’s term for a gaming license) which expires in June 2022; and a decision regarding the Adelson family’s 57 percent stake in the company.

“We ultimately believe these issues are being decided upon from a position of strength and therefore have confidence in the current leadership to arrive at the most positive conclusion for value” Katz said.

Reese told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the board will eventually determine the permanent appointment of a new CEO but no time frame was given.

Katz suggested Adelson family members could retain control of the stock and assume a more prominent leadership role in the company while continuing to draw annual dividend payments that topped $1 billion prior to the pandemic

He said the least likely outcome would be the family selling the shares on the open market. Las Vegas Sands closed at $53.44 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares are down 5.6% since Adelson’s passing.

Leaving Las Vegas?

In October Las Vegas Sands confirmed it was in preliminary talks with an advisor to potentially sell its Las Vegas Strip gaming and convention operations in a deal valued at $6 billion.

Reese said at the time “very early discussions have taken place but nothing has been finalized.” Sources said the company engaged Goldman Sachs in exploring options

On the Strip the Venetian and Palazzo resorts and the Sands Expo and Convention Center cover 63 acres and include 7000 hotel rooms more than 200000 square feet of casino space and 1.7 million square feet of convention facilities. Las Vegas Sands also owns 19 acres east of the Strip where Madison Square Garden is building the $1.7 billion MSG Sphere an entertainment complex.

The company’s revenues from the Venetian and Palazzo are down more than 56 percent in the first nine months of 2020 because of the pandemic which caused massive disruption in the properties’ mid-week conventions and meetings business.

The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said convention attendance has declined almost 73 percent through the first 11 months of the year which includes eight straight months of zero convention attendees.

Since the announcement there has been some speculation on a potential buyer which includes a real estate investment trust. That type of transaction would allow the Las Vegas Sands to continue operating the Strip properties through a lease agreement and use the proceeds to expand operations to New York City and Texas.

New markets

In December The Texas Tribune reported that the Adelsons donated $4.5 million to a Texas account affiliated with the Republican State Leadership Committee the top national GOP group involved in state legislative races. Las Vegas Sands also signed up 10 lobbyists with deep connections in Austin including the wife of Republican strategist Karl Rove for the upcoming session. Casino expansion is expected to be included with the state facing a $4.6 billion budget hole.

Andy Abboud Las Vegas Sands’ chief lobbyist told a conference hosted by the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association that the company considers Texas “the biggest plum still waiting out there in the history of hospitality and gaming.”

Meanwhile in New York City Las Vegas has sought to move up a voter-mandated 2023 timeline for when New York lawmakers can authorize an integrated resort in the nation’s most populous U.S. city. New York’s four-year budget gap estimated at between $70 billion to $75 billion may refuel that issue.

Even without Sheldon Adelson in the picture Global Market Advisors Director of Government Affairs Brendan Bussmann said Las Vegas Sands still wants a foothold in jurisdictions without integrated resorts.

“While both markets offer different approaches for the company it would allow them to grow the portfolio beyond the initial focus of Asia” Bussmann said.

He added that New York City is the reason the company opened the $800 million Sands Bethlehem in Pennsylvania in 2009. It was the closest casino to Manhattan at the time. Las Vegas Sands sold the property in 2019 for $1.3 billion to an Alabama-based Indian tribe.

“This is a natural opportunity to chase but it will be competitive with the existing players and other competitors” Bussmann said. “Unless something changes this race is still a couple of years off.”

Despite the company’s efforts in Texas Bussmann said “It will likely take a couple of sessions to get this done even with the budget deficit as gaming is not immediate revenue.”

Asia is still king

Last May Las Vegas Sands ended its years-long pursuit of an integrated resort license in Japan. Adelson made the decision — seven months after Goldstein told analysts an investment in the market “no longer penciled out.”

Macau and Singapore are a different story. The company drew between 65 percent and 70 percent of its annual revenues from Asia before the pandemic.

Adelson didn’t live long enough to see the unveiling of The Londoner Macau the centerpiece of the $2.2 billion being invested to renovate expand and rebrand Sands Cotai Central. The London-themed resort is expected to have a soft opening at the end of January and a full opening during Chinese New Year in February.

Gaming revenues in Macau fell to a 14-year low in 2020 as COVID-19 ravaged the market.

In his last earnings call in October Adelson was upbeat toward a Macau rebound.

“I remain steadfast in my belief that Macau has the potential to become one of the greatest business and leisure tourism destinations in the world” he said.

Las Vegas Sands is spending $3.3 billion on Marina Bay Sands in Singapore which includes a 15000-seat arena a 1000-room hotel and additional convention space. Expansion to the resort’s casino – one of two in the island nation – is not part of the project.

Macquarie’s Beynon said the Las Vegas Sands’ integrated resort business model – casino hotel dining retail entertainment and convention space – which is credited to Adelson – can’t be replicated and hasn’t been leased to outside REITs or private equity.

“The shopping mall’s financials are some of the highest in the world and we believe there is significant financial value beyond what most investors ascribe” Beynon said.

During one of my first meetings with Sheldon Adelson something caught my eye: a pair of gleaming airplane models on display in his office conference room at The Venetian.

One was a model of a Boeing 747SP and the other was an Airbus A340-500. Both had the distinctive colors of Sands Aviation: the dark-blue underside of the fuselage and trailing gold dark-blue and light-blue stripes the blue tones trailing up the vertical stabilizer.

Adelson the chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp. could tell I was mesmerized by the models and with a sparkle in his eye he initiated a conversation between two aviation geeks.

He excitedly told me how nice his newest addition was detailing the interior and the range of the Airbus. He said one of these days I would have to see it.

“It’s a beauty” he said with a smile.

It was a side of Adelson most people don’t get to see but it was clear there was a special place in his heart for his fleet of 19 corporate jets.

Adelson died Monday from complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Much has been written about Adelson’s visionary decision to purchase the legendary Sands hotel-casino on the Las Vegas Strip build the Sands Expo and Convention Center adjacent to the property then implode the hotel to make way for The Venetian. The integrated resort allowed thousands of guests to converge for business events during the day and enjoy the sights sounds and flavors of Las Vegas when the meetings were done. Conventions became central to Las Vegas’ business model.

‘A big hit’

Less is known about Adelson’s innovation in the use of private jets which he used to transport the company’s best customers to Macao Singapore and Las Vegas.

“That was all Sheldon’s idea because he said the ability to bring some of the larger customers nonstop in an environment where they’re comfortable and relaxed is going to be important” said Paul Gillcrist the company’s senior vice president of aviation. “And like almost all things that he did it was definitely out of the box. Nobody else has really emulated that in any way. But he was right. It was a big hit. If you could draw those people into your facility versus them going to somebody else then obviously that is a big win and he saw that early on.”

Adelson had “a passion for aircraft just as he had a passion for a lot of things” he said.

“He liked airplanes very much he liked what they did for him and he just liked them because they were airplanes” Gillcrist said. “He was very very knowledgeable. He knew how to calculate true airspeed and other flight dynamics. He liked all that stuff and he was very quick mathematically. He sort of enjoyed all the navigational issues and how do you get from here to there and why does it look this way. He was just always very interested in anything that had to do with the airplane.”

The Sands aircraft fleet includes three Gulfstream IV SPs six Gulfstream G550 jets five Boeing BBJs — shorthand for Boeing Business Jets a variant of the Boeing 737-700 — two more 737s a Boeing 767ER a Boeing 747SP and the Airbus. The 737s are for large parties of high rollers and their friends and families the Gulfstream business jets are for smaller groups and the 767 and 747 are for long hauls across the Pacific or Atlantic.

“All of those airplanes are in one way or another VIP” Gillcrist said. “There’s no airline-type interior in any of those. Some are a lot flashier than others but they’re all pretty flashy.

“A lot of people said ‘What?’ about going out and buying big airplanes but he was absolutely right” just as he was right about so many other business decisions that were contrary to conventional wisdom.

The aircraft are based in Las Vegas and Singapore’s Changi Airport. The company also owns Citadel Completions LLC in Lake Charles Louisiana a business dedicated to creating high-end interiors on jets and doing general maintenance work on planes.

You can occasionally see the Sands planes near the private hangars on the west side of McCarran International Airport.

Final flight

Adelson’s 767 was in the news in April when the company flew 2 million surgical masks and other personal protection equipment in the fight against the spread of COVID-19 from Guangzhou China to Las Vegas and Albany New York.

Sands’ 747 is one of two of the 747SP (Special Performance) jumbo jets the company owned. It’s a shorter version of the traditional 747 and there are only six of them in service today.

On Aug. 27 when Hurricane Laura was wreaking havoc on Lake Charles the eye of the storm passed over the Citadel Completions hangar where one of the 747s was parked for maintenance. Tornadoes spawned by the hurricane tore into the hurricane-proof hangar and spun a parked 737 around. Its wing sliced through the front of the jumbo. Gillcrist said the plane was “damaged beyond economic repair” and was lost.

In our meeting I told Adelson I didn’t know he had bought an Airbus a highly efficient plane capable of making the trans-Pacific flight from Las Vegas to Macao or Singapore without a stop.

Gillcrist explained that the Airbus is used primarily by Adelson’s family and is equipped with the comforts of home including sleeping quarters a dining room table and comfortable lounge areas.

Today the family and many friends continue to mourn the loss of Adelson who was honored in a private service at his final resting place in Jerusalem on Friday.

Getting there was Adelson’s last flight on the Airbus.

Perceptions are fueled by partisan animus economic dislocation and increasing alienation. People are good or evil. You either hate or love. Nuances disappear. Simplicity substitutes for clarity.

Sheldon Adelson embodied this more than almost anyone beloved by those who admired his acts of boundless generosity unmatched entrepreneurship and visionary accomplishments and reviled by those who despised his Republican donations anti-union crusades and occasional vindictiveness.

There were very few people who were agnostic about Adelson who died last week at 87. But like so many human beings especially remarkably successful ones he was a complex man just as likely to quietly help a wounded warrior as he was to try to bankrupt a journalist who displeased him just as likely to donate significant sums of his fortune to Israel-related charities as he was to obsess over a dispute with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority for decades just as likely continue to pay his employees throughout a pandemic as he was to muse about nuking Iran.

Much has already been written about Adelson some of it hagiographic some of it hateful. He was as polarizing as almost any non-elected public figure alive.

While there were some notable praiseworthy columns I do not think I have ever seen the level of disgusting savagery in the social media sewer that the announcement of his death occasioned. And yet I also think all of us would like the person closest to us to write as touching a remembrance upon our deaths as Miriam Adelson did for her husband.

But I come not to bury or simply praise Adelson knowing full well that what many felt was evil about him will live on and that much of the good he unquestionably did will be interred in Jerusalem where he was laid to rest a few days ago and where he was able to after so many years persuade a president to move the Israeli embassy.

Adelson’s impact on the gaming industry and state and national politics (not to mention that of Israel’s) cannot be underestimated. He revolutionized the industry’s attitude toward conventions and proved the doubters wrong with his all-suite approach and investment in Macau. He more than anyone else was responsible for bringing the Raiders to Las Vegas — an idea he conceived and then devoted all of his company’s resources to pushing a (sweetheart and awful) financial deal through the Legislature for what would become Allegiant Stadium.

Adelson is a seminal figure in the history of Las Vegas deserving of a place in the pantheon that began with Bugsy Siegel and includes Howard Hughes Kirk Kerkorian and Steve Wynn. Indeed in many ways Adelson was the anti-Wynn.

Unlike the undeniably charismatic brilliantly articulate and preternaturally extroverted ex-chairman of Wynn Resorts who hobnobbed with celebrities and loved being in his own ads the more private Adelson was driven by his desire to succeed and prosper ever the poor kid from Dorchester ever the outsider.

The Mirage and the Bellagio were spectacular yes but The Venetian and the Palazzo were too in their own way.

“He was not afraid to go all-in and take his position based upon his opinion without looking over his shoulder or second-guessing himself” Wynn said after Adelson’s death in an almost perfect coda for the Las Vegas Sands chairman’s life a quote that is at once laudatory and somehow not. Adelson was indeed driven was hard to dissuade when he had an idee fixe about politics or business. One of those was that Macau was an untapped gold mine for the industry which occasioned much derision inside the industry but ultimately resulted in Wynn coming to Adelson for tips on entering the market.

“Steve liked to share his vision and so did Sheldon in a much more practical way with far less color and adjectives” said Andy Abboud who for 23 years was the chairman’s political right hand. “He had a very practical business sense would walk through the financial modeling of integrated resorts why you have so many square feet of convention space the mechanics of how you make money.”

Or as someone else who knew him well told me: “He was a finisher. He did what he said he was going to do. He was not all talk; he was all do.”

My sense was that some people were jealous of Steve Wynn but some people just hated Sheldon Adelson. He was the incarnation of the billionaire trying to buy elections and politicians simply to make or save himself more money.

“Anybody who is high-profile and has been a disruptor as he has been – in philanthropy in business and in politics – he is going to make enemies” said Matt Brooks the executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition that Adelson helped fund.

But those who really knew him said Adelson did not contribute hundreds of millions to politicians and PACs over the years because of his personal bottom line. For him especially after he became wealthy the money was just a way of keeping score – and by that metric no one in the business he had chosen came close.

Adelson’s politics were not as easy to pinpoint as his pre- and post-mortem cartoonists tried to do. Yes he was a zealous supporter of Israel an unabashed Zionist and a fiscal conservative.

But he was also pro-choice pro-gay marriage and pro-immigration reform. He strongly believed the GOP was wrong on immigration his immigrant parents always on his mind.

Adelson also diverged from many in his party – including some bleating daily in Nevada – about the pandemic and the government’s response.

“He never was going to diminish how horrific the pandemic would be and he never had a problem with any of the measures that came down (from the governor)” Abboud told me. “The pandemic scared the daylights out of him.”

Adelson’s decision to continue to pay his employees – even after COVID lasted much longer than a month or two – was widely and justifiably lauded. Sure he could afford to do it more than his counterparts but he also spared his workers from untold hardships.

It’s hard to believe the man he helped elect President Donald Trump would have done the same. And while Adelson surely had little regard for Trump’s lack of substance he also probably saw him as a winner and used him to pursue his political agenda. And Trump for his part if he respected anyone it was someone who had (a lot) more money than he did.

By contrast Adelson’s little-known backchannel relationship with the most powerful Nevadan ever to hold office – Democratic Sen. Harry Reid – was a testament to both Adelson’s practicality and his and Reid’s similar blunt styles. Reid knew that Adelson could marshal significant resources against him in campaigns and Adelson knew that Reid had ascended to the pinnacle of capital power. It was a symbiosis that served both men.

That’s not to say there wasn’t a darker side to Adelson’s involvement in politics.

His effort to discredit former employee Shelley Berkley by releasing internal company memos she wrote and going all out to beat her in a race for Congress was ruthless and nasty. He once hired a quite-inept Las Vegas consultant to try to defeat three Democratic Clark County commissioners and was dubbed the “billionaire bully” in mail pieces. And his team essentially created the phenomenon known as Adam Laxalt out of whole cloth and ran one of the nastiest campaigns in recent history against Steve Sisolak in the 2018 governor’s race.

All of which goes to show that Adelson…often wasn’t very good at politics.

Berkley won that race all three of his candidates for the Clark County Commission lost and of course Sisolak is now governor. And even when he had success it was nothing to boast about. Adelson now has the unique distinction of having spent a fortune to help elect arguably the worst governor in the state’s history (Jim Gibbons) and arguably the worst president in the country’s history (Trump).

Adelson also spent an inordinate amount of time in what seemed like petty feuds whether it was pitting one local temple against another or suing journalists near and far. I’m sure Adelson thought he was wronged. But the lengths he went to especially with The Indy’s John L. Smith as the columnist detailed in a piece for The Daily Beast were quite appalling and frightening.

Sometimes it seemed it wasn’t enough for Adelson to win. He sought to crush maim destroy. (His Javert-like pursuit of the convention authority and its leaders through a half-century after feeling he had been disrespected when he owned COMDEX fits this pattern too.)

Emphasizing the duality of the man Adelson’s many acts of generosity and kindness some known and many unknown show a much different side.

He gave tens of millions of dollars to groups such as Birthright Israel which offers free trips to the country for young adults and other organizations there. And he has long been a supporter of veterans including his work with the Wounded Warriors Project.

“When we would do the Wounded Warriors he would always go and chat with them at dinner” Abboud recalled. “He would quietly do these incredibly generous things help them financially provide medical assistance and long-term care. No one ever knew about it.”

I was particularly struck by a Facebook post from Ed Bernstein the well-known lawyer and onetime Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate about his daughter Dana who died three years ago after a long battle with Crohn’s disease.

“There wasn’t a time when Dana would call him for a medical emergency that he didn’t respond immediately and offer his help” Bernstein wrote. “He was always kind and loving to her and I will forever be grateful for that. His generosity and good deeds will be remembered by many.”

As for my relationship with Adelson I knew and observed him for more than 30 years from before he imploded The Sands to make way for The Venetian after which I referred to him as Gondolier Numero Uno. (I was told he chuckled.) I did not know him well but I interacted with him and his agents enough times to get more than a sense of the man.

We had cross words a few times but I always found him to be a fascinating and refreshingly candid interview whether he was on my TV show or in his office or if I ran into him at an event and managed to get by his security detail.

(One thing that has stuck with me is how protective Miriam was of her husband whether it was her standing a few feet away from the camera when he was on the show or wandering into his office when I was interviewing him and occasionally admonishing him “Say ‘off the record’ Sheldon!”)

There was a mutual respect but we were never friendly per se. Indeed I always believed he was behind a threatened lawsuit against The Indy when we considered publishing a negative story about the Review-Journal and I suspected (and I was hardly alone) that he might have been behind the abrupt cancellation of my television show by craven public television overlords. But in both cases I was Tessio talking to Tom Hagen; I knew it was only business.

Ironically Adelson became the best fundraiser The Indy could have hoped for as his purchase of the RJ induced many a donor to help contribute to an alternative news source. I was – and remain – disturbed by his purchase of the newspaper. He also owns one in Israel and it is known for having been a political billy club for Bibi Netanyahu.

Sure other billionaires own newspapers. But no billionaire so enmeshed in the political and economic fabric of the state and a small one at that. I thought it was dangerous and his initial effort to keep his ownership a secret and the newspaper’s subsequent kowtowing to him only confirmed my fears.

Don’t get me wrong; I don’t believe he constantly hectored editors and there were and are good reporters there impervious to such pressures.

But when you assemble an investigative team and its first project is to go after your bete noire (the convention authority) and Miriam is allowed front-page columns and mandatory-to-publish talking points are sent over on what to report about a trial involving the Sands and…well you get the picture.

So yes I acknowledge it bothers me deeply and I have pointed out when editors there either pre-emptively or after a call from a Sands minion bent to his will. All these last five years though Adelson never expressed any anger at what I was saying vis a vis the RJ mostly because I think he didn’t care that much.

I’m not sure where the RJ goes now that he is gone nor do I have much insight into the future of the empire he built — I’ll leave that to experts like Howard Stutz.

But love him or hate him Adelson’s passing is going to leave a huge vacuum in the worlds of politics and gaming. “A force of nature” as one associate called him and you always knew which way the wind was blowing with Adelson.

I often thought to myself during the last few years that rather than pressing forward into new markets or enmeshing himself in the political fray or getting into pointless scrapes that Adelson should just take his billions and go enjoy his remaining years. And you know what?

Maybe he did.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Nhc2lub3MtZ2FtaW5nL25ldmFkYS1jYXNpbm8tcmVzb3J0LXdvcmtlcnMtbWF5LWZhY2Utd2FpdC1iZWZvcmUtdmFjY2luYXRpb24tMjI1NjY0OS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY2FzaW5vcy1nYW1pbmcvbmV2YWRhLWNhc2luby1yZXNvcnQtd29ya2Vycy1tYXktZmFjZS13YWl0LWJlZm9yZS12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi0yMjU2NjQ5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nevada casino-resort workers may face wait before vaccination,"Nevada hospitality employees are in the fast lane to receive a COVID-19 vaccine but face a long line before it’s their turn.

Nevada hospitality employees are in the fast lane to receive a COVID-19 vaccine but face a long line before it’s their turn.

In the state’s latest COVID-19 playbook front-line casino and resort workers are in the fourth category of workers eligible for the vaccine through Nevada’s “frontline/essential workforce lane.” Workers in education and agriculture and certain state and local government employees are just a few of the groups ahead of them in line.

Leisure and hospitality employees make up a quarter of the state’s total private workforce. Thousands of these workers have been put face to face with visitors since June when casinos reopened. Gov. Steve Sisolak recently extended into February a 25 percent capacity limit on casinos which the state has previously identified as a source of spread.

“I think (getting hospitality workers vaccinated) is the first step to turning it all around” said one Strip dealer who was granted anonymity to protect her job at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

Vaccinating ‘critical’ workers

The latest vaccination guidelines from the state were announced Monday. Brian Labus an assistant professor of epidemiology at UNLV and a member of the medical team advising Sisolak said the updated playbook largely follows federal recommendations.

“There are local decisions we can make but the basic groups are decided at the federal level and rolled out similarly state to state” he said. But “we want to protect (hospitality workers) because they’re putting themselves in situations where they’re potentially at risk by being around tourists from all around the world.”

As of November there were roughly 301700 leisure and hospitality workers in the state according to data from the Department of Employment Training and Rehabilitation.

Labus said it’s not yet clear when hospitality workers will be eligible for the vaccine. He expects that priority groups will continue to shift as federal guidance is updated.

Virginia Valentine president of the Nevada Resort Association said Monday that Sisolak’s decision to expedite front-line hospitality workers is “welcome and encouraging news.”

“While Nevada’s resorts continue to take responsible actions to protect employees and guests … swift vaccine access will provide another layer of protection for resort employees their families and the public” she said in a statement. “Further protecting the frontline members of Nevada’s economic engine sends a clear message to visitors and meeting and convention organizers that Nevada is the world’s safest travel and tourism destination.”

Culinary Local 226 which represents about 60000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno has been working with Sisolak’s office and the resort association to ensure that hospitality workers have access to the COVID-19 vaccine said Geoconda Argüello-Kline the union’s secretary-treasurer.

“The hospitality industry is critical for the well-being of the entire state of Nevada and the Culinary union is supportive of the governor’s designation of hospitality workers as essential” she said in a statement.

MGM also provided a statement saying the company will make “the necessary resources available to achieve this critical objective” of immunizing workers.

Spokespeople for Las Vegas Sands Corp. Caesars Entertainment Inc. and Boyd Gaming Corp. did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Wynn Resorts Ltd. declined to comment and a spokesman for Red Rock Resorts Inc. referred to the resort association’s statement.

Waiting their turn

The state’s new vaccine rollout plan divides eligible populations into two concurrent lanes: one based on occupation the other based on age underlying health conditions and housing status.

Labus said some hospitality workers will have early access to the vaccine if they fall in a higher age bracket or have underlying health conditions.

“What you’re left with … are people who are younger and healthier to begin with” he said. “We’re not talking about leaving everyone in hospitality until the end. … There may be a large portion already vaccinated by the time we open it to the group of workers.”

Gladis Blanco a guest room attendant of eight years at Bellagio and a Culinary member said hospitality workers are on the front lines of the pandemic interacting with customers from across the world. She thanked Sisolak for “acknowledging that hospitality workers are essential” and said she would feel “peace of mind” that a vaccine could keep her and her family safe.

“I will be first in line for the vaccination when it is my turn” Blanco said through a Culinary spokeswoman statement.

Caesars Palace dealer Tony Pontecorvo said he doesn’t mind hospitality workers’ place in the state’s playbook.

“It’s easy to say we should be higher up but then you have to decide who to move down” he said. “It’s hard to say who I should jump in front of.”

A cook at an MGM property who is being granted anonymity to protect her job said she is comfortable waiting to receive the vaccine.

She acknowledged that vaccination could protect her and others from the coronavirus but she said she is concerned that current vaccine iterations wouldn’t prevent a newly identified more contagious strain. The cook said she already has been exposed to COVID-19; her mom contracted it and suffered “pretty bad” symptoms.

Last month President-elect Joe Biden’s surgeon general nominee Vivek Murthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that there’s “no reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed will not be effective against this virus as well.”

The cook said she was hoping for an “alternative to come into place” with higher efficacy by the time she was eligible though she would take the shot if her employer made vaccination a condition of her job.

“I don’t want to be exposed to something that’s stronger than what I witnessed my mom going through” she said. “It would just depend on the circumstance.”

The Southern Nevada Health District notes that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are after both doses more than 90 percent effective at protecting people from getting sick with COVID-19.

They are the only vaccines currently approved for COVID-19 and they were developed with the same level of U.S. Food and Drug Administration review as vaccines for polio smallpox meningitis and more according to the health district.

The Cosmopolitan dealer said she was ecstatic to learn that casino workers would be included in the prioritization lane.

“It’s going to be exciting to see what’s around the corner (once the vaccine is widely distributed)” she said. “I feel like the whole world is going to come to Vegas.”

Adelson a key supporter of President Donald Trump Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and their hawkish approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict died this week at the age of 87 after a long illness. His wide-ranging political influence leaves a controversial legacy.

The chairman and CEO of the Las Vegas Sands built a worldwide casino empire. Forbes ranked him the 19th wealthiest person in the U.S. worth an estimated $29.8 billion.

Netanyahu was at the airport late Thursday for the arrival of the casket which was draped with American and Israeli flags. Adelson was laid to rest at a revered centuries-old Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives just outside the walls of Jerusalem’s Old City in a private service.

Adelson was a driving force behind the Trump administration’s departure from decades of U.S. policy in recognizing contested Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and dropping objections to Jewish settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.

Netanyahu in one of a string of effusive eulogies by Israeli leaders called Adelson “an incredible champion of the Jewish people the Jewish state and the alliance between Israel and America.”

The Palestinians and other critics of Israeli policies viewed Adelson’s influence as an obstacle to efforts to bring about a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict an idea that still has wide international support.

Israeli critics of Netanyahu viewed Adelson’s establishment of a free newspaper that strongly supports the prime minister as a multi-million-dollar campaign donation that further corrupted the country’s politics."

The $17.2 million expansion announced in late 2018 was completed just in time for what was sure to be the venue's biggest season yet. A new partnership with Live Nation Entertainment plus a capacity increase to 11000 was drawing attention from acts who probably hadn't even blinked at our area before.

Backstreet Boys Alanis Morissette and Lindsey Stirling were all poised to make their AMP debuts while iconic rock band Phish was set for its first ever visit in the whole state. Country superstar Kenny Chesney would show his continued love for Northwest Arkansas with his fourth visit to Rogers. One of the AMP's most popular past shows -- Matchbox Twenty -- was returning. Heavy metal rockers Disturbed were going to be introduced to Northwest Arkansas with a stop on the 20th anniversary tour of their debut album while country trio Rascal Flatts would say farewell on theirs. And those are just some of the names that had been announced.

Well nearly a year later we know the tune all too well. Twenty-twenty didn't allow for the fanfare AMP staff envisioned in sharing the expanded facility with the community and like dominoes everything on the already robust summer schedule had come crashing down by mid-spring.

""It was heartbreaking"" Jennifer Wilson public relations director recalls of the moment they realized everything was going to change. ""Not just because we wanted to open the expanded venue but also because of the reality that this was going to impact hundreds of thousands of people within our industry and the other industries that support or depend on touring shows -- artists stagehands ushers hospitality folks as well as hotels restaurants logistics companies.

""I know I personally had pinned my hopes on opening the AMP in the summer and returning to some level of normalcy. When we realized that was not going to happen -- we were devastated.""

Though at a smaller scale staff did get to show off some of the AMP's new amenities throughout the summer and fall once they had gathered best practices from across the industry to develop appropriate safety protocols. The new flexible space at the venue offered opportunities for experiencing live music and movies outside with adequate social distancing.

The AMP Happy Hour series employed hospitality workers local and regional bands and supported the local live music industry as those bands performed in the new covered plaza at the top of the campus. Saturday Cinema brought some old favorites back to the huge outdoor screen. And inside donors got to see some of the additions to the backstage area during two blood drives hosted at the AMP.

""While our stage has the capacity to accommodate the biggest names in the touring industry our backstage areas needed better amenities to better accommodate the larger tours"" Peter Lane president and chief executive officer of the Walton Arts Center which owns the venue told guests during the introductory tour in August.

The expansion includes the covered plaza and a bar at the top of the lawn more concession stands and restrooms an expanded main entry and a bigger box office. Among the changes to the backstage area are a laundry a renovated and larger dining area for artists and crews and four dressing rooms putting the facility at eight dressing rooms total.

""This renovation was all about creating great spaces and experiences for our patrons and for our artists"" Wilson shares. ""I believe you can learn from every situation and 2020 is no exception to that. We wanted to develop programming during this intermission period that allowed us to stay connected to the community that kept artists employed and that are safe art experiences and we were able to accomplish that because of the great team we have at the Walmart AMP and Walton Arts Center.""

Twelve shows scheduled for last year have already confirmed dates for the new 2021 season. Organizers and industry partners will watch the vaccination distribution progress and continue gathering information and best practices as they wait with bated breath to see if large tours will be feasible and most importantly safe again this year. As AMP staff members prepare for 2021 though Wilson is confident that music lovers can expect to see at the very least the return of the popular AMP Happy Hour series this year.

Local reggae band The Irie Lions perform at the AMP’s new Choctaw Pavilion during Happy Hour on Sept. 11. “The sense of community is strong within our industry especially in Northwest Arkansas” AMP Vice President Brian Crowne said in the fall. “There is definitely emotion involved as artists get to connect with fans again in person. Any since of normalcy is moving during these times.” Guests are required to mask up unless they are seated at appropriately distanced tables.

Elvis Presley skyrocketed in fame during 1956 and that year he famously returned to his birthplace of Tupelo to perform two live concerts.

Elvis shot to fame in 1956

Gene said: “While I was working on the car Elvis just stood on the side of the car leaning over the vendor talking to me the whole time. We were just buddies back and forth.” He was pretty sure it was Elvis as he had that slicked back jet black hair and ended up having lunch with him. While Elvis was born in Tupelo Mississippi just north over the state line was Memphis Tennessee where he had moved with his family in 1948. After quickly becoming rich and famous Elvis purchased his Graceland mansion there in 1957.

Just over 50 years ago The Beatles released their final studio album in Let It Be. While mainly loved by fans alongside much of the Fab Four’s work the final mixing by producer Phil Spector – who died in prison today while serving a 2003 murder conviction – proved particularly controversial. Originally the Let It Be album was going to be called Get Back after the record’s final song before Spector assembled an album in early 1970 under the title of Paul McCartney’s iconic track.

In Spector’s final mixing he removed Don’t Let Me Down the B-side of the Get Back single and instead included a 1968 version of Across the Universe. The late producer also famously put in background studio chatter by The Beatles and included orchestral and choir overdubs on four of the songs. McCartney was not pleased with Spector’s take on the album and in 2003 initiated the release of an alternative mix in Let It Be…Naked which omitted The Beatles’ comments plus Spector’s embellishments. Additionally the new version of the record replaced Dig It and Maggie Mae with Don’t Let Me Down. READ MORE: The Beatles Get Back movie: UNSEEN footage of Fab Four fun – WATCH

Speaking with Rolling Stone in 1971 the late Beatle said: “When Spector came around we said Well if you want to work with us go and do your audition. “He worked like a pig on it. He always wanted to work with the Beatles and he was given the s***tiest load of badly recorded s*** with a lousy feeling toward it ever. And he made something out of it. He did a great job. “When I heard it I didn’t puke; I was so relieved after six months of this black cloud hanging over me that this was going to go out.”

Lennon added: “I had thought it would be good to let the s***ty version out because it would break The Beatles break the myth. “It would be just us with no trousers on and no glossy paint over the cover and no hype: This is what we are like with our trousers off would you please end the game now? “But that didn’t happen. We ended up doing Abbey Road quickly and putting out something slick to preserve the myth. I am weak as well as strong you know and I wasn’t going to fight for Let It Be because I really couldn’t stand it.” As for what the other members of the Fab Four thought Ringo Starr is quoted in The Beatles Anthology as remaining complimentary.

While The Beatles’ producer George Martin who was informed by EMI he wouldn’t get a producer credit because Spector produced the final version of Let It Be suggested “produced by George Martin over-produced by Phil Spector”. Despite the controversy surrounding the final mixing of the Let It Be album Spector went on to produce some solo records for The Beatles.

Lasers have been operational for years as the Navy’s Laser Weapons System (LAWs) was deployed on the USS Ponce several years ago. However the service has for many years been working with industry partners to further refine sharpen strengthen and power-scale newer laser-weapon applications. One of them called High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance (HELIOS) will soon be arming U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class DDG 51 Flight IIA destroyers.

Rear Adm. Boxall the Navy’s former director of surface warfare previously indicated that the HELIOS would go on the USS Preble a move which the Navy expects to happen later this year. The speed and technical advances of Navy laser systems were highlighted in a recent Chief of Naval Operations CNO NAVPLAN strategy document in which CNO (Chief of Naval Operations) Adm. Michael Gilday writes that the service is on pace to deploy new highly capable lasers ahead of rival nations.

""We will complete fielding of the high-power directed energy weapons systems our fleet needs to prevail in a near-peer fight before our adversaries achieve the same capability"" the CNO NAVPLAN states.

NAVY ELECTRONIC WARFARE STOPS MULTIPLE ENEMY MISSILE ATTACKS AT ONCE

The Lockheed-built weapon is now operational and has been delivered to the Navy following years of development. HELIOS is slated to be integrated on destroyers later this year following a series of ongoing testing at Wallops Island Va.

The testing HELIOS weapons developers explain will begin on land-based sites and move to sea-based tests where the laser is fired against drones from a destroyer at sea.

""We will be testing the accuracy and the ability of a laser to take out smaller targets proving out a lot of work we have done in the lab"" Jon Rambeau vice president and general manager Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems and Integrated Warfare Systems and Sensors told Warrior in an interview.

HELIOS is a 60kw laser system engineered with multiple kilowatt fibers to reach new levels of precision surveillance beam quality and strength or power levels. Lockheed Martin completed the Critical Design Review and Navy Factory Qualification Test milestones in 2020.

NAVY ARMS SEA DRONES FOR OCEAN ATTACK

""HELIOS is designed to be compatible with the ships and integrate seamlessly into ships cooling systems and power systems. There is operational hardware that integrates into the ship hardware"" Rambeau said.

Refining testing and improving maritime laser technology has been a long-standing Navy developmental effort which has sought to balance the requisite heat cooling and expeditionary electrical power requirements needed to support laser weapons operations. Lockheed information on the weapon cites that HELIOS is built with ""Thermal & Environmental Management Subsystems Refrigerant Cooling Ship’s Chilled Water & Clean Dry Air Distribution"" as well as a ""Spectral Beam Combined Fiber Laser.""

HELIOS will also be integrated with Navy ship AEGIS Combat Systems that draw upon common technical standards to synergize fire control ballistic missile defense and emerging weapons such as lasers.

""This is an ability for us to validate technology so that we can continue to design similar capabilities in the future"" Rambeau added.

On 17 January 2021 Elliniki Polemiki Aeroporia (HAF Hellenic Air Force) Lockheed F-16C-52+ Fighting Falcon serial 005 with markings of 335 Mira Tigris/Tigers took to the skies for the first time after its upgrade to the F-16V standard. The Viper was modified by Hellenic Aerospace Industries (HAI) at Tanagra air base (Greece).

Work on 005 started in January 2020 and it is now ready for it's certification. The 61-minute test flight of the F-16V was completed early in the afternoon and she was flown by an American pilot.

When all goes well it is expected that the aircraft will be ferried together supported by USAF tankers to the USA with three USAF F-16s (Shaw AFB) that are currently at SABCA Gosselies (Belgium).

The exact flight dates are still unknown at this point because 005 must complete 10 flight hours of testing over Tanagra AB before heading to the US. Judging from the bad weather over Greece these days this might take a while as some trials require minimum temperature of 16⁰C and the forecast predicts lower temperatures during the day.

Once certified HAI is vetted to perform the upgrade programme. During the ferry flight to the USA the four F-16s will be flown by American pilots two US Air Force and two Lockheed Martin test pilots who are in Greece at this moment. The USAF will provide refueling capabilities and the aircraft are scheduled to arrive in the USA on 5 February 2021.

Early 2020 the HAF announced the start of the modernisation programme of its extensive F-16 fleet. Greece awarded Lockheed Martin a USD 280 million contract to upgrade the air force’s fleet of F-16C-52+ and F-16D-52+ over the next seven years. These F-16s will be upgraded to the Block 70/72 Viper configuration. Among other enhancements this includes an APG-83 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar significantly enhancing the aircraft’s ability to identify and engage enemy aircraft.

In December 2019 Greek Defence Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos said the modernisation of 84 F-16s in the ""Viper"" version is expected to be completed by 2027.

When he found out he panicked.

Little House on the Prairie’s Melissa Gilbert was in a long-term relationship with Rob Lowe throughout the 1980s. The young couple couldn’t seem to get enough of each other during the honeymoon stage of their relationship and Gilbert claims they were hopelessly in love at the time.

But despite how happy they seemed on the outside their relationship faced several hurdles behind closed doors. Lowe was unwilling to commit to Gilbert and would frequently cheat on her with his co-stars. And when he found out his then-girlfriend was pregnant with his child all hell broke loose. In a state of panic Lowe told Gilbert that he wasn’t ready to be a father.

Rob Lowe proposed to Melissa Gilbert while she was in a serious relationship with someone else

Lowe and Gilbert had an on-again/off-again relationship for several years. And during one of the “off-again” periods when they were broken up with each other Lowe shocked Gilbert by getting down on one knee.

“Will you marry me?” He asked.

Gilbert said nothing. She was shocked. Where was this all coming from? Not months before he told her that he wanted to see other people. And now he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her? Gilbert wasn’t buying it.

To make matters more complicated she was already in a serious relationship with another man.

“I was at a complete loss” Gilbert writes in her memoir Prairie Tale. “I was totally thrown! Finally I said ‘Rob it’s just too much. Go away. Give me some time and I will give you an answer.”

Gilbert spent days trying to think it through even going so far as to write a “Pros and Cons” list about marrying Lowe. On the one hand she had never loved anyone as much as him. On the other hand he was a notorious cheater.

But despite her gut telling her not to go through with it Gilbert agreed to his proposal.

Bad mistake.

During Gilbert’s engagement with Lowe she learned that she was pregnant with his child. Although this news terrified her considering she was only 22 and not yet married she knew they would be able to make it work.

A few days later Gilbert broke the news to Lowe that she was pregnant. Yet to her chagrin her fiancé didn’t seem excited. In fact he looked utterly horrified.

“I saw the look on his face change from shocked to positively panic-stricken” she writes of Lowe’s reaction. “It was like I had stepped into a bottomless pit. I felt the terror of falling and no one to catch me.”

“I can’t be a father” Lowe told Gilbert. “I can’t be a husband. Melissa I can’t be a boyfriend right now either… I’m so sorry. It’s over.”

Melissa Gilbert has come to terms with her breakup and is now happily married

As heartbroken as Gilbert was she has since come to terms with their breakup. Despite how much it pained her at the time she believes it led her to the happy marriage she is currently in with her new husband.

“Everything no matter how painful led me to this place I am right now which is really an amazing place to be” she revealed on The Today Show. “I have a really peaceful happy life. I have these great confident kids. I’m married to a man I’m absolutely crazy about who cherishes me. It’s a real gift.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYW5kc2NhcGUuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2FtZXJpY2Etb3dlcy1icnlhbi1tb25yb2UtYS1kZWJ0LW9mLWdyYXRpdHVkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America owes Bryan Monroe a debt of gratitude,"From left to right: Herbert Lowe Will Sutton and Bryan Monroe all served as president of the National Association of Black Journalists.

Let’s begin remembering Bryan Monroe in the way he so often unabashedly did himself.

I did the first interview with Barack Obama after he was elected president – and I did the last interview with Michael Jackson before he died.

Bryan was rightly proud of those achievements. They were focal points of his three-year tenure as vice president and editorial director at the Ebony and Jet magazines in Chicago.

The magazines’ coverage of Obama’s monumental campaign and election not to mention other critical issues affecting the Black community were unquestionably invigorating and always on point. For that all of America owes Bryan a debt of gratitude.

And yet for many journalists across the country in the hours after he died of a heart attack on Jan. 13 at his home in Bethesda Maryland at just 55 years old his professional accolades paled compared with the humanity he exuded in countless measures over the years.

Bryan was vice president-print during the two years 2003 to 2005 I served as president of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ). He followed me as the organization’s leader the next two years. Our respective boards of directors pretty much had the same members.

Two dozen of us the night he died spent nearly three hours remembering Bryan via Zoom. It was incredibly joyous and heartbreaking loving and cathartic emotional and resolving for us to recall his friendship spirit encouragement generosity confidence leadership vision hugs love for his family – and yes his willingness to pick up the check for expensive meals and alcohol.

Leading the gathering I began by noting that Bryan was the youngest of the now six former NABJ presidents to die. Imagining that he sits on the heavenly NABJ board alongside groundbreaking journalists Chuck Stone Vernon Jarrett Les Payne Tom Morgan and Sidmel Estes is offering me some comfort. No doubt just as he did for so many of us over the years Bryan is showing them how to use or adapt to the latest digital technology.

During the Zoom call we also admired how Bryan consistently advocated for more coverage of underrepresented communities and for journalists of color to have greater opportunities in U.S. newsrooms. He was a passionate supporter of UNITY: Journalists of Color the organization that would convene Black Asian Hispanic and Native American media members every four years.

In Bryan’s remarkable career – he also helped lead a team of journalists from Knight Ridder and the Biloxi Sun Herald in Mississippi to a Pulitzer Prize for its Hurricane Katrina coverage served as editor of CNNPolitics.com and was a professor at Northwestern and Temple universities – his greatest contribution was getting Ebony and Jet ready for the Obama moment.

The magazines had become venerable not only for their decades of telling the stories of African Americans that mainstream media neglected but also by starting to feel ancient and obsolete.

Hired to succeed Lerone Bennett Jr. the renowned Black scholar author and social historian in 2006 Bryan quickly recruited several journalists from top newsrooms across the country to join him at the historic Johnson Publishing Co. headquarters on Michigan Avenue.

My wife Mira Lowe was among the journalists Bryan recruited to Ebony and Jet – she would become the weekly newsmagazine’s first female editor-in-chief – making her one of many others there and elsewhere whose careers were significantly advanced by him essentially saying “You could do this.”

During our Zoom call we spoke of how as president Bryan pushed NABJ to extend its influence internationally and helped to force the ouster of Don Imus from his syndicated radio show after the shock jock had racially disparaged the Rutgers University women’s basketball team.

We appreciated that Bryan a former Nieman Fellow at Harvard University was still doing important things for the causes of diversity inclusion equity and access from his perch at the Lew Klein College of Media and Communication at Temple. Indeed he was co-leading a new college task force performing a content and culture audit for The Philadelphia Inquirer.

And we recalled how we almost lost Bryan in April 2004. I’ll never forget when the day after an NABJ board meeting in Washington he had not left his hotel room by the early afternoon. After I persuaded the cleaning staff to open the door we found Bryan in a dire medical condition. Thankfully Jerry Ceppos and Jay Harris two influential journalists from the Bay Area in California whom he respected and his then-wife Tahirah helped get him the care he needed.

In 2013 by then an op-ed editor for CNN Bryan wrote two pieces detailing his battle with obesity and how he had lost 170 pounds after having gastric bypass surgery in 2006.

Let’s also mention how as the latest national reckoning on race was taking shape in June Bryan challenged “white people to step up.” His audacity inspired me to write my own piece about my hope for my students in the fight for racial justice. If he could speak out I should too.

Bryan last month sent Mira and I a Christmas card with a family portrait and bio blurbs as updates. Born in Munich the son of an Army general from North Carolina and schoolteacher from New Jersey he loved his children dearly. His daughter Seanna 20 is a junior studying math and education at Temple; his son Jackson 19 lives in Los Angeles and after the killing of George Floyd in the spring of 2020 helped organize a protest group that gained national attention. Bryan’s fiancee Abrielle (Abe) Anderson is an associate general counsel for a large health care company.

My hope was that Bryan and I would grow old together as past NABJ presidents seeing each other at annual conventions and continuing to mentor future journalism and organization leaders.

Our last text exchange was to share home addresses. He then wrote “How y’all doin’?” Not wanting to engage in a long conversation that night I didn’t answer. Damn!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNvd2JveWNoYW5uZWwuY29tL2FmdGVyLWluanVyeS1pbi0yMDIwLTN4LXdvcmxkLWNoYW1waW9uLXdpbGwtbG93ZS1nZXRzLWEtc3Ryb25nZXItc3RhcnQtdG8tdGhlLTIwMjEtc2Vhc29u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After Injury in 2020 3X World Champion Will Lowe gets a Stronger Start to the 2021 Season,"PHOTO: STEVE WRUBEL PHOTOGRAPHY

Last season 3X Bareback Riding World Champion Will Lowe started out the year with an unfortunate injury in Denver where after looking strong in the semi-finals he was knocked out in the finals — literally taking a kick to the head from the powerhouse Virgil that resulted in a depressed orbital bone and 20 stitches.

While it wasn’t long before Lowe was back in the saddle riding at the Super Series Finish at the end of May where he won the Bracket 5 average.

Unfortunately he wasn’t able to make up enough for lost time finishing No. 28 in the 2020 PRCA World Standings thirteen spots shy of getting to the NFR.

Hopefully his recent win at the Sandhills Stock Show & Rodeo is indicative of a strong season for the 15X NFR qualifier who rode Beutler & Son’s Buttercup for 85.5 points at the premiere ProRodeo Tour stop in Odessa to split first with Mike Solberg and add $3338 to his earnings.

In 2018 Lowe was convicted in Las Vegas for selling photo ops with tiger cubs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGVhdHNoZWV0LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21lbGlzc2EtZ2lsYmVydC1zYWlkLXJvYi1sb3dlLWFza2VkLWhlci10by1yZW1vdmUtMS1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLXRoaW5nLWhlLWhhdGVkLWZyb20taGVyLWJvb2suaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Melissa Gilbert Said Rob Lowe Asked Her to Remove 1 Surprising Thing He Hated From Her Book,"Rob Lowe requested that Melissa Gilbert remove one thing from her book about him.

Melissa Gilbert retold her romance with Rob Lowe in the pages of her book Prairie Tale and shed some light on his cheating ways. Lowe only had one problem with her book that he asked her to remove — and it revolved around a word that he hated to describe him.

Rob Lowe requested that Melissa Gilbert remove this word from her book

During a 2014 appearance on Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen asked Gilbert a number of questions about her book including Lowe’s reaction to it.

While playing a game called “Melissa Spill-bert” she was asked “What was Rob Lowe’s reaction to the book?”

Did the actor want her to remove anything from it before the book was published? It turns out there was something that he really hated even though it was very small. “He asked me to take out the word ‘pretty’ when I referred to him” she explained. “That was it … ‘Just could you do one thing? Please don’t call me ‘pretty’? I hate it when people call me pretty.’”

Rob Lowe wrote very little about Melissa Gilbert in his memoir

By comparison Lowe spent much less time writing about his relationship with Gilbert in his autobiography Stories I Only Tell My Friends. He only made some small mentions of the Little House on the Prairie star.

“I have been dating Melissa Gilbert back in L.A. but her mom thinks I’m after her for her fame and won’t let her visit me” he wrote referencing his time filming The Outsiders in Tulsa Oklahoma.

Lowe spent his time away from Gilbert he explained in “a time-honored tradition of entertainers on the road” he wrote. “Sometimes you chase girls sometimes they chase you sometimes it’s just to flirt and sometimes it’s more than that.”

“My situation is complicated somewhat by my long-distance relationship with my girlfriend and there are times when I feel bad about that” he explained in the book. “Nothing quiets the inner voice you want to ignore better than a couple of beers” he added.

Melissa Gilbert gave her take on Lowe’s book — and she wasn’t impressed

When Cohen asked Gilbert her thoughts on Lowe’s book she had a pretty cheeky response. During Cohen’s game he asked “What did you think of Rob Lowe’s book?”

“Did he write a book?” she answered with a sly grin. “I don’t know … maybe someone wrote it for him? I’m not sure.”

Cohen also asked Gilbert about how her book detailed Shannen Doherty having a one-night stand with her first husband Bo Brinkman.

“If you saw her on the street today what would you say to her” Cohen asked during the speed round of questions.

Gilbert understandably is still holding a grudge about Doherty’s hookup with her husband. “I wouldn’t say anything I’d just punch her in the nose” Gilbert responded."

After missing the past two-plus seasons with a knee injury Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball has exercised the $21.4 million option on his contract for the 2024-25 season sources told ESPN on Saturday.

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021. After a fantastic start that had the Bulls leading the Eastern Conference in 2021-22 Ball averaged 13.0 points 5.4 rebounds 5.1 assists and 1.8 steals before a knee injury 35 games into the season.

His inactivity has caused his contract to become a blight on the Bulls' salary cap.

Ball was the No. 2 overall pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2017 NBA draft and eventually was traded to the Pelicans as part of the Anthony Davis blockbuster deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS10aGUtZmFsbC1ndXktcnlhbi1nb3NsaW5nLTEyMzU5MDM1ODYv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLXRoZS1mYWxsLWd1eS1yeWFuLWdvc2xpbmctMTIzNTkwMzU4Ni9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘The Fall Guy’ Falls Down To $27M+ Opening – Monday Update,"MONDAY AM: Universal’s The Fall Guy has tumbled to $27.7M this after a lower-than-expected Sunday of $6.9M -33% from Saturday. Global cume is at $64.4M a $1M off. Some are worried as to what this lower than expected result means for star power specifically for Gosling coming off Barbie. The 3x Oscar nominated actor did everything to promote Fall Guy down to dressing up as Beavis at the Hollywood premiere of the film. Look as we mentioned Fall Guy is third highest opening of his career stateside Barbie being an outlier. Moviegoers in a streaming age are far too sophisticated and deliberate before they leave the house and an original Hollywood stunt-set action film wasn’t worth their time. Perhaps Gosling as a different kind of astronaut than he was in First Man is worth the time in Amazon MGM Studios’ Project Hail Mary. In the end as of late Gosling can get a movie open to $20M+.

Other things to consider: Fall Guy isn’t a movie that typically fires off summer it’s a movie you find either in August the second weekend of June or even the off season which is where this was originally scheduled on March 1. If the cost was lower here on this original title than the $130M-$150M we wouldn’t be scrutinizing it so much.

SUNDAY AM Writethru after Saturday AM Update: Universal’s The Fall Guy isn’t so strong and nobody is really shocked.

While it was projected to do at least $30M and it’s coming in at $28.5M this is the range for original action comedies even when they star Ryan Gosling. PostTrak exits report he’s 50% of the reason why people went to see the movie (versus 35% for Emily Blunt). Pic took in $25.4M from offshore marketings raising its foreign gross to $36.9M global to $65.4M.

The opening for Fall Guy is actually on the higher end of Gosling starts ranked third after anomaly Barbie ($162M) and Blade Runner 2049 ($32.7M) yet further down on Blunt’s. It’s the ninth-best opening of her career stateside short of Edge of Tomorrow ($28.7M) and Jungle Cruise ($35M with an asterisk – it did have a theatrical day-and-date PVOD on Disney+).

So what gives? Why is Fall Guy playing like a deflated balloon even with a great A- CinemaScore and 90% positive on PostTrak?

First yes we’re still in an uneven marketplace and won’t be out of it until we have more movies toward the end of the month into June leading up to Inside Out 2 on Father’s Day weekend. The entire box office weekend is totaling around $73M off 55% from the same frame a year ago when Disney/Marvel Studios had Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 leading summer’s charge with $118.4M.

But in Fall Guy despite how well it plays with audiences (SXSW crowds were belly laughing) there’s nothing that screams “rush to this” despite Universal showing off the fun and the romance in its campaign. It’s too inside Hollywood and these types of movies never play to an uber-wide crowd despite how accessible the studio and filmmakers have tried to make it. “Why do young people want to see this movie?” challenges a film finance source.

Most of all for an original event film at $130M-$150M+ this movie is too damn expensive.

“They should have spent like Tom Rothman: Make it for $80M. Why is Universal spending the extra money? Instead of spending $220M-$230M between production and marketing costs they could have pulled this off for $160M-$180M” added the source.

Some marketing sources are dinging the Fall Guy brand. “Nobody under 60 remembers that show!” However I don’t think Universal sold the movie on that and studios have shown before that they can take an antique TV property and turn it into a mega franchise. Hello Mission: Impossible and Tom Cruise. What Gen Xer had actually watched Mission: Impossible back in the late ’60s? Not me I wasn’t around then.

Great movies can ascend their brand.

Other sources have critiqued that for those leaving the theater Fall Guy is a hard movie plot wise for them to describe to others. “It took someone three paragraphs to tell me what the movie was about” remarked one insider. While that might be true note that trailers for Fall Guy distilled the movie to its most crystal-clear elements. Also we can’t ignore the great exits here for the movie. Unfortunately the masses aren’t falling over themselves to see the Fall Guy.

Evidence that there wasn’t heat on Fall Guy before opening: RelishMix reports that the movie’s social media universe across YouTube TikTok X Instagram and Facebook stood at 266.7M -33% below action adventure norms heck it was even under Argylle‘s 272M.

‘Challengers’ Everett Collection

In addition Amazon MGM Studios’ Challengers did a have good hold at -49% meaning they were able to keep some younger women away from the Gosling pic (71% women 18-24 at 44%). However the Zendaya tennis rom-com is coming in $1.1M lighter than expected (yesterday pic was at $8.7M) for a $7.6M weekend 2. Women under 25 were the lowest to show up yesterday for Fall Guy at 13% with men over 25 leading at 38% women over 25 at 33% (who gave the pic its best grade of 93%) and men under 25 at 16%. Universal is confident that given the exits for Fall Guy more women will come out in the month ahead as it’s the only choice for that audience in a guy skewing marketplace of Furiosa Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and Bad Boys: Ride or Die.

Said Universal Domestic Distribution Boss Jim Orr “David Leitch and Kelly McCormick have crafted an incredibly entertaining film with The Fall Guy and clearly audiences agree as evidenced by the film’s exceptionally strong scores. The chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt is fantastic and we anticipate audiences will continue to be thrilled by the film for weeks to come.”

Fall Guy‘s best play areas were the West and Mountain regions. AMC Lincoln Square is currently the top-grossing venue for the pic with $91K in the till through Saturday night. IMAX and PLFs are driving 44% of Fall Guy‘s weekend with the former ringing up $3M.

Largest quad for the David Leitch-directed movie is 25-34 at 25% with diversity demos seeing 52% Caucasian 25% Latino and Hispanic 8% Black 10% Asian and 5% other.

Universal given the love for the film among older women believes it will leg out. Look $100M domestic isn’t out of the realm of possibility ala Lost City and Bullet Train. But Fall Guy could drop into PVOD by Memorial Day weekend.

With 8% Rotten Tomatoes critical reviews and 52% audience scores as well as C- CinemaScore and 59% PostTrak on Sony/Screen Gems’ Tarot you didn’t need a psychic to see that the Culver City lot wasn’t going to spend one more dime in marketing this movie. Hence the $6.5M opening here on this single-digit budgeted title. The PG-13 movie is 52% female leaning with 18-34 year old repping 67% of the audience. Those 18-24 were the biggest demo at 40%. Diversity demos were 38% Latino and Hispanic 30% Caucasian 16% Black 9% Asian and 7% other. Tarot‘s best regions are the South South Central and Midwest with the Cinemark Rialto the highest grossing location so far with close to $6K (eek).

Other sundries….

Viva’s Dragonkeeper in Spanish and English opened in 760 theaters with meh grosses for what’s looking like $429K for the weekend. The animated indie kids film is set in ancient China and follows a young girl who must find the last remaining dragon egg and fulfill her destiny.

FRIDAY MIDDAY: Universal’s The Fall Guy is coming in a little light right now at $10.4M today including previews for what’s looking like a $28M opening at 4002 theaters below its $35M projection.

Many aren’t shocked: This is where action comedies open and Fall Guy isn’t that far from the $30M starts of Paramount 2022 adventure rom-com The Lost City and David Leitch’s previous movie 2022’s Bullet Train. But damn was Fall Guy for this concept expensive at $130M after Australian tax credits. Some have heard the production cost was even higher at $150M.

Fall Guy already has $8.4M-plus in the bank from a 38-market rollout last weekend including Australia Turkey Netherlands and Spain. The movie goes into 40-plus markets this weekend including UK & Ireland Germany France and Mexico.

No RT audience score yet.

Amazon MGM Studios’ Challengers is booked at 3477 theaters and eyeing $2.55M in its second Friday -59% for a 3-day around $8.75M -42% for a running cume of $30.5M.

FRIDAY AM: Universal teed off summer Thursday night with the Ryan Gosling-Emily Blunt action comedy The Fall Guy which made $3.15M from showtimes that began at 5 p.m. and Wednesday advance screenings. The movie is only expected to do around $35M for the weekend maybe $40M. That’s not your typical start to summer but we’re in this predicament due to the strikes’ delay on feature films.

Preview-wise that start is right near Paramount’s 2022 adventure rom-com Lost City which did $3.2M before a $30.4M opening and a $105.3M domestic final.

The most recent release date for The Fall Guy had been March 1 but Universal pushed it to this weekend after Disney and Marvel Studios moved Deadpool & Wolverine to end of July — which some now view as the true start of summer.

Universal believed big time in The Fall Guy bringing it down to SXSW in Austin for a world premiere where audiences laughed their asses off. This was followed by a screening at the onset of CinemaCon for exhibitors with a stunt-filled Hollywood premiere on Tuesday night. The anticipation is that the Gosling factor of The Fall Guy will keep pulling women to theaters. Also the movie despite its insider Hollywood vibe has a sensibility of yesteryear ’70s/’80s action titles — ones that used to conquer the middle of the country read Smokey and the Bandit and Every Which Way but Loose.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Interim President Jeff Ettinger’s budget for the next fiscal year proposes to slap a 4.5 percent tuition hike on in-state undergraduate students studying at the Twin Cities campus. If approved by the Board of Regents that would be the highest annual tuition increase for Minnesota residents since 2010.

Students at other campuses would also pay more money.

“Tuition increases always suck” said Blake Barrington a freshman. “I think sometimes the fault is on the university for spending it needlessly. There’s a lot of clubs and activities that the university funds that I don’t think are necessarily needed.""

Create a More Connected Minnesota MPR News is your trusted resource for the news you need. With your support MPR News brings accessible courageous journalism and authentic conversation to everyone - free of paywalls and barriers. Your gift makes a difference.

At least two members of the Board of Regents seem reluctant to embrace the proposed increase.

“I only learned that we were considering a tuition increase this weekend” wrote Robyn Gulley who represents the Second Congressional District in an email to MPR News. “I have not been convinced that increasing tuition for our students — compelling many to take additional loans or work longer hours to make tuition payments — will benefit our whole university more than it will harm our students. I expect to vote no on this proposed tuition increase.”

James Farnsworth a regent representing St. Paul hadn’t heard about the proposed tuition hikes until he read about in the newspaper on Friday.

“In general I’m not supportive of putting our budgetary pressures on the backs of our students right now” he wrote in an email. “But [I] haven’t digested the proposal enough to be knowledgeable comment on it.”

In real terms the total increase in tuition room and board and fees for Minnesota residents would raise costs by an additional $453 to $1552 per year depending on the campus. For Twin Cities undergrads who reside in-state tuition could increase by 4.5 percent to $15148.

The U has consistently raised tuition across campuses but in recent years has not exceeded annual hikes of 2-3 percent for locals. Proposed residential raises at other U campuses range from 1.5 to 4.5 percent and are anticipated to bring in $42.2 million in revenue.

“A large part of coming from in-state and going to the U is the fact that the tuition is a lot more affordable” said freshman Adella Mulawarman. “I’m curious to see if they go ahead and increase it if there will be a difference in how many in-state students decide to attend here.”

Thanks to scholarships Mulawarman got a break on tuition this year. But those scholarships are drying up and next year she’s worried about having to take out loans.

Tuition hikes could be incoming for out-of-state students too where the track record for an increasing price tag has been steeper. At the Twin Cities campus non-resident undergraduates could face a 5.5 percent tuition increase bringing tuition to $36296. A decade ago tuition was just over $19000 for non-residents.

In a Star Tribune Op-Ed last month regents Janie S. Mayeron Douglas A. Huebsch and Kenyanya urged state legislators to approve the U’s funding request to help cover the cost for students and employee pay.

“As a nonprofit public university our recurring operating fund request will minimize tuition increases for students and families who should not shoulder the burden of the state’s diminishing support” they wrote. “It will also help provide our 27000 faculty and staff members systemwide with fair compensation and the facilities they need to remain competitive in the workforce. They all deserve support by state leaders.”

Students who choose U housing may also have to anticipate higher room and board costs at all campuses. That change is “primarily driven by inflationary cost pressures” according to the proposal.

At the Duluth campus standard room and board costs could go up by 8.9 percent bringing the typical total to $10456 per year. In the Twin Cities that’s a 6.5 percent increase bringing room and board totals up to $13606.

A 6 percent increase is proposed at Morris 5.2 percent at Rochester and 2.8 percent at Crookston.

The attendance cost hikes are paired with proposed expense reductions of $13.7 million. The bulk of that reduction is planned through eliminating positions after employees leave and hiring replacement employees at lower salaries.

BF Borgers CPA and its owner Benjamin Borgers reportedly agreed to pay $14 million in fines and be permanently suspended from practicing as accountants according to a report from CNBC.

More from the report:

The agency calling BF Borgers a “sham audit mill” said the company and its owner engaged in “deliberate and systemic failures to comply with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ... standards in its audits and reviews incorporated in more than 1500 SEC filings from January 2021 through June 2023” according to a press release.

BF Borgers during that same time acted as the auditor for Trump Media which was then privately held and moving toward a planned merger with the publicly traded shell company Digital World Acquisition Corp.

Trump’s media company went public in March.

Marathon Petroleum Occidental Petroleum and the employee political action committees for ConocoPhillips and BP temporarily froze their contributions. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are reviewing their donations. Even energy industry association spokespersons for the American Petroleum Institute the Independent Petroleum Association of America the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers as well as a leader of the Koch network said the attack on the Capitol will factor into their future giving.

Those who have spent years confronting fossil fuel industry-funded disinformation campaigns raising alarms about the climate crisis are unimpressed with the moves. The origin of the storming of the Capitol was a series of lies and there is no indication that the fossil fuel industry is taking a meaningful stance against high-risk deceit.

“They have been funding disinformation and anti-climate politicians for a very long time.”

In many ways fossil fuel companies laid the groundwork for the widespread acceptance of lies big enough to cause an existential threat to democracy’s survival — even humanity’s. “Lying has become a habit” said science historian Naomi Oreskes whose book with Eric Conway “Merchants of Doubt” documents how veterans of the tobacco industry’s misinformation efforts seeded climate denial among the media and lawmakers.

“They have been funding disinformation and anti-climate politicians for a very long time” she said over email of the fossil fuel industry. Oreskes said reconsidering political donations for election misinformation is a belated gesture: “A day late and a dollar short. Or rather three decades late and hundreds of millions of dollars short.”

Meanwhile the industry still has not come close to fully divesting from nor making amends for their spread of lethal climate disinformation.

To climate scientist Michael Mann the fossil fuel groups’ announcements that they will review political giving serves to evade attention from the fact that during the Trump administration the oil and gas agenda was supercharged by the racist rhetoric and lies that swayed elections in the direction of their favored candidates. Indeed never has the fossil fuel industry’s agenda been carried to fruition so completely as it was over the past four years achieved using what Mann described to The Intercept as “red meat” thrown out for the racist right including election disinformation.

“It is the fossil fuel industry the front groups that they fund along with plutocrats like the Koch brothers — these are the groups that have been pulling the strings that have been throwing out the red meat that have been instigating this racially motivated treasonous rebellion by the disaffected base of the Republican Party” said Mann. “They’re playing with fire and it’s almost like they don’t really care about democracy.”

Links To Election Deniers

The fossil fuel companies will presumably be reexamining donations to politicians who supported the “Stop the Steal” movement to overturn election results. Some 139 U.S. representatives and eight senators voted against certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s win including lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas who has received extensive contributions from some of the oil and gas companies now denouncing the Capitol attack. Perhaps they will also reconsider future contributions to President Donald Trump himself who incited the insurrection and received $14696347 from the oil and gas industry for the 2020 election cycle according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Many more individuals and groups would have to be included in a comprehensive audit of the fossil fuel industry’s involvement in the events leading up to the storming of the Capitol. Among those listed as coalition partners on the March to Save America website which called on Trump supporters to defend the president was the Rule of Law Defense Fund a dark-money group started by the Republican Attorneys General Association.

Fossil fuel companies like Koch Industries and Exxon have donated to the attorneys general association and groups backed by the industry — like the Koch brothers’ Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and the Edison Electric Institute — have directly contributed to the Rule of Law Defense Fund. The Rule of Law Defense Fund even went so far as to put out robocalls promoting the march as Documented reported.

Also listed on the march’s website was Turning Point USA which recently entered into a partnership with the Koch-backed American Legislative Exchange Council. ALEC as the group is known brings together lobbyists and lawmakers to promote industry friendly legislation at the state level. Turning Point and ALEC are working together to place right-wing students on university boards of regents according to reporting by the Center for Media and Democracy. Koch-linked groups also helped mobilize this summer’s reopen protests — a movement that significantly overlapped with Stop the Steal.

Meanwhile the Twitter account for the climate denial website Climate Depot tweeted on January 6: “Striking fear in politicians is not a bad thing.” A subsequent tweet said “Thomas Jefferson: ‘The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” Climate Depot is run by the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow a think tank that the fossil fuel industry has funded in the past. Its Twitter was just one among several climate denier accounts that DeSmog documented supporting the Stop the Steal movement or spreading disinformation in the aftermath of the Capitol attack.

Big Lie of Climate Denial

Mann the climate scientist pointed to parallels between the industry’s attempt to distance itself from election misinformation and its recent move to steer away from all-out climate denial. “They’ve done the same thing with climate denialism as it has become untenable to deny that climate change is real and happening” he said.

The story of the climate lie goes back to the 1980s. In the early part of the decade a task force of fossil fuel industry representatives was meeting regularly to talk about the emerging climate science they were helping produce. Just as the science was becoming clear the American Petroleum Institute and companies like Exxon Mobil began pouring money into disinformation. To cast doubt on climate science the industry lobbied funded new organizations published ads paid for studies bought scientists who would act as media pundits and of course lavished millions of dollars on politicians who would advance their cause.

As a young scientist and author of a key study showing that recent high temperatures were aberrations in the historical record Mann became a target of the industry’s denial machine. Media pundits and politicians attempted to smear his credibility. He received death threats.

Sen. Jim Inhofe R-Okla. who is among the politicians who have received the highest donations from the fossil fuel industry went so far as to call for Mann to be investigated as a criminal.

By the mid-aughts under pressure from scientists environmentalists civil society and shareholders the industry began to distance itself from denial. But the lies were well rooted by then in part because of how well they fit into dreams of unfettered capitalism championed by the right. (Oreskes the science historian and her co-author Conway have a forthcoming book “The Magic of the Marketplace: The True History of a False Idea” which will focus on how ideas about free market fundamentalism helped normalize misinformation.)

Meanwhile the fossil fuel industry continued to donate money to politicians who purveyed climate lies. A 2019 analysis by the Center for American Progress Action Fund of the outgoing 116th Congress counted 150 Republican members who did not believe that human activity causes climate change. They’d collectively accepted $68 million in donations from the fossil fuel industry.

“They haven’t given up in their effort to block the clean energy transition and keep us addicted to fossil fuels. They just changed their tactics.”

And Trump himself perhaps fossil fuel firms’ all-time biggest champion accepted more than $14 million from the oil and gas industry for his reelection campaign. Over the course of his administration Trump dismantled much of the existing government infrastructure for confronting the climate crisis and promoted outright deniers to positions of power.

Mann’s book “The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet” published this week argues that the industry never truly quit promoting climate disinformation. “They haven’t given up in their effort to block the clean energy transition and keep us addicted to fossil fuels” he said. “They just changed their tactics to tactics they think they can get away with.” He pointed to fossil fuel industry efforts to derail state-level policies to incentivize renewable energy development bolster false solutions like geoengineering spread the idea that the climate problem is about individual lifestyle choices and promote a sense of doom that nothing can really be done about the climate crisis — which Mann argues is simply untrue.

What should the industry do if it truly wants to make amends for sowing chaos? “That’s easy” said Oreskes. “Stop funding and fomenting disinformation stop exploring for new oil gas and coal reserves and start working on a new business model that shifts to renewable energy or something else entirely.”

“I think it is tragic that it took an insurrection for them to rethink their strategy” she said. “I hope this will prompt a deeper self-examination. An awful lot is at stake here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS1ldGZzLWNoYW5uZWwvMy1zdG9jay1wcmVkaWN0aW9ucy15ZWFyLWxpa2Utbm8tb3RoZXIv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXRmdHJlbmRzLmNvbS9pbm5vdmF0aXZlLWV0ZnMtY2hhbm5lbC8zLXN0b2NrLXByZWRpY3Rpb25zLXllYXItbGlrZS1uby1vdGhlci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stock Market Predictions for Another ‘Year Like No Other’,"By Robert Ross

Investors might have thought they’d seen it all in 2020. But the stock market action was merely a preview of what’s to come in 2021.

Just to take a quick look back the market gave everyone a scare in 2020 when it bottomed in March. But then the S&P 500 surged 67% between March 23 and year-end.

Certain stocks like Tesla (TSLA) Zoom (ZM) and Moderna (MRNA) performed even better soaring by triple-digits.

And now we are going from one “year like no other” to another.

Here’s what I expect the new year will bring for investors…

Prediction No. 1: The Bull Will Still Run in 2021

As 2020 has shown us things outside your control—like a global pandemic—can render any prediction worthless.

But I have a lot of confidence in—and a lot of money riding on—this idea.

Why? Three reasons…

We have every reason to expect the Federal Reserve will keep money flowing into stocks.

Their easy money policies help push people out of “safe” investments (i.e. money market funds and bonds) and into riskier assets (i.e. stocks). With the Fed pledging to keep interest rates low until 2023 bulls can look forward to a multiyear boost.

Here’s something else investors can look forward to…

Congressional gridlock isn’t going anywhere.

With political leadership split nearly down the middle in Washington D.C. we are in for at least two years of political gridlock. Gridlock is historically great for stocks… especially Walmart (WMT) Hewlett-Packard (HPE) and IBM (IBM).

As is this…

Markets are at all-time highs… which typically lead to more all-time highs!

Since 1988 the S&P 500 returns were significantly higher on one- three- and five-year time horizons when the index was at all-time highs:

But while I expect the bulls to keep charging some sectors are looking even better than others.

Prediction No. 2: Tech Will Be 2021’s Top-Performing Sector

Technology stocks have been on an incredible run over the last five years. In fact it has been the best-performing sector in three of the last four years.

Forget those nattering nabobs of negativity who say the tech run is just about done. Get ready to see more outperformance in 2021.

For one while some tech names have had an incredible run in 2020 others have struggled… particularly in the second half of the year.

Household names like Amazon (AMZN) Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) have well underperformed both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since July. And smart investors will see this opportunity to buy great companies at a discount to their peers.

The other kicker is technology stocks are not expensive.

Compared to the dot-com bubble (when interest rates were 5X higher) the five largest US technology companies are relatively cheap:

Technology companies allowed many of us to keep working from home and biotechnology companies will help us return to normal.

That means we’ll see another big year from the companies that made—and will continue to make—this possible.

The worst of the COVID-19 pandemic will soon be behind us. The coronavirus vaccine will take effect both physically and psychologically and the global economy will find its footing again.

Some companies are already taking that side of the bet…

Prediction No. 3: 2021 Will Be the Best Year in a Decade for Dividend Hikes

2020 was the worst year in a decade for dividend investors. In total global companies cut their dividends by 22%.

That means 27% of all publicly traded companies slashed their dividends this year.

We stayed on top of these dividend cuts throughout the crisis. From cruise ships to casinos we steered away from companies whose payouts my Dividend Sustainability Index (DSI) identified as being in danger.

But what goes down… must come up. At least when it comes to dividends.

We have already seen a few dividends return from the dead. Kohl’s (KSS) TJX Companies (TJX) Marathon Oil (MRO) and Darden Restaurants (DRI) are among the first to reopen their purse strings.

Look for more where that came from… even among those that maintained and/or raised their payouts in 2020.

Why? We can use history as our guide.

In the two years after the 2008 financial crisis we saw global dividend payouts increase 39%.

With the Fed keeping the easy money flowing… techs and biotechs getting ready for another unbelievable year… and dividend income ready to be unleashed there’s never been a better time to be an investor.

Police entered with guns drawn. He was naked. He said he had taken a phone call just as he was about to get into the shower. See

The pilot served a six month suspension from his job at United and became a national news story. The city which owns the hotel and clearly designed it poorly paid him a $300000 settlement. However he also went after the Westin Denver Airport’s operator and there he lost

A federal judge in Colorado dismissed a lawsuit filed by a commercial airline pilot…alleging the hotel should have warned him the windows were see-through and trained its employees to protect guests’ Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search seizure and arrest. “It is well-established that the Fourth Amendment protects hotel guests from unreasonable searches and seizures. However plaintiff [Collins] provides no legal support for his contention that a hotel has a duty to protect its guests’ Fourth Amendment rights or that defendant’s lack of training to protect hotel guests’ Fourth Amendment rights is a ‘danger’” U.S. District Judge William Martinez wrote in his 14-page order. …Martinez sided with the hotel in finding that Collins failed to show that Westin “was aware or should have been aware that aspects of its windows could potentially lead an unsuspecting guest to erroneously conclude that the windows were opaque and expose himself.”

The city paid up. They designed the hotel. Law enforcement should pay up too there’s absolutely no reason to have stormed the pilot’s hotel room with guns drawn just because his ‘ammunition’ was pointed at the TSA.

I suppose the hotel’s management is on notice now that this is an issue and may have a duty to warn future guests that something like this might happen to “don’t stand naked in from of the window.” Perhaps they should put stickers on the window the way the Hilton Colombo in Sri Lanka has stickers warning people that cameras might be taken for guns to watch out or they might be taken out by a sniper dating to the government’s conflict there with the Tamil Tigers.

It’s rather shocking that this issue at the property still hasn’t been addressed though.

Just in time for the FIFA 20222 World Cup six new hotels are set to open their doors in different locations across Qatar introducing five new Marriott brands in the country’s real estate hub.

The agreement to operate the projects was signed by Al Rayyan Tourism Investment (ARTIC) and Marriott International and is expected to strengthen Qatar’s hospitality sector and support its development.



“We welcome the signing of these six new agreements. The completion of five new projects within 2021 will be a first for Qatar’s hospitality sector and further enhance ARTIC’s position as a leading player in the sector and supporter of the development of Qatar’s tourism industry” said Mohamed bin Faisal al-Thani vice-chairman of ARTIC.



The much-anticipated openings will see the introduction of Marriott’s Autograph Collection Delta Hotels by Marriott Element by Westin Le Meridien and Marriott Executive Apartments according to an ARTIC statement.

“It is with pleasure that we announce that with the expected completion of these new hotels in 2021 the majority of ARTIC’s portfolio of properties will be operational supporting our future growth through new developments and acquisitions” said Tarek M El Sayed ARTIC’s managing director and CEO.

To ensure the success of the agreement five of the properties will be located in West Bay one of the most vibrant and luxurious areas in Doha. Meanwhile the Autograph Collection will be located in the Al Sheehaniya district an “ideal sanctuary for quality time with the family and loved ones” the statement said.

The completion of the agreement will bring ARTIC’s total number of hotel keys in Qatar to over 3260 al-Thani added further strengthening the company’s investment portfolio with well-established international brands.

“Our ongoing investment and commitment to these partnerships remains a priority for us and we are extremely proud to be an integral part of Qatar’s attractive local market based on our country’s strategic location in the region attractive investment climate and excellent track record of organising successful prestigious events” he added.

Earlier this month Doha witnessed a rapid increase in trade propitious for economic growth following the signing of the Al-Ula declaration which signalled the end of the three year long blockade on Qatar.

Experts are now anticipating a sharp rise in business as many positive signs forecast steady development in the near future and across the region.

Unlike the trade market the pace of recovery in the real estate industry will likely be gradual according to the Chairman of the Association of Filipino & Entrepreneur Executives in Qatar (AFREEQ) Joseph Timothy Rivera.

“The reopening of borders and flights are just the beginning of the process. The resumption of trade and commerce as well as the physical re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Qatar and the former siege nations is daunting but we remain optimistic that this would all fall into place in a smooth and hopefully speedy manner” he added.

Meanwhile there has been an increase in the issuance of building permits leading to a promising development in the local construction industry according to official statistics.

These permits are of great importance as they are considered the main indicator of the performance of the construction sector which in turn is a main contributor to the local economy.

Kendra Brown spent much of her career doing the hard behind-the-scenes work that makes legislation possible on Capitol Hill. In her last job before joining Mastercard she served as chief of staff to U.S. Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-NC) focusing on community partnerships and working with the Congressional Black Caucus. Her time in Congress taught her valuable lessons: work hard always plan and engage the community. While she has been able to do a lot of that work at a high level as a director of public policy at Mastercard she saw an opportunity to go back to her social justice roots.

Brown was one of 13 volunteers in the company’s inaugural Racial Justice Virtual Pro Bono program which connects employees with nonprofits working to further racial equity. The program matches the skills and expertise of Mastercard’s employees to the needs of racial justice organizations across the United States with the goal of solving organizational challenges and driving lasting change. The program was born out of Mastercard’s In Solidarity initiative to combat racism and advance inclusion inside and outside its walls. These efforts are part of a broader push by Mastercard many other companies and sports leagues to make a concerted effort to end systemic racism in the U.S. a huge undertaking that has taken renewed urgency following 2020.

It meant so much to me to be a part of this program because it was the weaving together of so many different threads of my life that have all been headed in the same direction.

But much of this historically working-class part of the city suffers from high levels of homelessness and poverty.



“Fifteen years ago it was a no-go area but now hipsters are buying houses and it’s trendy in parts” says Pascal Derrien who runs SPADE Enterprise Centre in Dublin 7. “But it is still dodgy – the Garda (police) station is still one of the busiest in the country.”



As we speak he is looking on his video monitor to check if the premises are secure.



“It’s a multidimensional landscape” Derrien says. “This area is on a transformative journey.”

And a big influence on the outcome will be the gleaming new development project underway – the Grangegorman campus of Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin or TUD) which will eventually cater for 20000 students. This will naturally bring economic benefits for the surrounding area.



The 73-acre campus development located above Smithfield is described as the largest single investment in a higher education project in the history of the Irish state. Since 2014 €450 million (US$543 million) has been invested in infrastructure – drainage water fibre optics and new buildings including business incubation and research facilities and a €300 million (US$362 million) building for studies in arts science health and tourism.



Several protected or historically-listed buildings have been repurposed to education and playing fields including a playground to encourage children onto the campus have been opened.



In coming months a further €500 million or so is being invested in a new library sports facilities student accommodation and science park activity as well as relocation – TUD is the result of a 2019 merger of three technological institutions with buildings located in campuses in three different locations Grangegorman Tallaght and Blanchardstown.



But what makes the university’s approach to the development interesting is the extent to which TUD has tried to use it as a vehicle to build on its full-throttle commitment to using staff and student community engagement to tackle social disadvantage.



TUD has become a driving force integrating its own community engagement work with the work of statutory bodies and community organisations and driving the development forward with other stakeholders in a way that ensures the university becomes an engine of social change for the whole area rather than just a very fine upgrade for TUD with a few business opportunities added on.



That aim is supported by national higher education and employment policies which are part of a commitment to tackling social inequality across the country.



“It is an ethos that really universities can’t stand apart from what is happening outside their walls” Noel O’Connor director of student development at TUD told University World News.



“There is a real obligation with the kind of funding you receive to really try to find solutions and help the best way we can. With the Grangegorman project we can take so many of our activities spread over so many areas – research innovation community engagement – pull them together and leverage them for the benefit of everyone.”



He added that 80 pianos are being transported across from the university’s Conservatory of Music on another site to the newly-opened arts building. Some 5000 arts students were to be moved in at Christmas but COVID-19 is holding that up.



Long history of practical solutions



TU Dublin has a long history of providing practical solutions. Its genesis was the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) established in 1887 as Ireland’s higher technology institute at a time when similar institutions were being created around the world. Its main focus was on engineering and applied technology and from early on there was a strong emphasis on connecting with and supporting local communities including promoting participation in education.



When the merger of DIT with IT Tallaght and IT Blanchardstown was announced in 2018 it was to become not only the country’s first technological university but the biggest third level institution with 30000 students and 3500 staff on three sites. The Taoiseach (prime minister) at the time Leo Varadkar said it would “drive regional development and provide more opportunities for individuals enterprise and the community”.



O’Connor says that while many universities from Oxford and Cambridge to TU Dublin itself have three missions encompassing teaching and learning research and engagement with or impact on society they are in many cases dealt with separately creating silos.



“What we have tried to do is integrate those. It is part of national policy as well. The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 really encourages all universities to engage with their surrounding communities in a broad sense and with regions in a meaningful way.”



The key statutory body is the Grangegorman Development Agency (GDA) established by the Department of Education to drive procurement on behalf of TUD and the HSE – Ireland’s Health Services – which is co-located with TUD’s Planning Office and Estates to ensure an integrated approach and optimum use of resources.



The GDA’s mantra is that at Grangegorman the site of a former lunatic asylum it is developing a “new urban quarter” which will have “health education and community” at its heart and open up a once walled-off part of Dublin.



But the key community body is the Grangegorman Labour and Learning Forum with a coordinator funded by TU Dublin. The forum participants include community and voluntary groups statutory bodies employment and training agencies further education bodies and the university itself and it focuses its work on the political wards with the highest deprivation.



“The forum was set up to ensure there was a benefit for the community [from the campus development] and that we were not just landing like a spaceship as happened in the past not further marginalising people” Kathleen McCann the forum’s coordinator told University World News.



It provides oversight of the work of all the bodies involved – voluntary community and statutory – to make sure they keep to the agenda.



McCann says her work is a “very visible and ongoing community engagement from TUD to supporting being part of and creating opportunities for those local communities so that they don’t get left behind”.



The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the importance of TU Dublin’s mission to address local poverty in an integrated way.



“One of the stark things that happened with COVID was that we had to switch a lot of effort into feeding people – hunger became a big problem. We were creating food packs for children aged 0-6 as once the projects and community centres and crèches closed down access to food was diminished for those who rely on them for daily needs” McCann says.



Another indicator of poverty is that all the primary schools bar one and all the secondary schools are DEIS schools – those in the government’s Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme designated for disadvantaged communities.



Pathways into education



One of the most important interventions to address poverty is education opening up access to students who wouldn’t otherwise get in or even think of applying and providing the right kind of support to ensure that they achieve.



O’Connor explains that for TU Dublin because it is mostly located in sites in non-affluent areas the notion of trying to improve the quality of life and open up opportunities to participate for the surrounding community has always been part of its ethos and has very much been part of the fabric of the university in the past few decades (as for DIT).



For instance the university takes in around 8000 to 9000 part-time students and 10% of its students are from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and 10% have physical disabilities or learning disabilities.



But the access programme starts at primary school level and enables TU Dublin to take its own students into DEIS schools to get them involved.



Dr Julie Bernard the head of Access and Civic Engagement at TU Dublin says the approach is very much about integrating teaching research learning and engagement.



“We take a lifelong approach” she told University World News.



It starts with involvement in the Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme in their location for which TU Dublin is the lead agency.



It is one of 16 ABC programmes in the country all set up in areas where there is significant risk of poverty providing early intervention to address the effects of poverty on mental health and education.



But in Grangegorman it is set up as a consortium led by around 30 community organisations with €800000 (US$965000) a year in state funding.



“We came together specifically to address child poverty” Bernard says. “It’s about recognising that if you want children to progress you have to address poverty at a very young age.”



Through the programme children from disadvantaged communities attend crèches at DEIS schools. An early initiative was upskilling community practitioners in early childhood care and education which is taught at TU Dublin. Additional literacy support is given at primary school by community-based staff.



Higher education students are embedded in the programme engaged with the community as part of their research and learning. So for instance journalism students produce a programme called Click News which is published on a website for primary school children and through that the primary pupils are learning literacy and engaging with world news so there is a lot of sharing of skills.



Further support is given at secondary level and entry routes to higher education are offered.



For instance students from disadvantaged backgrounds can access higher education with lower entry requirements – a reduction of 12.5% in the points score – as part of a national approach that was originally co-pioneered by TUD because research shows that social disadvantage impacts on their attainment. At TU Dublin there is also a year-long access programme.



“The key then is to support students when they come into higher education and we have a whole suite of supports and progression is very strong” says Bernard.



Student projects



When the creation of TU Dublin was announced Professor Tom Collins chair of the three constituent institutes’ governing bodies said TUD had the potential to be ground-breaking by “providing a pioneering and practice-based research-informed learning framework to students” the Irish Times reported.



This has been realised in part through the many projects that TU Dublin students are involved in with local communities as University World News has



Examples include urban planning students helping to redesign an open plaza food safety studies students supporting a meals-on-wheels service for elderly people by working on guidelines and measures for safety and engineering students delivering construction work for a project providing clean water in Africa.



But that experience is not an add-on O’Connor said it is linked to the university’s core activity.



“If students are involved with the community testing their subject knowledge or research applying it and coming back in again and engaging and interacting with the community you really do have a different kind of educational experience. It is definitely enhanced” he says.



Social contracts



McCann is employed by TU Dublin and co-funded by the university and the GDA. She sees her job as one of always being there for the community building a relationship and out of this “pick[ing] up things that might otherwise be missed” discovering the real needs and potential solutions that could be supported.



“One of my favourite mantras is ‘let’s ask what people want’. But sometimes people need a bit of help to work out what they want” she says.



“There is a particular interest in social entrepreneurship from the forum because of the employment opportunities especially for people who struggle to access the labour market. There are lots of micro businesses and social enterprises growing in the area.”



There is also a strong demand to support entry into employment. McCann focuses across the board on employment education and training and one of her key roles is to help link people to employment opportunities that arise from the campus development.



“Unemployment went up to 16% [in Ireland] after the 2008-9 financial crisis the construction industry was decimated. But by February this year it had changed radically down to 4.8% which is considered full employment” she says.



“Now with COVID it is back up to 16% and even that is masked by all the revenue supports provided.”



Locally the main business is hospitality food and drink. Then there is the legal profession which has four main courts in the area. But many small businesses have closed and youth unemployment is “horrendous” McCann says.



Bernard O’Connor and McCann are all heavily involved in the Labour and Learning Forum.



The forum started by focusing on the construction industry. Although that is a very gendered labour market with the imminent opening of two quads on the campus permanent jobs outside construction will become available McCann says.



An important tool for ensuring the community benefits has been the development of a social charter and the inclusion of social clauses in contracts. As a result on average 12% of total construction workers have been employed from the local community.



On all state-funded projects there is now an emphasis on social clauses on construction contracts. On face value it might be difficult to use social clauses in the procurement within the European Union because of anti-competitivity rules O’Connor says but “it sends a signal that you feel it is important and in their interest to demonstrate that they are addressing it in some way so it is about getting companies to recognise that as a client you see that as an objective and they in turn respond”.



TU Dublin has a member of staff who works with construction companies and meets them on a weekly basis monitors what jobs are coming in and liaises with local employment agencies on the forum.



O’Connor says there is an obvious benefit from having more people from the local community work on the campus development. “It gives them ownership and they feel it is a benefit because their sons or daughters or partners are getting a job on site.”



He says the university has taken this beyond construction to looking at how social clauses can be included in contracts for cleaning and catering “to promote the whole notion of being part of the surrounding community”.



Another strand is trying to support local businesses. Many of them will benefit from an influx of 20000 students on their doorstep.



“That is a big spin-off and the whole part of town has lifted off because of that” says O’Connor.



TUD staff are looking into how they can support businesses. Mooted measures include briefing businesses on stages of the development coming up and how they might access and sell to construction companies for instance.



They are also looking at how students can go out and help businesses develop marketing and funding strategies.



“In some cases academics have provided [informal briefings] to local businesses about future trends in their industry” says Bernard. “We also introduce businesses to each other so that they can network.”



“One of the first activities on campus has been business start-up activities run in TU Dublin” O’Connor says. “Half of it is about innovation and start-up and half of it is about research.”



Pascal Derrien at SPADE which has created more than a thousand jobs over the past 30 years and currently hosts 30 start-ups employing 155 people says he is very interested in the pipeline TU Dublin can create for his services among students with ideas.



The big difference with TU Dublin compared to Trinity College University College Dublin and Dublin City College is that whereas the others’ start-ups are technology-driven with TU Dublin there is the “social element”.



“They are very open and there is a big appetite among the academics” he says.



McCann points to TU Dublin’s take up of the TEFCE – Towards a European Framework for Community Engagement of Higher Education – tool box designed to help universities and policy-makers across the EU assess how they can better interact with their communities locally and regionally to address pressing social needs. She says this has encouraged a lot of mapping of civic engagement to enable a coordinated approach.



Bernard who has 25 staff working on civic engagement in her office while in addition many academic staff are delivering activities says community engagement is part of the history and culture of certain types of higher education institution and certainly of the technological university remit.



“There is a very strong commitment to community engagement a strong belief in education for all a strong focus on preparing graduates for the real world hence why they take part in community research and learning.”



She says at TU Dublin there is a “very strong belief in the value of it being for the benefit of everyone students universities and communities. It is a genuine partnership where everyone gains that’s what makes it sustainable”.

We were creating food packs for children aged 0-6 as once the projects and community centres and crèches closed down access to food was diminished for those who rely on them for daily needs” McCann says.Another indicator of poverty is that all the primary schools bar one and all the secondary schools are DEIS schools – those in the government’s Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme designated for disadvantaged communities.One of the most important interventions to address poverty is education opening up access to students who wouldn’t otherwise get in or even think of applying and providing the right kind of support to ensure that they achieve.O’Connor explains that for TU Dublin because it is mostly located in sites in non-affluent areas the notion of trying to improve the quality of life and open up opportunities to participate for the surrounding community has always been part of its ethos and has very much been part of the fabric of the university in the past few decades (as for DIT).For instance the university takes in around 8000 to 9000 part-time students and 10% of its students are from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and 10% have physical disabilities or learning disabilities.But the access programme starts at primary school level and enables TU Dublin to take its own students into DEIS schools to get them involved.Dr Julie Bernard the head of Access and Civic Engagement at TU Dublin says the approach is very much about integrating teaching research learning and engagement.“We take a lifelong approach” she toldIt starts with involvement in the Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme in their location for which TU Dublin is the lead agency.It is one of 16 ABC programmes in the country all set up in areas where there is significant risk of poverty providing early intervention to address the effects of poverty on mental health and education.But in Grangegorman it is set up as a consortium led by around 30 community organisations with €800000 (US$965000) a year in state funding.“We came together specifically to address child poverty” Bernard says. “It’s about recognising that if you want children to progress you have to address poverty at a very young age.”Through the programme children from disadvantaged communities attend crèches at DEIS schools. An early initiative was upskilling community practitioners in early childhood care and education which is taught at TU Dublin. Additional literacy support is given at primary school by community-based staff.Higher education students are embedded in the programme engaged with the community as part of their research and learning. So for instance journalism students produce a programme called Click News which is published on a website for primary school children and through that the primary pupils are learning literacy and engaging with world news so there is a lot of sharing of skills.Further support is given at secondary level and entry routes to higher education are offered.For instance students from disadvantaged backgrounds can access higher education with lower entry requirements – a reduction of 12.5% in the points score – as part of a national approach that was originally co-pioneered by TUD because research shows that social disadvantage impacts on their attainment. At TU Dublin there is also a year-long access programme.“The key then is to support students when they come into higher education and we have a whole suite of supports and progression is very strong” says Bernard.When the creation of TU Dublin was announced Professor Tom Collins chair of the three constituent institutes’ governing bodies said TUD had the potential to be ground-breaking by “providing a pioneering and practice-based research-informed learning framework to students” thereported.This has been realised in part through the many projects that TU Dublin students are involved in with local communities ashas reported Examples include urban planning students helping to redesign an open plaza food safety studies students supporting a meals-on-wheels service for elderly people by working on guidelines and measures for safety and engineering students delivering construction work for a project providing clean water in Africa.But that experience is not an add-on O’Connor said it is linked to the university’s core activity.“If students are involved with the community testing their subject knowledge or research applying it and coming back in again and engaging and interacting with the community you really do have a different kind of educational experience. It is definitely enhanced” he says.McCann is employed by TU Dublin and co-funded by the university and the GDA. She sees her job as one of always being there for the community building a relationship and out of this “pick[ing] up things that might otherwise be missed” discovering the real needs and potential solutions that could be supported.“One of my favourite mantras is ‘let’s ask what people want’. But sometimes people need a bit of help to work out what they want” she says.“There is a particular interest in social entrepreneurship from the forum because of the employment opportunities especially for people who struggle to access the labour market. There are lots of micro businesses and social enterprises growing in the area.”There is also a strong demand to support entry into employment. McCann focuses across the board on employment education and training and one of her key roles is to help link people to employment opportunities that arise from the campus development.“Unemployment went up to 16% [in Ireland] after the 2008-9 financial crisis the construction industry was decimated. But by February this year it had changed radically down to 4.8% which is considered full employment” she says.“Now with COVID it is back up to 16% and even that is masked by all the revenue supports provided.”Locally the main business is hospitality food and drink. Then there is the legal profession which has four main courts in the area. But many small businesses have closed and youth unemployment is “horrendous” McCann says.Bernard O’Connor and McCann are all heavily involved in the Labour and Learning Forum.The forum started by focusing on the construction industry. Although that is a very gendered labour market with the imminent opening of two quads on the campus permanent jobs outside construction will become available McCann says.An important tool for ensuring the community benefits has been the development of a social charter and the inclusion of social clauses in contracts. As a result on average 12% of total construction workers have been employed from the local community.On all state-funded projects there is now an emphasis on social clauses on construction contracts. On face value it might be difficult to use social clauses in the procurement within the European Union because of anti-competitivity rules O’Connor says but “it sends a signal that you feel it is important and in their interest to demonstrate that they are addressing it in some way so it is about getting companies to recognise that as a client you see that as an objective and they in turn respond”.TU Dublin has a member of staff who works with construction companies and meets them on a weekly basis monitors what jobs are coming in and liaises with local employment agencies on the forum.O’Connor says there is an obvious benefit from having more people from the local community work on the campus development. “It gives them ownership and they feel it is a benefit because their sons or daughters or partners are getting a job on site.”He says the university has taken this beyond construction to looking at how social clauses can be included in contracts for cleaning and catering “to promote the whole notion of being part of the surrounding community”.Another strand is trying to support local businesses. Many of them will benefit from an influx of 20000 students on their doorstep.“That is a big spin-off and the whole part of town has lifted off because of that” says O’Connor.TUD staff are looking into how they can support businesses. Mooted measures include briefing businesses on stages of the development coming up and how they might access and sell to construction companies for instance.They are also looking at how students can go out and help businesses develop marketing and funding strategies.“In some cases academics have provided [informal briefings] to local businesses about future trends in their industry” says Bernard. “We also introduce businesses to each other so that they can network.”“One of the first activities on campus has been business start-up activities run in TU Dublin” O’Connor says. “Half of it is about innovation and start-up and half of it is about research.”Pascal Derrien at SPADE which has created more than a thousand jobs over the past 30 years and currently hosts 30 start-ups employing 155 people says he is very interested in the pipeline TU Dublin can create for his services among students with ideas.The big difference with TU Dublin compared to Trinity College University College Dublin and Dublin City College is that whereas the others’ start-ups are technology-driven with TU Dublin there is the “social element”.“They are very open and there is a big appetite among the academics” he says.McCann points to TU Dublin’s take up of the TEFCE – Towards a European Framework for Community Engagement of Higher Education – tool box designed to help universities and policy-makers across the EU assess how they can better interact with their communities locally and regionally to address pressing social needs. She says this has encouraged a lot of mapping of civic engagement to enable a coordinated approach.Bernard who has 25 staff working on civic engagement in her office while in addition many academic staff are delivering activities says community engagement is part of the history and culture of certain types of higher education institution and certainly of the technological university remit.“There is a very strong commitment to community engagement a strong belief in education for all a strong focus on preparing graduates for the real world hence why they take part in community research and learning.”She says at TU Dublin there is a “very strong belief in the value of it being for the benefit of everyone students universities and communities. It is a genuine partnership where everyone gains that’s what makes it sustainable”.University World News

From helping doctors diagnose and treat patients to rapidly advancing new drug discoveries it’s our trusted partner in so many ways.

Now it has found its way into the once exclusively-human domain of love and relationships. With AI-systems as matchmakers in the coming decades it may become common to date a personalised avatar.

This was explored in the 2014 movie “Her” in which a writer living in near-future Los Angeles develops affection for an AI system. The sci-fi film won an Academy Award for depicting what seemed like a highly unconventional love story.

In reality we’ve already started down this road.

Delving into the human psyche

The online dating industrty is worth more than US$4 billion and there are a growing number of players in this market. Dominating it is the Match Group which owns OkCupid Match Tinder and 45 other dating-related businesses.

Match and its competitors have accumulated a rich trove of personal data which AI can analyse to predict how we choose partners.

The industry is majorly embracing AI. For instance Match has an AI-enabled chatbot named “Lara” who guides people through the process of romance offering suggestions based on up to 50 personal factors.

Tinder co-founder and CEO Sean Rad outlines his vision of AI being a simplifier: a smart filter that serves up what it knows a person is interested in.

Dating website eHarmony has used AI that analyses people’s chat and sends suggestions about how to make the next move. Happn uses AI to “rank” profiles and show those it predicts a user might prefer.

Loveflutter’s AI takes the guesswork out of moving the relationship along such as by suggesting a restaurant both parties could visit. And Badoo uses facial recognition to suggest a partner that may look like a celebrity crush.

Dating platforms are using AI to analyse all the finer details. From the results they can identify a greater number of potential matches for a user.

They could also potentially examine a person’s public posts on social media websites such as Facebook Twitter and Instagram to get a sense of their attitudes and interests.

This would circumvent bias in how people represent themselves on matchmaking questionnaires. Research has shown inaccuracies in self-reported attributes are the main reason online dating isn’t successful.

While the sheer amount of data on the web is too much for a person to process it’s all grist to the mill for a smart matchmaking AI.

Shovelling your data into the dating sandbox

As more user data is generated on the internet (especially on social media) AI will be able to make increasingly accurate predictions. Big players such as Match.com would be well-placed for this as they already have access to large pools of data.

And where there is AI there will often be its technological sibling virtual reality (VR). As both evolve simultaneously we’ll likely see versions of VR in which would-be daters can “practice” in simulated environments to avoid slipping up on a real date.

This isn’t a far stretch considering “virtual girlfriends” which are supposed to help people practice dating have already existed for some years and are maturing as a technology. A growing number of offerings point to a significant degree of interest in them.

With enough user data future AI could eventually create a fully-customised partner for you in virtual reality – one that checks all your “boxes”. Controversially the next step would be to experience an avatar as a physical entity.

It could inhabit a life-like android and become a combined interactive companion and sex partner. Such advanced androids don’t exist yet but they could one day.

Proponents of companion robots argue this technology helps meet a legitimate need for more intimacy across society — especially for the elderly widowed and people with disabilities.

Meanwhile critics warn of the inherent risks of objectification racism and dehumanisation — particularly of women but also men.

Using tech to save us from the problems of tech?

Another problematic consequence may be rising numbers of socially reclusive people who substitute technology for real human interaction. In Japan this phenomenon (called “hikikomori”) is quite prevalent.

At the same time Japan has also experienced a severe decline in birth rates for decades. The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research predicts the population will fall from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065.

Concerned by the declining birth rate the Japanese government last month announced it would pour two billion yen (about A$25000000) into an AI-based matchmaking system.

AI as a facilitator not a replacement

The debate on digital and robotic “love” is highly polarised much like most major debates in the history of technology. Usually consensus is reached somewhere in the middle.

But in this debate it seems the technology is advancing faster than we are approaching a consensus.

Generally the most constructive relationship a person can have with technology is one in which the person is in control and the technology helps enhance their experiences. For technology to be in control is dehumanising.

Humans have leveraged new technologies for millenia. Just as we learned how to use fire without burning down cities so too we will have to learn the risks and rewards accompanying future tech.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmloZi5pbmZvL21lZGlhLWNlbnRlci9uZXdzL3J1c3NpYW4taGFuZGJhbGwtZmVkZXJhdGlvbi10ZWFtLXRha2Utc2Vuc2F0aW9uYWwtd2luLW92ZXItc2xvdmVuaWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russian Handball Federation Team take sensational win over Slovenia,"We use cookies

Harry Maguire details what he'll say in pre-match team talk at Liverpool

Harry Maguire won't be delivering a rousing Churchillian speech to Manchester United players in the away dressing room at Anfield today.

Maguire might be Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's captain but he says his Premier League leaders don't need a tub-thumping pep-talk before facing all-conquering Liverpool.

This United have the belief confidence and ability to handle the occasion without extra motivation from him.

“We will have a long conversation before the kick off but I’ll keep what I'll be telling them to myself” explains Maguire.

“But it’s not about any big battle speech – it’s about your mentality.

“We don’t need to hype this one up everyone knows how important it is. It will be tough to go to Liverpool and get a result it’s never going to be anything else.

“But we are confident. We are Manchester United - and there is definitely a feeling that we can go anywhere and beat anyone.

“We’ve shown the spirit and character to come from behind this season and turn games around.

“And shown we can hang in when we’ve had to fight. We also know we have enough talent to score goals from anywhere in an instant.

“Winning builds the confidence and we have that winning mentality back amongst the group.”

Like United £80 million Maguire – the world's most expensive defender - has been on an upward curve this season and at Anfield he'll celebrate a year since officially being given the armband.

It's been a roller-coaster ride that's seen the England star arrested jailed and handed a suspended prison sentence after a headline-making brawl on Mykonos.

As if that wasn't enough Maguire's troubles leaked onto the pitch for club and country.

His United form dipped and his red card for England in the Nations League defeat by Denmark at Wembley in October capped a torrid time.

Those miserable weeks now seem a long time ago for the 27-year-old who has emerged stronger after a personal and professional test of his character.

“I’ve learned a lot about myself over the last year and I've learned so much as captain of this club too” says Maguire.

“It’s a massive honour but I'm here to win games and trophies” he says.

“That’s the mentality and character I have. We've a lot of leaders in this group. I just happen to be the one with the armband.”

Maguire has researched the history of United skippers and takes regular advice from Bryan Robson – Old Trafford's original Captain Marvel.

“I have looked into the history of this club. And I've spoken a lot to Robbo because he's always knocking about the place and has told me loads.

“But I am my own man with my way of being captain.

“I wouldn’t put myself in the same category as anyone else. I’m my own person I've got my own voice and do it my own way.”

All eyes will be on Maguire and United at Anfield to see if United can end Liverpool's astonishing 64 game unbeaten home League run stretching back three years seven months.

Some pundits claim this is a bigger game for Liverpool with the pressure on Jurgen Klopp's stars to assert their authority. Maguire disagrees.

“Playing for United and playing with no pressure don’t come in the same sentence.

“We’re the biggest club in the world. And whatever anyone says on the outside we go into every game not only wanting to win but expected and expecting to win.

“That’s the mentality we have in this dressing room – winning at all costs. It’s something we've changed round we’ve created it and that's the environment we’re in now.

“But we’re not even at halfway in the league yet so we’ve got to keep this level up and improve.

“No way are we the finished article – once we are that’s when we’ll get to where we want to be.

“But winning a game like this would send a statement of course it would” he says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbGlieWFvYnNlcnZlci5seS9zcG9ydHMvbGlieWEtZHJhd3MtbmlnZXItZmlyc3QtY2hhbi1tYXRjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Libya draws Niger in first CHAN match,"Libya's national football team drew Niger 0-0 in the first match of the Cameroon-hosted African Nations Championship (CHAN) in the second group that also contains Congo and DR Congo.

What Is Staphylococcus Aureus?

The FDA explains that Staph is a bacteria that can cause severe food poisoning. Food contaminated with Staph may not smell or taste bad or look spoiled. Though the bacteria can be killed by cooking the toxins may still be able to cause illness.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) symptoms develop within 30 minutes to eight hours after consuming the contaminated food. Though severe illness is rare Staph food poisoning may cause nausea vomiting and stomach cramps.

What To Do If You Have the Recalled Products at Home

Check your pantry for the recalled products many of which have a long shelf-life. Do not eat any of the recalled products. You should discard them.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA1L3NucC1hY3RpdmlzdC1ncmFlbWUtbWNjb3JtaWNrLWpvaG4tc3dpbm5leS1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWNvbnRlc3TSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8wNS9zbnAtYWN0aXZpc3QtZ3JhZW1lLW1jY29ybWljay1qb2huLXN3aW5uZXktbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1jb250ZXN0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SNP activist aims to challenge John Swinney for party leadership,"John Swinney could face a leadership contest before he becomes Scottish National party leader after an activist said he expected to win enough nominations to stand.

Graeme McCormick a well-known party activist who stood to become SNP president in 2023 claimed he would gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

His supporters argue it would be undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. If one does take place Swinney will not be appointed as first minister until late May.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson posted on X on Sunday that he had already obtained the 100 signatures required and was planning to hand them in to the SNP “in person”.

Lawson also attacked Swinney for criticising the move and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was challenging him.

“So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS [Swinney] has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea?”

McCormick some of whose allies want the Scottish government to mount a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea? — Iain.lawson27 (@ILawson27) May 5 2024

Nominations to succeed Humza Yousaf as SNP leader close at noon on Monday. If another candidate crosses the nominations threshold and forces a contest Yousaf is expected to remain in post and as Scotland’s first minister until a winner is declared.

McCormick was very confident he would gather the signatures before the deadline after canvassing for support at an independence rally in Glasgow organised by All Under One Banner the Sunday Herald newspaper reported.

Swinney who has been expecting to be confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday afternoon and be voted in as first minister this week warned on Sunday that a contest would delay his efforts to rebuild the party and put its deep divisions on public display.

“I think it would be better if we just got on with things that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength” he told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show. “We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we’ve just had a rough couple of years.

“[The] SNP has not looked cohesive; the SNP has not looked together. The central point of my message is we’ve got to get ourselves together.”

An unopposed coronation would not be the SNP’s first: Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in November 2014 without a contest.

Swinney’s call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

For Amber Roze McCormick known to many in pro wrestling DangerKid it took 30 years to reach that destination. The celebration isn’t to be compromised.

McCormick came out as a trans woman Saturday in an emotional Instagram post in which she detailed the last year that led to this moment.

“I can confidently say I’m living my best life and am growing into the best version of myself” McCormick said. “I am able to sit here and be proud of the growth I’ve managed to achieve and continue to.”

The multi-time tag team champion explained that transitioning genders had been a goal she set for herself one year prior during a period of great personal and professional change.

McCormick who previously came out as nonbinary genderfluid in 2021 began undergoing HRT treatment last September and never looked back.

“On this day I can’t help but be moved to tears realizing that I wrote down ‘transition’ under a list of goals and thinking back to how I was feeling on this day one year ago” McCromick said. “I am not even close to where I want to be but the progress I’ve made I didn’t think was possible.”

The post came three months after the last time pro wrestling fans saw McCormick in the ring. Her final match as DangerKid (for the foreseeable future) saw her and longtime tag team partner close friend and fellow out pro wrestler Aiden Aggro clash in a 49-minute match at Maine-based Limitless Wrestling’s Jan. 20 event.

The match itself was framed as the end of the 10-year partnership between the team collectively known as MSP. She detailed how her and Aggro “spilled our hearts out to each other” and worked together to build the angle that would see their paths diverge.

That night brought an end to a furious run for MSP including tag team title reigns in Chaotic Wrestling New South Pro Wrestling and Blitzkrieg Pro Wrestling among other promotions along the east coast. The duo was also a staple of “EFFY’s Big Gay Brunch” and Pro Wrestling VIBE events that highlighted LGBTQ pro wrestlers in recent years.

McCormick explained that she needed to get out of wrestling for reasons associated with her transition and otherwise. “The mental and physical anguish that ten years of being in wrestling does to a person was too much for me with everything else I had going on” she said. “I don’t know if my days in wrestling are officially over but for now the time away has been exactly what I needed.”

Putting aside whether fans ever see her in the ring again the expressions of love confidence and affirmation that inundate McCormick’s declaration point to a higher achievement than a championship: finding happiness and comfort within one’s self.

Outsports congratulates Amber Roze McCormick for showing the power to live out and proud a second time over and continuing to show that Courage is Contagious."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tY3ZlZ2FuLWJ1cmdlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the hell isn't there a McVegan Burger yet? It's complicated,"It seemed like the trial was going well until the company quietly pulled the item from the menu in 2020 telling a dejected Twitter user that it “has no plans to bring it back”. Then in November McDonald’s announced that it would be bringing a burger called the McPlant to the United States in 2021 following the success of the PLT.

However there has been some confusion about who exactly McDonald’s will be partnering with to produce the McPlant burger. Ian Borden McDonald's international president said that the plant-based patty that was trialled last year was developed “exclusively for McDonald’s by McDonald’s”. This did not sit well with its partner: Beyond Meat quickly responded that it was actually a collective effort.

London-based marketer Heidi Bland is among the McDonald’s aficionados that has been patiently waiting for the arrival of a McVegan ever since she became a vegetarian. Seeing pictures of the burger in Finland gave her hope that it was finally coming to the UK. “But lo and behold I'm still waiting and it never bloody arrives.”

In 2018 Lucy Brady then senior vice president of corporate strategy at McDonald’s told Fortune that “plant-based protein is something we’re keeping our eye on”. But that has yet to translate into action. When approached for comment McDonald said there were currently no plans to bring a vegan burger to UK restaurants this year.

Sure McDonald’s does sell a couple of vegetarian options besides a trusty bag of chips like the Vegetable Deluxe and the Veggie Dippers. But they are the standard bean-style options that have been on menus for years. ""I think the bean burger is a bit of a cop-out"" Bland says. ""I want it to be as meat-like as possible.""

In the meantime rivals like Burger King and KFC have beaten McDonald’s to the punch. Last year Burger King launched the Rebel Whopper a patty made from soya and topped with sliced tomatoes fresh lettuce vegan mayonnaise pickles onions and ketchup in partnership with Unilever’s Vegetarian Butcher. KFC launched the vegan chicken burger made from a Quorn fillet with iceberg lettuce and vegan mayonnaise.

When bakery chain Greggs reinvented the staple greasy sausage roll for vegan customers in 2019 – replacing the log of pork with Quorn’s fungus-grown meat alternative thousands of people flocked to try it. It was so popular that shares in Greggs soared by 77 per cent in the months following its introduction.

It seemed like a no-brainer for McDonalds to follow their lead. As the most popular takeaway brand in the UK McDonald’s rules the dinner crowd where Greggs dominates lunch orders. Now that the company has a partnership with both Uber Eats and Just Eat it could have flooded the burgeoning home-eating market with a glut of vegan burgers.

Ultimately it comes down to whether the food item can scale. “McDonald's doesn't make too much margin on an individual [burger] sale it makes margin by selling lots and selling lots and lots of burgers and patties and nuggets and whatnot” says Mohan Sodhi a professor of operations and supply chain management at The Business School (formerly Cass). “You just sell volume but the profit margin on each is very small.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzE2L2JldHRlci1idXktbWNkb25hbGRzLXZzLXl1bS1icmFuZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: McDonald's vs. Yum! Brands,"Only one of these fast food giants has mastered the art and science of the business.

With nothing more than a passing glance it would be easy to assume one is more or less the same as the other. McDonald's (MCD -0.38%) is the bigger chain but Yum! Brands (YUM 1.37%) -- the name behind KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell -- is certainly no slouch. Besides fast food is just fast food right?

Investors looking to make a bet on a restaurant before a full-blown recovery from the COVID-19 slump however would be far better served by McDonald's.

Every little detail

That's not a slight on Yum! Brands for the record. Taco Bell and its Yum! brethren have carved out a respectable piece of the world's $600 billion fast food market. All told the company operates more than 50000 locations in more than 150 countries. Technically speaking it's got more total restaurants under its umbrella than rival McDonald's -- they're just divvied up among three different banners.

McDonald's has something Yum! doesn't have though and isn't likely to have anytime soon. That's one of the world's best-known brand names. McDonald's is consistently found among the world's ten most recognized companies regardless of who's performing the poll.

That's not a coincidence either. In a relatively normal (read ""pre-COVID"") 2019 McDonald's spent almost $450 million on advertising and related expenses a figure that doesn't include franchisees' localized spending.

While the company is spending big it's also spending smart. Indeed the fact that the logo hasn't changed in decades is by design as everything else about the organization's look has adapted to its iconic memorable golden arches and their unique red and gold colors. Even the lettering font you'll see in its visual promotional material is the stuff of vigorous debate ultimately steered by a chief marketing officer.

McDonald's isn't just one of the few names to revise the role of chief marketing officer however. In an effort to ensure it's connecting with customers in the way customers most want the restaurant chain even employs a chief digital customer engagement officer. Lucy Brady was named to that role a year ago before the pandemic took hold. With someone in the driver's seat catering to how consumers spend their money in the age of COVID McDonald's estimates that 20% of 2020 revenue produced within its top six markets was digitally driven. That's a lot. For perspective less than 6% of Wendy's third-quarter company-wide revenue came from connected customers.

Marketing brilliance

It's admittedly difficult to attribute McDonald's sustained growth -- excluding the coronavirus shutdown slump -- to how seriously it takes its public presence. Rather the evidence of the chain's mastery of marketing lies in the sheer number of success stories it always seems able to point to.

The company's partnership with rap star Travis Scott is one example of this promotional brilliance. Although not quite the perfectly family-friendly affiliation one might normally expect from the fast food chain the company's executives' intuition was on target. Driven by the rapper's connection to a particular combo meal September's sales grew year over year at a double-digit pace. In fact it was one of the best single months McDonald's had mustered in years.

The restaurant chain is hardly reliant on expensive spokespeople though. It's also savvy when it comes to the creation of new attention-getting products at the right time.

Case(s) in point: In October it launched an apple fritter a blueberry muffin and a cinnamon roll largely in an effort to nab market share in a competitive quick breakfast market that exploded during the pandemic. Wendy's entry into this race earlier this year likely played a part in the decision as well. The items available all day are ideal additions to the menu because they're quick and easy to make.

The company also introduced a new crispy chicken sandwich just a few days ago quickly capitalizing on what's turned into a brutal chicken sandwich war that's involved KFC Popeye's Shake Shack Wendy's and Chick-Fil-A.

McDonald's already had a couple of chicken choices on the menu mind you. It just felt it needed more entrants in the race to plug into changes that were already under way. Telsey Advisory Group explained over a year ago that 2019's chicken sandwich market would grow to the tune of 14% that year jibing with numbers from NPD Group suggesting U.S. chicken sandwich orders grew 4% early that year while orders of burgers were flat.

To this end in an interview with Time magazine published in August of last year CEO Chris Kempczinski explained: ""We're certainly working on ways that we can update and upgrade our chicken offering in the U.S. Suffice to say we will continue to be competing and innovating in chicken"" adding ""I don't want to get too into revealing competitive secrets but I think we are feeling good about where we're at."" It sounds more like something a tech CEO would say illustrating exactly why McDonald's is the dominant name in the business.

Connect the dots. Clearly McDonald's takes the science (and math and business) of fast food very seriously.

Bottom line

None of this is to suggest Yum! Brands doesn't do comparable market research or marketing tie-ins. It does. Its Taco Bell KFC and Pizza Hut chains are going to hold their own for the foreseeable future.

It's not a stretch to say however that McDonald's is the industry's ""best of breed."" Every move it makes is either data-informed well-conceived adequately funded or a combination of all three. That's a key reason earnings growth has been so steady for years and is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future.

The revenue dropoff that started in 2014? That's by design. The restaurant chain began selling most of its company-owned stores to franchisees around that time which crimps the top line but clearly translates into more profits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8va3V0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC91dGFoLW1hbi1hcnJlc3RlZC10cnlpbmctdG8tbWVldC1naXJsLWF0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1mb3VuZC13aXRoLW1ldGgtaW4tcG9ja2V00gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9rdXR2LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC91dGFoLW1hbi1hcnJlc3RlZC10cnlpbmctdG8tbWVldC1naXJsLWF0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1mb3VuZC13aXRoLW1ldGgtaW4tcG9ja2V0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utah man arrested trying to meet 'girl' at McDonald's found with meth in pocket,"Authorities say they arrested a man on Friday night for allegedly trying to meet up with who he thought was a young girl he was enticing and for being in possession of methamphetamine.

According to probable cause statements Brian Davidson 49 started messaging who he thought was a girl younger than 14 years of age on Sept. 5. Over the course of several months Davidson messaged her offering to buy her clothes and other items.

Davidson offered to meet the girl several times and traveled to Kaysville on one occasion to meet her according to statements. However he did not meet the girl on that day.

Davidson began asking sexual favors from the girl while continuing to ask her to meet. Statements said that he sent her pictures of lingerie and underwear offering to purchase them for her.

Davidson offered to reserve a hotel room for him and the girl on the night of Jan. 15. He told the girl that she could stay the night with him in the hotel room and arranged to pick her up. Davison arrived at the McDonald's located at 1520 S. State Street where he was taken into custody without incident.

Police also found a small amount of methamphetamine in Davidson's pant pocket and a glass pipe. According to statements Davidson had previously been convicted of several drug charges including felony charges.

Davidson was booked into the Salt Lake County Jail and charged with enticing a minor by Internet possession of a controlled substance and use or possession of drug paraphernalia.

5 The 32-year-old spent months perfecting the recipe

His “Eureka moment” came at his 25th attempt.

Software developer Dave 32 said: “I’ve had so many McDonald’s over the years I knew exactly what taste I was looking for — sort of a thousand island dressing with a beefy undertone.

“The first attempt was awful so I binned it. But I kept trying different flavourings in different proportions until it was exactly right.”

Dave used an e-liquid base mixture and three food flavourings mixed using a pipette.

He is keeping the exact details a secret given he spent so long on it.

In the first lockdown he moved from ­Manchester to his mum’s in Northumberland but found himself 30 miles from a McDonald’s.

He added: “My dad would take us to McDonald’s for a day out so it has that nostalgic feel.

“I’d been thinking of quitting smoking and the start of lockdown felt the right time.

""But after perfecting my secret recipe this is the next best thing.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

The arrangement aims to create “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and produce BCG “at large scale” for use in combination with Anktiva in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ImmunityBio said Thursday.

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

“We are pleased to partner with the Serum Institute of India so that the power of its large-scale world-class GMP manufacturing capacity can be used to address the issue of BCG shortage which affects thousands of bladder cancer patients annually” Soon-Shiong said in a statement Thursday.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Privacy-focused messaging app Telegram continues its torrid streak of user growth. On Tuesday founder Pavel Durov announced the service had grown to more than 500 million active users. That's an impressive total but the acceleration in its growth has been particularly noteworthy: In the 72 hour-period before Tuesday's announcement the service added 8.3 million daily users versus 1.5 million daily adds in the prior year.

Telegram still significantly trails Facebook's (META 3.04%) WhatsApp which boasts 2 billion users but the upstart is slowly chipping away at that lead. Although Telegram was founded nearly eight years ago 25% of its user growth has occurred in the last nine months.

The company can thank a WhatsApp misstep for the most recent growth explosion. In the short run this is bad news for WhatsApp but Facebook investors shouldn't worry... yet.

A less-private privacy-based messaging service

WhatsApp has always been an odd fit in the Facebook family as it initially existed as a privacy-focused subscription-based service that charged users $1 per year while Facebook has always supported an ad-based monetization model.

After the technology giant purchased WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion its founder Jan Koum sought to assure users the service's commitment to privacy wouldn't change but many remained skeptical privacy could coexist with Facebook's data collection efforts. Since then Facebook has killed the $1 annual fee but also chipped away at the level of user privacy WhatsApp offered leading to Koum's eventual departure in 2018.

This month Facebook ripped the bandage off and announced it was changing WhatsApp's terms of service effective Feb. 8. To continue using the service users will have to agree to share identification data like profile name IP address phone number and contacts and app logs with other Facebook entities.

Facebook investors should pay attention



Facebook shareholders have little to worry about in the short run. Many users were introduced to WhatsApp through other Facebook apps and use it for its convenience not necessarily for its privacy focus. Switching costs are low in the universe of messaging apps which is a double-edged sword -- users have recently flocked to other apps like Telegram and Signal but could return to WhatsApp if it remains popular among their friends and colleagues.

In exchange for the short-term outrage Facebook is now able to increase the monetization of the service. Facebook likely performed a review of user loss versus the value of data collection and determined this is a favorable trade-off. Furthermore any revenue effects will be minimal in the short-run as WhatsApp is still early in its monetization cycle and has little to do with the company's top line. My colleague Jeremy Bowman argues Facebook is well-primed for top-line growth as digital advertising recovers from its pandemic-pressured lows and I agree with this thesis.

There's an argument that an increased focus on privacy might mean Facebook overpaid for WhatsApp but the acquisition was mostly paid for with Facebook stock that has been well-supported by growth in its eponymous social media site and Instagram. Despite the expensive price tag this isn't a significant concern.

The biggest risk remains hypothetical for now -- that a more pronounced shift in consumers' desire for privacy could impact Facebook's business model. If consumers are becoming increasingly cognizant of how their data is being used and shared Facebook will be in their cross-hairs. Facebook is aware of this: Apple has been on a privacy-focused campaign in recent years which has resulted in growing acrimony between Apple CEO Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg. It's a nascent risk at this point but one that investors should keep an eye on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZW4uY3J5cHRvbm9taXN0LmNoLzIwMjEvMDEvMTYvdHdpdHRlci1wb3N0cy1uZnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Twitter posts become NFTs and can be bought,"Posts on Twitter become NFTs. This is something that has been created by Cent a social media company that has launched Valuables.

Thanks to this platform users can literally buy tweets paying for them with Ethereum. Valuables already has a volume of over $150000.

Cent had already made a name for itself by enabling Ethereum transfers between users of its social network.

This time they have done more: they have made it possible for people to make offers to buy the tweets they produce which are in fact tokenized and become NFTs.

How do Twitter NFTs work

According to Voice the social network based on the EOS blockchain the original idea was to create “tradable” posts. It was supposed to be just another function of Cent to increase engagement on the platform creating a market that wasn’t there before.

The operation is simple: it is necessary to use a browser such as Google Chrome or Brave with an extension for the Metamask wallet or it can be done through the MetaMask app and Coinbase wallet in their internal browser.

Via Valuable the user has to paste the link to the tweet they want to buy and make their offer. The author has to accept it. After the transaction exclusively in Ethereum a certificate of ownership is issued on the Matic blockchain. The tweet never leaves Twitter.

The creators of this system Matthew and Cameron from Cent are aware that the transformation of Twitter into a large NFT marketplace is currently not a breakthrough for either the economy or the crypto ecosystem. It is mostly a game something to spend time on.

They speculate for example that one day they might make an offer to Elon Musk to buy one of his tweets.

“I think he would laugh if he saw the offer tweet and for essentially no other reason. It’s a little weird I suppose but my instinct says to me that if I get this much amusement from this concept it’s worth picking up and running with (to a degree) for that reason alone”.

After all they say part of the crypto world is based on memes and in this sense the case of Dogecoin is emblematic.

The ambition though goes outside the context of the game:

“However if it works it could end up doing something truly remarkable. I’ll be closely following this because if we start to see Twitter users provide a real stream of value to meme-makers and curators we may soon see Valuables begin to take over all of today’s social media platforms and add an agnostic layer to the tech stack we use to interact with every single one of them. How? Simply by allowing people to pay creators for making things they like wherever they’re found”.

It’s something that is bound to broaden the debate over social media platforms which have been called into question since Donald Trump has had his accounts banned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc3VuZGF5dGltZXMubGsvMjEwMTE3L2VkdWNhdGlvbi90aWxsaS1hLWxlYXJuaW5nLXRvb2wtZm9yLWVtcGF0aHktY3JpdGljYWwtdGhpbmtpbmctYW5kLW1ldGEtY29nbml0aW9uLTQyODgxNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tilli: A learning tool for empathy critical thinking and meta-cognition,"Tilli: A learning tool for empathy critical thinking and meta-cognition View(s):

A game-based social-emotional learning tool called ‘Tilli’ was recently released on multiple platforms by a team of young innovators. Co-founder at Without Borders a community education based non-profit Kavindya Thennakoon spoke to the Education Times on their creation. Tilli empowers five to ten year olds to stay safe healthy and happy while targeting three skills: empathy critical thinking and meta-cognition.

“These three core skills are linked to everything from better academic outcomes and job market prospects to more positive mental health outcomes later in a child’s life” Ms. Thennakoon said.

Meta-cognition is in simple terms thinking about our thinking. It is a higher-order skill that forms the basis of everything from social-emotional learning to STEM-related competencies. It helps learners take control of their own learning by empowering them to reflect think critically and understand how unique their thought processes are.

“This in turn helps them make sense of nuances beyond the binaries of what is traditionally considered a correct versus the wrong answer” Ms. Thennakoon said.

Tilli’s special focus on meta-cognition helped train children to make better sense of their own emotions think critically and empathetically about the world around them and creatively solve everyday problems. It used interactive game-mechanics and engaging stories to help kids learn apply and internalise crucial skills mindsets and tools.

The game had several modules on topics like trust bodies boundaries consent and emotional regulation. Every module helped children build their empathy improve their critical thinking skills and enhance their meta-cognition.

Ms. Thennakoon also mentioned that their research paper outlining the design and development process of Tilli was recently published by Stanford and was accessible on their website.

Tilli had been made available on multiple platforms in order to increase faster accessibility. The current mobile version launched was a mini-game of the ‘Trust’ module. It taught some key concepts around trust through ‘Tilli’ and the people in her life. It could be accessed from anywhere in the world via a smartphone or device. It could also be downloaded and played via IMI games using the QR code attached to this article.

The team behind Tilli had also constructed a physical learning kit that they are able to send across to teachers and educators to be used in their classrooms or communities. Interested educators could reach out to the team and access this kit at tilliforkids@gmail.com. The inspiration for Tilli stemmed from an ambitious dream of ensuring that no child grows up to face (or create) any situation of sexual abuse assault or violence.

“We fiercely believe that social-emotional learning interventions when designed well and delivered as early as the age of five have the power to reverse cycles of violence” said Ms. Thennakoon.

She said she built Tilli with her own seven-year-old self in mind. Her co-founded non-profit Without Borders worked with communities across Sri Lanka engaging with schools teachers and local officials trying to find a more effective sustainable learning-based solution to the issue of gender-based violence. Their work laid the foundation of the research that was applied in the creation of Tilli which was a result of five years of user-testing community-based research and iteration.

The team includes Vidya Sri a leading women’s rights activist and scholar who led the Initiative on Violence Against Women at Carr Center Harvard Kennedy School and the projects team at Without Borders. The research that crafted Tilli was supported by and based at the Stanford School of Education.

The mobile game version of Tilli recenlty launched in Sri Lanka was designed by IMI Games at Arimac where the creators were able to partner with Sri Lanka’s most experienced game designers. The research phase was supported by a driven local team where it was user-tested with over 100 children and adults from Anuradhapura to Galle.

Tilli’s creators are currently working on building a fully-fledged mobile version that integrates more interactive game mechanics and features for parents to track and measure their child’s learning while also working on building a physical learning kit for Tilli specifically designed for classrooms kindergartens and community learning centers.

“Accessibility is at the heart of what we do and we want to ensure that every child is able to access and make use of Tilli irrespective of internet access” Ms. Thennakoon said.

Since the team used a research-backed approach to learning experience design the content and tools were also constantly user-tested to measure learning and to understand how children respond to the tool. She also invited interested stakeholders to visit www.tillikids.org to join their waitlist and get more regular updates and learning tools.

Kavindya Thennakoon hoped to expand the innovation by connecting with organisations willing to support their work and help them reach more schools classrooms and young parents. In the spirit of constant improvement and research-based contribution she believed interaction with the app and any feedback given would support their efforts to make Tilli better for every child that accessed it.

Music by Gustav Mahler Bergmund Waal Skaslien

Norwegian choreographer director and filmmaker Jo Strømgren was inspired primarily by Mahler's songs excerpts and melodies. Moreover he found inspiration in what Mahler heard around him and what was significant for Mahler’s home which was the multinational and multicultural Austro-Hungarian Empire that was slowly falling apart.

Jo Strømgren's creative endeavour is neither a reconstruction of Gustav Mahler's memories nor a recreation of his childhood and boyhood in Jihlava which was the place where Mahler perceived the musical culture of this region very sensitively and which was later partly reflected in his work. The choreographer is more concerned with creating a poetic image of Gustav Mahler’s world and Gustav Mahler as a human being. The inexhaustible source of Strømgren's inspiration is especially the modernity topicality and attractivity of Mahler's music that comes from the combination of diverse elements. Among his other authentic projects and his own dance company Jo Strømgren has worked as a residential choreographer at the Norwegian National Ballet he has collaborated with many significant institutions such as The Royal Danish Ballet or the Vienna State Opera. He has created over 150 choreographies in more than 60 countries and films.

A Mahwah couple are suing the Demarest resident whose real name is Artist J. Dubose for damage to their home while he leased it for a year between 2017 and 2018.

Dr. Lawrence Guarino and his wife Carol Guarino said in their lawsuit filed by Chubb Insurance Co. on their behalf that Dubose known for his singles “Look Back At It” and “Still Think About You” and Quincy Acheampong one of the founders of the music company High Bridge the Label entered into a 12-month lease agreement for their property on Finn Court but abandoned the property.

The lawsuit filed in state Superior Court in Bergen County last Wednesday said that when Lawrence Guarino entered the abandoned home on Dec. 13 2018 after making several attempts to contact Dubose and Acheampong he found the following:

“Damage to the landscape”; “entry doors to be left open with evidence of extensive water damage”; “bathroom toilets clogged and overrun by sewerage material which penetrated through the floors and damaging ceilings below”; “walls and trim damaged”; “carpets cut out and mismatched pieces replaced damages stains and tears throughout”; and “two vehicles had been abandoned on the property.”

The Guarinos are seeking $263592 in compensation according to the lawsuit saying that as “a direct and proximate result of the negligent reckless and/or carelessness of the defendants the Property sustained extensive damage to the high end interior finishes and was left in a condition that left it unable to be leased until extensive repairs were conducted.”

Nevada hospitality employees are in the fast lane to receive a COVID-19 vaccine but face a long line before it’s their turn.

In the state’s latest COVID-19 playbook front-line casino and resort workers are in the fourth category of workers eligible for the vaccine through Nevada’s “frontline/essential workforce lane.” Workers in education and agriculture and certain state and local government employees are just a few of the groups ahead of them in line.

Leisure and hospitality employees make up a quarter of the state’s total private workforce. Thousands of these workers have been put face to face with visitors since June when casinos reopened. Gov. Steve Sisolak recently extended into February a 25 percent capacity limit on casinos which the state has previously identified as a source of spread.

“I think (getting hospitality workers vaccinated) is the first step to turning it all around” said one Strip dealer who was granted anonymity to protect her job at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

Vaccinating ‘critical’ workers

The latest vaccination guidelines from the state were announced Monday. Brian Labus an assistant professor of epidemiology at UNLV and a member of the medical team advising Sisolak said the updated playbook largely follows federal recommendations.

“There are local decisions we can make but the basic groups are decided at the federal level and rolled out similarly state to state” he said. But “we want to protect (hospitality workers) because they’re putting themselves in situations where they’re potentially at risk by being around tourists from all around the world.”

As of November there were roughly 301700 leisure and hospitality workers in the state according to data from the Department of Employment Training and Rehabilitation.

Labus said it’s not yet clear when hospitality workers will be eligible for the vaccine. He expects that priority groups will continue to shift as federal guidance is updated.

Virginia Valentine president of the Nevada Resort Association said Monday that Sisolak’s decision to expedite front-line hospitality workers is “welcome and encouraging news.”

“While Nevada’s resorts continue to take responsible actions to protect employees and guests … swift vaccine access will provide another layer of protection for resort employees their families and the public” she said in a statement. “Further protecting the frontline members of Nevada’s economic engine sends a clear message to visitors and meeting and convention organizers that Nevada is the world’s safest travel and tourism destination.”

Culinary Local 226 which represents about 60000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno has been working with Sisolak’s office and the resort association to ensure that hospitality workers have access to the COVID-19 vaccine said Geoconda Argüello-Kline the union’s secretary-treasurer.

“The hospitality industry is critical for the well-being of the entire state of Nevada and the Culinary union is supportive of the governor’s designation of hospitality workers as essential” she said in a statement.

MGM also provided a statement saying the company will make “the necessary resources available to achieve this critical objective” of immunizing workers.

Spokespeople for Las Vegas Sands Corp. Caesars Entertainment Inc. and Boyd Gaming Corp. did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Wynn Resorts Ltd. declined to comment and a spokesman for Red Rock Resorts Inc. referred to the resort association’s statement.

Waiting their turn

The state’s new vaccine rollout plan divides eligible populations into two concurrent lanes: one based on occupation the other based on age underlying health conditions and housing status.

Labus said some hospitality workers will have early access to the vaccine if they fall in a higher age bracket or have underlying health conditions.

“What you’re left with … are people who are younger and healthier to begin with” he said. “We’re not talking about leaving everyone in hospitality until the end. … There may be a large portion already vaccinated by the time we open it to the group of workers.”

Gladis Blanco a guest room attendant of eight years at Bellagio and a Culinary member said hospitality workers are on the front lines of the pandemic interacting with customers from across the world. She thanked Sisolak for “acknowledging that hospitality workers are essential” and said she would feel “peace of mind” that a vaccine could keep her and her family safe.

“I will be first in line for the vaccination when it is my turn” Blanco said through a Culinary spokeswoman statement.

Caesars Palace dealer Tony Pontecorvo said he doesn’t mind hospitality workers’ place in the state’s playbook.

“It’s easy to say we should be higher up but then you have to decide who to move down” he said. “It’s hard to say who I should jump in front of.”

A cook at an MGM property who is being granted anonymity to protect her job said she is comfortable waiting to receive the vaccine.

She acknowledged that vaccination could protect her and others from the coronavirus but she said she is concerned that current vaccine iterations wouldn’t prevent a newly identified more contagious strain. The cook said she already has been exposed to COVID-19; her mom contracted it and suffered “pretty bad” symptoms.

Last month President-elect Joe Biden’s surgeon general nominee Vivek Murthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that there’s “no reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed will not be effective against this virus as well.”

The cook said she was hoping for an “alternative to come into place” with higher efficacy by the time she was eligible though she would take the shot if her employer made vaccination a condition of her job.

“I don’t want to be exposed to something that’s stronger than what I witnessed my mom going through” she said. “It would just depend on the circumstance.”

The Southern Nevada Health District notes that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are after both doses more than 90 percent effective at protecting people from getting sick with COVID-19.

They are the only vaccines currently approved for COVID-19 and they were developed with the same level of U.S. Food and Drug Administration review as vaccines for polio smallpox meningitis and more according to the health district.

The Cosmopolitan dealer said she was ecstatic to learn that casino workers would be included in the prioritization lane.

“It’s going to be exciting to see what’s around the corner (once the vaccine is widely distributed)” she said. “I feel like the whole world is going to come to Vegas.”

Olivia Palamountain reports Hyatt has joined legions of US hotels including MGM Resorts the Wythe Hotel Proper and the London West Hollywood in repurposing rooms and suites as offices to generate revenue during the pandemic. With a resurgence of Covid-19 infections and renewed travel restrictions enacted in many states a November 2020 survey of American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) members showed that the hotel industry will continue to face devastation and significant job loss without additional relief from Congress. Seven in ten hoteliers (71 per cent) said they wouldn’t make it another six months without further federal assistance given current and projected travel demand and 77 per cent of hotels reported they would be forced to lay off more workers. Without further government assistance (i.e. second PPP loan expansion of Main Street Lending Program) nearly half (47 per cent) of respondents indicated they would be forced to close hotels. More than one-third of hotels will be facing bankruptcy or be forced to sell by the end of 2020. Launched in December Hyatt’s “Office for the Day” package starts at a reasonable US$65 per day (plus tax) and offers guests private use of a high-floor room with workspace from 7 am to 7 pm. Early birds can hit the breakfast buffet before taking advantage of Hyatt’s office conveniences – think high-speed wifi and access to businesses facilities such as printer scanner and fax machine (where available).

Billed as an “office space plus the comforts and amenities of a premium hotel experience” guests receive a 50 per cent discount on self- or valet parking plus a 15 per cent off food and drink free bottled water and a selection of in-room coffee and tea.

Lunch breaks can be spent in the gym or pool where available or with a relaxing spa treatment. Various in-room wellbeing offerings are also on offer such as Headspace meditations via the World of Hyatt app and Headspace meditation and mindfulness exercises on guestroom TVs at participating Hyatt House and Hyatt Place properties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS05MTUyNDM1L0xhZGJyb2tlc3Mtb3duZXItcG9pc2VkLWFwcG9pbnQtZmVtYWxlLWJvc3MuaHRtbNIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS05MTUyNDM1L2FtcC9MYWRicm9rZXNzLW93bmVyLXBvaXNlZC1hcHBvaW50LWZlbWFsZS1ib3NzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ladbrokes's owner poised to appoint its first female boss,"Ladbrokes's owner is poised to appoint its first female boss as it fights off an £8billion takeover attempt by MGM Resorts.

Jette Nygaard-Andersen 52 is reportedly the front-runner to become Entain's chief executive after the firm was left reeling by the shock departure of Shay Segev.

Front-runner: It is thought that Jette Nygaard-Andersen could take charge swiftly as she is already a non-executive director at the firm

The appointment would thrust Nygaard-Andersen into the spotlight as the American casino giant and its biggest shareholder Barry Diller are determined to snap up the London-listed gambling company.

It is thought that Nygaard-Andersen could take charge swiftly as she is already a non-executive director at the firm having joined in 2019.

The Dane is the former chairman of Copenhagen-based e-sports firm Astralis and has more than two decades of experience in top roles in the media and entertainment industry.

Entain is in 'advanced talks' to secure her appointment and could announce it next week according to Sky News.

Analysts said 44- year- old Segev's departure leaves Entain in a weaker position as it fends off MGM's advances. The firm says MGM's current offer worth 1383p per share 'significantly undervalues the company and its prospects'.

If hired Nygaard-Andersen would become the first woman to lead one of Britain's biggest listed gambling groups. Along with Ladbrokes Entain owns the Coral Bwin and Sportingbet brands and runs 3000 betting shops.",,,

And you're still smiling. Please contact HR. Image: Microsoft

My head is recovering from something of a pivot.

You see a couple of weeks ago Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella declared in an interview with the Financial Times that Teams could soon be a digital platform as important as the internet browser. Yes Microsoft Teams.

This startled me a touch. The world seems to have moved rather quickly of late.

I thought of all those working-from-home employees real people who have been thrust onto Teams. I wondered if they like it. I also wondered just how much it records what they do.

See also: Employee-experience platform will be anchored in Teams | Here's why your colleagues get new Teams features before you do | You've only got six months to move from Skype for Business Online to Teams | Moving files from Outlook into Teams just got a lot easier

You see this became an especially poignant issue when Microsoft slipped into a puddle of controversy with its 365 Productivity Score feature -- since modified -- one that seemed to rate individual employees for their alleged output.

So I scuttled off to find details of how Teams captures data and delivers it to customers -- and to look at the nuances from the perspective of employees.

Teaming With Information.



As far back as June Microsoft explained in somewhat legalistic terms that it's happily recording so much Teams activity for the benefit of employers and it's up to them what they do with it.

Sample wording from Redmond's fine lawyers: ""Our customers are controllers for the data provided to Microsoft as set forth in the Online Services Terms and they determine legal bases of processing.""

From what I could see Teams hoovers up all your chats voicemails shared meetings files transcriptions your profile details including your email address and phone number and a detailed analysis of what you were wearing on the call. (I may have made up that last one.)

Cut to September and Microsoft offered a little more about the Teams Activity Report (since updated). Here's a sentence that's unsurprising but still a touch uncomfortable: ""The table gives you a breakdown of usage by user.""

Everything from how many meetings that user organized to how many urgent messages they sent is recorded. Separate numbers are given for scheduled meetings and those that were ad hoc. Even individuals' screen-share time is there.

It's remarkably detailed. But I hear you cry is it detailed enough?

In October then Redmond offered ""a new analytics and reporting experience for Microsoft Teams."" (This was updated last week.)

I confess that just staring at this made me swivel several times in wonder. Microsoft is measuring privacy settings device types time stamps reasons why someone may have been blocked and ""the number of messages a user posted in a private chat.""

And that's not the whole list. Screenshot by ZDNet

I know you'll tell me this is all normal. This is entirely what's to be expected in today's techno-marvelous world.

Yet as far as I could tell employees don't have too much say in all this. They're forced onto a particular platform without much control over what that platform may record about them personally with their employer being the potential beneficiary.

I imagined an individual -- or even a whole team -- being summoned by their boss and told: ""You didn't respond to 47 Teams messages last month.""

What do you say to that? ""Well I suspect those 47 messages were sent by brown-nosing halfwits who send as many Teams messages as possible so their innate industry shows up on your Teams analytics reports.""

Not Everyone On The Teams Is Happy.



Some employees are clearly worried about the extent of Teams' potential surveillance work. A Reddit thread last year offered a small glimpse into employees' concerns. Sample: ""Since moving to full-time remote working I can't shake feeling my boss is using Teams to monitor and evaluate our productivity. Is this something I should be concerned about or am I paranoid?""

Could it be both?

I understand there's a belief that the more data you have the wiser you'll be. But I couldn't help asking Microsoft whether there were any causes for employees' concern here. For example does Teams really record the actual messages a user posts in a Teams chat? I also asked whether there was anything an individual employee can do to enhance their own Teams privacy.

A company spokesperson told me: ""At Microsoft we believe that data-driven insights are crucial to empowering people and organizations to achieve more.""

Ah it's all about achievement? A noble pursuit surely. But you can empower people in other ways can't you?

The Microsoft spokesperson continued: ""We also believe that privacy is a human right and we're deeply committed to the privacy of every person who uses our products. Only the global administrator has rights to the analytics and reporting experience which provides insights into the ways in which the organization is using Microsoft Teams not the message content itself.""

I fear you'll parse those words carefully and still be a touch concerned. Perhaps you'll rush to make extra-special online friends with your global administrator.

Surely there'll always be a concern that even if a specific user isn't identified the global administrator won't have to work too hard to discover who they are.

But Is This Good Teams Management?



From Microsoft's perspective you might see the (commercial) dilemma. You want to impress your customers and gain their total commitment to the whole Teams world but you know privacy is a salient topic.

So you try and offer as much as you can as close to the privacy line as you can. (And in the case of Productivity Score beyond it.)

I can't help wondering though whether all this data digestion reflects an obsessive mentality that may be the opposite of both productivity and good management.

The most detailed analytics if widely disseminated could be manna for the micro-manager and a certain sort of purgatory for the manager who believes there's a little more instinct in leading and motivating human employees.

There's a talent in appreciating what employees actually do as opposed to what the data might ""say"" they do.

Some might wonder whether Microsoft's customers are actually begging for this sort of information or whether this is Redmond's way of as they say on marketing department Zoom calls adding value and creating a competitive advantage.

A marketing mind might wonder too if an excellent way to sell video conferencing products would be to boast about the fact that it doesn't scoop up so much personal data. Oh what am I saying? Teams could be as big as the internet browser -- and look at all the data browsers collect.

I wonder how many employees -- and how many companies -- currently know just how much information is now housed in Microsoft Teams.

Or have the companies already invested in some of the fine employee surveillance software that's now available?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vc3dpdGNoLWZyb20tbWljcm9zb2Z0LW9mZmljZS10by13cHMtb2ZmaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Getting Started With WPS Office: How to Switch Over From Microsoft,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vc3dpdGNoLWZyb20tbWljcm9zb2Z0LW9mZmljZS10by13cHMtb2ZmaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbWljcm9zb2Z0L3dpbmRvd3MtMTB4LWEtY2xvc2VyLWxvb2stYXQtbWljcm9zb2Z0cy1uZXctb3BlcmF0aW5nLXN5c3RlbS_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlcGluZ2NvbXB1dGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL21pY3Jvc29mdC93aW5kb3dzLTEweC1hLWNsb3Nlci1sb29rLWF0LW1pY3Jvc29mdHMtbmV3LW9wZXJhdGluZy1zeXN0ZW0vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Windows 10X: A closer look at Microsoft's new operating system,"Windows 10X was announced way back in 2019 and it's finally launching later this year on a new range of 2-in-1s/notebooks from Microsoft partners. Unlike Windows 10 Windows 10X would be simple sleek faster and more secure.

For those unfamiliar Windows 10X was originally designed for dual-screen devices such as the Surface Neo Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold and Intel prototypes. In 2020 Microsoft said that the plans have changed and the operating system will first debut on single-screen devices in 2021.

Reports have suggested that Windows 10X will now launch in the Spring of 2021 and we've finally managed to get our first look thanks to the leaked build.

Start Menu

Unlike Windows 10 or Windows 8 Windows 10X doesn't come with traditional live tiles. In the leaked build Windows 10X is using ChromeOS like static icons for Microsoft Store apps and Microsoft Edge-powered Progressive Web Apps.

By default the Start Menu will include shortcuts to popular apps and services like Microsoft Teams Microsoft Edge and Settings. Start Menu will show apps and websites only and you won’t be able to group apps to create a folder. You can right-click on any icon to access the app’s settings and pin it to the taskbar.

In addition to the Start Menu there’s also a new centre-aligned taskbar with three different sizes – small medium and large. The small size is aimed at desktops with mouse support and medium or large size appears to be very touch-friendly.

Action Center

Action Center is also getting a new look in Windows 10X. As you can see in the below screenshot Windows 10X comes with a floating Action Center which also includes the taskbar's system tray.

Unlike Windows 10 Action Center in Windows 10X puts more emphasis on quick actions which means the notifications area won't be visible all of the time and Action Center won't cover your full screen.

The new Action Center also comes with new volume controls power options and battery percentage.

Settings and Updates

In Windows 10X Microsoft has completely removed the Control Panel and the same Windows 10 Settings app is offered. Using the Settings app you can customize the Action Center change the desktop wallpaper enable transparency effect for the taskbar and more.

Windows Settings also allows you to manage the Windows Updates which are now separated from OS components such as the drivers and apps. Windows 10X is capable of applying updates in less than 90 seconds by saving the update package in a different partition. Once done the update data is moved to another partition and it is replaced during the reboot.

Windows Search

Windows Search is now a part of the Start Menu and it will appear at the top.

Like the Windows Search in Windows 10 Windows 10X will also allow you to search for files in local storage and cloud.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL21ham9yLW5lbHNvbi14Ym94LW1pY3Jvc29mdC0yMC15ZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Major Nelson Celebrates 20 Years at Microsoft,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL21ham9yLW5lbHNvbi14Ym94LW1pY3Jvc29mdC0yMC15ZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

More than 330000 doses from this lot have been distributed to 287 providers across the state according to a press release from the California Department of Public Health. The lot was delivered to the state between Jan. 5 and Jan. 12.

The reactions were linked to one community clinic in San Diego a CDPH spokesperson said. Fewer than 10 individuals required medical attention according to the release.

After closing for a few hours the site switched to another lot of the Moderna vaccine.

""Out of an extreme abundance of caution and also recognizing the extremely limited supply of vaccine we are recommending that providers use other available vaccine inventory"" California State Epidemiologist Dr. Erica S. Pan said in a prepared statement.

An investigation into the lot is underway by Moderna the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration. More information is expected to be released this week.

State officials said they have ""not been notified of any other cluster or individual events related to this lot"" which is called lot 41L20A.

As more Americans continue to get vaccinated against COVID-19 U.S. officials are monitoring for severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and other adverse events after getting the shot. However the vaccine continues to be “an important tool in efforts to control the pandemic” according to the CDC.

""While no vaccine or medical procedure is without risk the risk of a serious adverse reaction is very small"" the California public health department said in its release.

Most people with allergies can receive COVID-19 vaccines safely; the CDC advises those who have had severe allergic reactions to vaccine ingredients including polyethylene glycol to avoid vaccination. The agency also warns people who have had dangerous allergic reactions to a first vaccine dose to skip the second.

The stock market is arguably the greatest wealth creator on the planet. Though there have been short periods when other assets have outpaced equities the broader market has been the most consistent outperformer of inflation for over a century.

Building wealth in the stock market is really an exercise of the mind. It requires the analysis to pick great companies and the resolve to hang onto their stocks for long periods of time. This patience in allowing your investment thesis to play out is how Warren Buffett became one of the wealthiest people in the world.

Had you invested in foundational companies like Amazon or Starbucks at the turn of the century (Dec. 31 1999) you'd be up on your initial investment by around 4000%. These are fantastic returns but still nowhere near the returns of the biggest gainers of the century.

If you'd invested $10000 into the following four stocks at the beginning of the 21st century or whenever they went public you'd have $1.6 million or more today.

Apple: $1.62 million

This may not come as a shock but the kingpin of tech innovation has been a huge winner over the past 21 years. Investors who had the wherewithal to invest $10000 into Apple (AAPL -0.91%) and let it grow over time (I'm talking about you Forrest Gump) would have seen their initial investment top $1.6 million this century.

There's no question that Apple's iPhone completely revolutionized the company. Despite an exceptionally crowded field Apple's many iterations of the iPhone have maintained the top smartphone market share spot in the U.S.

Apple's CEOs (the late Steve Jobs and Tim Cook) have also successfully kept the company ahead of the innovation curve. Cook has been positioning Apple to take advantage of growth on the services side of the business for the past couple of years. Services are home to high-margin subscription revenue which will help reduce the sales lumpiness occasionally associated with physical products like the iPhone iPad and Mac.

Even now as the largest publicly traded U.S. company Apple shows no signs of slowing down.

Tractor Supply: $1.67 million

If feel-good American growth stories are more your thing you'll be interested in the nation's largest farm supplies and equipment chain. Had you bought $10000 worth of Tractor Supply (TSCO -0.25%) stock on Dec. 31 1999 you'd have almost $1.7 million now.

To partly steal a line from successful entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis the CEO of Camping World and the star of The Profit Tractor Supply is successful because of its ""people and process."" The company goes out of its way to hire employees with firsthand knowledge of what they're selling. In other words it's often farmers and ranchers selling to other farmers and ranchers. That makes each visit meaningful for the company's customers and it results in a lot of sales. Since 2000 Tractor Supply's full-year sales have grown from $759 million to an estimated $10.4 billion in 2020.

As for the process the company aims to be a one-stop shop similar to what you see at Walmart or Costco but without the 100000-square-foot locations. By having virtually every product that rural customers might need for their farms or livestock Tractor Supply has ensured that its competition isn't grabbing any low-hanging fruit.

With Tractor Supply also spending aggressively on digitization it'll soon have yet another element to build trust with rural consumers and improve its operating efficiency.

Netflix: $4.11 million

Even though it didn't make its debut as a public company until May 2002 FAANG stock member Netflix (NFLX 3.04%) is still the second best-performing stock of the century. A $10000 investment into Netflix at the closing bell on its first day of trading would be worth just over $4.1 million today.

For much of its early existence Netflix focused on the DVD-by-mail model. While mailing movies to members was profitable Netflix saw the future of content demand shifting and took action. Beginning in 2007 it began to focus on streaming content. Little did investors know at the time that this early leap of faith would pay off enormously.

In 2012 Netflix not only embraced streaming but also began investing in its own original content. House of Cards the company's first original series was a resounding success. As of the end of September 2020 Netflix had amassed 195.2 million global streaming subscribers with the company more than quadrupling its annual generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating margin since 2016.

Though I've been critical of the company's ongoing cash burn Wall Street appears perfectly content to allow Netflix to spend aggressively to acquire overseas subscribers.

Monster Beverage: $10.32 million

But if you wanted to really impress your friends and family you'd have purchased shares of Monster Beverage (MNST -1.42%) at the turn of the century. Back then the company was known as Hansen's Natural. An investment of $10000 into this Monster some 21 years ago would be worth more than $10 million today (a greater than 103000% gain).

If you're wondering how such impressive gains are possible from a beverage company you can primarily look to energy drinks for your answer. Back in the early 2000s Hansen's Natural had a very small percentage of the energy drink market. According to data from research firm T4 Monster accounted for 39% of all energy drink market share in 2020 with NOS (also owned by Monster) picking up another 3% share. This high-growth category especially with teens and young adults has been a multidecade winner.

Monster's success in the energy drink market also caught the attention of beverage giant Coca-Cola (KO 0.29%). In August 2014 Coca-Cola invested $2.15 billion into Monster equating to a 17% stake in the company. Additionally the two companies essentially swapped assets with Monster sending its non-energy drink line of products to Coke and Coca-Cola allowing Monster to take control of its energy drink products. This is how Monster came to control the NOS and Full Throttle brands.

Monster's large share of the energy-drink market continues to yield high single-digit to low double-digit annual sales growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,

On Thursday Delta Airlines reported a loss for the fourth consecutive time in the December quarter and a full-year 2020 loss for the first time in 11 years as COVID-19 travel restrictions significantly dented air travel demand but CEO Ed Bastian said he expects 2021 to be the year of recovery.

The Airline company which provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo reported a quarterly adjusted loss of $2.53​​ per share worse than the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.47​​ per share loss.

“Despite coming into the new year on the back of tough 4Q traffic numbers amidst a third pandemic wave and the prospect of 1Q somewhat bereft of catalysts we are very encouraged by mgmt’s confident tone on the conference call with a clear line of sight to the other side of the pandemic. We think this should result in a tide that will continue to rise and lift the airline stocks with it” noted Ravi Shanker equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“We believe Delta Airlines’ (DAL) strong customer loyalty/franchise corporate relationships footprint historical PRASM/margin strength balance sheet and mgmt. team leave them well-positioned amongst legacy peers to participate in the rebound with the potential for an upside surprise if international/corporate volumes/PRASM can surprise to the upside in 2H21/1H22. Long-only investors returning to the sector as traffic comes back are also likely to flock to DAL in our view which makes the technical setup attractive as well. Our 2021/2022/2023 EPS moves to -$1.42/4.33/7.52 vs. $0.91/4.80/NA prior”

Other equity analysts also recently updated their stock outlook. Credit Suisse raised the target price to $48 from $47. Stifel upped the stock price forecast to $49 from $39. JP Morgan lowered the price objective to $49 from $51.

In addition Deutsche Bank lowered shares of Delta Air Lines from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating and set a $47 target price in December. BNP Paribas began coverage and issued an “outperform” rating and a $54 price target.

Fourteen analysts who offered stock ratings for Delta Airlines in the last three months forecast the average price in 12 months at $48.83 with a high forecast of $58.00 and a low forecast of $40.00.

The average price target represents a 22.14% increase from the last price of $39.98. From those 14 equity analysts six rated “Buy” seven rated “Hold” and one rated “Sell” according to Tipranks.

Delta Airlines’ shares closed 3.59% lower at $39.98 on Friday; the stock fell over 30% in 2020. Morgan Stanley’s stock price forecast suggests a potential upside of 37.57% from the stock’s current price.

Morgan Stanley also gave a target price of $86 under a bull-case scenario and $29 under the worst-case scenario. The firm currently has an “Overweight” rating on the Airline company’s stock.

“Why Overweight? Delta Airlines (DAL) has some of the strongest customer satisfaction numbers among the other Legacy peers while also commanding a higher PRASM making it our preferred Legacy carrier. With ample liquidity we see limited liquidity risk here” Morgan Stanley’s Shanker added.

“Additionally we continue to see DAL’s international alliances and partnerships as strategic assets despite recent writedowns.”

CHINA DAILY

Kuaishou Technology has reportedly received approval from the Hong Kong stock exchange for an initial public offering of about $5 billion as the short video platform ramps up its monetization efforts amid rising competition from Douyin an app developed by Beijing ByteDance Technology.

The short video platform plans to list its shares in Hong Kong on Feb 5 Tencent News said quoting people familiar with the matter. The listing date follows after the company filed a preliminary prospectus to the Hong Kong bourse on Nov 5.

Kuaishou's IPO would be HK's biggest float since the world's largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's Asian unit raised $5.8 billion in 2019 excluding the secondary listing of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in the same year.

The company valued at $28 billion during its recent funding round in December 2019 is aiming for a valuation of $50 billion in its planned IPO according to a report from technology information website 36Kr.

ByteDance is also said to be in preliminary discussions to list Douyin in Hong Kong.

Shen Meng director of boutique investment bank Chanson& Co said more Chinese mainland investors will be able to make investments and get dividends from enterprises that are listed in Hong Kong.

Shen noted that Kuaishou has taken the lead in exploring the commercialization model for the short video industry and made breakthroughs in profitability.

According to the prospectus filed by Kuaishou Morgan Stanley Bank of America and China Renaissance Holdings are joint sponsors for the proposed IPO.

The company's total revenue increased from 8.3 billion yuan ($1.28 billion) in 2017 to 39.1 billion yuan in 2019. The figure reached 25.3 billion yuan in the first half of 2020 up 48 percent on a yearly basis.

There were 302 million daily active users and 776 million average monthly active users of the Kuaishou app and mini program in China during the first six months of last year.

Tencent has about a 21.6 percent stake in Kuaishou and other backers include venture capital firms DCMDST Global and Sequoia Capital China according to the prospectus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8va29yZWFqb29uZ2FuZ2RhaWx5LmpvaW5zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L2J1c2luZXNzL2luZHVzdHJ5L3Nob3J0Y3V0LWVsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGUtRVYvMjAyMTAxMTcxNzQ3MDA1ODEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[SHORTCUT] Is 2021 the year electric vehicles go mainstream?,"



[SHORTCUT] Is 2021 the year electric vehicles go mainstream?

A. Although EVs have been around for nearly a decade now they were never considered a serious alternative to internal combustion engine cars as the early technology and infrastructure was often inconvenient for customers. Even with subsidies offered by the government and manufacturers people weren’t convinced by the design functionality or charging time of EVs.But things will change this year. The grace period is now over and EVs are ready to enter the mainstream according to numerous experts analysts and researchers. The enthusiasm is clearly visible in the share prices of EV-related companies. Telsa for example has become the world’s most valuable automaker by holding a market capitalization of more than $800 billion compared to Volkswagen Group at $101 billion despite it selling the most cars.A. Global sales of EVs — fully-electric models hybrids and plug-in hybrids — have shown steady growth over the years.According to the Global Business Research Center sales of EVs globally stood at 3.2 million units in 2017 growing to 4 million 4.53 million and 4.55 million units over the following years. In 2021 the figure is expected to grow to 6.25 million.The report also suggests that 2021 will see the biggest growth rate in the last five years projected at 37.5 percent growth. This is a reasonably conservative estimate with Morgan Stanley projecting growth over 50 percent this year with the internal combustion engine market growing by just 2 to 5 percent.Analysts at Morgan Stanley also predict that the penetration rate of EVs will rise to 31 percent by 2030.A. Korea has been slow but is showing steady growth for sure. According to the Transport Ministry registration of EVs surpassed 3 percent for the first time last year as of October out of all registered vehicles. The figure had stood at 1.5 percent in 2017.A. The boom is so big that not only carmakers but also internet technology and electronics companies are jumping on the bandwagon.Apple was recently reported to be searching for a partner to build the so-called Apple car an electric self-driving car it apparently plans to make by 2024 at the earliest. Hyundai Motor is rumored to be linked to the deal.LG Electronics will build a $1 billion joint venture with Canada-based auto parts supplier Magna to manufacture EV parts. LG Electronics has never been involved in the auto industry having specialized in smartphones televisions and home appliances.Legacy carmakers are taking a radical approach as well laying out a long-term plan to eventually ditch their diesel engines if not all internal combustion engines. Hyundai Motor Group stopped developing diesel engines in 2020 and is planning to stop launching internal combustion engine-powered vehicles from 2030.Volkswagen will stop developing all internal combustion engines after 2026 which is expected to put an end to sales by 2040. Volvo stopped manufacturing diesel engines from 2020 and is replacing its internal combustion engines with hybrid ones.General Motors which has more than a century's history of manufacturing internal combustion engine vehicles recently changed its logo to emphasize the brand’s shift toward EVs. It also pledged to invest $27 billion in its electric and self-driving car businesses which includes a plan to release 30 EVs by 2025.A. Globally there are more than a dozen new EVs expected to hit the streets this year widening consumers’ options from sedans to SUVs high performance cars and even pick-up trucks. Cars at every price point from value-for-money options to more luxurious ones will be made available as all-electric EVs too.A completely new lineup includes Nissan’s first all-electric SUV Ariya Volkwagen’s ID.4 SUV BMW’s iX SUV and Hyundai Motor’s Ioniq 5 among others. All of these models are or will be produced on each carmaker's EV-dedicated platform. Tesla will also launch the Model S Plaid which could be seen as a high-performance version of the popular Model S sedan.Electric variants of existing models are just as exciting. Mercedes-Benz’s EQS luxury sedan and EQA compact SUV are expected this year. Pick-up trucks are on the way as well — GMC’s gigantic and iconic Hummer will have its first electric version later this year.A. Until now most EVs have been manufactured on platforms designed for internal combustion engines which means the vehicle had to then be redesigned to fit a battery and an electric motor. Squeezing in these elements in the wrong place did not bring out the best results leading to a limit in range and performance not to mention cost.To more efficiently manufacture EVs carmakers are quickly creating new modular platforms designed specifically to produce EVs. Volkswagen Group’s MEB Toyota’s TNGA Renault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance’s CMF-EV General Motors’ Ultium and Hyundai Motor’s E-GMP are a few examples.With the modular platform carmakers can reduce costs and manufacturing time while having more leeway in design and functionality. It means the range will get longer with quicker charging time while the performance gets better. It is expected to be safer as well with a specially designed space for the battery potentially negating possible fire risks.A. It is hard to specify exactly when EVs will become the king of the road pushing aside the long-reigning internal combustion engines.There are still arguments on whether internal combustion engines especially petrol ones will ever be obsolete. The push toward carbon neutrality with governments around the world banning sales of internal combustion engines by as early as 2025 will help accelerate the shift but not all countries are joining the move.One thing that is for sure is that pricing will factor in immensely in purchase decisions for customers. With government subsidies on EV purchases gradually shrinking the premium cost of EVs will have to disappear to increase general appeal. If they become cheaper than diesel or petrol cars that’s even better.But pricing doesn't just depend on the production cost of the car. The whole value chain of an EV will have to get more cost effective which is part of the reason that reusing EV batteries in other industries has become a coveted business at the moment.BY JIN EUN-SOO [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]"

A marathon board meeting of HT Media on November 27 last year which began at 2.30 pm and went on for six hours discussed threadbare among other things the final share purchase agreement it signed on November 9 with VCCircle’s promoter the Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp.

The HT Media board was in an unusual quandary. Revenues had nosedived during the first six months of 2020-21 and net loss had ballooned beyond its grasp. The group sacked several employees to cut costs since the start of the current financial year and the last round of layoffs took place on Friday January 15 2021. While seven employees of Mint were given pink slips many more from HT were believed to have received marching orders.

Apart from the ongoing scheme of amalgamation between six group companies HT Media also had to deal with an unpleasant whistleblower complaint from an employee of its radio business in the form of a nasty letter to the management on the employee’s last working day in August last year. He had alleged serious anomalies and deficiencies in the financial reporting processes of the company’s radio broadcast business.

The board was worried over the deepening financial woes during the pandemic. The management said it had been continuously evaluating the impact of Covid and had performed a sensitivity analysis based on current estimates in assessing the recoverability of financial and non-financial assets. Given the uncertainties the management has been undertaking a continuous impact assessment.

Between July and September it performed an impairment assessment of investment in subsidiaries too and recognised an impairment loss of Rs 17.6 crore against its investments in HT Overseas. It subsequently invested Rs 2.99 crore in its equity.

Meanwhile the proposed merger of six group companies – Firefly e-Ventures HT Digital Media Holdings HT Education HT Learning Centers India Education Services and Topmovies Entertainment – into HT Mobile Solutions was taking longer than anticipated.

The deal with Mosaic Media Ventures which was announced on June 29 2020 was supposed to have closed by August end. The deal – a distress sale by all means – now threatens to jack up HT Media’s employee costs even if it is downsized further. The company’s plan was to “unlock cost and revenue synergies” through the acquisition. But the merger has clearly put an additional burden on HT Media and is laying off its staff.

Will the quid pro quo pay off?

Post-merger VCCircle

The merger has been anything but smooth.

Soon after the final merger announcement on December 2 there was a flurry of exits. Over a quarter of VCCircle’s 125-odd staff who moved to HT Media has already stepped out in less than 45 days or been in the process. Among those who called it quits are the editor chief human resources officer sales head marketing head design head legal head and chief financial officer.

The chief executive officer Jaideep Mehta and chief business officer Shalil Gupta who Mehta inducted from his previous organisation IDC have stayed put. An old hand at TechCircle Snigdha Sengupta is now acting as the editor.

A person who was part of the transition process told Newslaundry that HT Media is probably in a hurry to help the acquired company achieve breakeven and possibly show some token profit in the first year itself.

“HT is trying every available trick in the book – including cost-cutting and pay rationalisation – to make the acquisition work” he said. “They have initiated salary restructuring starting from the top with a promise to shift the fixed pay to variable. For the staff they have already initiated a 15-20 percent salary cut. The company is removing the duplication of work layers wherever they exist.”

He added: “In fact most of the leadership folks were pushed out even before the deal was sealed on paper.”

HT Media has shut down VCCircle’s offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru and given its editorial staff the freedom to work from home. In Delhi VCCircle has locked itself into a three-year lease agreement and the third year has just begun. So some of the staff work from the office while the majority work from home.

“There are indications that when they want to get back to the old format they will offer coworking space in Gurugram and Noida where most of the staff live” said another source in HT Group.

VCCircle’s staff’s December salaries came via HT Media. “The News Corp money that was lying in the account has been adjusted and incorporated in the deal” said the source. “News Corp was lending money for almost a year as advance for payments as they couldn’t infuse money into equity anymore.”

Ever since News Corp took over the company in March 2015 it had continued to bring in funds year after year. It infused Rs 68.9 crore over four years until June 2019 over and above the deal value of Rs 20 crore ($3.12 million at Rs 63 per dollar at the time).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS90b3JvbnRvL29udGFyaW8tc21hbGwtYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3VwcG9ydC1wcm9ncmFtLTEuNTg3NTQ5MdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS41ODc1NDkx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Small businesses included in lockdown measures now eligible for up to $20k in emergency funding,"Small businesses that have been required to close or restrict their services can now apply for one-time funding worth between $10000 and $20000.

Ontario opened applications for its new Small Business Support Grant on Friday as a measure to help businesses affected by province-wide shutdown that started on Dec. 26.

The provincial government has since heightened its COVID-19 measures by issuing a stay-at-home order that went into effect Thursday.

To qualify for the emergency funding a business must:

Have been required to close or restrict services starting Dec. 26.

Have fewer than 100 employees.

Have experienced a 20 per cent or greater decrease in revenue in April 2020 compared to April 2019 (businesses started after April 2019 can choose a different month for the comparison).

You can apply for the program here.

Eligible businesses will receive a minimum of $10000 and a maximum of $20000 though it is not clear how the province will determine exact dollar figures.

The owners of eligible businesses can ""use this funding in whatever way makes the most sense for their individual business needs"" said the province in a news release listing employee wages or rent as possible uses.

Program could provide relief but not for all

Billy Dertilis chair of Danforth Mosaic BIA and the owner of Red Rocket Coffee said the program provides business owners with ""a sense of relief.""

Dertilis expects to qualify for the funding since he shut down his business entirely in April 2020.

His coffee shop is now permitted to stay open under the latest restrictions but he noted that sales remain down and noted that other businesses in his area have seen sharper drops in revenue.

""I was relieved but skeptical"" said Caroline Starr owner of The Healing Collective a mental health therapy operation. ""Because it's been quite a long time through the pandemic without any sort of relief from the province.""

Toronto business owner Caroline Starr says she was disappointed to learn the program may not capture all businesses that have been affected by the pandemic. (CBC)

Starr said the program may not account for the nuances of what she calls the ""slow bleed"" that has plagued businesses during the pandemic. She said pegging eligibility to revenue figures from April 2020 may not account for businesses that have had to repeatedly start and stop while adjusting to evolving restrictions.

In a tweet Dan Kelly president and CEO of the Canadian Federation for Independent Business expressed similar concerns including ""gaps"" in the program that may leave out businesses that were locked down earlier in the pandemic.

However Kelly praised the overall program and called on the federal government to expand on the concept.

Ontario's new Small Business Support Grant is now open. It is a solid program & has been well-designed especially as it includes new (2020) businesses. CFIB has identified some early gaps including support for those locked down earlier in the pandemic.<a href=""https://t.co/MpJrLa5IGA"">https://t.co/MpJrLa5IGA</a> —@CFIB

STARTING a business can be among the most challenging of things one can undertake especially given the attendant unforeseen ups and downs of running an enterprise.

Talent Sigudu’s source of inspiration came from a quest for independence.

The search for independence was driven by a wish to delink herself from dependence on paid employment. She wanted to do more with her life.

A chance conversation with a friend as she searched for meaning in her life led her to marketing.

Then one day a friend introduced her to tupperware. She was sceptical at first but the bottom line is that she got orders. That opened her eyes and expanded her horizon.

It seems that was the trigger in realising the missing puzzle in the mosaic to recalibrate and define her entrepreneurial pathway.

Interestingly during the chance meeting with the friend Sigudu had been encouraged to try her hand at and venture into perfumes. Months later she was on her way to making perfumes.

“For years I never saw myself as someone who could successfully sell anything” she explained earlier this week.

She realised then as Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin Group observes that opportunities are like buses — if one missed the first there is always going to be another coming.

Twenty-eight-year-old Sigudu’s bold step to independence was in the recent launch of her own perfume range.

“I have always been an independent person. I have a long way to go in terms of marketing introducing a wider range of new products but all I can say is I am enjoying the ride with all the ups and downs.

“I am loving the fulfilment that comes with it.”

While she had doubts about her ability with commodity broking this uneasiness led her to explore options of some opportunities that she could claim as her own.

It was then that it occurred to her that almost everybody uses perfumes. This realisation strengthened her belief in venturing into perfumes.

Growing up she had always wanted to be a teacher. That is because her mother Mrs Violet Sigudu was a teacher but with time and education there was fascination with becoming a chartered accountant.

“I had no prior knowledge whatsoever in the perfume-making business. I believe God sent me angels in the form of friends who mentored me inspired me and helped me make the business a success.

“Making perfumes for me is a story of a young woman who is desperate for independence and empowerment a young woman who is not scared of trying new things a young woman who wants to make a name for herself” she explained.

It must be awfully harder to come up with a brand in a market dominated by big and established players backed by product research and development capacities.

“I wanted a catchy name something that will make a passer-by take a second glance. At some stage this meant changing names in order to avoid creating confusion among consumers or blurring the lines between my brand of perfumes and products by other players in the same industry” she explained.

Welcome to Nicie Fragrances! So named in order to constantly remind her and those around her of the human capacity quest and spirit for soaring to even greater heights.

Simply put she says it is: “Young woman rise up empower yourself no matter how small you start or end rise up and do something that says this is you.”

The current global Covid-19 pandemic has led many to rethink their marketing strategies.

For Sigudu this has meant that the new normal means a departure from the traditional marketing approach that places emphasis on physical face-to-face contact. Her approach preferences various online platforms as well as networks of the social friends and family contacts.

Wary of competition and skirting around being specific Sigudu says she always uses the best of ingredients in creating her brand of fragrances.

Adding to the perfumes shortly will be hand lotions with prospects of venturing into body washes and natural soaps.

The girl from Chivhu who grew up in Warren Park Harare says her father Mr Nicholas Sigudu has been a major influence in her life.

“I cannot afford to disappoint him. He is a hard worker kind and loving I have an obligation to make him proud.”

Reflecting on her short journey what counsel does she have for someone at the crossroads?

“My message to young girls and women out there is to own our worlds our scars and take charge of our lives. Let us work hard to leave legacies for our children and inspire young girls who look up to us.

“Most importantly we must be young women who fix each other’s crowns. Let us support each other. An independent woman is at less risk of being abused. Let us take charge our lives know our rights and never settle for less” she concluded.",,,,,,

Ad-tech stocks have been one of Wall Street’s favorites in 2020. Amid fears of an economic recession and the volatility of the stock market as a result ad-tech companies are somehow enjoying the ride. For instance The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) has been one of the big winners on the stock market in the past year. Shares of the cloud-based ad-tech company tripled in 2020. The strong gains came as the company benefited from the opportunity in the Connected TV (CTV) space. And investors know that of course. However Trade Desk isn’t the only ad-tech stock that skyrocketed in the past year. Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) the streaming device maker is also getting tailwinds from CTV after acquiring Dataxu. However after such a massive run in its stock price one may be wary about buying the stock.

Fret not chasing the high price tag of these top ad-tech stocks need not be the only game in town. Magnite (NASDAQ: MGNI) the world’s largest independent sell-side ad-tech platform may be one of the best stocks to buy now if you are bullish on the ad-tech space. For starters the company was created from the merger of Rubicon Project and Telaria which closed in early 2020.

Since the company’s formation it has created a leading supply-side platform (SSP) for advertisers. Like The Trade Desk the company is also expecting strong CTV growth as cord-cutting is taking place at an unprecedented pace. More importantly its targeted advertising business is booming.

Improving Financials Makes A Bullish Case For MGNI Stock

From the company’s most recent quarter the company raked in $60.98 million in revenue. For the most part it saw a 51% rise in connected TV revenue year-over-year. The reason for this could lie behind the massive rise in internet video streaming content this year. In turn it creates a scenario whereby content producers could be relying on Magnite more to monetize their content. Ultimately this sets up the stage for Magnite in a world dominated by streaming services.

Magnite expects its fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of $72 million to $75 million. That represents a growth of between 18% and 23% quarter-on-quarter. The company also expects adjusted EBITDA margin to reach approximately 30%. That’s a sizable jump from the 23% figure it achieved in Q3 2020. Analysts are expecting Magnite’s revenue to rise by 37% this year. They also expect the company to generate non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.01 this year. The company could be on track to record more sustainable earnings going forward.

Ad-tech is not exactly something that is visible. What the company does is mostly behind the scenes. So I don’t blame you if you’ve not come across the company. But that doesn’t mean it has no potential. In fact the company has built strong relationships with digital publishers giving them access to tap on several channels from a single platform. For instance in early December 2020 the company announced a collaboration with Crackle Plus a Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (NASDAQ: CSSE) company and the operator of streaming services Crackle and Popcornflix. Crackle Plus is leveraging Magnite’s platform to better understand the bidding and buying behavior of ad buyers.

Strong Analysts Ratings On MGNI Stock

The ad-tech company got votes of confidence from stock analysts prompting greater interest in the stock. Earlier this week there was a bullish commentary from Susquehanna analyst Shyam Patil. He believes it is one of the companies that is well-positioned to thrive in the CTV space. The surge in stock price on Thursday has also exceeded Needham analyst Laura Martin’s price target of $30. Martin compared Magnite to its equivalent on the other side of the programmatic advertising space demand-side platform The Trade Desk.

She expects Magnite to “successfully execute the same game-plan TTD implemented in 2020” which was based on setting the company apart from other competitors “as a provider of full-service digital ad products backed by independence.” Magnite is a “one-stop-shop” which offers it a “unique competitive advantage.”

Some may also believe that the run-up in MGNI stock price could also be due to a short squeeze. But that may be unlikely. Data from Nasdaq shows that short interest in the stock has been declining recently. In addition the level of short interest is relatively low. Thus a short squeeze may not be the reason behind the increase in MGNI stock price. Earlier this week Magnite made an appearance at the Needham Growth Conference. CEO Michael Barrett said that the company will show growth in the first two quarters of 2021 from the same quarters in 2020.

Bottom Line For MGNI Stock

There’s no question that Magnite’s success was attributed to the CTV segment’s acceleration by cord-cutters. Sure the company has attracted many investors’ attention over the past year and many are starting to question if the stock has more room to run. It certainly looks to be in the right place with the rise in the programmatic advertising market. Nevertheless competition is present in the space with rivals such as PubMatic (NASDAQ: PUBM) which went public not long ago. Perhaps the jury is still out on whether MGNI stock can be a multibagger stock in the long run. But as long as current growth rates persist patient investors could be in for a reward.

Accolade is buying 2nd.MD which helps patients get second opinions from specialists for up to $460 million. Read more

Shares in Accolade Inc. rose nearly 10% Friday on news that the company agreed to pay $360 million for 2nd.MD a Houston company that will extend Accolade’s health-care navigation services into second opinions by specialists online.

The price could rise to $460 million if revenue targets are met Accolade said. The deal was announced Thursday and is expected to close by the end of next month.

“This acquisition of 2nd.MD is for us a very natural extension of what we do into an area that’s really important which is helping a person get the world’s best specialists for their own acute situation” said Steve Barnes chief financial officer of Accolade which has dual headquarters in Plymouth Meeting and Seattle.

Accolade which went public in July for $22 a share is paying for privately held 2nd.MD with $230 million in cash raised from selling shares last summer and fall and additional stock. Founded in the Philadelphia region in 2007 Accolade’s stock market value is $2.9 billion. Its shares closed Friday at $52.35 up $4.59 or 9.6% on Nasdaq.

Accolade helps employees of big companies navigate the health-care maze. The firm’s top four customers are American Airlines Comcast Cable Lowe’s and State Farm according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last summer.

The acquisition of 2nd.MD for more than 10 times its 2020 revenue of $35 million fits with a flood of money into telemedicine and digital health. Teledoc paid $18.5 billion for Livongo Health which provides remote monitoring for diabetes and other remote services even though Livongo had just $160.7 million in revenue in its final six months as a public company.

Separately Thomas Jefferson University chief executive Stephen K. Klasko is part of a group including Livongo’s founders that raised $525 million last fall to make acquisitions that will enable “the digital transformation of care bringing disruptive innovation to the healthcare system through technology” an SEC filing said.

“The market is looking for the next big thing” Barnes said. “The valuations that are being applied are recognizing that the market’s changing dramatically. Just like you might see in other industries like cars or electric cars or things like that large industries getting disrupted by technology often command higher valuations.”

Like Accolade large employers hire 2nd.MD and pay a per-member-per-month fee for the company’s services. 2nd.MD says its has more than 900 specialists across 120 specialties who review cases and make recommendations saving the employer an average of more than $5000 per consultation — a number that rises to $27000 when surgery is involved.

2nd.MD has more than 300 customers including some health plans and more than 7 million members. Accolade has about 100 customers and more than 2 million members. In the nine months ended Nov. 30 Accolade had a net loss of $46 million on $111 million in revenue.

What attracted Accolade to 2nd.MD was its reliance not only on technology but also on human interaction through a video consultation within three to four days Accolade’s Seattle-based chief executive Rajeev Singh told analysts on a conference call Thursday. “That is substantively different than the rest of the industry” where two- or three-week turnaround times and written reports are standard Singh said.

Matthew Gillmor who covers health care information technology investments for Baird said Accolade’s acquisition of 2nd.MD “makes perfect sense both strategically and financially.” He wrote in a note to clients that 2nd.MD complements Accolades current services expands its market reach and offers cross-selling opportunities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2lsbC1yaXNpbmctcmF0ZXMtY2hhbmdlLXRoZS1ib25kLW1hcmtldC1jbGltYXRlLTIwMjEtMDEtMTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will rising rates change the bond market climate?,"By Mark Hackett

Interest rates were on the rise last week with the 10-year Treasury yield topping 1.0% for the first time since last March closing at 1.13% on Friday January 8. One week into 2021 the benchmark bond yield is up 0.21% since the start of the year. This jump poses a frustrating challenge to an already difficult environment to generate yield as investors struggle with allocation decisions.

Over much of the past 40 years interest rates have been in secular decline with the 10-year yield falling from a high of 15.8% in September 1981 to a low of 0.5% last March. As a result bond funds have seen a continual tailwind of price appreciation to boost returns well above the return from interest payments. This has been particularly true over the past two years where price return contributed 4.0% and 5.5% respectively to the total annual return of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.

Rising interest rates would act as an impediment for future bond returns. As we saw in 2018 the 2.9% generated from income that year was offset by a 2.9% decline in the price of the Index. That resulted in a flat return in a year that saw the 10-year Treasury yield rise from 2.43% to 2.68% after touching 3.2% in November. With a duration of 6.2 years for the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index a 1% rise in the level of interest rates across the curve would result in a 6% decline in portfolio value. With a current yield of just 1.2% there is little income buffer to protect against rising rates. Given the influx of flows into bond funds in recent years investors may not be prepared for potential capital losses in their bond holdings.

As the name infers web hosting services companies own these servers networks and other related services to host sites.

Netflix's new French series ""Lupin"" debuted last week to critical acclaim and now it's one of Netflix's most popular titles.

But it couldn't beat Shonda Rhimes' first Netflix series ""Bridgerton"" or the ""Karate Kid"" sequel series ""Cobra Kai"" which recently debuted its first true Netflix original season.

Every week the streaming search engine Reelgood compiles for Business Insider a list of which TV shows have been most prominent on Netflix's daily top 10 lists of its most popular titles that week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL25ldGZsaXhzLWNyYXNoLWxhbmRpbmctb24teW91LXdpbGwtdGFrZS15b3VyLWJyZWF0aC1hd2F50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix's 'Crash Landing on You' Will Take Your Breath Away,"Panning opening scenes of South Korean high-rises and spaghetti highways to the lush hills of North Korea Crash Landing on You’s cinematography draws the viewer in before a human character appears.

The South Korean drama released last year on Netflix was a cultural phenomenon in its home country becoming the second-highest-rated cable drama in South Korea with a nationwide average viewership of 21.7 percent—translating to 6.3 million views according to Nielsen Korea. It was only beaten by 2018’s TV series SKY Castle.

Crash Landing on You follows a wealthy South Korean woman who ends up in the demilitarized zone between North Korea and South Korea after being carried over the border by a tornado while paragliding. Yoon Se-ri (played by Son Ye-jin) owns her own fashion brand and is also a chaebol heiress. She disappears a day after her father chooses her to be his successor taking over a sprawling business empire. With Se-ri presumed dead her incompetent brothers and their wives climb over each other for the chairmanship.

Across the border in North Korea another drama is unfolding: Se-ri is discovered by Captain Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin). The captain hides her with the help of his subordinates whose inattention at their border posting resulted in her escape further into the country. While trying to avoid the attention of a corrupt officer and curious neighbors Se-ri has to learn to survive in reduced circumstances and without the luxuries to which she is accustomed. North Korea’s authoritarian regime is presented in the slogans on buildings and street poles. Electricity is infrequent and the villagers use coupons to buy food. While the contrasting realities of North and South are presented the commonalities of both countries are shown. In the absence of leadership North Korea is seen as a place where communities like the village women who befriend Se-ri must help each other and look out for one another. The portrayal of the country was handled delicately and deftly by the producers who chose to highlight the humanity of its citizens and the day-to-day living of an imagined North Korea.

As with most Korean dramas the two main characters initially repel each other before recognizing their shared love. The more the viewer learns about the couple’s lives the more we realize they are well-suited. Captain Ri we discover has his own complicated family history hailing from a military-elite family whose position would be threatened if Se-ri’s presence and identity is known. After his brother died in suspicious circumstances Captain Ri abandoned his dream of becoming a world-renowned pianist leaving Switzerland and returning to North Korea to serve in the military. He is also engaged to be married to Seo Dan (Seo Ji-hy) a department store heiress. Theirs is an arranged marriage and with the appearance of Se-ri tension and conflict arise in the love triangle. Another subplot involves Gu Seung-jun (Kim Jung-hyun) a con artist who escapes to North Korea after swindling Se-ri’s brother. We learn that he once dated Se-ri and later falls for Seo Dan complicating matters considerably.

Crash Landing on You’s popularity is owed largely to the chemistry between its two striking leads Son Ye-jin and Hyun Bin whose sweeping romance is communicated via a medley of longing looks and very light friction (in many ways it’s a foil to the randy Bridgerton). Son Ye-jin’s nimbleness toggling from carefree and comedic to serious and anguished is perfectly matched by Hyun Bin’s captivating portrait of the emotionally-repressed soldier who will risk life and family to save the woman he cherishes.

Netflix

Fans of the show who had shipped the actors for months were pleased to learn that on Jan. 1 the couple confirmed they are in a real-life relationship. (They’d previously starred together in the 2018 drama The Negotiation). And Son Ye-jin one of the shining stars of the so-called Korean Wave (or Hallyu) is on the cusp of crossing over into Hollywood with a feature role opposite Sam Worthington in the upcoming sci-fi film The Cross helmed by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca).

The expansive show comprised of 16 hour-long episodes is rounded out by a strong cast of supporting characters from the colorful soldiers under Captain Ri’s command to the selfish brothers and the village women to sinister military leaders and a rogue wiretapper. There’s also a rather clever metanarrative involving a soldier who loses himself in South Korean dramas. While Crash Landing on You has provided a much-needed respite for KDrama fans during lockdown it hasn’t caught on so much stateside. Which is a shame because once you get lost in the saga of Yoon Se-ri and Captain Ri it’s almost impossible to stop.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vc2luZy1vbi1vdGhlci1iZXN0LW5ldGZsaXgtZ2FtZS1zaG93cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sing On!

It’ll be helmed by Tom Harper who directed Felicity Jones in the hot air balloon adventure “The Aernoauts” as well as Jessie Buckley in the indie country musical “Wild Rose.” Greg Rucka and Allison Schroeder will write the script. Pre-production has just started hence the silence on any further details.

Netflix acquired the feature “Heart of Stone” from Skydance Media. This marks the second acquisition of a Skydance title with their already completed feature “The Tomorrow War” heading over to Amazon. This marks the fourth feature Skydance and Netflix have teamed up on. Other features include the Charlize Theron action flick “The Old Guard” Ryan Reynolds’ “6 Underground” and the upcoming Shawn Levy-directed film “The Adam Project.”

Gadot herself has been in the headlines of late. Despite the mixed critical reception to “Wonder Woman 1984” which became the first major blockbuster to do a day-and-date release between theaters and streaming Warner Bros. has put the fast-track on a third feature to re-team Gadot with director Patty Jenkins. Theatrically the film exceeded early box-office projections as the top post-pandemic domestic opening weekend for a feature in 2020 according to WB.

“As fans around the world continue to embrace Diana Prince driving the strong opening weekend performance of ‘Wonder Woman 1984’ we are excited to be able continue her story with our real life Wonder Women — Gal and Patty — who will return to conclude the long-planned theatrical trilogy” said Toby Emmerich Chairman Warner Bros. Pictures Group in a statement shared with press. A Warner Bros. representative confirmed the news individually to IndieWire.

“Wonder Woman 1984” had taken in $141.7 million internationally as of January 17 but with steep drops in domestic grosses each subsequent weekend of release. HBO Max has yet to release any viewership data though WarnerMedia’s statement did credit the movie’s performance in greenlighting the next feature. “Wonder Woman 1984” will leave the streamer January 24 and will only be available to see in theaters thereafter. (The film is expected to return to HBO Max after a few months.)

Gadot also was vocal about her experiences with director Joss Whedon on the set of “Justice League.” Whedon and other members of Warners were accused by actor Ray Fisher of unprofessional and racist conduct. In an interview with Variety Gadot said she provided testimony during the recently wrapped investigation though isn’t aware of if “remedial action” as announced by WarnerMedia was taken. Findings from the probe were not disclosed though earlier in the summer Fisher said the filmmakers grossly abused their power."

James Murdoch the youngest son of Rupert Murdoch has publicly attacked ""media property owners"" and news outlets for their role in promoting false election claims that helped lead to the deadly riots in the US Capitol last week.

In an interview with the Financial Times published on Friday Murdoch said that the Capitol siege which resulted in five deaths is ""proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very very much so.""

""Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years"" the youngest Murdoch said according to the FT. ""I hope that those people who didn't think it was that dangerous now understand and that they stop.""

Murdoch did not mention any news outlets specifically although Fox News — the company owned by his father and eldest brother Lachlan — has previously been criticized for peddling baseless claims of voter fraud following the 2020 election which was first made by President Trump.

His comments are the strongest rebuke of the industry since he decided to break from the family media empire last year.

Murdoch announced his resignation from the board of directors of News Corp in July. The multinational media company owns several US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.

In a statement at the time Murdoch said he chose to leave ""due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""

According to several news reports James and his wife Kathryn were frustrated ""with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage"" on climate change as wildfires ripped through most of Australia last year.

The youngest Murdoch son has since turned his attention to his foundation called Quadrivium which according to its website aims to promote initiatives related to democracy voter participation and climate change among others.

In a separate statement that was published after the FT interview Murdoch and his wife wrote: ""Spreading disinformation — whether about the election public health or climate change — has real-world consequences.""

""Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies. We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever"" they added according to CNN Business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTE1NDUzMS9KYW1lcy1NdXJkb2NoLXNheXMtcmVja29uaW5nLW1lZGlhLUNhcGl0b2wtcmlvdHMuaHRtbNIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTE1NDUzMS9hbXAvSmFtZXMtTXVyZG9jaC1zYXlzLXJlY2tvbmluZy1tZWRpYS1DYXBpdG9sLXJpb3RzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Murdoch says there will be a 'reckoning' for the media after Capitol riots,"James Murdoch claimed on Friday that U.S. news outlets will be faced with a 'reckoning' after last week's deadly pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol.

In an interview with the Financial Times the 48-year-old blamed 'media property owners' for unleashing 'insidious and uncontrollable forces' with their support of disinformation about the 2020 election.

James the youngest son of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch also claimed that media groups fueled the riot by leading 'a substantial portion' of the public to believe 'a falsehood' about the election.

'The damage is profound' James said in Friday's interview as he criticized media groups coverage of election fraud.

'The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very very much so. Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.'

He did not explicitly mention Fox News whose board includes his father as chairman and older brother Lachlan as CEO yet was clearly focused on the right-wing cable network that has been criticized for its coverage of President Trump's election fraud claims.

A new opinion program at 7 p.m. will also replace the news-focused show 'The Story.' Advertisement

James quit his father's media company News Corp. last summer saying that he was 'increasingly uncomfortable' with News Corp and Fox 'legitimizing disinformation'.

He made the decision to leave after a 24-year career with the company which saw him with work alongside his father to build Newscorp's empire and climb to the role of CEO of 21st Century Fox.

In 2019 he received $2billion in a deal with Walt Disney for 21st Century Fox ending his time at the helm but he still remained on News Corp.'s board.

James had previously been viewed as heir apparant to Rupert after Lachlan resigned from his executive positions at News Corp. in July 2005.

Yet Lachlan became the golden child once more on his return and was promoted over his younger brother by their father.

His attack Friday came as his father flew back to New York to shake up the network as Fox's rating plummeted in the first two weeks of the year.

Conservatives remained loyal to Fox News throughout Trump's presidency angered at the coverage on CNN and MSNBC over Trump's first impeachment and the probe into Russian collusion.

Fox's emerging rivals Newsmax and OAN have continued to falsely claim Trump won the election if it were not for fraud even as Murdoch's outlets have called on the president to accept defeat.

'I hope that those people who didn't think it was that dangerous now understand and that they stop' James added in the Times interview yet claimed he had not 'seen any evidence of that yet'.

James and his wife Kathryn Hufschmid issued a further statement following the interview in which they accused 'media property owners' of chosing to spread 'lies'.

'Spreading disinformation — whether about the election public health or climate change — has real world consequences' the statement read.

'Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies.

'We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever' it concluded.

In his resignation letter James cited 'disagreements over certain editorial content'

James formerly served as the chief executive of 21st Century Fox from 2015 to 2019.

He is known as the more liberal Murdoch brother while older brother Lachlan's views seem to be more aligned with those of his conservative father.

James Murdoch quit his father's media empire because it was 'legitimizing disinformation' In July 2020 James Murdoch handed in his resignation letter for his final board position within News Corp. James' letter 'disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company's news outlets'. The 48-year-old told the New York Times that he 'pulled the rip cord' because he was 'increasingly uncomfortable' with News Corp and Fox 'legitimizing disinformation' and denying climate change. Murdoch told the Times it was 'not that hard a decision' to stand down from News Corp because of major disagreements with his father and brother Lachlan over the running of the business. He had voiced criticism about Fox the previous year. Yet prior to this James had been in line to take over his father's empire battling it out with brother Lachlan He was leapfrogged for promotion by Lachlan despite staying loyal to his father Advertisement

James split from the company in a dramatic exit in July 2020 when he left the News Corps. board completely citing in a letter 'disagreements over certain editorial content'.

A spokesperson for him and his wife also told the Daily Beast in January 2020 - before his split from the empire - that the couple disagreed 'with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage' on climate change.

The comments were made as wildfires ripped through Murdoch's native Australia.

'Kathryn and James's views on climate are well established and their frustration with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage of the topic is also well known.

'They are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia given obvious evidence to the contrary' their statement read.

The 'denials' were in reference to allegations arsonists and not climate change were to blame for the destructive wildfires.

At the time his comments were perceived as 'unprecedented' and sparked speculation of a feud within the family since he rarely spoke publicly about his role in the business.

He also told the New Yorker in 2019: 'There are views I really disagree with on Fox.'

Despite his family's conservative-leaning media outlets James and his wife have recently made significant donations to Democrats including former presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg and President-elect Joe Biden.

He along with Rupert Murdoch’s five other children received up to $2billion in 2019 from the break-up of the family’s media empire and the sale of its entertainment businesses to Walt Disney.

Yet the merger left him out of work and appeared to cause friction between father and son.

'There are periods of time when we do not' James told the New Yorker of speaking with his former boss after the deal.

THE MURDOCH FAMILY MEDIA EMPIRE RUPERT MURDOCH EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF NEWS CORP The Australian-born mogul began building his media empire in Australia by acquiring numerous publications in the 1950s before entering the British newspaper market in 1969 and expanding to the US in 1974. He founded News Corporation in 1980 which quickly evolved into one of the largest media groups in the world owning assets in print news and television. In 2013 News Corporation split into two sister companies News Corp and 21st Century Fox. The latter was later rebranded as Fox Corporation after the majority of its assets were sold to The Walt Disney Company in 2019. Murdoch currently serves as the executive chairman of News Corp and the chairman of Fox Corporation. He is estimated to be worth $17billion. LACHLAN MURDOCH EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF FOX CORPORATION CO-CHAIR OF NEWS CORP Lachlan Murdoch 49 the eldest of the Murdoch sons is the heir apparent to News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert and is co-chairman of News Corp. He was named executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corp in 2019 after 21st Century Fox was sold to Disney. Before the sale younger brother James had been the CEO of the company and Lachlan was executive chairman. Lachlan is also chairman of Australian entertainment company NOVA Entertainment which operates a number of radio stations across the country. JAMES MURDOCH FORMER BOARD MEMBER OF NEWS CORP The younger son of Rupert Murdoch James 48 had been on the board of News Corp since 2013. He and brother Lachlan had shared power at 21st Century Fox but the sale of much of the Fox entertainment business to Disney in 2019 saw James depart as CEO. Since then he has worked at the helm of investment fund Lupa Systems. James is considered more liberal than his older brother who is CEO of Fox Corp home to conservative news network Fox News the Fox broadcast and sports networks and local TV stations. James has been critical of News Corp's editorial decisions and has said he disagreed with Fox News coverage. He resigned from the board on July 31 2020. PRUDENCE MURDOCH NON-EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBER OF NEWS CORP Prudence Murdoch 63 is the eldest child of Rupert Murdoch through his first marriage with Patricia Booker. She formerly worked as journalist for now-defunct British tabloid News of the World which was owned by her father. Prudence was once described in the media as the 'only one of [Murdoch's] children not directly competing for his business affections.' ELISABETH MURDOCH MEDIA EXECUTIVE AND FORMER CHAIRPERSON OF SHINE GROUP Elisabeth is Rupert Murdoch's daughter from his second marriage with Anna Maria Torv. Born in Sydney she moved to London in 1990s where she worked on the operations side of BSkyB run by her father. She founded UK-based TV programming company Shine Limited in 2001 which was sold to News Corp ten years later. She currently serves as executive chairman of production company Sister. GRACE AND CHLOE MURDOCH The sisters aged 20 and 18 are Rupert's daughters from his third marriage to Wendi Deng. Advertisement

In 2019 James was reportedly looking to set up a $1billion new project including a liberal news outlet in stark contrast to his father's Fox News.

In March 2020 it was further suggested he pumped money into start-ups looking to combat fake news.

His firm Lupa Systems was said to have teamed up with Betaworks to create a 'more sustainable news ecosystem'.

Rupert designed his companies to benefit his family making certain that he and his children always had control meaning that his children and generations to follow would be taken care of financially.

One thing Murdoch has not left his children with however is a plan for the future of his media empire refusing to officially name an heir despite making no secret of his preferred child.

It is not his oldest child Prudence or the next in line Elisabeth who has found incredible success outside the family business in emerging media markets.

It is not James the son who has stood by his side for decades and weathered the fallout from the 2011 hacking scandal at News of the World and the 2016 sexual assault scandal at Fox News.

It is Lachlan Murdoch's older son who is the 'golden child' according to multiple sources.

The family company and its future were the focus of a New York Times piece in 2019 that provided an in depth look at the mogul's two sons while completely ignoring the lives and accomplishments of his four daughters.

By some accounts Murdoch's heirs are now battling behind the scenes for control of the empire with the two top contenders at the time appearing to be his sons James and Lachlan before James' split.

The brothers have had a tumultuous relationship over the years which had become more frayed than ever of recent after Lachlan was promoted over his younger brother by their father despite James' loyalty to the family company.

The media mogul is the father of six children who range in age from 63 to 19. The oldest is Prudence who is Murdoch's only child with his first wife Australian model Patricia Booker.

She has held various positions in her father's companies but now lives in Australia where she is largely focused on raising her three children.

Prue as she is called by her family has made it clear she is not interested in taking the reins and did not even attend college after graduating from Dalton in New York.

That does not mean she would oppose seeing her second husband Alasdair MacLeod move up the ranks at News Corp - despite her protests about him working with her father or her offspring - who are Murdoch's three oldest grandchildren - landing nice roles at the company.

The battle to take over their father's media empire was originally set between Elisabeth 52 Lachlan 49 and James all three of whom worth in the media.

Lachlan has since emerged as the frontrunner when James removed himself.

The relationship between Lachlan and his father has run hot and cold over the years but that all changed back in 2014 when Murdoch's older son returned to New York to work for News Corp. Now he is the Chairman and CEO of the Fox Corporation.

James the youngest of the three was the most loyal staying by his father's side and joining News Corp shortly after he dropped out of Harvard.

That devotion was tested however when Murdoch elected to promote Lachlan over James after he return to work in the US following an extended stint in Australia.

The brothers already strained relationship only got worse when Lachlan informed James of this decision over lunch.

James even briefly quit the company but then ultimately decided to return before then exiting for good.

Murdoch's youngest children are Grace 20 and Chloe 18 the New York-based daughters born to Murdoch's third wife Wendi Deng.

The ambitions of the two teenagers are unknown but their fiercely intelligent mother has no doubt seen to it that the two get not one bit less than their older half-siblings.

James' comments on Friday come as Fox executives are said to be fearful a shake-up is on the cards as Rupert Murdoch heads back to the US thanks to the COVID-19 vaccine.

The media mogul who will turn 90 in March got the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine in recent days from the UK's NHS sources told The Daily Beast allowing him to travel back to the country.

Murdoch is a US citizen and was born in Australia but has been isolated with his fourth wife Jerry Hall at his home in England since the summer.

He received the first dose at a local clinic in Henley on December 16 where he sang the praises of NHS staff and scientists and said he 'strongly encouraged' others to get the shot.

Sources said he was waiting for the second dose before heading back across the pond where rumors are circling that positions of some top executives are on the line after ratings have slumped in recent months.

The News Corp. boss has reportedly taken a more hands-on role at the right-wing network in recent days alongside his son Lachlan.

Top of the priority list is to tackle the decline in ratings seen since Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election in November insiders said.

Multiple insiders told The Daily Beast Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace are both fighting to keep their jobs after taking the lion's share of the blame for the figures.

Fox has denied there is any truth to the rumors issuing a statement that reads: 'Your premise is wrong. It is wishful thinking by our competitors.'

Sources said Murdoch and Lachlan are 'disenchanted' with the pair.

'Fox News has been absent a leader with the exception of [Fox Corporation's Chief Legal and Policy Officer] Viet Dinh running the operation between the network and the White House' one insider said.

James Murdoch's criticism of Fox on climate change James Murdoch and his wife Kathryn Hufschmid have distanced themselves from the rest of the family in their advocacy of climate change. In January 2020 months before he resigned from the company James announced that he disagreed 'with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage' on the issue. He noted his 'frustration' at the company's coverage on the topic. At the time the family's news outlets were claiming arsonists and not climate change were to blame for the destructive wildfires raging through Australia 'They are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia given obvious evidence to the contrary' James said in a statement. The statement is said to have blindside other members of the family as James had never previously made any criticism public. Just 18 months prior to this James was at least nominally responsible for Fox News output as boss of its parent company. He was also still a director of News Corp which owns the Murdoch's newspaper interests at the time James had previously joined the board of Tesla which aims to promote clean energy Advertisement

'Rupert re-taking the reins is a sign of the gross mismanagement to date.'

Murdoch has already made his return known with the announcement of a significant revamp of Fox's daytime scheduling Monday.

'I mean Rupert got involved with the shuffling of the lineup so that's never a good sign for someone in charge' a current Fox staffer told The Daily Beast.

'What is the point of having a manager running your business if you have to run the business yourself?'

Sources said Wallace's job is also rumored to be on the line after the network was first to call Arizona for Joe Biden on election night.

The state was won by the Democrat but the call was deemed premature by many and sparked outrage from Trump who allegedly personally called Murdoch in a fit of rage.

Sources said the move damaged ratings with Trump supporters switching to the right-wing pro-Trump Newsmax.

A press release from December reported that in 2020 Fox News Channel made history by becoming the first network to surpass 3.5 million viewers in primetime for an entire year.

But latest figures from Nielsen show that since December 28 Fox News' total viewership is down 15 percent compared to the same time last year.

By contrast CNN viewership is up 150 percent and MSNBC 89 percent.

While James' comments did not explicitly call out Fox News which his father helped found in 1996 others have been more forthright in their criticism after several hosts continued to back Trump with his unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud.

In December 2020 Fox was forced to air a news package that debunked election fraud claims made by three of its own hosts after an electronic voting company threatened legal action against the network.

The package featured voting technology expert Eddie Perez who said that he had 'not seen any evidence' that Smartmatic software was used to 'delete change alter anything related to vote tabulation'.

The news package was shared just after Smartmatic was targeted by allies of Trump who claimed that the company helped flip the 2020 election for Joe Biden. Smartmatic responded with the threat of legal action.

News Corp. is currently run by CEO Robert Thomson and owns U.S outlets such as The Wall Street Journal Dow Jones and The New York Post.

It is one of the two major media conglomerates owned by the Murdoch family the other being Fox Corporation which was established after The Walt Disney Company acquired the majority of 21st Century Fox last year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8xNi9tZWRpYS9mb3gtbmV3cy11ay1vZmNvbS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gE6aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8wMS8xNi9tZWRpYS9mb3gtbmV3cy11ay1vZmNvbQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why you won't find Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson on British TV,"London CNN Business —

The insurrection at the US Capitol has sparked a political firestorm and unnerved millions of Americans. It has also unleashed a wave of criticism over the role played by pro-Trump media outlets such as Fox News which fed lies and conspiracy theories about the election to angry supporters of the president for weeks.

“The mob that stormed and desecrated the Capitol … could not have existed in a country that hadn’t been radicalized by the likes of [Fox News hosts] Sean Hannity Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham and swayed by biased news coverage” wrote Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan.

But are the airwaves of any democracy free of this kind of harmful propaganda and downright fiction? The United Kingdom for one comes pretty close.

Though the UK media scene is defined in part by a freewheeling and often partisan tabloid press with its own share of conspiracy theories its TV news channels largely frame their coverage down the middle with broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV maintaining high levels of public trust. Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News is no longer on air in the country after failing to generate a significant viewer base.

A big factor in this is media regulator Ofcom which enforces rules on impartiality and accuracy for all news broadcasters. Those who breach the rules can be censured or fined — putting pressure on TV channels to play stories fairly straight.

What the impartiality rules do is ensure you cannot have the kind of shock jock culture.” Steven Barnett University of Westminster media professor

Russian state-funded news channel RT for example was slapped with a £200000 ($272000) penalty for repeatedly breaking impartiality rules in its 2018 coverage of the poisonings of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter as well as the conflict in Syria. It has not been fined since.

“What the impartiality rules do is ensure you cannot have the kind of shock jock culture — [a] far right or indeed far left one-sided interpretation of events” said Steven Barnett a professor of media and communication at the University of Westminster.

The UK system isn’t perfect. A review of BBC coverage ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum found that its main news program was more negative on the European Union than Russian President Vladimir Putin. And two new media ventures expected to launch shortly could again push the limits of what’s allowed. But according to experts the framework has protected against the kind of disinformation peddled by Fox News in the United States.

No Fox News

Ofcom which was established in 2003 has two important standards that the news broadcasters it licenses must abide by — “due impartiality” and “due accuracy.”

This does not mean that equal time needs to be given on television and radio to both sides of an issue. But broadcasters do have a responsibility at least to acknowledge opposing viewpoints and to quickly correct “significant mistakes.”

When Fox News was on the air in the United Kingdom its top stars were found to have violated the regulator’s rules.

Ofcom said that a Hannity program about President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting travel from seven majority-Muslim countries didn’t do enough to surface the viewpoints of those who opposed the order. Ofcom also said that a separate Carlson broadcast following the 2017 Manchester terror attack — which included claims that UK authorities had done nothing to stop terrorism or to protect “thousands of underage girls” from rape and abuse — did not adequately reflect alternate perspectives.

Fox News was pulled off air in the United Kingdom later in 2017 when Murdoch the billionaire chairman of News Corp and Fox News’ parent company was seeking government approval to purchase the shares he didn’t own of European pay TV network Sky. (He ended up selling his Sky holdings to Comcast.)

21st Century Fox the network’s parent company at the time said it made the decision because Fox News had attracted “only a few thousand viewers across the day” in the United Kingdom and it didn’t make commercial sense to continue broadcasting. But the move also came amid scrutiny from Ofcom which had previously slammed Fox’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against former network boss Roger Ailes and former star host Bill O’Reilly calling their alleged conduct “deeply disturbing.”

Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity's programs were found to have breached Ofcom's impartiality standards in 2017. Gerry Images

Such warnings hint at the trouble Fox News could have faced had it stuck it out during the Trump era.

Hefty penalties awarded to other channels such as RT have effectively communicated the consequences of slipping up to media executives said Trevor Barnes a TV and radio compliance consultant and former Ofcom official.

“They’re aware that if they misbehave they’ll be hit with a fine” he said.

The United States meanwhile doesn’t have these kinds of rules — and hasn’t since the Reagan era when the Federal Communications Commission stopped enforcing the so-called Fairness Doctrine for TV and radio stations. Historians believe the demise of this rule which required broadcasters to present a variety of views on issues of public importance paved the way for the explosion of conservative talk radio in the late 1980s and 1990s which later served as a model for Fox. Those talk radio shows continue to be popular today.

As a cable network Fox News wouldn’t have been bound by the doctrine which only applied to broadcast channels. But Julian Zelizer a history professor at Princeton University and CNN contributor said its removal changed the rules of the game.

“It served as a kind of check” Zelizer said. “It was always on the mind of everyone who was in the news business.”

Now even members of the Murdoch family are reckoning with the role Fox News has played. James Murdoch who made a dramatic break from his family last year when he resigned from the board of News Corp said in a statement on Friday that “spreading disinformation” has “real world consequences.” While he did not mention Fox News by name it was clear his focus was on the network controlled by his father and brother.

“Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies. We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever” James Murdoch and his wife Kathryn Murdoch said in a joint statement to the Financial Times.

New networks may test the system

The United Kingdom has largely watched the Capitol riot and its aftermath in horror.

“The events … have been the ultimate demonstration of what can happen when those fundamental pillars of democracy break down: accurate information [and] fair information” Barnett said.

But two outlets expected to debut shortly in the United Kingdom could test the bounds of the regulatory system including Ofcom’s appetite for enforcement.

Murdoch’s UK operation which still controls three big British newspapers — The Sun The Times and The Sunday Times — is working on a new video venture having recently received a license under the name News UK TV. Details haven’t been announced.

Meanwhile upstart competitor GB News which recently secured £60 million ($81 million) from investors is hiring journalists as it prepares to launch a 24-hour news channel.

“Many British people are crying out for a news service that is more diverse and more representative of their values and concerns” former BBC host Andrew Neil who will serve as the chairman of GB News said in a statement last week. Neil was previously the editor of Murdoch’s Sunday Times and executive chairman of Sky TV.

Critics fear the News UK TV venture and GB News could move to take on the BBC and fill a perceived gap in right-wing broadcasting sparking concerns about whether UK regulators are up to the task of maintaining due impartiality or whether Britain could soon have its own Fox News-type problem.

Both outlets may play things fairly safe at first and Barnes noted that the rules will give them some latitude.

“There’s no requirement under due impartiality for a channel not to have a bias” he said. “All it requires is you reflect to a pretty small degree what the opposing viewpoint is.”

But Barnett is worried that over time there could be a slow erosion of norms — combined with an anti-Ofcom push from Murdoch’s powerful papers who may level criticisms of a “nanny state regulator telling us what we can and can’t say.” News Corp declined to comment.

“I will make a prediction that within a year we will see a concerted attack within the Murdoch press on Ofcom” he said. And if support for the regulator fades all bets will be off.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL2phbi8xNi9qYW1lcy1tdXJkb2NoLXNheXMtdXMtbWVkaWEtbGllcy11bmxlYXNoZWQtaW5zaWRpb3VzLWZvcmNlc9IBaWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL2phbi8xNi9qYW1lcy1tdXJkb2NoLXNheXMtdXMtbWVkaWEtbGllcy11bmxlYXNoZWQtaW5zaWRpb3VzLWZvcmNlcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Murdoch says US media 'lies' unleashed 'insidious forces',"James Murdoch has condemned the US media for “propagating lies” which have unleashed “insidious and uncontrollable forces” that will endure for years.

Questioned about whether Fox News – founded by his father Rupert Murdoch and run by his brother Lachlan – had played a role in the riot at the Capitol last week he said media groups had amplified election disinformation which successfully sowed falsehoods.

Providing his sternest reproach yet of the US news industry since stepping away from the family business Murdoch stopped short of naming Fox News but the comments will be seen as a thinly veiled rebuke.

“The damage is profound” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very much so. Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.

“I hope that those people who didn’t think it was that dangerous now understand and that they stop.”

He added that the media would inevitably face “a reckoning” after being “co-opted by forces that only want to stay in power or are manipulating our discourse from abroad and are only too happy to make a mess and burn things down.”

In a subsequent statement issued jointly with his wife Kathryn they added: “Spreading disinformation – whether about the election public health or climate change – has real world consequences. Many media property owners have as much responsibility as the elected officials who know the truth but instead choose to propagate lies.

“We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever.”

Fox News was contacted for comment. While it has run some stories critical of the outgoing US president Donald Trump it has been largely supportive of his rule and some Fox News personalities have amplified his false election fraud claims.

“Tonight every American should be angry outraged worried and concerned about what happened in the election” Sean Hannity said on his programme in November. “Here’s the question that every American is going to have to answer by themselves. Do you trust what happened in this election? Do you believe these election results are accurate? Do you believe this was a free and fair election? I have a lot of questions.”

Murdoch did not mention any news outlets specifically although Fox News — the company owned by his father and eldest brother Lachlan — has previously been criticized for peddling baseless claims of voter fraud following the 2020 election which was first made by President Trump.

His comments are the strongest rebuke of the industry since he decided to break from the family media empire last year.

Murdoch announced his resignation from the board of directors of News Corp in July. The multinational media company owns several US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.

In a statement at the time Murdoch said he chose to leave ""due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""

According to several news reports James and his wife Kathryn were frustrated ""with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage"" on climate change as wildfires ripped through most of Australia last year.

The youngest Murdoch son has since turned his attention to his foundation called Quadrivium which according to its website aims to promote initiatives related to democracy voter participation and climate change among others.

In a separate statement that was published after the FT interview Murdoch and his wife wrote: ""Spreading disinformation — whether about the election public health or climate change — has real-world consequences.""

""Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies.

In an interview with the Financial Times the 48-year-old blamed 'media property owners' for unleashing 'insidious and uncontrollable forces' with their support of disinformation about the 2020 election.

James the youngest son of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch also claimed that media groups fueled the riot by leading 'a substantial portion' of the public to believe 'a falsehood' about the election.

'The damage is profound' James said in Friday's interview as he criticized media groups coverage of election fraud.

'The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very very much so. Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.'

He did not explicitly mention Fox News whose board includes his father as chairman and older brother Lachlan as CEO yet was clearly focused on the right-wing cable network that has been criticized for its coverage of President Trump's election fraud claims.

A new opinion program at 7 p.m. will also replace the news-focused show 'The Story.' Advertisement

James quit his father's media company News Corp. last summer saying that he was 'increasingly uncomfortable' with News Corp and Fox 'legitimizing disinformation'.

He made the decision to leave after a 24-year career with the company which saw him with work alongside his father to build Newscorp's empire and climb to the role of CEO of 21st Century Fox.

In 2019 he received $2billion in a deal with Walt Disney for 21st Century Fox ending his time at the helm but he still remained on News Corp.'s board.

James had previously been viewed as heir apparant to Rupert after Lachlan resigned from his executive positions at News Corp. in July 2005.

Yet Lachlan became the golden child once more on his return and was promoted over his younger brother by their father.

His attack Friday came as his father flew back to New York to shake up the network as Fox's rating plummeted in the first two weeks of the year.

Conservatives remained loyal to Fox News throughout Trump's presidency angered at the coverage on CNN and MSNBC over Trump's first impeachment and the probe into Russian collusion.

Fox's emerging rivals Newsmax and OAN have continued to falsely claim Trump won the election if it were not for fraud even as Murdoch's outlets have called on the president to accept defeat.

'I hope that those people who didn't think it was that dangerous now understand and that they stop' James added in the Times interview yet claimed he had not 'seen any evidence of that yet'.

James and his wife Kathryn Hufschmid issued a further statement following the interview in which they accused 'media property owners' of chosing to spread 'lies'.

'Spreading disinformation — whether about the election public health or climate change — has real world consequences' the statement read.

'Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies.

'We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever' it concluded.

In his resignation letter James cited 'disagreements over certain editorial content'

James formerly served as the chief executive of 21st Century Fox from 2015 to 2019.

He is known as the more liberal Murdoch brother while older brother Lachlan's views seem to be more aligned with those of his conservative father.

James Murdoch quit his father's media empire because it was 'legitimizing disinformation' In July 2020 James Murdoch handed in his resignation letter for his final board position within News Corp. James' letter 'disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company's news outlets'. The 48-year-old told the New York Times that he 'pulled the rip cord' because he was 'increasingly uncomfortable' with News Corp and Fox 'legitimizing disinformation' and denying climate change. Murdoch told the Times it was 'not that hard a decision' to stand down from News Corp because of major disagreements with his father and brother Lachlan over the running of the business. He had voiced criticism about Fox the previous year. Yet prior to this James had been in line to take over his father's empire battling it out with brother Lachlan He was leapfrogged for promotion by Lachlan despite staying loyal to his father Advertisement

James split from the company in a dramatic exit in July 2020 when he left the News Corps. board completely citing in a letter 'disagreements over certain editorial content'.

A spokesperson for him and his wife also told the Daily Beast in January 2020 - before his split from the empire - that the couple disagreed 'with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage' on climate change.

The comments were made as wildfires ripped through Murdoch's native Australia.

'Kathryn and James's views on climate are well established and their frustration with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage of the topic is also well known.

'They are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia given obvious evidence to the contrary' their statement read.

The 'denials' were in reference to allegations arsonists and not climate change were to blame for the destructive wildfires.

At the time his comments were perceived as 'unprecedented' and sparked speculation of a feud within the family since he rarely spoke publicly about his role in the business.

He also told the New Yorker in 2019: 'There are views I really disagree with on Fox.'

Despite his family's conservative-leaning media outlets James and his wife have recently made significant donations to Democrats including former presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg and President-elect Joe Biden.

He along with Rupert Murdoch’s five other children received up to $2billion in 2019 from the break-up of the family’s media empire and the sale of its entertainment businesses to Walt Disney.

Yet the merger left him out of work and appeared to cause friction between father and son.

'There are periods of time when we do not' James told the New Yorker of speaking with his former boss after the deal.

THE MURDOCH FAMILY MEDIA EMPIRE RUPERT MURDOCH EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF NEWS CORP The Australian-born mogul began building his media empire in Australia by acquiring numerous publications in the 1950s before entering the British newspaper market in 1969 and expanding to the US in 1974. He founded News Corporation in 1980 which quickly evolved into one of the largest media groups in the world owning assets in print news and television. In 2013 News Corporation split into two sister companies News Corp and 21st Century Fox. The latter was later rebranded as Fox Corporation after the majority of its assets were sold to The Walt Disney Company in 2019. Murdoch currently serves as the executive chairman of News Corp and the chairman of Fox Corporation. He is estimated to be worth $17billion. LACHLAN MURDOCH EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF FOX CORPORATION CO-CHAIR OF NEWS CORP Lachlan Murdoch 49 the eldest of the Murdoch sons is the heir apparent to News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert and is co-chairman of News Corp. He was named executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corp in 2019 after 21st Century Fox was sold to Disney. Before the sale younger brother James had been the CEO of the company and Lachlan was executive chairman. Lachlan is also chairman of Australian entertainment company NOVA Entertainment which operates a number of radio stations across the country. JAMES MURDOCH FORMER BOARD MEMBER OF NEWS CORP The younger son of Rupert Murdoch James 48 had been on the board of News Corp since 2013. He and brother Lachlan had shared power at 21st Century Fox but the sale of much of the Fox entertainment business to Disney in 2019 saw James depart as CEO. Since then he has worked at the helm of investment fund Lupa Systems. James is considered more liberal than his older brother who is CEO of Fox Corp home to conservative news network Fox News the Fox broadcast and sports networks and local TV stations. James has been critical of News Corp's editorial decisions and has said he disagreed with Fox News coverage. He resigned from the board on July 31 2020. PRUDENCE MURDOCH NON-EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBER OF NEWS CORP Prudence Murdoch 63 is the eldest child of Rupert Murdoch through his first marriage with Patricia Booker. She formerly worked as journalist for now-defunct British tabloid News of the World which was owned by her father. Prudence was once described in the media as the 'only one of [Murdoch's] children not directly competing for his business affections.' ELISABETH MURDOCH MEDIA EXECUTIVE AND FORMER CHAIRPERSON OF SHINE GROUP Elisabeth is Rupert Murdoch's daughter from his second marriage with Anna Maria Torv. Born in Sydney she moved to London in 1990s where she worked on the operations side of BSkyB run by her father. She founded UK-based TV programming company Shine Limited in 2001 which was sold to News Corp ten years later. She currently serves as executive chairman of production company Sister. GRACE AND CHLOE MURDOCH The sisters aged 20 and 18 are Rupert's daughters from his third marriage to Wendi Deng. Advertisement

In 2019 James was reportedly looking to set up a $1billion new project including a liberal news outlet in stark contrast to his father's Fox News.

In March 2020 it was further suggested he pumped money into start-ups looking to combat fake news.

His firm Lupa Systems was said to have teamed up with Betaworks to create a 'more sustainable news ecosystem'.

Rupert designed his companies to benefit his family making certain that he and his children always had control meaning that his children and generations to follow would be taken care of financially.

One thing Murdoch has not left his children with however is a plan for the future of his media empire refusing to officially name an heir despite making no secret of his preferred child.

It is not his oldest child Prudence or the next in line Elisabeth who has found incredible success outside the family business in emerging media markets.

It is not James the son who has stood by his side for decades and weathered the fallout from the 2011 hacking scandal at News of the World and the 2016 sexual assault scandal at Fox News.

It is Lachlan Murdoch's older son who is the 'golden child' according to multiple sources.

The family company and its future were the focus of a New York Times piece in 2019 that provided an in depth look at the mogul's two sons while completely ignoring the lives and accomplishments of his four daughters.

By some accounts Murdoch's heirs are now battling behind the scenes for control of the empire with the two top contenders at the time appearing to be his sons James and Lachlan before James' split.

The brothers have had a tumultuous relationship over the years which had become more frayed than ever of recent after Lachlan was promoted over his younger brother by their father despite James' loyalty to the family company.

The media mogul is the father of six children who range in age from 63 to 19. The oldest is Prudence who is Murdoch's only child with his first wife Australian model Patricia Booker.

She has held various positions in her father's companies but now lives in Australia where she is largely focused on raising her three children.

Prue as she is called by her family has made it clear she is not interested in taking the reins and did not even attend college after graduating from Dalton in New York.

That does not mean she would oppose seeing her second husband Alasdair MacLeod move up the ranks at News Corp - despite her protests about him working with her father or her offspring - who are Murdoch's three oldest grandchildren - landing nice roles at the company.

The battle to take over their father's media empire was originally set between Elisabeth 52 Lachlan 49 and James all three of whom worth in the media.

Lachlan has since emerged as the frontrunner when James removed himself.

The relationship between Lachlan and his father has run hot and cold over the years but that all changed back in 2014 when Murdoch's older son returned to New York to work for News Corp. Now he is the Chairman and CEO of the Fox Corporation.

James the youngest of the three was the most loyal staying by his father's side and joining News Corp shortly after he dropped out of Harvard.

That devotion was tested however when Murdoch elected to promote Lachlan over James after he return to work in the US following an extended stint in Australia.

The brothers already strained relationship only got worse when Lachlan informed James of this decision over lunch.

James even briefly quit the company but then ultimately decided to return before then exiting for good.

Murdoch's youngest children are Grace 20 and Chloe 18 the New York-based daughters born to Murdoch's third wife Wendi Deng.

The ambitions of the two teenagers are unknown but their fiercely intelligent mother has no doubt seen to it that the two get not one bit less than their older half-siblings.

James' comments on Friday come as Fox executives are said to be fearful a shake-up is on the cards as Rupert Murdoch heads back to the US thanks to the COVID-19 vaccine.

The media mogul who will turn 90 in March got the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine in recent days from the UK's NHS sources told The Daily Beast allowing him to travel back to the country.

Murdoch is a US citizen and was born in Australia but has been isolated with his fourth wife Jerry Hall at his home in England since the summer.

He received the first dose at a local clinic in Henley on December 16 where he sang the praises of NHS staff and scientists and said he 'strongly encouraged' others to get the shot.

Sources said he was waiting for the second dose before heading back across the pond where rumors are circling that positions of some top executives are on the line after ratings have slumped in recent months.

The News Corp. boss has reportedly taken a more hands-on role at the right-wing network in recent days alongside his son Lachlan.

Top of the priority list is to tackle the decline in ratings seen since Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election in November insiders said.

Multiple insiders told The Daily Beast Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace are both fighting to keep their jobs after taking the lion's share of the blame for the figures.

Multiple insiders told The Daily Beast Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott (pictured left) and President Jay Wallace (pictured right) are both fighting to keep their jobs after taking the lion's share of the blame for the ratings as Rupert Murdoch returns to the U.S.

Fox has denied there is any truth to the rumors issuing a statement that reads: 'Your premise is wrong. It is wishful thinking by our competitors.'

Sources said Murdoch and Lachlan are 'disenchanted' with the pair.

'Fox News has been absent a leader with the exception of [Fox Corporation's Chief Legal and Policy Officer] Viet Dinh running the operation between the network and the White House' one insider said.

James Murdoch's criticism of Fox on climate change James Murdoch and his wife Kathryn Hufschmid have distanced themselves from the rest of the family in their advocacy of climate change. In January 2020 months before he resigned from the company James announced that he disagreed 'with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage' on the issue. He noted his 'frustration' at the company's coverage on the topic. At the time the family's news outlets were claiming arsonists and not climate change were to blame for the destructive wildfires raging through Australia 'They are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia given obvious evidence to the contrary' James said in a statement. The statement is said to have blindside other members of the family as James had never previously made any criticism public. Just 18 months prior to this James was at least nominally responsible for Fox News output as boss of its parent company. He was also still a director of News Corp which owns the Murdoch's newspaper interests at the time James had previously joined the board of Tesla which aims to promote clean energy Advertisement

'Rupert re-taking the reins is a sign of the gross mismanagement to date.'

Murdoch has already made his return known with the announcement of a significant revamp of Fox's daytime scheduling Monday.

'I mean Rupert got involved with the shuffling of the lineup so that's never a good sign for someone in charge' a current Fox staffer told The Daily Beast.

'What is the point of having a manager running your business if you have to run the business yourself?'

Sources said Wallace's job is also rumored to be on the line after the network was first to call Arizona for Joe Biden on election night.

The state was won by the Democrat but the call was deemed premature by many and sparked outrage from Trump who allegedly personally called Murdoch in a fit of rage.

Sources said the move damaged ratings with Trump supporters switching to the right-wing pro-Trump Newsmax.

A press release from December reported that in 2020 Fox News Channel made history by becoming the first network to surpass 3.5 million viewers in primetime for an entire year.

But latest figures from Nielsen show that since December 28 Fox News' total viewership is down 15 percent compared to the same time last year.

By contrast CNN viewership is up 150 percent and MSNBC 89 percent.

While James' comments did not explicitly call out Fox News which his father helped found in 1996 others have been more forthright in their criticism after several hosts continued to back Trump with his unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud.

In December 2020 Fox was forced to air a news package that debunked election fraud claims made by three of its own hosts after an electronic voting company threatened legal action against the network.

The package featured voting technology expert Eddie Perez who said that he had 'not seen any evidence' that Smartmatic software was used to 'delete change alter anything related to vote tabulation'.

The news package was shared just after Smartmatic was targeted by allies of Trump who claimed that the company helped flip the 2020 election for Joe Biden. Smartmatic responded with the threat of legal action.

News Corp. is currently run by CEO Robert Thomson and owns U.S outlets such as The Wall Street Journal Dow Jones and The New York Post.

The insurrection at the US Capitol has sparked a political firestorm and unnerved millions of Americans. It has also unleashed a wave of criticism over the role played by pro-Trump media outlets such as Fox News which fed lies and conspiracy theories about the election to angry supporters of the president for weeks.

“The mob that stormed and desecrated the Capitol … could not have existed in a country that hadn’t been radicalized by the likes of [Fox News hosts] Sean Hannity Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham and swayed by biased news coverage” wrote Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan.

But are the airwaves of any democracy free of this kind of harmful propaganda and downright fiction? The United Kingdom for one comes pretty close.

Though the UK media scene is defined in part by a freewheeling and often partisan tabloid press with its own share of conspiracy theories its TV news channels largely frame their coverage down the middle with broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV maintaining high levels of public trust. Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News is no longer on air in the country after failing to generate a significant viewer base.

A big factor in this is media regulator Ofcom which enforces rules on impartiality and accuracy for all news broadcasters. Those who breach the rules can be censured or fined — putting pressure on TV channels to play stories fairly straight.

What the impartiality rules do is ensure you cannot have the kind of shock jock culture.” Steven Barnett University of Westminster media professor

Russian state-funded news channel RT for example was slapped with a £200000 ($272000) penalty for repeatedly breaking impartiality rules in its 2018 coverage of the poisonings of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter as well as the conflict in Syria. It has not been fined since.

“What the impartiality rules do is ensure you cannot have the kind of shock jock culture — [a] far right or indeed far left one-sided interpretation of events” said Steven Barnett a professor of media and communication at the University of Westminster.

The UK system isn’t perfect. A review of BBC coverage ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum found that its main news program was more negative on the European Union than Russian President Vladimir Putin. And two new media ventures expected to launch shortly could again push the limits of what’s allowed. But according to experts the framework has protected against the kind of disinformation peddled by Fox News in the United States.

No Fox News

Ofcom which was established in 2003 has two important standards that the news broadcasters it licenses must abide by — “due impartiality” and “due accuracy.”

This does not mean that equal time needs to be given on television and radio to both sides of an issue. But broadcasters do have a responsibility at least to acknowledge opposing viewpoints and to quickly correct “significant mistakes.”

When Fox News was on the air in the United Kingdom its top stars were found to have violated the regulator’s rules.

Ofcom said that a Hannity program about President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting travel from seven majority-Muslim countries didn’t do enough to surface the viewpoints of those who opposed the order. Ofcom also said that a separate Carlson broadcast following the 2017 Manchester terror attack — which included claims that UK authorities had done nothing to stop terrorism or to protect “thousands of underage girls” from rape and abuse — did not adequately reflect alternate perspectives.

Fox News was pulled off air in the United Kingdom later in 2017 when Murdoch the billionaire chairman of News Corp and Fox News’ parent company was seeking government approval to purchase the shares he didn’t own of European pay TV network Sky. (He ended up selling his Sky holdings to Comcast.)

21st Century Fox the network’s parent company at the time said it made the decision because Fox News had attracted “only a few thousand viewers across the day” in the United Kingdom and it didn’t make commercial sense to continue broadcasting. But the move also came amid scrutiny from Ofcom which had previously slammed Fox’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against former network boss Roger Ailes and former star host Bill O’Reilly calling their alleged conduct “deeply disturbing.”

Such warnings hint at the trouble Fox News could have faced had it stuck it out during the Trump era.

Hefty penalties awarded to other channels such as RT have effectively communicated the consequences of slipping up to media executives said Trevor Barnes a TV and radio compliance consultant and former Ofcom official.

“They’re aware that if they misbehave they’ll be hit with a fine” he said.

The United States meanwhile doesn’t have these kinds of rules — and hasn’t since the Reagan era when the Federal Communications Commission stopped enforcing the so-called Fairness Doctrine for TV and radio stations. Historians believe the demise of this rule which required broadcasters to present a variety of views on issues of public importance paved the way for the explosion of conservative talk radio in the late 1980s and 1990s which later served as a model for Fox. Those talk radio shows continue to be popular today.

As a cable network Fox News wouldn’t have been bound by the doctrine which only applied to broadcast channels. But Julian Zelizer a history professor at Princeton University and CNN contributor said its removal changed the rules of the game.

“It served as a kind of check” Zelizer said. “It was always on the mind of everyone who was in the news business.”

Now even members of the Murdoch family are reckoning with the role Fox News has played. James Murdoch who made a dramatic break from his family last year when he resigned from the board of News Corp said in a statement on Friday that “spreading disinformation” has “real world consequences.” While he did not mention Fox News by name it was clear his focus was on the network controlled by his father and brother.

“Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies. We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever” James Murdoch and his wife Kathryn Murdoch said in a joint statement to the Financial Times.

New networks may test the system

The United Kingdom has largely watched the Capitol riot and its aftermath in horror.

“The events … have been the ultimate demonstration of what can happen when those fundamental pillars of democracy break down: accurate information [and] fair information” Barnett said.

But two outlets expected to debut shortly in the United Kingdom could test the bounds of the regulatory system including Ofcom’s appetite for enforcement.

Murdoch’s UK operation which still controls three big British newspapers — The Sun The Times and The Sunday Times — is working on a new video venture having recently received a license under the name News UK TV. Details haven’t been announced.

Meanwhile upstart competitor GB News which recently secured £60 million ($81 million) from investors is hiring journalists as it prepares to launch a 24-hour news channel.

“Many British people are crying out for a news service that is more diverse and more representative of their values and concerns” former BBC host Andrew Neil who will serve as the chairman of GB News said in a statement last week. Neil was previously the editor of Murdoch’s Sunday Times and executive chairman of Sky TV.

Critics fear the News UK TV venture and GB News could move to take on the BBC and fill a perceived gap in right-wing broadcasting sparking concerns about whether UK regulators are up to the task of maintaining due impartiality or whether Britain could soon have its own Fox News-type problem.

Both outlets may play things fairly safe at first and Barnes noted that the rules will give them some latitude.

“There’s no requirement under due impartiality for a channel not to have a bias” he said. “All it requires is you reflect to a pretty small degree what the opposing viewpoint is.”

But Barnett is worried that over time there could be a slow erosion of norms — combined with an anti-Ofcom push from Murdoch’s powerful papers who may level criticisms of a “nanny state regulator telling us what we can and can’t say.” News Corp declined to comment.

“I will make a prediction that within a year we will see a concerted attack within the Murdoch press on Ofcom” he said. And if support for the regulator fades all bets will be off.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL2phbi8xNi9qYW1lcy1tdXJkb2NoLXNheXMtdXMtbWVkaWEtbGllcy11bmxlYXNoZWQtaW5zaWRpb3VzLWZvcmNlc9IBaWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL2phbi8xNi9qYW1lcy1tdXJkb2NoLXNheXMtdXMtbWVkaWEtbGllcy11bmxlYXNoZWQtaW5zaWRpb3VzLWZvcmNlcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Murdoch says US media 'lies' unleashed 'insidious forces',"James Murdoch has condemned the US media for “propagating lies” which have unleashed “insidious and uncontrollable forces” that will endure for years.

Questioned about whether Fox News – founded by his father Rupert Murdoch and run by his brother Lachlan – had played a role in the riot at the Capitol last week he said media groups had amplified election disinformation which successfully sowed falsehoods.

Providing his sternest reproach yet of the US news industry since stepping away from the family business Murdoch stopped short of naming Fox News but the comments will be seen as a thinly veiled rebuke.

“The damage is profound” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very much so. Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.

“I hope that those people who didn’t think it was that dangerous now understand and that they stop.”

He added that the media would inevitably face “a reckoning” after being “co-opted by forces that only want to stay in power or are manipulating our discourse from abroad and are only too happy to make a mess and burn things down.”

In a subsequent statement issued jointly with his wife Kathryn they added: “Spreading disinformation – whether about the election public health or climate change – has real world consequences. Many media property owners have as much responsibility as the elected officials who know the truth but instead choose to propagate lies.

“We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever.”

Fox News was contacted for comment. While it has run some stories critical of the outgoing US president Donald Trump it has been largely supportive of his rule and some Fox News personalities have amplified his false election fraud claims.

“Tonight every American should be angry outraged worried and concerned about what happened in the election” Sean Hannity said on his programme in November. “Here’s the question that every American is going to have to answer by themselves. Do you trust what happened in this election? Do you believe these election results are accurate? Do you believe this was a free and fair election? I have a lot of questions.”

Murdoch resigned in August 2020 from the board of directors of News Corp which also ultimately controls the Times the Sunday Times the Sun the Wall Street Journal the New York Post a host of Australian newspapers and a number of other media outlets and entities across the world.

He said at the time he was departing over “disagreements over certain editorial content published” by its news outlets and “certain other strategic decisions”.

Murdoch who donated to Joe Biden’s successful presidential campaign told the New Yorker in 2019: “There are views I really disagree with on Fox.”"

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 10 biggest questions in life. Life is a funny thing. We are born we go to school we graduate get a job get married have kids raise them and then just die. Of course I’m missing quite a few steps but that is the usual path many of us take. We go through these motions almost naturally because that is what we’re supposed to do right? That’s what our parents did anyway. And their parents before them. And their parents before them. The chain goes on. Of course many a times we find people who chose a different path and its becoming more common as we evolve to stray away from certain traditions. While unacceptable in the beginning to most many parts of the world are now accepting these changes in tradition. Far from being something bad this actually shows diversity and sociological differences in people. It should be supported as long as it isn’t hurting anyone. For example many people are now choosing to not marry many are choosing to adopt their offspring rather than procreate while there are some who don’t want a family anyway.

Then there are people who are choosing a different way of life. Living green helps the environment. Some people dedicate their whole life to curb the negative effects of Global Warming. Their efforts not only help them they help everyone on planet earth in the long run. Some of these people have even made avenues so that others could follow suit. There are a lot of businesses working in this field to help the earth. For example if you want to switch to renewable energy you have options like Brookfield Renewable Partners ((NYSE:BEP) who deal in hydroelectric wind and solar energy generation facilities as well as energy storage assets. First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is another business helping the environment. They deal in thin film solar panels and are one of the leaders in the field. Another company NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) produces more energy from the wind and sun than any other company in the world.

We go through life trying to find the perfect fit for everything. We want the perfect marriage the perfect home the perfect lifestyle the perfect job etc. In a sense we’re all different from each other according to our preferences and our choices but at the heart of it all we’re all human beings and there are a lot of things that bind us together. It can be our love for music our love for humanity our optimism for the future our humility etc. We’re all seeking answers to life’s biggest questions in our own ways. Here we have compiled a list for the 25 biggest questions in life. The questions have been compiled from Conversation Starters World the emotions machine and Reddit.

25. How would life be different if you were born in a different country?

Starting off with number twenty five we have a question that we often find ourselves wondering about as we grow older. Would we be leading a different life if we were born in another country? Will we be different people? This question has different implications according to the state of one’s country. A person from a third world country might be wondering if life would be easier if they were born in a first world country. Someone from a better background might wonder the opposite.

24. Is suffering a necessary part of the human condition? What would people who never suffered be like?

Ah this. Every time something bad happens to us or if we’re going through a particularly bad time we hear the term “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”. But what about those who’ve never had to deal with a bad situation be like? It’s rare to come across anyone who hasn’t had a bad break at least once in their life. Even the most privileged have their own set of problems.

23. What is the best way for a person to attain happiness?

The age old question. We’re all trying to find the formula to happiness. But the truth is there is no fit all solution available. We all have different destinations different preferences hence different answers to the question. It just takes a long time for most of us to get there. Often times what we think will bring us happiness turns out to disappoint us.

22. Would you break the law to save a loved one?

Well would you? Ask yourself would it be worth risking the wrath of the state in order to save to spare someone you love? It probably depends on how much you love the person to put yourself under that kind of risk. Hopefully none of us have to answer this question.

21. If a child somehow survived and grew up in the wilderness without any human contact how “human” would they be without the influence of society and culture?

Like Mowgli? Fans of the Jungle Book might immediately think of the sweet kid in the franchise who grew up in the Jungle. But what this question ultimately points towards is what makes a human a human? Is it really the society or the norms which influence us or do we have instincts that set us apart from other species? Is it nature or nurture? Another popular character that comes to mind is Tarzan.

20. How long will you be remembered after you die?

This is a particularly difficult question as it involves thinking about your own death. But often times you can’t help yourself. When with a loved one or even when alone you often find yourself wondering will it matter if I die? How long will people remember me miss me? It doesn’t make sense why it matters since we’ll be dead but the mind can’t help but wonder.

19. Do extraterrestrial life forms exist?

We answered this question amongst others in 20 biggest questions in science from a scientific perspective. Man is a social animal and it seems weird to thing that we are alone in the universe. There have to be other worlds right?

18. How would life be different if you were born the opposite gender?

You’re lying if you say you’ve never thought about this before. Especially due to the social norms stuck to gender roles one can’t help but wonder how different would life be if we were born as the opposite gender? This wouldn’t just mean a different name it would mean different clothes different friends probably different activities and aren’t these the core of what develop our lives?

17. What happens after we die?

Many people turn to religion for the answer. Some believe in heaven and hell and the Day of Judgment according to their respective religions while some believe that we just disappear into nothingness. There are some who believe that we go back into the earth and become a part of it. There is of course no way a fellow human being can tell us because they’ll be dead. Unless you believe in psychics and mystics of course.

16. When is silence better than words?

A question we should probably ask ourselves more often than we already do. When should one stay silent save their breath? This often depends upon personal choice but both options usually have drastically different consequences. Hence making this an extremely important choice.

15. Can world peace ever be achieved?

Humans have dedicated an enormous amount of time to answer this question but at the same time very little efforts from our population as a whole to make a positive answer possible. With constant wars genocides and other forms of violence it seems that we are far from getting even half an answer.

14. Is the meaning of life the same for animals and humans?

Our base instincts are probably the same. Both species need to survive and reproduce. But it’s the details that make us different. We have the ability of thought which animals don't who only go about fulfilling their basic necessities for survival. Our brain power is what distinguished us from humans and animals after all.

13. Is it possible to live a normal life and not ever tell a lie?

Most of us have this belief that lying is a sin. Even people who aren’t religious adhere to the notion that lying is deception which is wrong. But one can’t really say in all honesty that they’ve never lied. We’ve all told a little white lie here is there. Why is it so hard not to lie?

12. How will humans as a species go extinct?

Will the world end in an explosion or will we finally kill each other in world wars? Scientists have proposed a lot of theories in this matter but the truth will only come out when everything does end. Though we likely won’t be there to find out.

11. Where does your self-worth come from?

A theory suggests that our self-worth comes from our abilities and other activities that we deem to be important. But most of us have different notions or yardsticks as to what really encapsulates the worth of a human being. We might never have a unanimous answer and that’s probably a good thing.

NKE,Nike,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzE2L2JldHRlci1idXktbmlrZS12cy1zdGFyYnVja3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Nike vs. Starbucks,"Which of these consumer favorites should you add to your portfolio?

One way for many investors to improve their returns while lowering their risk is to focus on companies that have a long track record of delivering great products to consumers. Nike (NKE 1.31%) and Starbucks (SBUX -0.29%) with their powerful brands belong in a rare group that have been consumer darlings for a long time.

Owning shares in both companies over the past decade would have been a winning move. At recent prices Nike shares are up 566% since early 2011 while Starbucks shares aren't far behind at 524%.

But investors can't rely on the past as a decent guide for the future. Let's see which one of these businesses is deserving of a place in your portfolio for the next decade.

The leader in sports apparel

Nike's business took a major hit from the coronavirus pandemic in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2020 (which ended May 31) as revenue fell 38% and the company posted a loss of $790 million due to worldwide store closures. But Nike has recovered nicely thanks to its digital infrastructure and impressive gains in China. In the second quarter of its fiscal 2021 (which ended Nov. 30) e-commerce sales jumped 84% while the Greater China segment recorded 24% revenue growth.

This resulted in overall quarterly revenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rising 9% and 11% respectively over the prior-year period. Nike's resiliency is on full display and management's investments in technology are paying off. ""Innovation has always been our life blood at NIKE"" CEO John Donahoe said on the most recent earnings call.

Nike's desire to utilize technology to connect more with consumers is working. Its different digital applications are resonating extremely well. For example the SNKRS app which gives shoe fanatics access to new product releases and upcoming events hit $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2020. Donahoe believes SNKRS ""remains one of Nike's greatest competitive advantages.""

Technology is clearly becoming an increasingly important tool to drive higher brand recognition and engagement and Nike is riding this trend. The business has returned to growth following the pandemic's disruption and its impressive performance in e-commerce and in China indicate the company's long run isn't over.

The king of caffeinated beverages

Starbucks also suffered a setback due to the coronavirus but its business has not fully returned to pre-pandemic levels. Sales in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2020 (which ended Sept. 27) were 8.1% lower than the prior-year period. Despite this management still strongly believes in the company's long-term growth story.

Starbucks held its biennial investor day in December where CFO Patrick Grismer announced that he thinks Starbucks ""will reach approximately 55000 stores across 100 markets by the year 2030."" Although those of us in the U.S. view Starbucks' stores as ubiquitous this may not really be the case globally. Investors welcomed the news -- the stock popped 5% after the virtual event.

With nearly 33000 locations today this is quite an ambitious target and it would make Starbucks the largest food and beverage chain in the world. Similar to Nike Starbucks will rely on China for much of this growth. Fueled by openings of the Starbucks Now concept which are smaller-format retail outlets located in high-traffic areas the company is forecasted to have 6000 stores (up from the current 4700) in the country by the end of fiscal 2022.

Starbucks is also known for its outstanding rewards program. The company ended the most recent quarter with 19.3 million 90-day active members in the U.S. a 10% increase compared to the prior-year period. What's more remarkable is that these customers accounted for close to 50% of revenue. It's apparent that Starbucks like Nike has benefited greatly from using technology in its business model.

The final verdict

Nike and Starbucks were forced to shutter locations worldwide because of the coronavirus pandemic and have since recovered at different rates. Nike's business is back in growth mode while Starbucks improves with each passing quarter.

I think long-term investors would gain by adding both companies to their portfolios. These are two global businesses with exceptional brands that sell products consumers absolutely love. Furthermore it's evident that their growth will be bolstered by the smart use of technology to acquire and engage customers as well as continued progress in China.

But if I had to choose I'd give the slight edge to Starbucks simply due to valuation. The stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36 compared to Nike's 41 giving me just a little more comfort with the price being paid.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3NuZWFrZXJzL2EvYnJhbmRvbi1yaWNoYXJkL25pa2UtYnkteW91LWlkLXBnLTQtZGVzaWduc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 50 Best Nike By You PG 4 Designs,"Around this time last year Paul George debuted his fourth signature sneaker the Nike PG 4. The Tony Hardman design introduced a shrouded upper to the line while retaining the same low to the ground feel of its predecessors and implementing the new Air Strobel tooling for performance and support. It also marked the beginning of a new chapter in George's career as he suited up for his first season with the Los Angeles Clippers.

Shortly after its launch the PG 4 was added to Nike by You the brand's customization platform. In addition to the usual choice of colors lettering and numbering designers could choose different materials for the shroud along with the speed graphic option. With an affordable $130 price tag PG fans quickly took to the platform to work on colorways of their own. Before the PG 5 officially hits retail this week here's a rundown of the 50 Best Nike By You PG 4 Designs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdxLW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvLnVrL2Zhc2hpb24vYXJ0aWNsZS9uaWtlLWR1bmtzLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get ready for another year of Nike Dunks,"Courtesy of Nike

The Dunk will hit the ground running in the new year with a stream of general release drops. The first three colorways of the Dunk Low will arrive next week the type of classic and expected Nike fare: black and white red and grey and sail and coast. In February things get turned up a notch with another Dunk Low in black and hyper cobalt. And then in March the Dunk High drops in a white and orange blaze.

None of these sneakers will come with buzzy designer co-signs or an ultra-rare release. And they don't really need to. Over last year Nike laid the foundation for the Dunk's rise building the hype and demand through strategic drops and big-deal collaborations. It's a move the brand has done repeatedly: generate excitement and buzz for a silhouette and then release a limitless supply for the masses who couldn't get their hands on the rare stuff.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC1wbHVzLWRqNDYwMS0xMDAtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Max Plus Pink Snakeskin DJ4601-100 Release Date - SBD,"Nike is getting exotic with their latest edition of the Air Max Plus by adding “Pink Snakeskin” textures.

Could Nike SB be considering a “J-Pack 2.0” series of colorways? Official images of the Nike SB Dunk Low have emerged in “Court Purple” a brand new colorway that pairs up the regal hue on the sole and ankle wrap with a simple white/black upper. While not an exact mimic this composition does remind us of the Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG “Court Purple” that released in the Fall of 2018 although that version featured a purple flooded toe-box compared to the more OG-style white seen here. This leads us to ponder a possible “J-Pack 2.0” series which would see the best non-OG colorways in Air Jordan 1 history get the SB Dunk treatment. Which would you like to see? The Shattered Backboards seem like a must-see.

See the official images below and stay tuned for a release; the SB Dunk Court Purple is tentatively set to release in early 2021. In other early ’21 SB drops check out the Supreme SB Dunk Low in Hyper Royal.

It was not immediately clear how many UPS and Norfolk Southern personnel were affected by the leak of over 3000 files from occupational health provider Taylor Made Diagnostics on Jan. 8. But FreightWaves found multiple health records for employees from both firms in addition to multiple smaller trucking companies U.S. government agencies and defense contractors from as recently as December 2020.

“The security of our employees’ data is a priority for Norfolk Southern and a requirement for our vendors” Norfolk Southern spokesperson Jeff DeGraff told FreightWaves in an email Friday. “Norfolk Southern is looking into the issue but has no further comment at this time.”

The railway which employs nearly 25000 people and operates in 22 states would not say if it had been informed about the data breach.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL3Rob21hcy1zaGVsbGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEyNjI3NTEw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thomas Sheller Obituary (1930 - 2020) - Norfolk VA - The Virginian-Pilot,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pilotonline/name/thomas-sheller-obituary?id=12627510 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL3Rob21hcy1zaGVsbGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEyNjI3NTEw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlbnRyYWxtYWluZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9vcGluaW9ucy1kaWZmZXItb24tcG90ZW50aWFsLWltcGFjdC1hcy13YXRlcnZpbGxlLXJhaWwteWFyZC1pcy1zb2xkLXRvLWNzeC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinions differ on potential impact as Waterville rail yard is sold to CSX,"WATERVILLE — The Waterville rail yard dates back to the now-defunct Maine Central Railroad yet it — with its locomotive repair shop — remains integral to rail transportation in the Northeast.

Change could be coming to the sprawling yard however given the impending purchase of its parent company.

CSX Corp. is acquiring Massachusetts-based Pan Am Railways which owns the Waterville rail yard in a deal that has yet to finalized.

Pan Am formerly known as Guilford Transportation Industries bought Maine Central Railroad in 1983. Pan Am’s sale to CSX has statewide implications.

“The Waterville shops have a very strong reputation and I think it would certainly be very positive for Waterville and I think for the state of Maine if they remained open” said George O’Keefe economic development director for the town of Rumford and a longtime follower of the locomotive industry. “We’re not in a place where we have too much of that. There’s enough and we can make it work.”

O’Keefe said he is a firm believer in rail supporting the local economy. He also said the CSX merger is a significant opportunity for Maine industry.

CSX has a large facility in Selkirk New York and some are concerned business could be sent there. O’Keefe however said he expected increased intermodal activity — the shipment of freight by more than one carrier such as truck and rail — in Waterville.

In acquiring Billerica Massachusetts-based Pan Am CSX gets the largest regional Class II railroad in North America which has more than 1700 miles of track in six states and Canada.

Jacksonville Florida-based CSX has more than 21000 miles of track across the Northeast. The Maine portion of Pan Am includes more than 300 miles of track.

CSX is a Class I railroad meaning it is among the nation’s largest. There are eight Class I railroads in the United States including Amtrak.

CSX’s purchase of Pan Am Railways is subject to approval by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board and the company plans to complete its application soon a CSX spokesperson wrote in an email. Pan Am Railways Executive Vice President Cynthia Scarano directed a reporter’s inquiries to CSX.

Nathan Moulton director of the Maine Department of Transportation’s Rail Program wrote in an email that the operational details remain murky until CSX takes over Pan Am. Moulton said the MDOT has a meeting planned with CSX officials to discuss operations.

Once the transaction is finalized MDOT officials will have a better idea of the longer-term effects on Maine businesses. The transaction could take a while. One industry expert said CSX’s purchase of Pan Am will likely be fought by Norfolk Southern Railroad.

Moulton said he believed the direct service in Maine from CSX should provide more-efficient operations and transit times and access to more markets. Maine is a new state for CSX which will have subsidiaries in 23 states.

“We do need to ensure that good connections and interchanges with other rail carriers remain and are efficient so that all traffic moves efficiently not just the traffic that continues on in the CSX system” Moulton wrote. “If this does indeed happen then yes freight rail usage and business in Maine should grow.”

Patrick Strauch executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council said transactions like the CSX-Pan Am deal bring potential to connect more quickly with major markets. The Maine Forest Products Council has many paper and pulp mills as members such as Sappi Fine Paper North America in Skowhegan.

“If there are less links in the system and you’re part of a major line” Strauch said “that usually equates with less time to get to your destination.”

CSX said the acquisition of Pan Am will create more opportunities for the company’s existing customers and those of Pan Am. There are many large producers Pan Am serves across New England.

“We intend to bring CSX’s customer-centric operations and industry-leading reliability to shippers and industries served by Pan Am” the CSX spokesperson wrote. “We look forward to integrating Pan Am and the rail-served industries of the Northeast into CSX and to working in partnership with connecting railroads to provide exceptional supply chain solutions to New England and beyond.”

Adrian Dowling a South Portland resident and self-described New England railroad historian said CSX’s acquisition of Pan Am could have positive and negative impacts on Maine. Dowling said if Pan Am’s dispatchers are moved from Massachusetts to Florida there could be a problem with on-time passenger rail. Dowling also said the sale could positively benefit some of the state’s largest users of freight rail including paper mills but might not be as beneficial to smaller companies.

The CSX spokesperson also wrote the company’s model benefits passenger rail and shippers such as Amtrak which declined a request for comment.

The Amtrak Downeaster runs from Boston to Brunswick on nearly 80 miles of Pan Am track and there is speculation on how the purchase could impact commuter rail service.

The Lake Shore Limited train which is Amtrak’s Boston-to-Chicago service was on time just 41% of the time in 2018 and runs on CSX tracks. The Amtrak’s Downeaster reported 57.3% end point and 74.7% customer on-time performance in November according to a Northern New England Rail Passenger Authority report.

There have been safety concerns over the years involving CSX such as when alleged safety lapses were blamed in 2018 for a fatal Amtrak collision in South Carolina and a derailment in Virginia.

“CSX has a long history of prioritizing their own freight trains ahead of the Amtrak trains and commuter trains that run on CSX tracks” Dowling said. “That’s great for freight customers but not so great for passengers.”

Potential disadvantages include the railroad not being based in New England so CSX might not be as invested as Pan Am was in smaller New England customers. However CSX could also bring improved service according to those close to the rail industry.

An industry expert said CSX could sell assets north of Boston which was allowed by the 1980 Staggers Rail Act.

Consequently O’Keefe said CSX might invest in structural improvements to get through to the port of Saint John New Brunswick Canada. It could level the playing field for some Maine industries if rail service is improved to compete with bigger Canadian industries especially in forest products. In forest products Maine competes with Canadian National which is a Class I rail line like CSX.

“It’s already pretty good but if they do make investments in New England and Maine specifically it really is significant to industry” O’Keefe said. “There’s huge huge demand for (Maine’s) forest products lumber and food products. There’s a lot of potential there.”

“Family is who you choose…my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha…. our Divine Nine and my HBCU brothers and sisters.” With these words and more Senator Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic nomination for Vice President of the United States. Harris was giving an historic shout out to her college sorority and the Greek system at her alma mater Howard University.

It’s rare that a politician thanks a fraternity or sorority at such an important event. The popular image of Greek life in “Animal House” or “Legally Blonde” does not inspire. But AKA is not just any sorority.

In the Black community sororities play a far different role from what Greek life appears to be in the media. In her acceptance speech Vice President-elect Harris stressed the challenges ahead saying “We’ve got to do the work.” “Doing the work” also underlies the concept that Black sororities provide members with a lifelong commitment to community service and a source of inspiration expectation and support.

Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) was the first sorority for Black female students founded in 1908 and incorporated in 1913 at Howard University. AKA is one of the Divine Nine the nickname for the nine sororities and fraternities founded for Black students in the early 20th century primarily at HBCUs (historically Black colleges and universities). Many leading Black women in Chicago are members including Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle (AKA) and Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton (AKA). Cook County States Attorney Kimberly Foxx is a member of Delta Sigma Theta.

Harris might have been talking about not the new administration but AKA itself. One of the sorority’s five tenets is “to be of Service to All Mankind.” In fact service is what distinguishes all four sororities of the Divine Nine: Alpha Kappa Alpha Delta Sigma Theta Zeta Phi Beta and Sigma Gamma Rho.

Kimberly Evans Executive VP Northern Trust

Harris’ words resonated with Northern Trust executive Kimberly Evans “I felt the world shift a little bit she said.” Evans had virtually grown up with the Divine Nine. ”It started in elementary school” she said “it was always my teachers principals community activists people who organized for our church and food drives. I always thought it would be great if one day I could be that too.” She remembered that they always wore their fraternity or sorority gear sweatshirts and hats. “We still do that today” she said.

At the University of Illinois Evans had pledged Delta Sigma Theta. She said that during the recent election “We’d wear something in solidarity with Kamala.” All four sororities joined together for the common cause of voter registration. An Atlanta dance studio owner was inspired to create the nonpartisan “stroll to the polls” campaign that went viral uniting sorority sisters across the country.

Getting out the 2020 vote was the focus for attorney and WVON radio host Kimberley Egonmwan. She’s the social action chair for the Chicago chapter of the National Pan-Hellenic Council the organization supporting all Divine Nine organizations. Potential voters were encouraged to register vote and urge others to do so mindful of Covid-19. Voter pandemic cards were distributed reminding people to wear masks wash hands and use hand sanitizers. Many chapters provided rides to the polls.

A long-time member of AKA like many of her sorority sisters Egonmwan was aware of Black sororities growing up. “As a child my mother took me to many activities and a lot were run by women in the community who were members of these organizations…many were members of AKA. [I met one] when I was a debutante in the Chicago Links Cotillion” she recalled. When Egonmwan was at the University of Illinois AKA had no active chapter; she joined a year after graduating relatively common among the Divine Nine. “The draw for me is that it’s always been about the community service aspect… We celebrate lifelong sisterhood.”

The power of sorority sisterhood was not anything award-winning journalist Maudlyne Ihejirika experienced growing up. In fact she didn’t even know the sororities existed until she got to college. Born in Nigeria she was raised in Downers Grove and attended a Catholic elementary school; she discovered AKA as freshman at the University of Iowa. “The Black student union reached out to new students to let them know there was a community to support them” she recalled. She spent her freshman year meeting students from a variety of sororities and found that for a Black student at a predominantly white university they were key to her social life. “I did my research and learned that AKA best fitted my character and interests and values…at the time I pledged I learned that Maya Angelou was an honorary member and I wanted to be a journalist. She and member Toni Morrison were among my writing heroes.”

Journalist Maudlyne Ihejirika

Ihejirika credits AKA for her closest friends. “I was gifted with a bond that I could not have imagined. The women I pledged with became immediately family…the only competition was who could get the highest grades! We had to keep up our average.” Academic achievement led to professional achievement. With her B.A. in journalism from University of Iowa an M.S.J. from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University and an honorary Doctorate from Saint Xavier University she writes the long-form Sun-Times “Chicago Chronicles.” A frequent guest on television and radio news programs she’s currently president of the Chicago Journalists Association Charitable Fund.

For Ihejirika re-engagement with AKA came some years after college. “There was a point midway in my career where I felt like I needed to bounce some issues I was dealing with in corporate politics and fairness in the media off some accomplished women. I reached out to an AKA member…. and I was immediately able to plug into an instant mentor who continued to check in on me giving me advice. The resources were there.” She’s now actively involved in AKA events through friends in Bolingbrook and Chicago chapters. “The impact of the Divine Nine on the Black community in local and national arenas is exponential in terms of political and economic leadership and civil rights.”

For some families sorority membership is a powerful multi-generational tradition. Three generations of Satia Orange’s family have been members of Delta Sigma Theta. Her mother Ruthe Langley Marshall attended high school on the campus of Missouri’s Lincoln University and remained to get her degree and meet Orange’s father who would work as librarian at the college. Orange grew up across the street from Lincoln and like her mother attended high school on campus. She got to know the school well its sororities and fraternities and their songs and “steps.” Despite rumors that she would pledge AKA she followed her mother as a Delta.

It took Orange’s daughter Tiffani more determination to join. There was no chapter at her college St. Andrews Presbyterian College (now St. Andrews University) in Laurinberg North Carolina. Inspired by her mother and grandmother she was able to pledge at a regional Delta conference in Columbia South Carolina. As Orange looked on her daughter was pinned by her grandmother.

An older Delta member later fondly remembered Orange’s mother. “She’d give you ‘the look’ and you’d check to see that the seams of your hosiery were straight. [She taught us] to stand up and walk correctly to soften the voice… There was an expectation that you would look the part of a professional person.” Orange observed “The new generation is less concerned about whether your seams are straight…now the stress is on voting rights and tutoring kids.” Her daughter would finally enjoy sorority life in the Delta chapter at the University of Iowa where she earned her MBA.

Ruthe Langley Marshall

Like her late father (later dean of libraries at Eastern Michigan University) Orange trained as a librarian and served as Director Literacy & Outreach at the American Library Association winning its Distinguished Librarian award. She has lived in many cities in her career including Milwaukee Winston Salem and Chicago. In each place she has found friends through Delta Sigma Theta who have helped her in so many ways. “It’s very important when you move into a community especially an urban community…You meet women of all ages all interests all projects…[it might be] a soup kitchen or mentoring students; there’s something you can connect to.”

Orange salutes the Delta commitment to community. “Even at 78 [I} have a level of pride at seeing how they are making a difference all over the country. It’s from the day you are initiated until the day you’re gone.”

Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has often spoken about being a role model for little girls of color. Her sorority sisters will no doubt ensure that these little girls also know that women like Harris have the advantage of being part of a powerful and supportive sisterhood.

Maudlyne Ihejirika says “AKA is one of the best things that I ever did for myself. AKA women are strong are driven are competitive are persistent and beautiful. AKA is beyond proud to have one of our members in the White House…it’s historic for Black women.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3dpbGxpYW0taG9iZ29vZC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02OTA5Njg10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,William Hobgood Obituary (1932 - 2021) - Dallas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.dallasnews.com/us/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/name/william-hobgood-obituary?id=6909685 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3dpbGxpYW0taG9iZ29vZC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02OTA5Njg10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWxmYXN0dGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvaGVhbHRoL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzL25lYXJseS1oYWxmLW9mLWFudHJpbS1hcmVhLWhvc3BpdGFsLXBhdGllbnRzLXRlc3QtcG9zaXRpdmUtZm9yLWNvdmlkLTE5LzM5OTc3NTEzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly half of Antrim Area Hospital patients test positive for Covid-19,"Northern Trust chief executive Jennifer Welsh said dealing with virus has come at ‘great cost’ to health service

Almost 50% of all patients in Antrim Area Hospital have tested positive for Covid-19 according to the chief executive of the Northern Trust.

There are currently 840 Covid inpatients across Northern Ireland’s hospitals with 62 of them in intensive care.

Hospitals here are operating at 95% capacity.

Speaking on BBC NI’s Sunday Politics programme Northern Trust chief Jennifer Welsh explained that as of Sunday morning 30 patients in Antrim Area Hospital’s emergency department have received a decision to admit.

However there are no beds to accommodate them - 24 of those patients have been waiting for more than 12 hours.

Ms Welsh explained that it takes more staff to help care for Covid inpatients and outlined that “if almost half of the patients in Antrim are Covid positive I need more staff to cope with that”.

“At the peak of the first wave across both Antrim and Causeway hospitals the highest number of Covid positive patients that we had was 73 and then in November in wave two the highest number that we had was 102” stated Ms Welsh.

“Here we are beyond that peaking on Thursday at 202 patients. We have just dropped below that just slightly.”

She added that the five health trusts have been working together to help cope with the influx of Covid-19 patients.

“You’ll recall that Antrim was in significant difficulty mid-December with many ambulances - 17 in total - waiting outside at one point” said Ms Welsh.

“We got signifiant help and support from colleagues right across the system particularly the Belfast Trust and South Eastern Trust.

“You saw the footage last week in terms of the pressures at Craigavon and Daisy Hill and again the system has pulled together to transfer patients to the South West Acute Hospital to the Ulster [Hospital] and into the Belfast hospitals as well.

“We are pulling together as an entire system to make sure that we can deliver the care urgently to those who need it.”

Ms Welsh explained that Northern Ireland’s trusts have only been able to deal with the surge in patients because so many other services have been stood down.

“If I think about the Covid patients that we have in our hospitals at the moment - a lot of very sick people needing enhanced respiratory support and obviously some of them needing intensive care” she said.

“So it is a higher level of nursing a higher level of medical input more interventions and more kit.

“A lot of these people even in intensive care are needing other organ support.”

Appealing to the public to take care Ms Welsh said it is clear that the figures are starting to reduce but warned we are “a long way from being out of the woods”.

“The Covid numbers are just about on the turn from the perspective of new positive cases” she continued.

“There’s the lag time then into those needing enhanced respiratory support and that’s what we’re experiencing just at the moment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NsZXR0ZXIuY28udWsvbmV3cy9wZW9wbGUvYWxtb3N0LWhhbGYtb2YtYWxsLWFudHJpbS1hcmVhLWhvc3BpdGFsLXBhdGllbnRzLWhhdmUtY292aWQtMTktMzEwMzQwNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Almost half of all Antrim Area Hospital patients have COVID-19,"Watch more of our videos on Shots!

“We have been able to deliver some red flag cancer surgery at Causeway but we would like to do more.”

Despite these emergency measures already in place the worst of the current surge is only expected to arrive this week.

She added: “We are not going to get out of this quickly. It’s going to be a challenge for us as a system.

“It’s been building from October.”

“We’re not yet at the peak of intensive care admissions and we expect that this week.

“Antrim has doubled its intensive care beds from seven to 14 in anticipation of the coming surge - 11 are already being used.

“All hospitals have doubled their ICU footprint. There are more than 160 inpatients in Antrim Area Hospital.”

A second B-21 Raider bomber is under construction at Northrop Grumman’s facility at the United States Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale California while the first one slowly takes shape ahead of its expected roll-out in early 2022. This program update was provided by Randall Walden director of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office during a recent interview with Air Force Magazine.

The B-21 was previously expected to fly for the first time later this year in December however it looks like that the plans changed with Walden saying that a first flight in mid-2022 is now a “good bet” adding that the first bomber even if it didn’t reach the final assembly stage yet is slowly taking shape and “really starting to look like a bomber”. Maj. Gen. Mark E. Weatherington commander of the 8th Air Force and of the Joint Global Strike Operations Center at Barksdale Air Force Base also anticipated this during the Air Force Association Air Space & Cyber Conference 2020.

As for the second bomber Walden said that it is being built mainly for structural testing: “The second one is really more about structures and the overall structural capability. We’ll go in and bend it we’ll test it to its limits make sure that the design and the manufacturing and the production line make sense.”

The lessons learned during the building process of the first Raider are being applied to the second one with the work progressing much more efficiently now that the workers are not restricted anymore to work based just off the blueprint’s assumptions. Also there has been an increase in the workforce as Boeing 737 MAX workers from Spirit Aviation of Wichita which is supplying aerostructures for the B-21 were shifted to the B-21 program avoiding the risk of losing their jobs after the order for the 737 MAX collapsed following two horrific crashes in 2018 and 2019.

This workforce increase also helped to compensate some of the delays caused by the COVID pandemic. Walden mentioned that the program is working with the suppliers to ensure that a slower parts delivery does not delay the aircraft production.

Obviously even with all the precautions there could always be some surprises along the way especially when working on a complex program like the B-21. Walden said that the surprises are expected and they are ready to solve them as they present themselves. For an instance one of these surprises was discovered in 2018 when some thrust issues related to the bomber’s inlet and serpentine ducting were noticed and promptly solved after some basic changes to the design.

The team working on the B-21 however is trying to anticipate these problems. One of the means used to do this is a business-class jet used as avionics testbed to test hardware and software before transferring them to the B-21 similarly to what Lockheed Martin did with the Cooperative Avionics Testbed aircraft better known as CATbird while developing the F-35 Lightning II or the Flying Test Bed used while developing the F-22 Raptor. According to Walden the jet is flying “real B-21 software” assessing the integration of sensors and code into the future bomber test fleet and is making good progress with satisfying results giving the team “a lot of confidence” about powering up the first aircraft for its maiden flight next year.

The new bomber will be ready for service around 2026 or 2027 according to Lt. Gen. James C. Dawkins Jr. Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration. Maj. Gen. Weatherington said during the vASC2020 that the bomber is reported on track and on schedule even if the first flight has been delayed and it will also have a reduced unit cost than previously predicted which however has not been specified. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018 that the cost of developing and buying the first 100 aircraft should be $80 billion in 2016 dollars. The Air Force plans to get at least 100 Raiders.

The development program is highly secretive with few info being disclosed. Earlier last year the Air Force published three new renderings of the B-21 four years after the first one giving for the first time a glimpse of the shape of the new bomber which will have a lot of things in common with the B-2 Spirit. You can find a more detailed analysis in this previous article here at The Aviationist.

When it will finally enter service the B-21 Raider will replace the B-1B Lancer and the B-2A Spirit while also increasing the bomber fleet from the current 156 to the goal of 220 total bombers. The ability to meet this goal is closely related to the B-21 Raider development as the Air Force is making sure that the aircraft will be affordable sustainable and rapidly modifiable/upgradeable and until the aircraft is ready the B-1B readiness the B-52H engine replacement program and the B-2A fleet deterioration.

The B-52H Stratofortress will actually continue to serve alongside the B-21 through 2050 remaining still relevant thanks to the new stand-off capability added with the introduction of hypersonic weapons but also thanks to major upgrades that will help the bomber to meet the demands of future combat scenarios it may encounter mainly new engines radar weapons and connectivity. Even if it’s 60 years old the B-52H fleet is reported to be in very good health with a 100% mission ready crew status on almost a regular basis.

Recently the Air Force begun planning for constructions that will support the beddown of the newest Air Force stealth bomber with the Air Force Civil Engineering Center and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers explaining the types quantities and scale of projects anticipated during a virtual B-21 Industry Day on January 11 at the Rapid City Military Advisory Coalition including a low-observable restoration facility a wash rack and general maintenance hangar and a mission operations planning facility.

The location of the event was not casual as the nearby Ellsworth Air Force Base (South Dakota) is the preferred location for the first B-21 main operating base with Dyess AFB (Texas) being the alternative. The Air Force stated that these bases were selected in order to minimize the impact to operations and communities maximizing at the same time the reuse of existing infrastructure and reducing the overall costs to base the B-21. The final basing decision will be made this year after the completion of the Environmental Impact Statement giving the green light to begin the actual B-21 beddown construction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd2Fycmlvcm1hdmVuLmNvbS9zZWEvdXMtamFwYW4ta29yZWEtYXVzdHJhbGlhLWNvdW50ZXItY2hpbmEtd2l0aC1taXNzaWxlLWtpbGxpbmctYWVnaXMtcmFkYXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Japan Korea Australia Counter China With Missile-Killing Aegis Radar,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://warriormaven.com/sea/us-japan-korea-australia-counter-china-with-missile-killing-aegis-radar on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd2Fycmlvcm1hdmVuLmNvbS9zZWEvdXMtamFwYW4ta29yZWEtYXVzdHJhbGlhLWNvdW50ZXItY2hpbmEtd2l0aC1taXNzaWxlLWtpbGxpbmctYWVnaXMtcmFkYXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Zsb3JpZGEvMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9uYXNhLWN1dHMtc2hvcnQtaG90LWZpcmUtdGVzdC1vZi1hcnRlbWlzLWktcm9ja2V0cy1jb3JlLXN0YWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA cuts short hot fire test of Artemis I rocket's core stage,"ORLANDO — NASA lit up all four engines on the massive core stage for the Artemis I rocket that will travel to the moon at the end 2021 but cut off the test after a minute into an eight-minute test.

The burn took place after 5 p.m. with the stage hooked up in the B-2 Test Stand at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.

The hot fire was aiming to simulate the thrust the core stage of the Space Launch System rocket generating 1.6 million pounds burning through more than 700000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen for more than eight minutes.

But NASA shut it down after just a minute. A briefing on the test was expected later Saturday.

It’s the eighth and final test in the series of Green Run tests for the core stage since arriving to Stennis. Once completed NASA will analyze data to confirm the core stage is ready to fly refurbish it to some degree and then ship it to Kennedy Space Center.

If all goes well that will happen in February as NASA is still targeting November 2021 for launch of the Artemis I.

Once at KSC the 212-foot-tall core stage will be stacked in the Vehicle Assembly Building with the rest of the SLS components including the external boosters and Orion capsule already on site.

The core stage the product of primary contractor Boeing with its four RS-25 engines refurbished by Aerojet Rocketdyne from the Space Shuttle program will be combined with two side boosters from NASA partner Northrop Grumman that together will produce about 8.8 million pounds of thrust making it the most powerful rocket to launch from Earth.

Artemis I will be an uncrewed mission to the moon but actually traveling farther from Earth than any ship ever built for humans has ever flown before about 280000 miles away.

NASA’s SLS schedule still has Artemis I as early as November with Artemis II a crewed mission around the moon without landing by 2023 and then a 2024 flight that aims to put the first woman on the moon. Those targets though were part of the Trump administration’s push and could change under the new Biden administration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd2Fycmlvcm1hdmVuLmNvbS9zZWEvbmF2eS1naG9zdC1mbGVldC1kcm9uZS1zYWlscy1uZWFybHktNS0wMDAtbWlsZXMtYXV0b25vbW91c2x50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Navy ""Ghost Fleet"" Drone Sails Nearly 5000 Miles Autonomously",ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://warriormaven.com/sea/navy-ghost-fleet-drone-sails-nearly-5-000-miles-autonomously on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd2Fycmlvcm1hdmVuLmNvbS9zZWEvbmF2eS1naG9zdC1mbGVldC1kcm9uZS1zYWlscy1uZWFybHktNS0wMDAtbWlsZXMtYXV0b25vbW91c2x50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd2Fycmlvcm1hdmVuLmNvbS9mdXR1cmUtd2VhcG9ucy9haXItZm9yY2UtZGVjb3ktamFtbWVyLXByb3RlY3RzLW5vbi1zdGVhbHRoeS1wbGFuZXMtZnJvbS1haXItZGVmZW5zZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Air Force Decoy ""Jammer"" Protects Non-Stealthy Planes from Air Defenses",ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://warriormaven.com/future-weapons/air-force-decoy-jammer-protects-non-stealthy-planes-from-air-defenses on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd2Fycmlvcm1hdmVuLmNvbS9mdXR1cmUtd2VhcG9ucy9haXItZm9yY2UtZGVjb3ktamFtbWVyLXByb3RlY3RzLW5vbi1zdGVhbHRoeS1wbGFuZXMtZnJvbS1haXItZGVmZW5zZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

A restricted-attendance audience of 10830 race fans clustered in pod seating by families and groups cheered Barcia’s incredible third-consecutive opening round victory.

Barcia fought off Team Honda HRC’s Ken Roczen for nearly the entire race while Red Bull KTM’s Marvin Musquin returned to Supercross with a solid third-place finish.

In the Eastern Regional 250SX Class a division that traditionally begins later in the season Monster Energy Star Racing Yamaha’s Christian Craig started 2021 with his first victory in five years.

It had been 25 years since the Monster Energy Supercross series kicked off outside of California and coincidentally 25 years since a rider had won three consecutive opening rounds (Jeremy McGrath in Orlando) but in Texas Justin Barcia in his 100th Monster Energy Supercross start cemented a place in the history books by grabbing the victory of what was the debut race for the GASGAS team and GASGAS Supercross machine.

At the gate drop Musquin got the holeshot on the 22-rider field but Barcia squeezed into the lead immediately. Honda’s Ken Roczen worked his way through the top five to reach second place with over seventeen minutes left on the race clock; Roczen stayed close and with five minutes and one lap remaining launched three intense pass attempts.

Barcia held his composure and track position forcing Roczen to eventually settle for the runner-up spot.

The Eastern Regional 250SX class kicked its season off with great racing excitement. Rockstar Energy Husqvarna Factory Racing’s R.J. Hampshire nabbed the holeshot but his time at the front lasted less than one minute before Christian Craig got past and pulled away to a comfortable lead.

Behind Hampshire battled hard to stay up front but Monster Energy Kawasaki’s Austin Forkner got past just after the midway point and Craig’s teammate Monster Energy Star Racing Yamaha’s Colt Nichols made his way into a podium finish after rounding the first lap just inside the top five.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbW90b2Nyb3NzYWN0aW9ubWFnLmNvbS9hbXAvYmVzdC1pbi10aGUtcGl0cy1wcmVzcy1kYXktcmlkaW5nLTIwMjEtaG91c3Rvbi1zdXBlcmNyb3NzLTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BEST IN THE PITS & PRESS DAY RIDING | 2021 HOUSTON SUPERCROSS 1 (UPDATED),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='motocrossactionmag.com', port=443): Read timed out.

This news was discovered by YouTuber Dapz who also confirmed the existence of the GT 1010 via a live chat with an Nvidia representative. The GT 1010 is aimed towards very basic graphical workloads like 2D / 3D acceleration and Home Theaters so don't expect this card to be in our Best Graphics Cards of 2021 lineup. But the GT 1010 should be replacing the much older Kepler-based GT 710 with a healthy boost to performance. Luckily you should be able to snag a GT 1010 in the future as Nvidia's GT series GPUs are largely unaffected by the current graphics card shortage.

If you are wondering why Nvidia is resurrecting the Pascal architecture it's due to how the GT series of cards operate in Nvidia's lineup. The GT series is designed around basic tasks like 2D/3D acceleration and providing additional display outputs for systems. Tasks like these can already be done with older architectures like Pascal so implementing a much newer architecture into a GT card really isn't necessary.

The GT 1010 features the same GP108 core as the GT 1030 but disables a third of the shader cores to give the GT 1010 a total of 256 shader cores to work with (compared to the GT 1030 with 384 shader cores).

For memory the GT 1010 will come with one memory config 2GB of GDDR5. Unlike the GT 1030 which comes in both GDDR5 and DDR4 variants.

For power the GT 1010 has a TDP of just 30Ws with a recommend PSU wattage of 200W so this GPU should be compatible with almost any modern PC or pre-built that has an open PCI-E slot to spare.

Unfortunately we still don't have any information on an MSRP; but our best guess is to expect the GT 1010 to cost similar to that of the GT 710 it's replacing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9udmlkaWEtYm9hcmQtcGFydG5lcnMtZnVydGhlci1jb25maXJtLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwNjAtc3BlY2lmaWNhdGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA board partners further confirm GeForce RTX 3060 specifications,"Confusing announcement of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060

Just two weeks before the official announcement of the GeForce RTX 3060 NVIDIA changed the specifications of the new SKU from 3840 CUDA cores to 3584. The manufacturer’s shift to the lower-end GA106 variant has clearly caused confusion among AIBs.

Official render of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Source: NVIDIA

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 debuted at CES 2021 as the first GA106 based graphics card. NVIDIA officially did not disclose the GPU model of the new graphics cards nor when exactly would it card be available. However a few add-in-board partners have provided more information on the new SKU.

NVIDIA did reveal the clock speeds on their website but for some reason the values were rounded up and thus not very accurate. However thanks to AIBs we have learned that the card default clock is 1320/1777 MHz (base and boost). Some AIBs were not yet ready to list the clock speeds due to the fact that their cards are factory overclocked and still under evaluation however they seem certain that the memory speed will remain at 15 Gbps.

Only one board partner (Galax) confirmed that the RTX 3060 features GA106-300 GPU while Gainward confirmed that the GPU is 8nm. This would prove that all three Ampere GPU are based on 8nm architecture and manufactured by Samsung.

PNY and PALIT appear to agree on RTX 3060’s memory capacity power consumption and CUDA core count however manufacturers disagree on clock speeds and the maximum bandwidth of the new SKU. We have not been able to confirm why PNY lists specifications that are so much different from other AIBs but we believe that the specifications are based on a different SKU that wasn’t released yet (RTX 3060 6GB) thus the listed specs are in fact a mistake:

A confusing official RTX 3060 teaser

The official RTX 3060 teaser video showcases a new RTX 30 graphics card design likely to be a render of a reference RTX 3060. It is unclear if NVIDIA has any plans to sell this reference design as Founders Edition but since official slides did not feature any pictures of the card itself it would appear that RTX 3060 is an AIB-only launch.

The teaser features GA102 GPU instead of GA106. The number of memory modules does not appear to correspond to RTX 3060 either. We’re not sure which card is being shown here as a part of the RTX 3060 teaser video but this certainly is not the card in question.

NVIDIA officially declared that GeForce RTX 3060 will be available in late February. The card will cost at least 329 USD.

The GT 1010 is a Pascal card featuring the 14 nm GP108 GPU similar to the GT 1030. The GT 1010 has only 256 CUDA cores enabled supports 2 GB GDDR5 VRAM and has a TDP of 30 W. Availability information is not known yet.

4 Reviews

Update (01/18): TechPowerUp has updated their specifications to indicate the TDP as 30 W which is about the same as the GT 1030. The same has been updated in the headline abstract and the article. Readers may kindly note.

NVIDIA is apparently not fully done and dusted with the Pascal architecture yet. The company seems to have clandestinely launched a GT 1010 GPU a couple of days ago and no one even knew about it. Search results for the GT 1010 GPU throw up few relevant results at this point. However the GT 1010 is indicated on NVIDIA's official driver download page. So what really is the GT 1010 and when can you get it?

The first report that a GT 1010 card actually exists came from user Dapz's YouTube video who happened to have spotted the card's name on the NVIDIA driver download page. Dapz contacted NVIDIA customer support via live chat to which he received a response in the affirmative that such a card indeed exists. However the rep said that the card was just announced not released. The rep neither confirmed any specifications nor could give a release date.

TechPowerUp however has managed to put up the specifications of the NVIDIA GeForce GT 1010. According to the site the GT 1010 is based on a GP108 GPU fabbed on the 14 nm process. The GP108 has a die area of 74 mm2 and is comprised of 1800 million transistors. Essentially the GT 1010 is the same GPU as the GT 1030 with some CUDA cores disabled. While the the GT 1030 offered 384 CUDA cores the GT 1010 will offer only 256 (i.e. two streaming multiprocessors).

The GT 1010 supports 2 GB of GDDR5 VRAM on a 64-bit memory interface. The base clock of the GPU is 1228 MHz and can boost up to 1468 MHz. Additionally the card features 16 texture mapping units (TMUs) 16 raster operation pipelines (ROPs) and a TDP of 30 W which means it can run on just PCIe power without the need for power connectors.

It is not yet clear whether the GT 1010 will be available for OEM systems alone or for the general public as well. While such a cut-down Pascal GPU may seem odd in 2021 NVIDIA clearly thinks otherwise and sees a potential market for it. Who knows we may even seen a GT 1020 as well to complete the series.

All of these graphics cards are expected to launch in the coming months however new information regarding the postponed nature of the RTX 3080 Ti graphics card has also surfaced in the rumor mill.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti RTX 3050 Ti RTX 3060 & RTX 3050 Graphics Cards Imminent Submitted To The EEC By PALIT

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is the only graphics card in the submitted list that has been confirmed since before the GeForce RTX 30 series launch. This graphics card was abandoned repurposed and then delayed as per the rumor mill. The latest rumors seemed to suggest that NVIDIA will launch the card sometime in January but that's not the case anymore as at CES the company only confirmed the GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB model.

The card was later suggested to launch in February though that also doesn't seem to be the case anymore so while the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti may launch we don't have an exact date for this card. It could be due to a shortage of DRAM and NVIDIA focusing on getting a better supply of the existing 30 series cards than offering more premium SKUs.

With that said Videocardz has spotted several unreleased NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series cards that include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GeForce RTX 3050 Ti GeForce RTX 3060 6 GB & GeForce RTX 3050 over at EEC. The submission was made by PALIT for its upcoming lineup. The full list of those cards can be seen in the table below:

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications

NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 Ti FE (Founders Edition) graphics card is expected to feature the PG133-SKU15 PCB design and the GA102-250-KD-A1 graphics core. The GA102-250 GPU has also changed since the last time we saw them and is now exactly the same as the GeForce RTX 3090 at 10496 FP32 CUDA cores.

As for memory the card will feature 20 GB of GDDR6X memory. Unlike the 19.5 Gbps speeds of the RTX 3090 the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is said to retain the same memory speeds as the RTX 3080 at 19 Gbps. Since we are getting a 20 GB bus interface NVIDIA will be using a 320-bit bus interface which equals a total bandwidth of 760 GB/s. TGP for the card is set to be the same as the RTX 3080 at 320 Watts. That's definitely needed to feed the extra cores so NVIDIA might have to optimize the clocks a bit here.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications

The GeForce RTX 3060 is suggested to feature the GA106-300 GPU which is expected to feature 3584 FP32 cores in a total of 28 SM units. The graphics card will make use of the PG190 SKU by board partners which are both GA104 and GA106 pin-compatible. Both 12 GB and 6 GB variants are likely to feature the same DRAM specs clocking in at 15 Gbps for a combined bandwidth of 360.0 GB/s.

Considering that the 12 GB variant starts at $329 US it is expected that the 6 GB variant should be priced at $279 US.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications

Just like the GeForce RTX 3060 the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti will also be featuring the GA106 GPU but a cut-down configuration. The card is expected to be based on the PG190 SKU (stock) board which will be different than the 60 variant that the RTX 3060 will utilize. The GPU is expected to come with 3072 FP32 cores in a total of 24 SM units.

The GeForce RTX 3050 Ti is surprisingly going to feature a 6 GB GDDR6 memory interface too which is a big upgrade over its 4 GB predecessors. This suggests a 192-bit bus interface and we can also expect similar bandwidth numbers from the card if it ends up utilizing 15 Gbps memory dies. The card is expected to feature a price point of around $200 US.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications

The GeForce RTX 3050 is suggested to feature the GA107-300 GPU which seems to be the most entry-level Ampere GPU at this point in desktop graphics cards. Only time will tell if we will see something even lower-end like the GA108 GPU but the RTX 3050 leaves little room for that. The card is expected to feature 2304 FP32 cores in a total of 18 SM units and is suggested to feature a 90W TGP.

RTX 3050 GA107-300 2304FP32 90W TGP — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) November 9 2020

This would mean that the GeForce RTX 3050 will require an external 6-pin connector to boot unlike its predecessor the GeForce GTX 1650 which conformed to a 75W TGP and didn't require any plug to boot in several custom variants. The GeForce RTX 3050 should feature a 128-bit bus interface & up to 4 GB of GDDR6 memory. We are likely to see speeds of 14 Gbps on the card but that remains to be confirmed. In terms of pricing the GeForce RTX 3050 is expected to carry a sub-$200 US price of around $149 US.

Marathon Petroleum Occidental Petroleum and the employee political action committees for ConocoPhillips and BP temporarily froze their contributions. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are reviewing their donations. Even energy industry association spokespersons for the American Petroleum Institute the Independent Petroleum Association of America the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers as well as a leader of the Koch network said the attack on the Capitol will factor into their future giving.

Those who have spent years confronting fossil fuel industry-funded disinformation campaigns raising alarms about the climate crisis are unimpressed with the moves. The origin of the storming of the Capitol was a series of lies and there is no indication that the fossil fuel industry is taking a meaningful stance against high-risk deceit.

“They have been funding disinformation and anti-climate politicians for a very long time.”

In many ways fossil fuel companies laid the groundwork for the widespread acceptance of lies big enough to cause an existential threat to democracy’s survival — even humanity’s. “Lying has become a habit” said science historian Naomi Oreskes whose book with Eric Conway “Merchants of Doubt” documents how veterans of the tobacco industry’s misinformation efforts seeded climate denial among the media and lawmakers.

“They have been funding disinformation and anti-climate politicians for a very long time” she said over email of the fossil fuel industry. Oreskes said reconsidering political donations for election misinformation is a belated gesture: “A day late and a dollar short. Or rather three decades late and hundreds of millions of dollars short.”

Meanwhile the industry still has not come close to fully divesting from nor making amends for their spread of lethal climate disinformation.

To climate scientist Michael Mann the fossil fuel groups’ announcements that they will review political giving serves to evade attention from the fact that during the Trump administration the oil and gas agenda was supercharged by the racist rhetoric and lies that swayed elections in the direction of their favored candidates. Indeed never has the fossil fuel industry’s agenda been carried to fruition so completely as it was over the past four years achieved using what Mann described to The Intercept as “red meat” thrown out for the racist right including election disinformation.

“It is the fossil fuel industry the front groups that they fund along with plutocrats like the Koch brothers — these are the groups that have been pulling the strings that have been throwing out the red meat that have been instigating this racially motivated treasonous rebellion by the disaffected base of the Republican Party” said Mann. “They’re playing with fire and it’s almost like they don’t really care about democracy.”

Links To Election Deniers

The fossil fuel companies will presumably be reexamining donations to politicians who supported the “Stop the Steal” movement to overturn election results. Some 139 U.S. representatives and eight senators voted against certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s win including lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas who has received extensive contributions from some of the oil and gas companies now denouncing the Capitol attack. Perhaps they will also reconsider future contributions to President Donald Trump himself who incited the insurrection and received $14696347 from the oil and gas industry for the 2020 election cycle according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Many more individuals and groups would have to be included in a comprehensive audit of the fossil fuel industry’s involvement in the events leading up to the storming of the Capitol. Among those listed as coalition partners on the March to Save America website which called on Trump supporters to defend the president was the Rule of Law Defense Fund a dark-money group started by the Republican Attorneys General Association.

Fossil fuel companies like Koch Industries and Exxon have donated to the attorneys general association and groups backed by the industry — like the Koch brothers’ Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and the Edison Electric Institute — have directly contributed to the Rule of Law Defense Fund. The Rule of Law Defense Fund even went so far as to put out robocalls promoting the march as Documented reported.

Also listed on the march’s website was Turning Point USA which recently entered into a partnership with the Koch-backed American Legislative Exchange Council. ALEC as the group is known brings together lobbyists and lawmakers to promote industry friendly legislation at the state level. Turning Point and ALEC are working together to place right-wing students on university boards of regents according to reporting by the Center for Media and Democracy. Koch-linked groups also helped mobilize this summer’s reopen protests — a movement that significantly overlapped with Stop the Steal.

Meanwhile the Twitter account for the climate denial website Climate Depot tweeted on January 6: “Striking fear in politicians is not a bad thing.” A subsequent tweet said “Thomas Jefferson: ‘The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” Climate Depot is run by the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow a think tank that the fossil fuel industry has funded in the past. Its Twitter was just one among several climate denier accounts that DeSmog documented supporting the Stop the Steal movement or spreading disinformation in the aftermath of the Capitol attack.

Big Lie of Climate Denial

Mann the climate scientist pointed to parallels between the industry’s attempt to distance itself from election misinformation and its recent move to steer away from all-out climate denial. “They’ve done the same thing with climate denialism as it has become untenable to deny that climate change is real and happening” he said.

The story of the climate lie goes back to the 1980s. In the early part of the decade a task force of fossil fuel industry representatives was meeting regularly to talk about the emerging climate science they were helping produce. Just as the science was becoming clear the American Petroleum Institute and companies like Exxon Mobil began pouring money into disinformation. To cast doubt on climate science the industry lobbied funded new organizations published ads paid for studies bought scientists who would act as media pundits and of course lavished millions of dollars on politicians who would advance their cause.

As a young scientist and author of a key study showing that recent high temperatures were aberrations in the historical record Mann became a target of the industry’s denial machine. Media pundits and politicians attempted to smear his credibility. He received death threats.

Sen. Jim Inhofe R-Okla. who is among the politicians who have received the highest donations from the fossil fuel industry went so far as to call for Mann to be investigated as a criminal.

By the mid-aughts under pressure from scientists environmentalists civil society and shareholders the industry began to distance itself from denial. But the lies were well rooted by then in part because of how well they fit into dreams of unfettered capitalism championed by the right. (Oreskes the science historian and her co-author Conway have a forthcoming book “The Magic of the Marketplace: The True History of a False Idea” which will focus on how ideas about free market fundamentalism helped normalize misinformation.)

Meanwhile the fossil fuel industry continued to donate money to politicians who purveyed climate lies. A 2019 analysis by the Center for American Progress Action Fund of the outgoing 116th Congress counted 150 Republican members who did not believe that human activity causes climate change. They’d collectively accepted $68 million in donations from the fossil fuel industry.

“They haven’t given up in their effort to block the clean energy transition and keep us addicted to fossil fuels. They just changed their tactics.”

And Trump himself perhaps fossil fuel firms’ all-time biggest champion accepted more than $14 million from the oil and gas industry for his reelection campaign. Over the course of his administration Trump dismantled much of the existing government infrastructure for confronting the climate crisis and promoted outright deniers to positions of power.

Mann’s book “The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet” published this week argues that the industry never truly quit promoting climate disinformation. “They haven’t given up in their effort to block the clean energy transition and keep us addicted to fossil fuels” he said. “They just changed their tactics to tactics they think they can get away with.” He pointed to fossil fuel industry efforts to derail state-level policies to incentivize renewable energy development bolster false solutions like geoengineering spread the idea that the climate problem is about individual lifestyle choices and promote a sense of doom that nothing can really be done about the climate crisis — which Mann argues is simply untrue.

What should the industry do if it truly wants to make amends for sowing chaos? “That’s easy” said Oreskes. “Stop funding and fomenting disinformation stop exploring for new oil gas and coal reserves and start working on a new business model that shifts to renewable energy or something else entirely.”

“I think it is tragic that it took an insurrection for them to rethink their strategy” she said. “I hope this will prompt a deeper self-examination. An awful lot is at stake here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIxLTAxLTE2L3lvdXItd2Vla2VuZC1yZWFkaW5nLW1vc3QtYW1lcmljYW5zLWNhbi10LXdhaXQtZm9yLXRydW1wLXMtZXhpdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Your Weekend Reading: Most Americans Can't Wait for Trump's Exit,"U.S. President Donald Trump is counting down the final days of his tumultuous term in the White House one that is concluding with a domestic crisis unmatched in American history. Most in the U.S. want the Republican real estate developer to disappear from politics. Shunned by businesses and banks for his role in the U.S. Capitol riots he reportedly plans to live at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida (though some locals don’t want him). Bloomberg Opinion columnist Timothy O’Brien writes that while Trump may be worried about his brand he should be more worried about his cash. In Washington preparations for President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration have—thanks to the Jan. 6 attack by white supremacists and other Trump followers—turned downtown into an armed camp. Some state capitols may soon look that way too as governors prepare to face down far-right threats.

His Instagram is full of photos of raw meat grilled ribs pigs’ heads and big knives. For one photo of a grill he posted: “Have you ever seen anything sexier?”

But his hobby made shocking headlines this week when a recent ex-girlfriend revealed how the 34-year-old “Call Me By Your Name” actor fantasized about which of her body parts he’d like to roast and devour.

“He said to me he wants to break my rib and barbecue and eat it” Courtney Vucekovich exclusively told Page Six.

The claims by Vucekovich known for creating the “on-demand glam” app Flashd came days after the revelation of Hammer’s messages about rape fantasies and cannibalism.

In one DM shared by the anonymous Instagram account @HouseofEffie Hammer allegedly told a partner he wished to “cut off one of your toes and keep it with me in my pocket so I always had a piece of you in my possession.”

In another he allegedly described himself as “100 percent a cannibal.”

Hammer’s representative did not answer a request for comment.

This has come as a shock not just to his friends but his ex-wife Elizabeth Chambers with whom he is in the midst of an already difficult divorce.

They are both currently on the Cayman Islands where Chambers has been living with their two young children since they split over the summer.

A family friend told The Post that Chambers who filed for divorce in July is “really in shock” and has “not processed any of this yet” adding: “They went out to the Cayman Islands at the beginning of the pandemic in March as a family and Armie left in late June to go back to California.

“She’s basically been a single mom since then Armie didn’t see the kids for five months. The kids are her number one priority so on top of all the emotional stuff she has two kids to take to school and make sure they’re not affected.”

The friend added: “Elizabeth was aware of some infidelity but she wanted to make the marriage work and thought that he did too.”

Several sources said that Hammer had been madly in love with Chambers. But a major Hollywood publicist told The Post how once “Call Me By Your Name” boosted his fame “women were texting him chasing him — and when he would drink that’s when he’d run around. Everyone thought he and Elizabeth decided to have an open marriage.”

A representative for Chambers had no comment.

“[These messages] are very shocking for her” Chambers’ friend added. “He never did any of the weird s- -t with her.”

Another source who knows both Hammer and Chambers said: “My mind is blown. He always appeared so totally normal he loves grilling I mean — he was so excited about buying a new smoker and he would have friends over for barbecues and cocktails.

“None of this seems like the Armie that I know. He needs help. Something is terribly wrong and I just wonder if it’s drugs.”

This week the Daily Mail published video clips of Hammer declaring “s–t’s getting weird” after sniffing a white substance from someone’s hand and swigging from his beer can while behind the wheel of a car.

On Friday the Daily Mail posted a video from what is alleged to be Hammer’s secret Instagram account. The post said that he had “THC and benzos” in his system but that the hallucinogenic drug DMT had not showed up in a drug test; he also showed what appeared to be a court mandate ordering him to undergo drug testing as a condition of seeing his children. In the background a woman wearing lingerie while on her hands and knees in a bed was visible.

“Divorce is so fun. Not as fun as drugs. But what is” the post read.

A movie insider who worked with Hammer on the set of the 2018 film “On the Basis of Sex” told The Post that “He would have a water bottle of vodka in the green room before going on TV [interviews] but other than that he was a gentleman.”

A source who has worked with Hammer told The Post that Hammer does “not have a drug habit” but that he will drink heavily for weeks at a time. Asked about the messages the source said: “Of course Armie is not a cannibal … although BDSM might be weird it’s not illegal.”

Hammer a 2018 Golden Globes nominee for Best Supporting Actor has admitted he came close to “completely losing” his mind while with his family in the Caribbean which went from a tropical paradise to “draconian lockdown” during the pandemic.

Hammer told British GQ in September that he was at his dad’s apartment with Chambers their kids and his stepmother.

“We’d be looking out at the ocean but couldn’t go in the ocean; looking at the beach but couldn’t go on the beach. We couldn’t leave the apartment couldn’t go in the pool couldn’t do anything” the actor said.

“It was a very complicated intense situation with big personalities all locked in a little tiny place … I’d never dealt with anything like that before in my life so I didn’t have the tools” Hammer said.

He added: “I think to be quite frank I came very close to completely losing my mind.”

While in quarantine Hammer and Chambers decided to split after 10 years of marriage. Her divorce filing cited irreconcilable differences and the journalist and entrepreneur has asked the court to grant her primary physical custody of the children.

Back in LA Hammer embarked on a string of romances. He was seen canoodling with 22-year-old model Paige Lorenze and bakery owner Jessica Ciencin Henriquez the ex-wife of actor Josh Lucas. But in October just a month after she was first spotted with Hammer Henriquez posted a telling meme to Instagram: “How It Started” showed what appeared to be a paparazzi photo of her and Hammer on a lunch date; “How It’s Going” revealed that she had blocked the actor from her account.

Henriquez spoke out this week saying she believes the shocking cannibal/rape messages “are real” and later wrote: “’It takes an army to hide a predator.” She also posted a quote from Vucekovich’s Page Six interview: “He blows up [women’s] lives like that and walks away.”

A source close to Henriquez said she did not want to speak out any more fearing for her safety and that of her children.

However after Lorenze took to Twitter this week to post: “Anyone got a good therapist?” Henriquez replied: “Yeah girl I’ll send you her number.”

Meanwhile Vucekovich who dated Hammer from June to October couldn’t confirm whether the @HouseOfEffie screenshots were legitimate but she said they were no surprise.

“He likes the idea of skin in his teeth” she claimed. “He says ‘I want to take a bite out of you.’ If I had a little cut on my hand he’d like suck it or lick it. That’s about as weird as we got.”

Hammer comes from extreme privilege. In 2009 he appeared in a Vanity Fair spread of “Fortune’s Children” which features 38 heirs and heiresses — including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner — heralded as “the next generation of some of the world’s greatest fortunes.”

His great-grandfather Dr. Armand Hammer was an oil tycoon who ran Occidental Petroleum. When he died in 1990 he was reportedly worth around $200 million.

The actor the son of businessman Michael Armand Hammer and his wife Dru Ann Mobley grew up in Dallas and then the Cayman Islands. “My dad saw the movie ‘The Firm’ and he thought it looked like paradise” he has said of his father’s decision to move there.

Telling VF that he was taunted as a child with the nickname “Baking Soda Boy” Hammer has explained that his name has nothing to do with the Arm and Hammer brand. His great-grandfather was actually named for the arm-and-hammer logo of the Socialist Labor Party. Years later the oil tycoon used the insignia for the flag on his yacht.

‘Of course Armie is not a cannibal … although BDSM might be weird it’s not illegal’

Before he began acting Hammer told VF “I tried college at UCLA. I gave it a fighting effort and I just couldn’t do it.” He reportedly got kicked out of high school for starting a fire and his “two semesters” of UCLA were actually two semesters of signing up for UCLA Extension classes and never showing up.

He started out in TV landing guest spots on shows like “Arrested Development” and “Desperate Housewives” before his break: a recurring role on “Gossip Girl” in 2009. A year later he impressed audiences with his dual turn as the Winklevoss twins in the movie “The Social Network.” That was followed by films like “The Lone Ranger” and “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.” that were supposed to make Hammer a big star only to flop.

His career seemed back on track with 2016’s “The Birth of a Nation” based on the story of Nat Turner the enslaved man who led a slave rebellion in Southampton County Va. in 1831.

But following major Oscar buzz the film was overshadowed by news of a 1999 alleged rape that director and star Nate Parker was accused of having committed. (Parker was acquitted.)

In 2019 many expected Hammer would receive an Oscar nod for “Call Me By Your Name” in which Hammer played a college student who has an affair with a teenage boy played by Timothée Chalamet. The film itself was nominated as was Chalamet. Some Hollywood insiders think Hammer hurt his own chances by getting political.

5 Courtney Vucekovich exclusively told Page Six that “he said to me he wants to break my rib and barbecue and eat it.” Facebook

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter Hammer argued that his “Birth of a Nation” director Nate Parker had unfairly suffered career backlash — while actor Casey Affleck was sued for sexual harassment by two female coworkers and had gone on to win an Oscar for “Manchester by the Sea.”

“Nate had the stuff in his past which is heinous and tough to get beyond. I get that” he said. “But that was when he was 18 and now he’s in directors jail. At the same time the guy who went and won an Academy Award has three cases of sexual assault against him.” (Hammer later apologized to Affleck.)

What will happen to Hammer’s own career now is anyone’s guess. As Page Six reported he has “stepped down” from a leading role in the Jennifer Lopez movie “Shotgun Wedding.”

The “On the Basis of Sex” source believes this will “undoubtedly” hurt Hammer’s career. “He is not box office gold — you can’t sell a film with him — so why would you hire him when there are so many other better actors without this kind of story swirling around them?”

Hammer released a statement that read in part: “I’m not responding to these bulls–t claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for four months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic.”

A casting director told The Post that Hammer is a cautionary tale for young Hollywood.

“Up till ‘Call Me By Your Name’ nobody took him that seriously other than as a rich kid who wanted to get famous. He was in a lot of loser films before that” the casting director said. “But after ‘Call Me’ he started getting much better offers and much more attention.

“He seemed to be getting a bit of a God complex — like he’s so famous and rich he’s above reproach. That can lead to some actors having very bad behavior.”"

In her previous life in Norfolk she helped build the Chrysler Museum of Art’s Glass Studio and was a co-founder of Norfolk’s NEON Festival.

This go-round Kasic returned as manager of education and engagement at the Barry Art Museum at Old Dominion University. She started the job last January; two months later the building closed because of the pandemic.

That only made the artist more creative in thinking of how to lure people into a facility they could only visit on a computer. She and her staff soon had a slate of virtual content from art-inspired yoga classes a monthly lecture series with artists and online gaggles where locals could share their art.

The museum is offering even more programming now virtual and in-person including the collaborative exhibition “Orchids: Attraction and Deception” that opens Feb 4.

The multifaceted show includes works from 10 contemporary artists with their take on the allure of orchids one of the most diverse families of flowering plants on earth. Several pieces are being made specifically for the show and will be accompanied by historical illustrations on loan from the Oak Spring Garden Foundation based in Upperville. The exhibition is timed to coincide with the bloom cycle of orchids at The Arthur and Phyllis Kaplan Orchid Conservatory on campus and Norfolk Botanical Garden.

The exhibition will run through Aug. 1 and people can go to the Barry to explore the art take part in the monthly online lectures between artists and botanists and sign up for Instagram “bloom alerts” from Kaplan and NBG when the prized flowers erupt this season.

“From the pure botanical fascination to climate change to historical model-making and the history of collecting and colonization the artists approached the orchid from a bunch of different angles” Kasic said. “It is really fascinating.”

Kasic spent the past three years in her home state of Vermont working at the Yestermorrow Design/Build School. She and her husband decided to return to Virginia when new job opportunities bloomed for both. For Kasic the fresh canvas of the Barry like the Chrysler’s Glass Studio was too appealing.

“Both scenarios gave me a beautiful blank slate” said Kasic who became the Barry’s interim executive director when the museum’s founding director Jutta-Annette Page retired in October. “And I know that’s where I thrive the most having the opportunity to create new programs.”

Barry Art Museum Interim Director Charlotte Potter Kasic poses for a portrait with Paul Stankard’s “Caladenia Orchid” one of the pieces that will be displayed in the upcoming exhibit Orchids: Attraction and Deception at Barry Art Museum on Old Dominion University’s campus in Norfolk on Wednesday Jan. 13 2021.

Kasic had a strong foundation on which to build.

Page brought an international reputation to ODU and nearly three decades of experience and scholarship. She was senior curator of Glass and Decorative Arts at the Toledo Museum of Art before coming to Norfolk in 2017. She was charged with curating an extensive yet private collection of local philanthropists Richard and Carolyn Barry. She configured it into the two-story 24000-square-foot museum of brick and vertical channel glass that sits at the corner of Hampton Boulevard and 43rd Street.

Page supplemented the collection of historic dolls glass sculptures and modernist paintings Kasic said with pieces that represented more diverse artists. Last year the museum acquired 38 new pieces.

“She really wanted to make sure that we were a university museum not just a public institution but that we were a very academic institution” Kasic said. “Once I arrived it was time to get people in here and do some interesting things. So I immediately started a bunch of programs that we had to cancel.”

Some things were canceled. Others converted.

The yoga sessions were recorded and archived and people can still access them for free. Kasic started an internship for ODU students to get the student body more involved in the museum. They earn credits they learn the behind-the-scenes of the business and they are required to create content for the Barry.

One student engaged the public by asking people to submit artwork that showed what they missed during the pandemic. Another intern created a downloadable paint-by-numbers booklet based on the more than 300 pieces in the Barry collection. Kasic started a free monthly lecture series with the artists whose work is in the museum. Several of them are scattered around the world and have received international acclaim which proved a good thing for the museum. Sculptor Sonya Clark whom The New York Times Style Magazine included in its “15 Creative Women For Our Time” in August will give an online talk on Jan. 28.

“The beauty of being able to do this during the pandemic is that we’ve gotten an international following now” Kasic said.

The change also meant revamping the website creating 3D tours and getting more images of the museum online.

Last week the Barry launched a self-guided tour to allow people to “walk” through the museum and click on the displayed pieces for more information. Kasic has hired a local photographer to take videos of the more than 200 pieces on display that will allow viewers to get a more thorough view of each artwork. The museum also debuted last week a multi-media group tour in which people can go through the museum online with an educator.

“We’re probably going to reach more people virtually and in perpetuity than we will in person” Kasic said. “We’re fledgling but we’re growing and we’re growing fast.”

Va. - Former Hampton University player and assistant coach Charles Huff is expected to be hired as Marshall football's head coach as originally reported by Bruce Feldman.

Huff spent the past two season as the associate head coach and running backs coach with Alabama.

Huff was part of the Pirates' offensive from 2002-05 and coached Hampton's offensive line during the 2010 season. He also made coaching stops at Mississippi State Penn State Western Michigan the Buffalo Bills Vanderbilt Maryland and Tennessee State accumulating 16 years of coaching experience.

During Huff's time with the Nittany Lions he worked alongside Old Dominion coach Ricky Rahne as part of James Franklin's staff.

According to 247Sports Huff was ranked as the nation’s No. 1 recruiter in 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9BcnRpY2xlL2FzdS10by1oaXJlLWtsYXl0b24tYWRhbXMtYXMtb2wtY29hY2gtMTU5NDU1NTgx0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly8yNDdzcG9ydHMuY29tL0FydGljbGUvYXN1LXRvLWhpcmUta2xheXRvbi1hZGFtcy1hcy1vbC1jb2FjaC0xNTk0NTU1ODEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ASU to hire Klayton Adams as OL coach,"Klayton Adams

Klayton Adams who spent the last two seasons as an assistant offensive line coach with the Indianapolis Colts will replace the recently retired Dave Christensen as Arizona State's offensive line coach and run game coordinator according to people aware of the team's plan.

Adams has nearly two decades of coaching experience and spent 14 years coaching at the college level including a six-year stint at the University of Colorado from 2013-2018 where he spent three years at the Buffaloes’ running backs and tight ends coach and three as their offensive line coach.

In addition to coaching Colorado’s offensive line from 2016-2018 Adams was named its co-offensive coordinator prior to the 2018 season and served in that role for a year before moving on to coach professional football with the Colts.

ASU analyst and NFL Hall of Fame offensive lineman Kevin Mawae also interviewed for the position. Pittsburgh Steelers assistant offensive line coach Adrian Klemm had a preliminary conversation with ASU about the job but did not interview. News of ASU's pending addition of Adams was first reported by Bruce Feldman of Fox Sports.

Prior to coaching in Boulder Adams served as the tight ends coach at San Jose State from 2011-2012 the offensive line and tight ends coach at Sacramento State from 2009-2010 the run-game coordinator and offensive line coach at Western Washington from 2007-2008 and started his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Boise State where he played center and earned a bachelor’s degree in mass communication with an emphasis in journalism in 2006.

ASU head coach Herm Edwards has completely overhauled his offensive coaching staff since the conclusion of the 2018 season his first as the team's head coach. His running backs coach Shaun Aguano replaced John Simon after Simon departed for Memphis following the 2018 season. A year later former ASU offensive coordinator Rob Likens wide receivers coach Charlie Fisher and tight ends coach Donnie Yantis were dismissed or not retained after the 2019 Territorial Cup the Sun Devils hired offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Zak Hill and co-wide receivers and tight ends coaches Prentice Gill and Derek Hagan.

In late December Hagan was informed that his contract was not renewed for 2021 and he has since been replaced by former ASU graduate assistant Adam Breneman who was recently named the Sun Devils’ tight ends coach.

Edwards and recruiting coordinator and defensive coordinator Antonio Pierce have made an effort to hire young energetic recruiters including Gill defensive backs coach Chris Hawkins and Breneman.

Adams will inherit an offensive line that is almost entirely made up of returners from 2020. Senior left tackle Kellen Diesch and senior right guard Henry Hattis are expected to take advantage of the NCAA Division I board of directors’ August decision to grant all fall sport athletes another year of eligibility according to Hill.

In addition to Hattis and Diesch who was one of the Pac-12’s best offensive tackles last year ASU sophomore starting left guard Dohnovan West and redshirt freshman starting right tackle Ben Scott will be back in Tempe barring something completely unforeseen. Senior center Cade Cote is the only ASU starter expected to not return to the program. ASU's reserves at the position are all projected to return and the Sun Devils also added redshirt freshman offensive lineman and former four-star recruit Triston Miller from North Carolina.

Although it came over the course of just four games the Sun Devils' offense line had one of its best seasons in recent history. ASU led the Pac-12 and was one of the top programs in the nation in rushing-yards-per-game and ranked second in the Pac-12 in sacks-against-average.West and Diesch were among the highest-graded linemen in the conference by Pro Football Focus."

In this interview AZoM talks to Dr. Thomas Luxbacher about the semiconductor industry how surface charge analysis plays an important part and how Anton Paar is impacting the field.

Please could you give a brief overview of how surface charge analysis can be beneficial in the semiconductor field?

Image Credit: Anton Paar GmbH

When we refer to surface charge analysis we consider the charge at the interface between a material and a surrounding aqueous solution.

With respect to the semiconductor field knowing the charge at the wafer-water interface is extremely important for processes like chemical etching wafer cleaning and chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP).

The CMP process involves not only the interaction of a wafer surface with solutes such as an acid a base or a surfactant but also with dispersed slurry particles.

Surface charge is the initiator of electrostatic forces between the wafer surface and these solutes or suspended particles. The interfacial parameter that drives the electrostatic interaction is known as the zeta potential. It is related to the charge density and accepted as a representative indicator for surface charge which otherwise is difficult to determine.

The nature of the surface charge and the location of the zeta potential at the solid-water interface render this parameter not only dependent on the surface chemistry of the solid material but also on the composition of the aqueous surrounding especially the pH and the salinity of an aqueous solution determine the sign and magnitude of the zeta potential of a given material.

The surface charge and zeta potential can be measured with Anton Paar’s SurPASS 3.

What are the key challenges in semiconductor production that can be met with zeta potential analysis?

Image Credit: Anton Paar GmbH

Let us again consider the CMP process: The wafer and the CMP slurry particles assume their respective charge and electrostatic forces dominate the wafer-particle interaction.

In order to keep CMP slurry particles off the wafer surface process conditions that favor electrostatic repulsion are desirable. Measurement of the zeta potential of both a wafer surface and a slurry particle permits prediction of the effectiveness of a CMP process.

When tuning the composition of the slurry it is possible to reduce the adsorption of slurry particles on a wafer surface.

The zeta potential analyses for both slurry particles and wafers with different top coatings assist slurry manufacturers in the development of application-specific formulations and wafer fabs in the selection of slurries appropriate for their wafers.

Particle-surface interactions are not restricted to the semiconductor wafer. Consider the CMP pads which must not transfer particles from one wafer to the other to eliminate cross-contamination. In the cleaning process brushes made of PVA are also attractive to particle deposition.

The information provided by the zeta potential at the interface between the polymeric materials of pads and brushes and the corresponding solutions supports the taking of measures to avoid unfavorable contamination.

How is the zeta potential determined for slurry particles and wafer surfaces?

Two different methods are necessary to assess the zeta potential for slurry particles and large material surfaces. Particles in dispersion such as a CMP slurry are considered a colloidal sample and the method of choice is electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) which can be applied with the Litesizer 500 .

In ELS an electric field is applied on a particle dispersion which drives the charged particles to move towards the corresponding electrode. The particle mobility is measured indirectly by recording the intensity and frequency shift of the scattered light of a laser beam.

For large solid samples such as semiconductor wafers a different though analogous technique is employed: measurement of the streaming potential. This can be done with SurPASS 3.

In this method the solid sample is arranged in such a way as to provide a capillary flow channel. A pressure gradient is applied on a test solution which compels this liquid to flow through the capillary channel. The liquid flow creates an electric potential which is recorded as the streaming potential.

Although these two techniques produce completely different raw signals the calculated zeta potential has a single theoretical origin and the results obtained by electrophoretic light scattering and streaming potential measurement become comparable.

Anton Paar offers instruments that cover both methods for the zeta potential analysis namely Litesizer 500 and SurPASS 3.

How can I imagine the creation of a flow channel for a semiconductor wafer?

In principle the solution is straightforward. You need two pieces of the same sample and then you align the flat active surface layers opposite each other thereby separating the samples by a small capillary distance.

Usually this approach requires cutting the sample for example to a size of 1-2 cm2. Since this is undesirable for subsequent use of the same sample for other analytical techniques or further processing steps a sample holder for SurPASS 3 is available for the non-destructive zeta potential analysis of semiconductor wafers but also other solid samples such as sensor chips or EUV masks for state-of-the-art lithography.

The small but acceptable drawback of this sample holder is the requirement to use a reference sample that completes the flow channel i.e. one side of the channel is comprised of the sample such as a wafer and the opposite side faces the reference preferably an already built-in high grade polymer.

Does Anton-Paar also provide other instruments for wafer production?

Anton Paar provides wafer metrology tools for monitoring the quality of thin films understanding the surface chemistry of outer layers and characterizing wafer defects.

Our instruments help determine and adjust many different parameters throughout the wafer manufacturing process - from thin films to testing assembly and packaging - to create a better end product.

For the mechanical surface characterization of wafers Anton Paar offers two state-of-the-art measuring technologies namely scratch testing and instrumented indentation testing.

Density and concentration measurement is important to determine the correct concentration of the etching substance which is key to obtaining consistent etching results with the highest precision. Anton Paar also provides instruments for SAXS particle analysis solid density analysis and microwave digestion.

What aspects of the production process do you think could be improved and how could Anton Paar help with this?

Measuring certain parameters during the production process means controlling them and being able to react to changes as well as designing the raw materials and processes to reach the highest possible efficiency and product quality.

Nanoscratch testing in combination with nanoindentation testing for example provides full control of the deposited functional layers during integrated circuit development.

Furthermore a density meter with a chemically resistant Hastelloy U-tube to quickly measure the concentration of hydrofluoric acid is beneficial for a reproducible etching process.

Many other solutions to improve this process can be found here.

They expected supply chain disruptions and plummeting sales. But they never figured that a year later one of their biggest problems would be PlayStations.

Strong demand for gaming systems personal computers and other electronics by a world stuck indoors has sucked up supplies of semiconductors forcing carmakers around the world to scramble for the chips that have become as essential to mobility as gasoline or steel.

Virtually no carmaker has been spared. Toyota Motor has shut down production lines in China. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles temporarily stopped production at plants in Ontario and Mexico. Volkswagen has warned of production problems at factories in China Europe and the United States. Ford Motor said last week that it was idling a Louisville Kentucky factory for a week because of the shortage.

When COVID-19 hit automakers slashed orders for chips in anticipation of plunging sales. At the same time semiconductor makers shifted their production lines to meet surging orders for chips used in products like laptop computers webcams tablets and 5G smartphones.

Businesses also upgraded their digital infrastructure to handle online meetings and employees working from home while telecommunications companies invested in broadband infrastructure further fueling demand for semiconductors.

Then auto sales bounced back faster than expected at the end of 2020 catching everyone off guard. The shortages of chips that ensued are expected to last well into 2021 because it can take semiconductor makers six to nine months to realign production.

“Consumer electronics exploded” said Dan Hearsch a managing director at the consulting firm AlixPartners. “Everybody and their brother wanted to buy an Xbox and PlayStation and laptops while automotive shut down. Then automotive came back faster than expected and that’s where you get into this problem.”

While the shortage is not expected to cause auto prices to rise very much buyers might have to wait longer to get the vehicles they want.

The chip shortage has its roots in long-term forces reshaping the auto and semiconductor industries as well as short-term confusion from the pandemic.

During the past decade carmakers have become increasingly dependent on electronics to boost the appeal of their products adding features such as touch screens computerized engine controls and transmissions built-in cellular and Wi-Fi connections and collision avoidance systems that use cameras and other sensors.

New cars can have more than 100 semiconductors and the lack of even a single component can trigger production delays or shutdowns industry analysts and consultants said.

Long-term pressure on chipmakers to control production costs has also played a role. Semiconductor companies that supply the auto industry such as Infineon NXP Semiconductors and Renesas chose to have their most advanced chips made for them by external manufacturing services known as foundries. But the manufacturers also maintain their own factories to make simpler auto chips frequently fabricating them on 8-inch silicon wafers rather than the 12-inch discs used in more modern plants.

Manufacturers with plants using older 8-inch wafers weren’t easily able to increase production. They hadn’t invested much lately in new equipment which is now harder to find because that technology is older said Syed Alam global lead for Accenture’s global semiconductor consulting practice.

Geopolitics also played a role. The Trump administration in September placed restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. China’s main foundry which produces chips for cars and many other applications. The company’s customers began looking for alternatives generating additional competition for chip supplies from other foundries said Gaurav Gupta a vice president at the research firm Gartner.

The chip crisis is an example of how the pandemic has shaken the global economy in unpredictable ways. Carmakers expected to face supply chain shortages and plants closed early in 2020 because of fear that workers would infect one another or because trucking firms had stopped delivering. Most U.S. auto factories ceased production for roughly two months last spring.

But suppliers and carmakers quickly found ways to contain contagion within factories and got assembly lines going again. The impact on most parts supplies was less than feared.

The semiconductor shortage came out of left field hitting the industry at a perilous moment. Sales have plunged worldwide. In Europe for example they were down 25% in 2020.

This is all happening while automakers are trying to navigate a shift in basic technology from internal combustion engines to batteries which has subjected them to new competition from Tesla the California company that has become the most valuable automaker in the world by far and emerging Chinese manufacturers like Nio.

Exactly how long the shortage will last is unclear. It can take 20 to 25 weeks from the time new orders are placed for chips to be produced and work through the supply chain to reach cars said Michael Hogan a senior vice president at GlobalFoundries a big chip manufacturer that services the auto industry and other markets.

“We are doing everything humanly possible to prioritize our output for automotive” Hogan said.

German auto electronics supplier Bosch said the shortage was particularly acute for integrated circuits used to control engines transmissions and other key functions.

“Despite the difficult market situation Bosch is doing all it can to keep its customers supplied and to keep any further impact to a minimum” the company said in a statement.

Carmakers and suppliers are reacting as best they can. BMW based in Munich said it had been able to maintain production but was “observing the situation intensively” and in constant contact with suppliers.

For carmakers already stressed by the pandemic some impact is inevitable. Honda said Wednesday that it would shut down some production activities at its plant in Swindon England which builds Civics for at least four days starting Monday. Honda cited supply chain problems including shortages of semiconductors.

German supplier Continental which is best known for tires but also produces electronic components called on semiconductor producers to build up capacity in the foundries that produce chips.

“Future investment in these foundries will therefore be critical so that the automotive industry can avoid such supply chain upheavals in the future” Continental said in a statement.

Infineon based in Munich said it was stepping up investment in new production capacity in 2021 to as much as 1.5 billion euros or $1.8 billion from 1.1 billion euros in 2020. The company is also ramping up production at a new chip factory in Villach Austria that will produce 12-inch wafers.

But it will take time for the semiconductor makers to catch up. In the meantime PlayStations have priority.

“Automotive came back and they are not the front of the line for chips anymore” said Gary Silberg global head of the automotive practice at KPMG.

Packaging companies are experiencing a strong growth on the back of the e-commerce boom following the coronavirus pandemic. Analysts think that the packaging industry will see innovation and growth in 2021 and beyond. To skip our investment thesis and reasons to invest in packaging stocks click to read 5 Best Packaging Stocks to Buy Now.

The packaging industry has a robust and long-term growth potential as its applications are widespread and evergreen. According to consultancy firm Smithers packaging demand is expected to grow 2.8% to reach $1.05 trillion in 2024. Almost all essential and non-essential industries need some sort of packaging. The demand of packaging products is growing in lucrative domains like food beverages cosmetics personal care healthcare industrial items and household products. The industry is usually segmented by the type of material such as paper plastic glass and metal.

Coronavirus Crisis: Growth Catalyst for Packaging Stocks?

The packaging industry has proven to be extremely resilient and anti-fragile. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic when most businesses struggled packaging companies saw huge spikes in sales amid a rise in ecommerce. As businesses shift their focus towards online channels they are recognizing the importance of packaging for brand image customer satisfaction and marketing. According to a survey a majority of sellers think that the use of branded packaging for online orders affects their perception. The COVID-19 pandemic skyrocketed ecommerce sales worldwide as consumers stopped going to physical stores and loaded up on groceries and other items using online channels. Data shows that consumers spent a whopping $347.26 billion online with U.S. retailers in the first 6 months of 2020 up 30.1% from $266.84 billion for the same period in 2019.

The ecommerce trend was already expanding globally as the “Amazon effect” put several physical retailers out of business and analysts believe that online shopping will continue to grow in the future. Data shows that the e-commerce packaging market was valued at $27.04 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach $61.55 billion by 2025 growing at a CAGR of 14.59% over a period of 5 years.

In an April 2020 report McKinsey said that the effect of the coronavirus crisis would be mixed for the packing industry as the demand for certain packing items will decline while other categories will see explosive growth. The biggest winners will be the packing products for groceries healthcare products and e-commerce transportation while the firm sees some declines for industrial luxury and some B2B-transport packaging. While selecting 10 best packaging stocks to buy now we will incorporate the level of exposure to the growth categories in the industry.

The film directed by Nicole Newnham and Jim LeBrecht (the latter attended the titular camp as a teen) also won the ABC News VideoSource Award recognizing its skillful use of archival video from the 1970s to 1990s.

“I want to thank everybody at Camp Jened the staff the counselors and the campers” said an emotional LeBrecht as he Newnham and producer Sara Bolder accepted the award. “My life set a course when I went there and you all are responsible for this–you are so much a part of this award.”

Newnham added “The hippie teens and counselors of Camp Jened could never have imagined the wide-reaching impact that their brief utopian community would come to have on disability civil rights around the world. But they did dare to imagine that a better more inclusive world was possible. And we believed that an immersive community-told story a film of their story could help to continue their work.”

Newnham thanked among others executive producers Barack and Michelle Obama. The former president and first lady’s production company Higher Ground produced Crip Camp.

Going into the night Amazon Studios’ Time was the favorite for Best Feature having won a slew of pre-Oscar prizes including the Gotham Award for Best Documentary (in a tie with A Thousand Cuts). But Time directed by Garrett Bradley didn’t leave the IDA Awards empty-handed. Bradley was named Best Director and she also earned the previously-announced Emerging Filmmaker Award.

Bradley gave a shout out to the family whose story she tells in the film: Sibil Fox Richardson (known as Fox Rich) and her husband Rob. Time explores Fox Rich’s two-decade long effort to win the release of Rob who was sentenced to 60 years in prison for armed robbery.

“It has been such a privilege and an honor to work with Fox and Rob and Miss Peggy and the entire Richardson family” Bradley noted “in bringing their story of love which surpasses all time and space to the world.”

Time may yet rally in time for the Academy Awards. The IDA Awards has proven an uncertain predictor of Oscar success. At the IDA’s last awards show For Sama won the IDA’s Best Feature prize but American Factory from the Obamas’ Higher Ground Productions went on to claim the Oscar. In fact in the last five years only once has the IDA Best Documentary winner gone on to earn the Oscar statuette—2016’s O.J.: Made in America.

In another victory for Netflix the streamer’s short John Was Trying to Contact Aliens won the IDA Award for Best Short. Director Matthew Killip accepted for his story of an electronics enthusiast who built a massive radio transmitting operation in his house in the 1970s hoping to communicate with extraterrestrials.

“Really it’s a story about connection and love” Killip observed in his acceptance remarks. “I’m so happy it found an audience.”

The Netflix doc Dick Johnson Is Dead directed by Kirsten Johnson won two awards on the night for Best Editing and Best Writing. The Netflix series Last Chance U won Best Episodic Series.

The IDA Award for Best Music Documentary went to Universe directed by Nicholas Capezzera and Sam Osborn a film about an unrecorded piece of music by Miles Davis.

American Experience the long-running PBS historical series took Best Curated Series over fellow PBS contender American Masters and three other nominees.

Best Multi-Part Documentary went to HBO’s series Atlanta’s Missing and Murdered: The Lost Children. Among the show’s directors and executive producers is Sam Pollard who received the IDA’s Career Achievement Award. His documentary MLK/FBI was also nominated for Best Feature.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 largest industrial companies in the US. Before we get started let's first try to understand what an industrial company is. After all all companies operate in either individual or multiple industries right so isn't this just a list of the biggest public companies in the world filtered for the US? Well not really. An industrial company is a company which is engaged in the production of capital goods which in turn are generally used in either manufacturing or construction. Among the businesses that these companies engage in are the production and selling of machinery supplies and equipment which are basically used for the production of other goods and aren't products geared towards the end consumer.

The biggest industrial companies in the US are involved in various sectors which include aerospace lumber production tools defense construction waste management cement and metal fabrication among many others. In the United States the sector has become smaller than what is used to be as the manufacturing sector decreased comparatively in scope while the services sector has increased by leaps and bounds. However the sector is characterized by many small dynamic firms even though we also have some major companies which we will take a look at later. Further wages paid in the sector are quite high compared to other sectors and there is a lot of potential for the growth of the sector too. 8.5% of the total number of employed Americans belong to the manufacturing sector and even though employment in the sector has reduce by a third since the 1980s it has also increased production by at least 2.5 times through automation technology and greater efficiencies. The industry is also responsible for providing employment indirectly to many other people as well. In fact in 2013 17.1 million jobs were directly linked to manufacturing.

Also there is little doubt that the industrial sector has a lot of growth in store with at least 1.1 million jobs already being added since 2008. And while there may be some stagnation in the biggest cities such as Houston Chicago or Los Angeles there is significant growth being observed in smaller cities which are witnessing more and more manufacturers being established. By 2025 there are estimates that more than 2 million more jobs may be established in the industrial sector as well as adding $530 billion with electronics automation and aerospace driving this growth.

Story continues

Of course in 2020 there has been little to cheer about in most sectors and industries and the industrial sector did not escape the wrath of the Covid-19 pandemic which has seen nearly 95 million cases and over 2 million deaths and the worst part is both figures are expected to be severely understated. Since the industrial sector is dependent on many different industries which have all been affected by the lockdowns and the recessions and depressions that followed the lockdowns not just in the US but across the globe. And as cases and deaths continue to soar in the US so does the uncertainty and the exact impact of the pandemic on the industry will only be ascertained later on.

However if anyone can survive the effects of the pandemic it will be the biggest industrial companies in the US which are absolute giants in their industry. The combined revenues of these companies exceed $380 billion while their profits are a massive $26 billion despite just one company making a loss of nearly $5 billion. They also have assets worth more than $676 billion and provide direct employment to close to a million people. The market cap of these companies at March 2020 was more than $480 billion. To rank these companies we have used their assets revenues profits market cap and employees with all the information being taken from the Fortune 500 list for industrial companies in the US. So without further ado let's take a look at some of the giants in this industry starting with number 15:

I made a post on social media this week that I turned into this cartoon. After receiving over 300 reactions I thought “Why not?”.

Congressman Jim Jordan who is one of Trump’s biggest henchmen in Congress who claims he never knew about wrestlers he coached being sexually abused who voted against impeaching Trump both times and may be his defense attorney when the Senate trial begins received the Presidential Medal of Freedom last week.

After watching the medal go to people like Jordan and Rush Limbaugh I truly hope Joe Biden can restore the integrity to it. Just like Trump’s court nominees every one of his recipients will have an asterisk next to it.

As for Gym Jordan he’s real good at ignoring the bad guys whether it’s Donald Trump molesting the nation or MAGA terrorists sent by Trump to molest the capitol building. Jordan should be counsel for Trump because he’s a friend to perverts.

In early December Delian Asparouhov a principal at venture-capital firm Founders Fund threw out a proposal moving Silicon Valley to Miami. Francis Suarez a real estate attorney who stepped into the mayor’s chair in 2017 quote-tweeted the investor. He asked “How can I help?”

Suarez’s response went viral with more than 2 million impressions and thousands of likes. The mayor later likened it to “catching lightning in a bottle.” He was suddenly in conversation with major venture capitalists and tech executives from around the country grateful for a friendly ear in what has become a political climate openly hostile to Big Tech. Keith Rabois a member of the “PayPal Mafia” and an early investor in Opendoor SoftBank Group CEO Marcelo Claure and Shutterstock founder Jon Oringer are among those palling up with the 43-year-old mayor on Twitter. Rabois has become the city’s most prominent evangelist among the tech community.

“I have met more new interesting people in Miami in 3 weeks than all of 2020 in the Bay Area” Rabois tweeted Jan. 4.

For those marquee names and those who look up to them Miami marks a sharp contrast to the governments that have “marginalized and rejected” them in the past Suarez said in an interview with The Real Deal last month. “I’m letting them tell their story. There’s nothing more powerful [than that].”

It’s an overture that has South Florida real estate salivating. Developers brokers and office landlords are anticipating a Big Tech gold rush that would build on the recent success Miami has had with financial firms. Last month Rabois paid a record $29 million for a waterfront mansion in Miami Beach and the following month announced his intent to attract at least 1000 “founder caliber” technologists to the Magic City in 2021 as well as VC firms and established startups. That’s a lot of office space and a lot of high-end homes.

But Miami has a long way to go on several metrics important to Big Tech. It lacks efficient large-scale public transit and is well behind established tech hubs on health care and education. A surge in population might push the city’s infrastructure to the brink. Some warn that all the hype (and growth) could be short-lived. And Suarez for all his enthusiasm and PR savvy has very limited powers as mayor to bring about the sweeping changes that the tech industry will likely want.

If Miami really hopes to become the next Silicon Valley or Boston it will need to address those infrastructure deficits said Bernard Zyscovich an urban planner and architect who Facebook tapped to study the Bay Area from an urban design and mobility perspective.

There is “no way” Miami can provide the same “brain trust” as Silicon Valley in the short term Zyscovich said. “Over time Miami could become a place which generates its own feeder system for recruitment. But in the short term recruitment is limited to Miami being a desirable place for startups and incubators. It has to be a large number of small scale investors that come here that can run their businesses from their computer.”

Oringer who relocated to Miami Beach in the fall after keeping a pied-à-terre for years described Miami’s situation as a “chicken or egg problem.”

“If we can find entrepreneurs down here if we can launch enough businesses if we can attract enough talent we’ll be able to build lots of interesting companies down here” he said. “People asked me the same questions in the early 2000s when I started Shutterstock in New York. New York was a finance town filled with Wall Street people. It had a little bit of tech but if you wanted to start a tech company you moved to San Francisco. I resisted that.”

Testing the waters

“Visiting Miami right now and I think I’ve seen more people from SF here than I saw in SF last year” JD Ross a co-founder of iBuying startup Opendoor tweeted Jan. 10.

It’s a trend that’s been on since at least the summer with South Florida’s residential brokers finding themselves inundated with requests for luxury waterfront rentals and for-sale homes. The single-family home market particularly in Miami Beach and Palm Beach saw a surge and sellers called the shots.

In the second half of 2020 there were more than 3000 sales of single-family homes priced at over $1 million an increase of 99 percent according to Analytics Miami. In Palm Beach which saw the greatest gains $1 million-plus single-family home sales more than doubled year over year with nearly 1300 closings.

The wealthy buyers hailed from several industries: hedge funds finance real estate and entertainment. Martin Brand Blackstone Group’s co-head of U.S. acquisitions bought a waterfront home in Palm Beach and Goldman Sachs managing director Douglas Sacks picked up a condo at Eighty Seven Park in Miami Beach.

Many buyers also purchased teardowns and empty lots. Builders are busy.

Jason Anderson vice president of Coastal Homes said buyers are upping the ask for amenities including bowling alleys indoor basketball courts and even built-out tunnels connecting properties divided by the street. Rabois’ Venetian Islands mansion came with a $1 million aquarium.

Miami’s waterways are bustling with hedge fund managers and tech investors many of whom have recently become first-time boat owners. Boat slips which were already in demand are being snapped up. It’s the cool way to get around.

“They’re boating weekdays: Monday Tuesday Wednesday. Every day is a boat day” yacht broker Boomer Jousma who’s seen his sales double in 2020 said referring to the influx of New Yorkers in South Florida. “They’re entertaining on the water. They’re meeting on the water; they’re social distancing.”

Another sign that the migration is less seasonal and more permanent? Schools are filling up.

“In the middle of Covid where people would otherwise be potentially guessing private schools there’s waiting lists” Steve Hurwitz of JLL said. “People have already made those decisions.”

Land of the (tax) free

It’s not just the tech bros planting flags in South Florida. Though Suarez seems to have put Miami on the map with that industry the city has long been working to attract blue-chip financial firms to the region. The pandemic which normalized work from home merely accelerated a migration that’s been underway for years experts said. Florida’s lack of state income tax pro-business leaders and warm weather have long drawn the wealthy.

Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital Group Tom Barrack’s Colony Capital Carl Icahn’s Icahn Enterprises and David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management have all relocated to South Florida.

“The tours I used to have were with folks with second homes and second offices” JLL’s Hurwitz said.

And there’s more to come. In early January Blackstone took 41000 square feet at the MiamiCentral development in downtown Miami where it will hire more than 200 employees.

Billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin already the owner of some of Miami’s priciest real estate is nearing a deal to lease space at the under-construction office tower 830 Brickell according to Business Insider where Microsoft is also close to a deal. Goldman Sachs is also considering a larger expansion into South Florida and Virtu Financial has toured spaces in Palm Beach County. Google is eyeing an expansion in the Miami area and Spotify last year inked a lease in Wynwood.

Thrive Capital Joshua Kushner’s investment firm is also in the market according to sources. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and the Winklevoss twins have expressed interest in investing in Miami.

Kelly Smallridge president of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County acknowledged that there are no guarantees the businesses coming into town are here to stay. “However our retention numbers are very high and you can’t get away from no state tax on income” Smallridge said. She is behind the effort to build up “Wall Street South” and said there are about 30 financial services firms in the pipeline in Palm Beach County. (Paul Singer’s Elliott Management is among them with plans to move to a 40000-square-foot space at Related Companies’ 360 Rosemary office building in West Palm Beach.)

Danet Linares vice chair of brokerage Blanca Commercial Real Estate said new-to-market tenants have toured more than 1 million square feet of space in Miami-Dade over the past six months with Class A rents still increasing. Countywide Class A rents rose to more than $48 a foot in the fourth quarter according to Colliers International data. Brickell is still the most expensive with asking rents of nearly $60 per square foot. Though there is increased buzz surrounding the office market in South Florida the vacancy rate was at 10.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 up from 9.2 percent a year earlier according to Colliers. The hospitality and retail industries are still reeling and multifamily landlords aren’t able to collect rent from lower-income renters. In a way it’s a tale of two cities sources said.

Documentary filmmaker Billy Corben called the push for tech “the latest real estate hustle” in Miami.

“There is a commercial real estate depression happening right now” said Corben who’s known for the “Cocaine Cowboys” and “Screwball” documentaries. “No one wants to say the D word especially down here where everything is about spinning reality. But the reality is you have one of the poorest cities in America and its residents and business owners are crying out for real and immediate help without any response from their government.”

Moving’s easy. Living’s harder.

Let’s assume Big Tech does make the big move to Miami. Will the city be equipped to integrate it?

Transportation has long been a big issue for South Florida. Brightline a train that runs from downtown Miami to West Palm Beach is planning an expansion as is Tri-Rail a more affordable commuter rail option.

Suarez said that it was hard to predict what transportation requirements would be in a remote-work world and pointed to Miami’s investment in walkable neighborhoods.

David Goldberg general partner at Alpaca VC (formerly Corigin Ventures) noted that the cities attracting companies — Boca Raton Miami West Palm Beach Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach — are all far apart from each other preventing the kind of cluster that tech firms love.

He also made reference to the area’s more easygoing ways as a potential hurdle.

“Is there a hard-charging hustlers mentality?” he said. “Or is it a bit slower less ambitious potentially shady?” A thin talent pipeline is another concern: “You don’t have the Stanfords MITs and Berkeleys churning out entrepreneur talent” said the University of Miami graduate.

Still Goldberg made the jump to the city with his wife in August. He’s working out of a private office at the LAB Miami one of the first startup hubs. When asked where his partners are based he responded “I don’t really know what that means anymore. I’m in Miami. Ryan [Freedman] is in Aspen. Aubrie [Pagano] is usually in New York but she’s in Brazil right now.”

He added he’s been checking in on the tech scene in South Florida every couple of years waiting for the inflection point. In 2014 he met with “everybody important” within 24 hours. “Now I get introduced to five or six a day” he said.

Though business leaders are promoting the pool of local talent it’s also no longer necessary to recruit locally. Oringer and his business partner are launching Pareto Holdings to invest in startups that will be based in Miami — “whatever based means these days” he said. He envisions a combination of remote and office workers and said it will likely be much easier to hire remotely.

“I cannot imagine we’ll snap our fingers and work in our headquarters again” he added.

Cometh the hour

Suarez’s powers as mayor are limited and when he proposed becoming a strong mayor in 2018 Miami residents trounced the measure leaving the city commission and the city manager with most of the clout. (There are 34 municipalities in Miami-Dade County 31 in Broward and 39 in Palm Beach County. Suarez is mayor of just one city.)

That legislative weakness according to attorney David Winker could see Suarez’s push to bring companies over backfire.

“By not having a strong mayor you have the tension that Miami’s open for business but when you get here you have to deal with a commission that may not be open for you to do business” Winker said referring to the ongoing battle between the popular Little Havana nightclub Ball and Chain and the city.

Businesses relocating to the city of Miami for example could be eligible for tax breaks promoted by business development agencies that include the Beacon Council. In some cases those incentives packages are subject to approval by the Miami-Dade County Commission or in the case of those offered by the DDA subject to approval by the DDA’s board. Suarez can only veto decisions made by the Miami City Commission which does not offer incentives.

“The mayor is a mascot in the head coach’s office. By charter he does not have a lot of official power” Corben said. “Ultimately the buck stops with the commission and the buck stops with the bureaucracy. The moment any of these people out west have to come out here and have to deal with someone in government not Suarez they will head right back for the hills.”

Condo market consultant Peter Zalewski cautioned against buying into the hype.

“Politicians sell a dream and a vision” Zalewski said. “The problem is he [Suarez] doesn’t have the juice to be able to pull this off.”

Still there’s no denying the astounding success of Suarez’s PR blitz.

Aaron Gordon a partner at Schwartz Media Strategies described the last two months as “rocket fuel” for the city’s corporate prospects.

“It took a bold forward-looking mayor with a Twitter handle to open the floodgates” Gordon said. “Francis has become the face of Miami’s tech scene in the span of four weeks the same way Dwyane Wade was the face of the Miami Heat and Dan Marino the face of the Miami Dolphins.”

Suarez who is the son of former Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez is quick to respond lighthearted and accessible. He’s what business leaders wish their government leaders would be like Gordon said.

On a recent podcast Suarez said that any city that is not competing to grow its tech community is being negligent toward its residents who could benefit from high-paying tech jobs.

“I want to seize the momentum. You don’t always get opportunities like this” he told TRD. For the tech community it’s the gesture that counts.

Some say it’s almost irrelevant that he doesn’t manage the city’s budget or that he can’t direct who gets awarded what contracts while others point out his power to sway the Miami commission and his connections to major developers.

Nitin Motwani the developer of Miami Worldcenter and a DDA board member said the incentives wouldn’t make or break a company’s decision to move to Miami.

“It’s not a life changing amount of money with these companies” Motwani said. “What the incentive does is exactly what we wanted to do. It reinforces our message: How can we help? We want to show you that you’re important to us. People are so excited to come to a place like Miami knowing the community is embracing them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRibHRhcC5jb20vcG9zdHMvcmFpbmJvdy1zaXgtc2llZ2Utb3BlcmF0b3JzLXRpZXItbGlzdC1qYW51YXJ5LTIwMjEtMDFldzhuODZrN2Zr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rainbow Six Siege Operators Tier List January 2021,We’re proud to continue our long-term partnership with @PayPal as the official payment platform for multiple competitions in the Rainbow Six Esports circuit!,,,,,,

That’s when so many people tune into the TV to see who wins the championship ring. On Jan. 15 2021 Pepsi and Coca-Cola announced they will be foregoing this tradition.

Pepsi decided instead that they will be using their traditional time slot for a new campaign. This campaign will lead to The Weeknd’s halftime show. This will be the 10th year that Pepsi has sponsored the Super Bowl’s halftime show.

However Frito-Lay and Mountian Dew — both owned by PepsiCo — have plans to advertise during the game. Coca-Cola stated they will be on the sidelines toasting other brands this year. according to spokesperson Kate Hartman.

This difficult choice was made to ensure we are investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times.

Two years ago Coca-Cola decided to run their ad before the Super Bowl instead of during the game. The COVID-19 pandemic has the company staggering in sales. During the first nine months of 2020 Coca-Cola’s revenue fell a whopping 13 percent. By the end of 2020 Coke’s shares fell 14 percent.

Due to PepsiCo receiving a small portion of their sales from away-from-home sales they managed to raise two percent in sales. This gave the company’s stock a market value of $197 billion.

This year Super Bowl LV will be held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida on Feb. 7 2021. Usually before the Super Bowl is the Pro Bowl game. Due to the pandemic the NFL has canceled this game and plan to replace it with virtual activities this year.

The Pro Bowl was supposed to be played in Las Vegas on Jan. 31 2021. Football fans were very disappointed to hear that it was canceled. However they were happy to hear they had not canceled the Super Bowl.

The parody on the pronunciation of his last name [pronounced boo-BLAY] would eventually land him an ongoing partnership with soda giant Pepsico (PEP).

“I knew from doing Saturday Night Live with Jon Hamm that [the wrong pronunciation] was funny and it's funny in many other countries” the musician told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview. While touring in other countries like South Africa “that was a marketing tool for me.”

Fast forward to 2018 and Bublé capitalized on the skit when got a call from Pepsico’s new sparkling water brand bubly. In the 2019 Super Bowl LIII Commercial ""Can I have a bublé?"" the 45-year old debated the pronunciation of the product with shoppers.

“I assumed when I got the call I would make this commercial and then that would be it...” Bublé continued. “it'd be great for me and I'd make a Super Bowl commercial.” But it turned out to be deeper than that he added.

“I remember sitting with the writers and sort of writing different ideas of how the commercial would end” Bublé stated. “That's a different thing than it usually is because it usually isn't like that ...it can feel very corporate.”

‘The right positioning’

And it turns out Bublé hopped onto this opportunity just in time for sparkling water an increasingly popular beverage category.

“Sparkling water has been has been on the rise and taking over” Bryan Welsh Sodastream’s U.S. General Manager told Yahoo Finance.

In Pepsico’s third-quarter earnings results Pepsico CEO Ramon Laguarta shared that bubly had double-digit revenue growth while the North America beverage business delivered a strong improvement in results with 3 percent organic revenue growth.

Sodastream a business the soda giant acquired back in 2018 for $3.2 billion dollars saw a similar growth helped by what Laguarta cited as demand for an “environmentally friendly convenient at-home beverage system.”

This spike in at-home consumption has been mostly to the stay-at-home effect of the coronavirus pandemic but greased by the collaboration between two other Pepsi brands. On Wednesday the company launched new bubly drops for SodaStream — including six healthy flavors that contain no calories sweeteners or artificial flavors.

“Based on what we're seeing in the U.S. we think that sparkling water is the way in the right positioning” to get into U.S. households “and bubly is the right brand to do it with” Welsh told Yahoo Finance.

Proponents say the deal could allow Israel to become the first country to vaccinate most of its population while providing valuable research that could help the rest of the world. But critics say the deal raises major ethical concerns including possible privacy violations and a deepening of the global divide that enables wealthy countries to stockpile vaccines as poorer populations including Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza have to wait longer to be inoculated.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who is stumping ahead of the country’s March elections as Israel’s vaccinator-in-chief — said earlier this month that he reached the deal with Pfizer’s chief executive to speed up vaccine deliveries to Israel.

“Israel will be a global model state” he said. “Israel will share with Pfizer and with the entire world the statistical data that will help develop strategies for defeating the coronavirus.”

Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told The Associated Press the government will turn over data to “see how it influences first of all the level of the disease in Israel the possibility to open the economy different aspects of social life and whether there are any effects of the vaccination.”

Pfizer’s vaccine developed with German partner BioNTech has received emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Union’s regulatory agency and is believed to provide up to 95% protection against COVID-19. But much remains unknown including its long-term protection and whether it can prevent transmission of the virus.

Israel home to some 9.3 million people is considered an ideal place for studying these questions. Its mandatory universal health care is provided by four publicly funded HMOs with meticulously digitized medical records. This centralized system has helped Israel administer more than 2 million doses of the vaccine in under a month. Israel has also purchased doses of the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines.

The inoculation blitz is a matter of national pride. It also is at the center of Netanyahu’s reelection campaign as he seeks to deflect attention from his ongoing corruption trial Israel’s deep economic crisis and the latest virus surge.

The Health Ministry has recorded over 551000 cases since the beginning of the pandemic and more than 4000 deaths. Israeli officials say they aim to have most of the country vaccinated by the end of March just around election day.

But the exact quid pro quo between Israel and Pfizer is unclear even after a redacted version of the agreement was released by the Israeli Health Ministry on Sunday.

Neither Israel nor Pfizer would say how much Israel has paid for the vaccines though Edelstein called it a “classical win-win” for both sides. Israeli media have reported that Israel paid at least 50% more than other countries. The data is reportedly being shared with the World Health Organization but the global body did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Earlier this month the head of the WHO appealed to drugmakers and wealthier countries to “stop making bilateral deals” saying they hurt a U.N.-backed effort to widen access. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus did not single out any countries or companies.

Last week Dr. Siddhartha Datta WHO Europe’s program manager for vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization said the agency is trying to collect “disaggregated” data — based on age gender local area employment and other factors — and reporting on any safety issues as the vaccines are deployed.

Israel had already announced the acquisition of millions of vaccine doses before the Pfizer deal was announced. It’s unclear how the quantity or pace of deliveries has changed or whether the vaccines have been diverted from other countries.

The arrangement has drawn attention to the unequal distribution of vaccines between rich and poor nations. A recent estimate from the International Rescue Committee said that the WHO’s global COVAX campaign is likely to vaccinate only 20% of the world’s lower-income countries by the end of 2021.

“This is a shady under-the-table deal that preferences certain countries over others without any transparency” said Lawrence Gostin a professor of global health law at Georgetown University in Washington. “In the end it’s going to be low- and middle-income countries that are going to be left behind.”

Dr. Nadav Davidovitch head of the school of public health at Israel’s Ben Gurion University and an adviser to the government on coronavirus policy said the deal has raised troubling concerns about the deepening disparity of vaccination efforts.

“In order to eradicate COVID-19 or at least control it in an efficient manner we need to see the global picture” Davidovitch said.

That disparity is particularly striking in the case of Israel and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who live under varying degrees of Israeli control and have yet to receive any vaccines.

While vaccinating its own Arab citizens and Palestinian residents of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem Israel says it is not responsible for inoculating the Palestinians. Edelstein said Israel will consider helping once it takes care of its own citizens.

But the Palestinians and major human rights groups say Israel remains an occupying power and is responsible for providing them vaccines. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh recently accused Israel of “racism” but has not publicly requested vaccines.

With tens of thousands of West Bank Palestinians working in Israel and its West Bank settlements experts say Israel should share vaccines on ethical and practical grounds.

“I truly think that we need to see how we get the vaccine for the Palestinian Authority” said Davidovitch acting chairman of Israel’s association of public health professionals. “We are talking about it with the minister of health and I really hope that soon this thing will be solved.”

It’s also uncertain exactly what information is being shared with Pfizer. According to the redacted agreement “no identifiable health information” shall be shared and the research is to be published in a recognized medical journal.

It said Israel will provide weekly data to Pfizer about various age and demographic groups. The objective it said is to “analyze epidemiological data arising from the product rollout to determine whether herd immunity is achieved after reaching a certain percentage of vaccination coverage in Israel.”

The data it added is “aimed at helping end the global COVID-19 pandemic for the benefit of all patients inside and outside of Israel.”

Privacy Israel an advocacy group that had petitioned the government to disclose the deal welcomed its release but said certain questions remained unanswered mostly about the handling and security of private information. It also blacked out certain details such as key dates and the names of officials involved. Still it said there is a “little more certainty” about sharing information with a global corporation.

Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler an expert in digital privacy at the Israel Democracy Institute questioned the ethics of a deal that could bring millions in profits to Pfizer. She also said sharing large quantities of information could still potentially put individuals’ privacy at risk even if it’s supposedly made anonymous.

“If God forbid the data set is going to be hacked then the risk is going to be yours” she said referring to Israeli citizens.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3VzLWhlYWx0aC1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1sZWJhbm9uL2xlYmFub24taW5rcy1maW5hbC1kZWFsLWZvci0yLTEtbWlsbGlvbi1kb3Nlcy1vZi1wZml6ZXItYmlvbnRlY2gtdmFjY2luZS1pZElOS0JOMjlNMEJGLz9lZGl0aW9uLXJlZGlyZWN0PWlu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lebanon inks final deal for 2.1 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-lebanon/lebanon-inks-final-deal-for-2-1-million-doses-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-idINKBN29M0BF/?edition-redirect=in on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3VzLWhlYWx0aC1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1sZWJhbm9uL2xlYmFub24taW5rcy1maW5hbC1kZWFsLWZvci0yLTEtbWlsbGlvbi1kb3Nlcy1vZi1wZml6ZXItYmlvbnRlY2gtdmFjY2luZS1pZElOS0JOMjlNMEJGLz9lZGl0aW9uLXJlZGlyZWN0PWlu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAxLzE2L25hdGlvbmFsL2phcGFuLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LXBmaXplci12YWNjaW5lLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japan seeks mid-February Pfizer vaccine approval minister says,"Health minister Norihisa Tamura said he’s hoping Pfizer Inc.’s coronavirus vaccine will be approved by mid-February under an accelerated process.

Earlier the age group thought to be in the danger zone was above 80 but the fresh six deaths on Saturday further lowered it to 75 and also raised questions over which groups to target in national inoculation programme.

Here is what we know so far:

- The Covid-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech is the only one available in Norway and all deaths are seen to be linked with it according to Norwegian Medicines Agency (NMA).

- The NMA wrote to news agency Bloomberg and confirmed that while most people have experienced the expected side effects of the vaccine 13 deaths have been assessed and another 16 are being looked at for having been caused due to it. “There are 13 deaths that have been assessed and we are aware of another 16 deaths that are currently being assessed” the agency said adding that all the reported deaths related to “elderly people with serious basic disorders”.

- The side effects being seen in most people are nausea and vomiting fever local reactions at the injection site and worsening of their underlying condition. According to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) the vaccine could have marginal or no benefit for those who have a very short remaining life span anyway. For those with the most severe frailty even relatively mild vaccine side effects can have serious consequences it added.

LONDON -- Israel is by far leading the world when it comes to vaccinating its population against COVID-19. Even as the country faces high rates of infection and is on lockdown last week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu boasted: “We will be the first country in the world to emerge from the coronavirus.”

More than 20% of its population of 9.29 million have so far received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine which to date far outstrips the rates of vaccination in every other country in the world.

Since approving the vaccine the country has moved quickly marshalling its emergency resources to great effect yet the vaccination program -- spearheaded by Netanyahu himself -- is not without controversy as the 5 million Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank have been excluded from the rollout.

Emergency footing

Israel possesses both a strong standardized public health system and a relatively small population. The U.S. meanwhile has 64 health jurisdictions – each with their own rules and regulations -- and the best per capita vaccination rates have been seen in areas with smaller populations.

Even so the rate of vaccination in Israel is astounding. Netanyahu announced on January 10 the objective to increase the pace of vaccinations to 170000 daily and said that 72% of people over the age of 60 have received their first dose. By March he said the government would “bring shipment after shipment and complete the vaccination of the over-16 population in Israel.” Then the authorities will look to begin vaccinating under 16s if the research shows it to be safe. As of Friday morning 170000 Israelis have received their second booster shot -- part of the two-shot regimen the Pfizer vaccine requires.

""At the moment we are in a mighty race between two events: The spread of the disease and the distribution of the vaccines” Netanyahu said. “We are ahead of the whole world in vaccines with the millions of vaccines that we have brought.”

Israel’s frontline healthcare workers have moved swiftly to vaccinate such large numbers in a short period of time.

While the majority of vaccinations are taking place outside hospitals at specialist centers staff continue to work flat out to both vaccinate the population and treat the steady influx of coronavirus patients.

At Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv which has been administering the vaccines for some time now the staff is very much on emergency footing to vaccinate as many as possible.

“It’s like a mission I’m doing injections for my friends and for my colleagues” Vicky Greenberg the head nurse at the hospital’s surgical intensive care unit told ABC News.

“I really hope that in a few months we’ll be able to celebrate Pesach (Passover) with our families not in Zoom like we did last year. I have to get married so I have to do it in May. It must work until May. Patient after patient for eight nine hours a day.”

Prof. Joseph Klausner Ichilov Hospital’s head of surgery described the early success of Israel’s early vaccination program as a “combined effort.”

“On one hand it is a relatively small community relative to the [United] States for instance so it's much easier to get there to get to the population and get treatment in there. But definitely there was some effort directed towards to achieve this.”

Dr. Dalit Salzer another doctor at the hospital told ABC News she was “proud and excited” to be a part of the early vaccination efforts at the beginning of a 26-hour shift.

The hospital’s current CEO is also Israel’s former COVID commissioner Prof. Ronni Ganzu who has seen the challenges of leading a coronavirus response from a national and local levels. Both a strong public healthcare system and manifold experiences of political and military crises have helped mobilize the resources required to vaccinate so many so quickly.

“We understand that in disaster in emergency situation we have a very short time to act” Ganzu told ABC News. ""And this is what we are really used to do. We are trained to do so the energy they want to do to win the war [we are] really looking forward to give the vaccine to as many as possible Israelis.”

Deals and data

The accelerated vaccination program is taking place at a time when the country is experiencing the highest rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality since the beginning of the pandemic . The country is in lockdown until January 21 even while rolling out its mass vaccinations with 3892 coronavirus deaths and 533026 confirmed cases as of Friday according to the Health Ministry.

The controversial Israeli prime minister has placed himself at front and center of the vaccination program’s success. He was the first Israeli to receive a jab and over the weekend with media present he received his second. Netanyahu has boasted of a close relationship with Pfizer’s Chairman and CEO Albert Courla whom he describes as a “friend.”

The pair have had 17 conversations as of January 17 Netanyahu claimed last Sunday. Israel will share with Pfizer and with the entire world the statistical data that will help develop strategies for defeating the coronavirus” as part of the agreement Netanyahu said earlier this month.

“Pfizer and the Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) have entered into a collaboration agreement to study the real-world impact of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine” a Pfizer spokesperson told ABC News.

“This project will gather critical real-world epidemiological information that will enable real time monitoring of the evolution of the epidemic in Israel and evaluate the potential of a vaccination program using the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to trigger indirect protection and interrupt viral transmission.

“While this project is conducted in Israel the insights gained will be applicable around the world and we anticipate will allow Governments to maximize the public health impact of their vaccination campaigns determine potential immunization rates needed to interrupt transmission and ultimately help bring an end to the global COVID-19 pandemic.”

A report in Politico claimed that an off the record briefing from officials on January 5 had suggested Israel were paying Pfizer $30 per person more than what is paid by some other countries. One report by an Israeli broadcaster claimed that the country had spent $47 per person  or $23.50 per dose according to the Times of Israel.

That is more than what the U.S. government paid for their initial 100 million doses $1.9 billion which amounts to $19 per dose and $38 per person. The EU agreed to pay Pfizer/BioNTech $18.50 per dose or $37 per person according to Reuters.

“In order to conduct this project the Israeli MoH will receive vaccine doses at a previously agreed price (which remains confidential)” the Pfizer spokesperson said.

Politics and Palestine

Israel’s vaccination policy has drawn the condemnation of human rights groups and the Palestinian National Authority as the rollout does not include the more than 5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza many of whom travel into Israel for work.

The country is vaccinating Israeli residents in settlements in the West Bank but not Palestinians who live there or in Gaza. Human rights groups including Amnesty International have said the exclusion means Israel is “ignoring its obligations” as an occupying force under international law and “exposes Israel’s institutionalised discrimination.”

There have been high rates of infections and death in the West Bank and Gaza which is currently under a short term lockdown and Amnesty called on Israel to “ensure that vaccines are equally provided to the Palestinians living under their control.”

“We condemn the racism of the occupation state which boasts about the speed of vaccinating its citizens and neglecting the legal responsibility to provide vaccines to the people under occupation” the Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said this month.

But that in the current climate is unlikely to happen. Yuli Edelstein the Israeli Health Minister has said the priority is to vaccinate as many Israelis first before considering any shortage on the Palestinian side.

The Palestinian Authority is in negotiations with several other companies to procure their own vaccines. The Russian Direct Investment Fund announced that the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine has been registered by the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The delivery of the vaccine will begin in February according to Mai Kailleh the Health Minister.

“I think there are definitely moral and legal obligations” Yossi Mekelberg a professor of international relations and senior fellow at the think tank Chatham House told ABC News. “Many of them work inside Israel or in the Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. They move from one place to another. But it doesn't play to Netanyahu's base and probably won't happen.""

In the meantime doctors in Gaza hit badly by the first wave and now fearing the surge of a second say the need for a vaccine is as acute as ever.

“We can say we are working in a comfortable situation we are not under pressure anymore and I hope this will continue because there is always a fear of a second wave and usually it is an aggressive one” Dr. Mohammed El Sheek Ali the head of the Covid department at the European Gaza Hospital told ABC News. “We need the vaccine and as soon as possible because we are facing a difficult situation in Gaza we have a lack of resources.”

Point guard Deivon Smith is transferring to St. John's from Utah giving Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino a veteran replacement for Daniss Jenkins next season.

A fifth-year senior Smith ranked sixth in the country with 7.1 assists per game last season. He averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Utes compiling five triple-doubles -- second most during a single season in NCAA history and the most by any Pac-12 player.

In a St. John's news release Monday Pitino said the 6-foot Smith reminds him of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier a standout player for Pitino at Louisville.

""Super excited to have Deivon Smith joining the Johnnies"" Pitino said. ""Total dog who rebounds creates and scores.""

Smith from Decatur Georgia played his freshman season at Mississippi State and then spent two years with Georgia Tech. He shot a career-high 46.7% from the field in 28 games during his only season at Utah.

Two of his triple-doubles came during Utah's run to the NIT semifinals and he scored a career-best 28 points against tournament runner-up Indiana State on April 2.

Bluebirds come up to guide us

… Oh we can fly we can fly.""

(Bob Cowsill Bill Cowsill A. Kornfield S. Ruboff)

This former Cowsill's hit song could have been the theme song last weekend for the Bartlesville Gymnastics Club sponsored by Phillips 66.

Taking flight in the Airborne Gymnastics Winter Invitational (Sapulpa) the club came home with a team championship trophy and a team runner-up award.

Bartlesville entered participants in the USA Level 3 X-Cel Gold TAG Level 1 TAG Level 2 and TAG Level 3 groups.

Led by two All-Around champions the Bartlesville club won the first-place title in X-Cel Gold.

Halle Vanfield surged to the All-Around honor in the X-Cel Gold 10-and-under division while winning individual crowns on the balance beam and floor exercise.

Kaylee Stark ruled the X-Cel Gold 11-and-older division as the All-Around queen while seizing the top spots on the uneven bars and balance team.

In the USA Level 3 wars Bartlesville came in second overall led by second-place All-Around warrior Dylan Sweany (eight-year-olds) and third-place All-Around battlers Burklee Orphin (7-and-under) and Sophia Mayer (9-and-older).

Orphin and Ella Lindesmith (8-year-olds) both won the uneven bars in their respective competitions.

Club director/head coach Lorrie Bertolet said Bartlesville has given itself a handicap this season by advancing several athletes to a higher level this season even though many clubs have opted for their girls to compete on the same level as last year.

She added that Level 3 age group head coach Rachel Coyle praised the progress of her athletes from meet to meet.

""We were so pleased to be able to compete in a gymnastics competition"" Bertolet continued. ""These athletes work hard and deserve to get out and show off for the judges. It definitely has been a different start to the season but we will persevere and continue to train. Gymnastics is such a great sport and we will look forward to our rest of the season.""

Originally published on The Climate Docket.

With oral arguments set for next week before the U.S. Supreme Court in a climate liability lawsuit against the country’s largest oil companies Justice Amy Coney Barrett whose father was a Shell attorney for nearly three decades has still not said whether she will recuse herself.

“My father worked at Shell Oil Company for many years and while on the Seventh Circuit in an abundance of caution I have recused myself from cases involving those Shell entities with which he was involved” Barrett wrote in her response to questions submitted by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse as part of her nomination process.

As it stands now Justice Samuel Alito who owns stock in ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 will recuse himself leaving the court with a potential for a 4-4 split vote. A recusal by Coney Barrett would eliminate that possibility.

While the court’s decision involves a limited legal issue in Baltimore’s case against fossil fuel companies it could decide the crucial point of whether all of the climate liability suits filed against the industry will be heard in state or federal court.

Coney Barrett’s potential conflict of interest stems from her father Michael E. Coney who in addition to working for Shell also held leadership positions with the American Petroleum Institute (API) for two decades. He served on its subcommittee of exploration and production law and twice served as its chairman. He was also chairman of the legal subcommittee of the API’s offshore operations committee and frequently reviewed and drafted comments on policies related to the Outer Continental Shelf (OCF).

The API is the nation’s largest and most powerful fossil fuel trade association. Nearly all of the companies named in Baltimore’s suit—including Shell—are API members.

Baltimore filed suit in Maryland state court in 2018 against ExxonMobil Chevron Shell BP and nearly two dozen other fossil fuel companies alleging that they knew for decades that their products drive climate change but deliberately failed to inform the public about those risks. The city charged the companies with eight violations including public nuisance private nuisance failure to warn and violations of Maryland’s consumer protection laws.

The Supreme Court’s ruling could determine the fate of Baltimore’s case and the companies have asked it to apply its decision to many of the other climate change-related cases filed against them by municipalities across the country.

The high court is not expected to address the merits of the case but has agreed to review a technical question involving the scope of appellate review in jurisdictional matters. The issue of jurisdiction—whether the cases will be heard in state court where they were filed or in federal court where the companies think they have a better chance of shaking them—has been hotly contested.

A win for Baltimore means the case—and others like it— will likely proceed in state court. If the court sides with the fossil fuel companies it could send the case back to the Fourth Circuit for further review of the energy giants’ arguments for federal jurisdiction.

A split decision which could result if one or three justices were to recuse leaving an even number to hear the case would give the appellate court which has already decided in Baltimore’s favor the final say.

The companies have argued that because they operated with leases issued by the federal government they were acting as “federal officers” and therefore the case belongs in federal court.

As it turns out Barrett’s father may have worked on some of those lease agreements.

Between 1978 and 2007 part of Coney’s responsibilities for Shell included lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) legal support of Shell’s expansion into the deep water OCS the drafting and interpretation of shelf and deep water unit and joint operating agreements and negotiations related to the oil giant’s drilling contracts.

Shell and several of its subsidiaries are included on a recusal list Barrett used while at the Seventh Circuit.

“If confirmed I will continue my present practice of using a recusal list to identify and avoid potential conflicts” Barrett wrote on her Senate Judiciary Committee Questionnaire.

Barrett didn’t say whether Shell would remain on that list.

“She might say ‘my new lists of conflicts at [the Supreme Court] doesn’t include Shell’” said

Gabe Roth executive director of Fix The Court an organization that advocates for a more accountable and transparent judiciary.

The Supreme Court doesn’t require conflict lists to be made public but it’s not unusual for a newly confirmed justice to revise their list Roth explained.

For Barrett updating the list so soon after her nomination process could raise questions.

“If you’re coming out and sending the Senate Judiciary Committee a list of your conflicts on which Shell is listed several times—in various combinations and permutations seven different ways—then I think the American people are owed an explanation as to why Shell is no longer a conflict” Roth said.

Federal Recusal Law

Under federal law justices are required to recuse themselves if a reasonable person might question their impartiality or if they have a financial interest in the case.

Included in the latter is the provision that a judge must recuse if a “person within the third degree of relationship”—which would include a parent—is known “to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.”

It’s unclear what if any stake Barrett’s father who left Shell in 2007 still has in the company. If ultimately found liable for its role in climate change Shell could find itself on the hook for billions if not trillions of dollars in damages a financial jolt even for an oil company.

“With Alito it’s very open and shut—he owns stocks and federal law says if you own stock you have to recuse” Roth said.

Barrett’s situation is less clear-cut according to Louis J. Virelli III a law professor at Stetson University who has written on the Supreme Court recusal process.

“I don’t think there’s any sort of a financial or other interest standard that would trigger recusal for Justice Barrett based on her father’s prior involvement with Shell or the API” Virelli said adding that even so it would be easy to understand if she chose to recuse herself.

The interesting and more relevant question is whether a reasonable person might think Barrett is unable to be impartial because of her father’s relationship with the fossil fuel industry.

“It doesn’t mean that she can’t be it means she could appear to not be” Virelli said. “That is by definition very fact-specific and it’s going to depend on the depth of her father’s involvement her relationship with him and/or the industry—lots of things that are very difficult to characterize.”

Nine Irreplaceable Justices

The Constitution gives Congress the power to determine the composition of the Supreme Court.

“It is a nine-person court and they are non-replaceable” Virelli said. “So another consideration that the justices have to take into account—and we can fight about whether or not they’re doing a good job of this—is ‘what happens if I recuse myself and we end up with a tie vote’ or ‘what happens if four of my colleagues and I all recuse ourselves and now we don’t have a quorum and we can’t decide the case at all.’”

The dilemma highlights the inadequacy of the current recusal statute according to Virelli.

“We need to think of Supreme Court recusal outside the scope of the statute and we need to think about this balance between the court being able to do its job and the ethical phenomenon of the justices participating” Virelli said.

“With an appellate court judge who can be replaced we would say you have a legal obligation to recuse because it doesn’t in any way shape or form affect the court’s ability to do its job. With the Supreme Court it’s different—they cannot be replaced” Virelli added.

Supreme Court recusal is not uncommon Fix the Court says with an average of 150-200 recusals among the nine justices every year.

The justices have recused themselves a combined total of 89 times this term which began in October. Most involve cases the justice has heard or worked on prior to his or her confirmation.

In addition to the Baltimore case Alito has recused eight other times this term due to stock ownership. Justice Alito Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Steven Breyer are the only justices who still own individual stock. Other reasons include cases in which the justice is a named party and Coney Barrett sat out cases in which she did not hear arguments or have time to review.

If Coney Barrett were to recuse herself from the Baltimore case the court would be left with seven justices a situation that is not unusual at this stage but is less common once review is granted. Six justices are required to reach a quorum.

When justices do recuse themselves they rarely share their reasoning.

“They don’t say much about recusal publicly and they never explain their decisions in writing—there’s been maybe three or four in explanations in the last 50 years” Virelli said adding that his sense is that the justices are diligent about recusing themselves.

With the number of climate-related cases rapidly growing it’s increasingly likely that the Supreme Court will be asked to weigh in again in the future. Next time the question could involve the meatier issues of climate change and attempts by municipalities to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for their decades-long campaigns of deception and for damages done by the use of their products.

“It brings into focus the need to really push hard on the justices to sell their individual stock” Roth said.

“The idea that three of the justices continue to own stock and of those one of the justices Justice Alito continues to own stock in fossil fuel companies that means that at almost every turn you’re only going to have eight justice deciding these major cases and that’s less than ideal” Roth said adding that if the court were split the judiciary would be left without a ruling.

Oral arguments are scheduled for January 19.

Trump,"SAN FRANCISCO — Jack Dorsey Twitter’s chief executive was working remotely on a private island in French Polynesia frequented by celebrities escaping the paparazzi when a phone call interrupted him on Jan. 6.

On the line was Vijaya Gadde Twitter’s top lawyer and safety expert with an update from the real world. She said she and other company executives had decided to lock President Trump’s account temporarily to prevent him from posting statements that might provoke more violence after a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol that day.

Mr. Dorsey was concerned about the move said two people with knowledge of the call. For four years he had resisted demands by liberals and others that Twitter terminate Mr. Trump’s account arguing that the platform was a place where world leaders could speak even if their views were heinous. But he had delegated moderation decisions to Ms. Gadde 46 and usually deferred to her — and he did so again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vbmV3cy9jcnlwdG8tbWluaW5nLWdpYW50LWJpdG1haW4tZ29pbmctcHVibGljLTQwNTAtYmlsbGlvbi12YWx1YXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crypto Mining Giant Bitmain Is Going Public With a $40 to $50 Billion Valuation,"Cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain Technologies Ltd. filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in September 2018. Although Bitmain closed its pre-IPO round with $1 billion (valuing the firm at $15 billion post-deal) the company ultimately failed in its attempt to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX). The company's application lapsed in March 2019 and it was not re-filed.

The Beijing-based company had been valued somewhere between $40 billion and $50 billion prior to its IPO making it potentially one of the largest public offerings ever had it been successful.﻿﻿

Key Takeaways Cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain Technologies Ltd. filing for an initial public offering (IPO) in September 2018 was ultimately unsuccessful.

It has been reported that the company confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the end of 2019.

Bitmain is a dominant player in the mining equipment business

The company had raised approximately $450 million from investors between 2013 when it was founded by Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan and 2018 and it was valued at $12 billion in private markets during its funding round in June 2018. The failed offering was underwritten by China International Capital Corporation.

At the end of 2019 it was reported that Bitmain confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However as of January 17 2021 Bitmain is still a private company.

In November 2019 Canaan Creative the Chinese bitcoin-mining machine manufacturer became the first cryptocurrency company to be listed on the Nasdaq. Canaan a Cayman Island-registered company is one of the largest manufacturers of the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) devices that are used to mine cryptocurrency. Because Canaan and Bitmain both filed for an IPO with the SEC around the same time the successful listing of Canaan was considered a kind of ""coup"" by some in the cryptocurrency community.

How Does Bitmain Make Money?

Coindesk which claimed to have seen filing documents for the IPO stated that Bitmain had earned a total of $2.3 billion in profits across 2016 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. Skyrocketing prices in cryptocurrency markets garnered a profit of $1.1 billion for the company in 2017.﻿﻿ Industry analysts have a more optimistic take on Bitmain’s prospects. In February this year Bernstein Research estimated that Bitmain is generating profits of as much as $3 billion per year.

Bitmain is a vertically-integrated company. It makes its own chips for mining rigs which are sold to end customers. It also uses them in equipment for cryptocurrency mining farms.

Bitmain is a dominant player in the mining equipment business.﻿﻿ It has been estimated that Bitmain controls as much as 80% of the market for bitcoin mining equipment.﻿﻿ The company’s Application-ASIC chips are the industry’s favored workhorses for cryptocurrency mining.

In fact any of Bitmain’s announcements regarding the development of ASICs for specific cryptocurrencies are generally considered indicators that the coin’s numbers in the market will multiply in the coming months.﻿﻿ The company also runs two of the largest bitcoin mining pools in the world BTC.com and Antpool. Those pools together account for somewhere between 42% and 51% of the total mining capacity for bitcoin.﻿﻿

What’s In The Future For Bitmain?

Cryptocurrency markets exert a strong influence on Bitmain’s revenues. A run-up in crypto prices in 2017 had a positive impact on Bitmain’s revenues. This is because it translated to an increased demand for its machines and greater profits from its mining operations. During the surge in crypto markets in 2017 Bitmain increased prices for its mining machines. Conversely a slide in prices means less demand for Bitmain’s machines and lower profitability from its mining operations.

To that extent Bitmain has diversified its revenue base. It announced a major foray into artificial intelligence in 2018: the Sophon BM1680 a chip that promises to speed up machine learning algorithms. In an interview with Bloomberg in May 2018 Wu said that as much as 40% of Bitmain’s revenue will come from AI chips in 5 years.﻿﻿

That is not all. Researchers have predicted that ASIC chips will be the building blocks for ASIC clouds that can “provide a glimpse into planet-scale computing’s future.” According to Michael Bedford Taylor at the University of Washington in Seattle ASIC chips herald the next wave of distributed computing. In a paper he outlined the concept of bespoke silicon a customized form of silicon that leverages specialization to outperform high-volume general-purpose System on Chips (SoCs) by industry giants. As a major industry player in ASIC chips Bitmain is well-positioned to benefit from these predictions.﻿﻿

According to Coindesk Bitmain outlined its plans to go “head-to-head” with the U.S. and Chinese semiconductor giants in its investor prospectus. “In half a decade Bitmain has captured 8% of the domestic chip design market where Huawei HiSilicon has taken 14 years to achieve 17%. At this rate Bitmain could near or overcome Huawei HiSilicon’s local stronghold very soon.”﻿﻿

In 2020 Coindesk included Bitmain in its list of the Coindesk 50 an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. Coindesk referred to Bitmain as the ""Behemoth of Bitcoin Mining"" and claimed that Bitmain remains at the center of the crypto economy.

However if the board wants to tap her decades of expertise in consumer products management and operations she'll be far more receptive.

When Six Flags Entertainment Corp. approached Bracey last year about serving on its board she was intrigued. ""They were looking for a seasoned business leader"" says Bracey Unilever's executive vice president and chief operating officer of beauty and personal care in North America. She knew she would learn and grow by advising a business forced to recalibrate during the coronavirus pandemic. ""I thought it would be fascinating—fascinating—to be part of that"" she says.



Last summer Bracey became a Six Flags director part of a surge of women and people of color who have joined corporate boards traditionally dominated by white men. Among the confluence of forces moving boards toward greater diversity: activism and protests by women and people of color including the Black Lives Matter movement; pressure from investors and shareholders; and state legislation.



Despite recent advances however corporate boards still do not reflect the increasing diversity of the U.S. population.



White individuals account for about 60 percent of the population but hold 84 percent of Fortune 500 board seats.

Latinos the country's fastest-growing ethnicity make up 18.5 of the population but fill just 2.2 percent of board seats on Russell 3000 companies' boards.

Black individuals represent 12.5 percent of the population but hold just 4.1 percent of Russell 3000 board seats. In addition 37 percent of S&P 500 companies had no Black board members in 2019.

Women have fared better filling 45 percent of new Russell 3000 board seats and 46 percent of new S&P board seats in 2019. That year however women held just 19 percent of all Russell 3000 board seats and about 25 percent of seats on S&P boards.



Mandating Diverse Boards

To move the needle faster California became the first state to require diversity on corporate boards starting with women and followed by ""underrepresented populations."" A law that took effect in 2019 requires the boards of all California-based publicly held companies to have at least one female director by the end of that year and three by the end of 2021. Violators can be fined up to $300000.

The state of Washington passed a law effective June 2020 requiring corporate boards to be at least 25 percent female. Other states including Massachusetts and New Jersey have considered mandating board diversity and Illinois requires companies to disclose their female and minority board membership. Countries including Iceland Israel Norway Italy France Belgium and Finland have quotas for female directors that range from 33 percent to 50 percent.







The California law boosted the number of women on corporate boards but it has had little impact on the ethnic and racial diversity of board members. Though Latinos make up 39 percent of the Golden State's population just 3.3 percent of the women on corporate boards are Latinas according to the Latino Corporate Directors Association (LCDA). Of the 511 board seats filled at California public companies between 2019 and March 2020 only 17 went to Latinas.

Another California law which took effect Sept. 30 2020 requires the state's publicly traded companies to have at least one director from an underrepresented community (defined as people who are gay lesbian bisexual transgender Native American Native Hawaiian Alaska Native Pacific Islander Asian Latino Hispanic Black or African-American). As of mid-2020 35 percent of publicly traded companies based in California had boards of directors that were exclusively white the LCDA found. Of the 429 boards considered racially diverse 66 percent had at least one member who was Asian 25 percent had at least one who was Black 20 percent had at least one who was Latino and 10 percent had at least one member who was nonwhite/other.



Quota Opposition

Laws that dictate the composition of corporate boards have come under fire. The libertarian nonprofit Pacific Legal Foundation and conservative activist nonprofit group Judicial Watch claim quotas violate the tenet of equal protection under the law. The groups have filed lawsuits to stop them.

""You can't have the government forcing us to take race and gender into account"" for board appointments says Daniel Ortner a Pacific Legal Foundation attorney.

He and other opponents say pressure from investors shareholders and the public are better legal alternatives to quotas. That pressure is mounting. BlackRock Inc. the world's largest money manager told its portfolio companies in 2018 that it wants boards to have at least two female directors. Vanguard Group last year began asking the boards of companies it invests in to report back on the gender age and race of their board members. And Goldman Sachs announced that starting July 1 2020 it would no longer underwrite initial public offerings of American and European companies that were not diverse.

In December 2020 Nasdaq proposed new rules requiring most companies listed on its U.S. stock exchange to have or explain why they don't have at least one female director and one director who self-identifies as an underrepresented minority or as LGBTQ. Additionally all Nasdaq-listed companies would have to publicly disclose diversity statistics regarding their boards of directors.

Civic leaders business activists and advocacy groups such as 2020 Women on Boards and the LCDA have also been outspoken about the need for change. A consortium of Latino leaders is demanding that public company boards triple Latino representation by 2023 asserting that the push for diversity has benefited women and Black individuals but eluded Latinos.







Latinos are significantly underrepresented on corporate boards says Ana Dutra co-chair of the Latino Corporate Directors Education Foundation. The LCDA runs a training program to prepare executives and leaders for board service and maintains a referrals list. ""The bottom line is that there's no excuse"" for homogenous board leadership she says.

Executives should tap those advocacy groups for board candidates who aren't typically members of their often-homogenous networks of CEOs and CFOs says Lyndon Taylor managing partner of executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles' global diversity and inclusion practice. ""Board members should ask each other to build the pipeline and think about the board's needs in one three and five years down the line"" he says. ""That will lead to a much broader range of candidates"" including trailblazers in academia community organizations nonprofits and the military.

Effective Recruitment and Engagement

When a board seeking a diverse pool of candidates contacts Egon Zehnder recruiter Charles ""Chuck"" Gray Gray asks what expertise the leadership lacks. ""You want someone who joins a board for their skill set and they just happen to be a woman or a person of color"" says Gray who leads the firm's technology officers board and diversity practices. ""You want to layer diversity on top of those areas of expertise.""

Candidates can quickly suss out whether they're being courted for their business acumen or the color of their skin. ""If [race] is the only way they're contributing those executives are not going to feel valued"" Gray says. What they need to hear he maintains is ""We're calling because you have incredible supply-chain experience … and it's great that you're a person of color.""







Dutra who serves on several boards and is CEO of management consulting firm Mandala Global Advisors rejects board roles that don't tap her knowledge of growth globalization and management. ""If I ever felt like I was a token I wouldn't take it"" she says. ""I have to believe I was being recruited for more than that and that I have value to add. I want to be a super-effective director who happens to be a woman and happens to be a Latina.""

Because being the sole woman or person of color on an otherwise homogenous board can be challenging recruiters suggest boards add two or three directors from diverse groups at a time when possible. ""It makes the experience better and richer"" says Molly Brennan a recruiter with executive search firm Koya Leadership Partners in Boston.

But someone has to be the pioneer says Bracey the Six Flags board member. ""If I shied away from boards because I didn't want to be the first person of color"" she says ""I'd never be on a board.""



When people of color and women join boards they should not be tasked with spearheading training around diversity equity and inclusion—unless that's their area of expertise and they have offered to lead that initiative. ""Just because you're a woman or person of color it doesn't mean you are by default the expert on diversity"" Gray says. ""But a woman or person of color will bring attention to issues that are previously not addressed."" A woman for example may be more likely to call attention to the lack of women in leadership roles in the organization.



Moving Forward Slowly



Today's emerging U.S. workers are growing up in a country that's far more diverse than what their parents and grandparents experienced. White individuals account for just under 50 percent of U.S. residents under age 16 a drop of about 11 percentage points from 2000. The decade of 2010-2020 is likely to be the first since 1790—when the first U.S. census was taken—that the white population did not grow according to The Brookings Institution.



Meanwhile the percentage of Latino/Hispanic teens jumped by nearly 9 percentage points to 25.8 percent in 2019 from 17.2 percent in 2000. The percent of Black individuals under age 16 dipped to 13.7 percent in 2019 from 14.6 percent in 2000. During that same period the percentage of under-16 Asian-American teens rose slightly to 4.5 percent from 3.4 percent.

Recruiters and executives are cautiously optimistic about change. Taylor of Heidrick & Struggles says 62 percent of the placements he made in 2020 were women and people of color. In 2018 his executive search firm committed to presenting more diverse slates of board candidates.



Gray of Egon Zehnder says he is pleased by the changes he's seeing ""but we are a long way from the ideal.""

Meanwhile consumers stockholders and the public are watching—and demanding that executives and companies do more to promote board diversity faster.

""This is an age of transparency"" says David Rodriguez Marriott International's executive vice president and global chief human resources officer and a member of the board of directors of cabinetmaker American Woodmark. ""There's going to be pressure on companies and there's no hiding these days.""

The first article covered strategies to kick-start a finance transformation and the second article is on automating finance processes.

In the current rush to digitise and automate processes we can sometimes forget that automation is a means to an end and that end is finance business partnering. It’s a role that drives value for the company and its stakeholders. It’s also a role that requires a drastic shift in mindset and gaining business knowledge to gain internal customers’ trust.

Drawing on past experiences I share in this article four strategies to transition a traditional finance and accounting (F&A) team to one that can serve as an effective and strategic business partner:

Define the strategic vision of business partnering;

Upskill F&A to understand the business model the value-creation process and key performance indicators (KPIs);

Win trust as business advisers; and

Enable cross-functional projects.

Define the strategic vision of business partnering

The vision and goals of business partnering should start from listening to what internal customers want. Reaching a certain level of consensus and agreement with key stakeholders helps establish credibility and trust in finance business partners (FBPs). When expectations are aligned it is much easier for F&A to serve the needs of internal customers. In seeking these alignments it is vital to work closely with the senior management team.

From a transformation project I was involved in feedback sessions and discussions revealed that other departments expected F&A to:

Give forward-pointing ideas in areas that the business and operations departments can improve;

Critique the strategic direction the operations department is heading towards (are they creating value for the company in an efficient and cost-effective way?); and

Raise an alarm for imminent risks (“seeing the smoke before the fire”).

These became the strategic vision of finance business partnering.

In different companies and at different stages of development the F&A team would be asked to perform slightly different roles. For example a business considering an acquisition would require an FBP to assist in deal evaluation and deal negotiation. On the other hand a business looking to recover from its loss position would require F&A to identify opportunities to turn around the business.

Upskill F&A to understand the business model the value-creation process and KPIs

Instead of talking about accounting standards control issues and cash flow with various operations departments F&A has to establish credibility and trust to receive buy-in as FBPs. This means that F&A will need to learn to talk business strategy and in language normally used by those departments.

How can that be done?

In the previous transformation project using external consultants to conduct training courses was one idea that came to mind. But we later realised that we would have had to teach the consultant the company’s business model value-creation process and KPIs — all from scratch. We realised that the best trainers are the people involved in these processes on a day-to-day basis — namely the operations departments. But those departments had their hands full managing their usual tasks and were in many instances in a “firefighting” mode. Would they have the time to do this? Would they be willing to do it?

During a routine senior management team meeting I raised the possibility of having various operations department heads and their key staff conduct training. After many deliberations we agreed to have operations staff conduct training with finance staff in two focus areas:

How operations departments create value in the entire supply chain of the business and their KPIs; and

The key technical language that operations departments use and why they are important to the business.

In addition the proposed training was not tailored for F&A only. Operations departments B C and D could attend training conducted by Operations Department A. A key feature of these training sessions was to have F&A and other operations departments act as consultants to identify opportunities for further improvements. For instance if Operations Department A were conducting training F&A and Operations Department B would analyse reports and brainstorm ways to help Operations Department A become more successful.

For example the research and development (R&D) department taught F&A and other operations departments about products’ functionality products’ perceived value to customers and factors that differentiated products from competitors in the market. In a subsequent training session F&A discussed ways to track invested R&D hours versus output more effectively using their new understanding of the key activities of the R&D department. F&A worked closely with R&D to further improve the method of measuring the returns obtained from R&D expenditure. This resulted in the R&D department being able to focus more efforts on high-return projects.

These training sessions helped enhance empathy cooperation and teamwork among various departments. I also noticed that presenting these training sessions as aimed at improving the trainers’ department instead of finding fault made the trainers more willing to teach and share information.

Gradually as a result of the training sessions the F&A staff and operations staff had sharpened their business acumen and deepened their knowledge of the organisation’s businesses.

From that experience I realised also that the training needed to be repeated multiple times. This was a critical factor for us. In much the same way that professional athletes become better by practising the same set of skills continuously repeated training sessions further enhanced proficiency. Repetition also ensured that more people could participate in the training sessions.

Win trust as business advisers

Learning technical terms from operations departments enabled F&A to speak in the language of those teams. But even after a few rounds of training the F&A team — not surprisingly — still didn’t have the same operational expertise as someone in sales and marketing purchasing or R&D. So how can F&A win the trust of operations departments as a trusted adviser?

Experience shows that the key for FBPs to win trust is not knowing as much as the sales and marketing department purchasing department or R&D department to take over their jobs. The value of the training sessions is in exposing F&A to the value creation of operations departments and their technical jargon. Once F&A understands these technical terms KPIs and value-adding activities it is able to explore forward-pointing strategy with the operations department.

Some useful activities that you can consider introducing in F&A:

Continuously exploring strategic options with operations departments brainstorming solutions or critiquing their strategic options in a nonconfrontational way.

Sharing market intelligence such as competitors’ strategic moves and state-of-the-art practices of market players. This requires F&A to study the market and speak to outward-facing departments like sales and marketing or purchasing to get a pulse of the external competitive forces at work. Such information can inspire operations departments to make further improvements.

Here’s a real example to illustrate the value FBP can bring to the table: In a manufacturing company I worked for a global supply chain crunch caused a supplier that normally delivered 60 days from the purchase order date to change its delivery lead time to 360 days.

In such cases the purchasing department would normally work closely with the supplier to see whether the delivery time could be shortened. But F&A understood the purchasing department’s major KPIs and its value-creation process — to ensure on-time delivery of raw materials. So F&A proactively played the FBP role by organising meetings with the purchasing department to explore strategic options to overcome the global supply chain issue.

One forward-pointing strategy that came from the discussions was exploring whether the purchasing department could temporarily purchase from other suppliers. Another forward-pointing strategy from F&A was to stress-test the company’s key suppliers. If the company were to increase its orders from all its suppliers by 20% or if all of its suppliers’ customers increased orders by 20% would the suppliers be able to maintain their 60-day delivery lead time? Conducting such stress tests ensured that F&A could “see the smoke before the fire”.

In winning trust as advisers a key lesson I learned is to allow operations to take the credit for strategic moves. This way they would not see F&A as a threat to their “rice bowl” and would be more willing to work with F&A.

Enable cross-functional projects as FBP

Another strategy to consider is for F&A to volunteer to lead cross-functional projects. These can include projects to enhance the costing and pricing formula to better track how much discount to provide for large sales orders and to improve operational efficiency. Through these cross-functional projects F&A can be exposed to practical ways to solve business problems together with operations departments and gradually accumulate business acumen.

However during the finance transformation I was a part of many F&A team members remarked that they were still not used to giving forward-pointing strategies. This can be solved by lowering the initial bar by having the team give one or two forward-pointing strategies out of say ten business partnering issues. F&A can continuously work on the next step towards giving three to four ideas out of another set of ten business partnering issues. This way F&A is given time to build up confidence and knowledge.

Another tip to keep in mind is to be humble and ask questions instead of giving instructions. F&A’s role is to provide services to help business make better decisions instead of creating obstacles. In my experience asking questions to seek advice generally made operations departments less defensive.

For example F&A can ask how it can help operations in their automation and digitalisation journey. F&A can also assist in calculating return on investment (ROI) for the operations department’s proposal to automate a business process.

Closing words: FBP is a continuous process

F&A should be encouraged to have regular conversation with other parts of the business and participate in industrial group meetings. F&A could start having regular internal meetings to share best practice. Some members of F&A could be sent to interact and collect insights on the state-of-the-art practice in the market and to understand external factors that could impact the business. These can enable F&A to provide more strategic inputs to the business.

To sum up finance’s transformation towards finance business partnering is a continuous process. There will not be a moment when F&A has arrived at the end of this transformation journey. As competition and businesses evolve F&A should constantly look for opportunities to improve as FBPs and to help the business.

We’ve published our Black Power list — highlighting the most influential Black leaders in Wisconsin — every year since our founding and it’s become the most anticipated thing we do. Since 2015 we’ve also published five lists of Wisconsin’s most powerful Latino leaders and just this year we’ve added lists of the state’s most influential and accomplished Indigenous and Asian American leaders.

And now this year more than ever it’s time to look beyond Wisconsin. To people on the coasts and even in the mainstream media even the word “Midwest” is often a substitute for “white.” But we know better and so do you — from the Twin Cities to Cincinnati from Michigan’s UP to central Iowa people of color are thriving leading and changing their communities.

We can’t pretend of course that this is just another year. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on our communities — our health and our jobs and our financial wellbeing and our education system and all of these effects are most pronounced in our Black communities. Add to that the brighter-than-ever spotlight on the injustice of systemic racism — it’s been a tough year for everybody but even more so for our communities of color.

Many have responded to this extraordinary year by expressing an authentic desire to learn more about Black communities celebrate Black excellence. This has also led to a reckoning with regard to other communities of color and a desire to learn more about and celebrate communities of color more broadly. That’s what this list is about. This list is not just a list. It is also an invitation — an invitation to engage to create to make your states and your communities wherever you are across this region a better place to attract and retain leaders of color.

We have never intended our lists to be exhaustive. It’s also not limited to people we agree with politically or otherwise. This list will however introduce you to some people you’ve never heard of who are doing great things in other parts of the region or simply working behind the scenes doing the work without the accolades.

With this list I hope you learn something you didn’t know about some of the real leaders in communities throughout the Midwest and that we might be able to make some connections and start conversations that really move communities forward.

P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYXdheXRvZ2FyZGVuLmNvbS9zY3VscHR1cmFsLXBvdHMtaW4tdGhlLWdhcmRlbi13aXRoLXN0ZXBoZW4tcHJvY3Rlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter,"Pin 11 11 Shares

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

Here's how his commercials took off.,"Jenni Carlson

Matt Dillon marvels at Baker Mayfield’s output and efficiency.

Time can be short. Direction can be minimal. Pressure can be high.

And still Mayfield can produce.

“Two days in Cleveland over the summer” Dillon said “we were able to capture eight to 10 television spots as well as digital content.”

He paused.

“In just two days. A normal two-day shoot would normally get two to three spots.”

Dillon isn’t talking of course about Mayfield’s quarterbacking. Even though Dillon is a Browns fan and is pumped about Cleveland’s playoff run he has been a Baker believer almost since the beginning of his NFL career. Dillon is the business leader for creative development at Progressive Insurance and he was one of the folks who brought on Mayfield as a Progressive pitchman a couple years back.

Now we are all the beneficiaries.

Who doesn’t love “At Home with Baker Mayfield”?

As the NFL Playoffs roll on the commercials featuring the former OU quarterback will help the timeouts pass a little quicker. The spots show Mayfield and real-world wife Emily doing things that homeowners often do but their “home” is FirstEnergy Stadium home of the Cleveland Browns.

The commercials are funny and relatable — in one of the spots released this season Mayfield returns home with a trunk full of groceries but manages to carry every bag inside in one trip lamenting at one point “I can’t feel my fingers!” — and they are memorable.

Even with just one line you remember them.

“Can we talk about this honeymoon scene? Wooooo!”

“Come on with two people it’ll be twice as fast!”

“Wait we’re having company? I didn’t put out the snacks. Do we have any of those mini quiches? And remove anything breakable — they might have little kids!”

This is the second season of the “At Home with Baker” series and Progressive knows it has hit on something big. The spots run nationally and folks at the Mayfield Heights (yes Mayfield) Ohio-based insurance company have seen lots of evidence of their impact including social media chatter.

“There were some bad-weather games throughout the season” Dillon said “and you had social mentions saying ‘Hey Baker you need to cover the seats’ and tying it back to our spots.”

The series has been such a hit that you’re likely to see Mayfield on more commercials this weekend than Aaron Rodgers or Patrick Mahomes or any other NFL quarterback. Never mind that those guys have won Super Bowls and MVPs and Mayfield only has one playoff win to his name to this point.

He is marketing gold.

So how did the Progressive partnership come to be?

And why does it work?

It started back during Mayfield’s rookie year in Cleveland. One of his representatives Chris Talbott made contact with Jeff Charney Progressive’s chief marketing officer. Talbott was impressed not only with the way Progressive had grown its business — it was the first major auto insurer to launch a website which has made it a top-three insurer — but also with the way it has sold its business.

Progressive has some of the most memorable TV ad characters in recent memory.

Flo and Jamie.

The Sign Spinner.

Mark and Marcus the chain gang crew.

And recently came Dr. Rick protecting you from becoming your parents.

(“We all see it. We all see it.”

“He has blue hair.”

“Blue!”)

But when Talbott brand strategist for the Mayfield family's Camwood Group connected with Progressive he learned they were looking to partner with an athlete. He felt like the company’s vibe — young and hip and (no pun intended) progressive — might mesh well with Mayfield.

When Mayfield met with Progressive's marketing folks they put him through their own combine. They would give him a word for example and ask him to say the first thing that came to mind. They wanted to see how quickly he was able to think on his feet.

“What they needed to figure out … ” Talbott said “was ‘Can Baker handle improvisation?’ We’ve seen him do it with his feet we’ve seen him do it with his arm. But we also know there are certain athletes that are unbelievable when they’re playing a sport but they can be kind of shy or just not have that kind of knack for acting.’”

Progressive uses lots of improv in its shoots. The scripts are foundations and frameworks not fully constructed houses so they need actors who can manage that. Dillon and his cohorts quickly knew Mayfield was capable.

“We felt something special was about to happen” Dillon said.

They haven’t been disappointed.

“We’ll put Baker in a scenario. We’ll have a general thought of what we want to accomplish but from there Baker will really take a line and customize it or Baker-ize it so that it feels authentic” Dillon said. “You really can see Baker shine.”

Erick Worrell founder of Oklahoma City-based advertising and copywriting agency Mattersword and executive director of marketing and PR at Oklahoma City Community College likened Mayfield’s on-screen abilities to those of another OU alum. Blake Griffin did commercials for Kia for several years including a time-travel series where he would visit and advise his younger self.

In one of those spots he stopped a flag football game by grabbing the ball telling his younger self “Wrong sport” then punting the ball far away.

“And stop wearing jean shorts” Griffin said at the end. “Just trust me.”

Worrell likened Griffin’s delivery to Mayfield’s.

“They’re both really impressive to me just being able to play deadpan” Worrell said.

And he wonders what doors might open for Mayfield because these high-profile Progressive commercials. There may be other sponsorships but other kinds of deals such as TV appearances might be possible too.

“It’s a little bit of a way of him showing the world that he’s in on the joke that he can poke fun at himself” Worrell said. “He can not take himself too seriously and then by doing that it really humanizes him.”

Talbott said “My first thought when I was with him for our very first (Progressive) shoot together I thought ‘Man this guy could host “Saturday Night Live.”’ … I’m not saying he’s going to be John Belushi or some of the great actors that have come to ‘Saturday Night Live’ but I think he really would be tremendous on that.”

In the short term though Mayfield and his people would be happy to continue their relationship with Progressive. The insurance company is equally interested and conversations will come after the Browns’ season is over.

Dillon and others are willing to delay those conversations if it's because Cleveland keep winning. Being headquartered in suburban Cleveland many of the company’s employees are Browns fans. They want the playoff run to last as long as possible.

It’s good for their favorite team.

It’s good for their corporate team too — Progressive has been able to keep rolling out fresh “At Home with Baker” content during the playoffs.

And to the people who scream and shout about Mayfield shooting commercials during the season fear not. He gave Progressive so much material in the summer that it just looks like he’s doing new stuff.

Clearly being productive on the football field isn’t Baker Mayfield’s only talent.

‘AT HOME’ FAVORITES

Matt Dillon is heavily involved with the production of Progressive Insurance’s “At Home with Baker Mayfield” series of commercials. As business leader for creative development at Progressive he likened the spots to children who you nurture and raise then release into the world. You want them to soar.

“You think you know how people are going to react” he said “but you don’t necessarily know.”

Needless to say all of the “At Home” spots are near and dear to Dillon.

But he does have his favorites.

1. Book Club: “My top one would be book club with Baker and Jedrick (Wills Browns offensive lineman). First of all Baker killed it with the honeymoon line. And then the wild part of having Jedrick in the spot just kind of out of left field. This huge big offensive lineman you really wouldn’t expect that.”

2. Groceries one trip: “We’ve all been there. You know my garage is only 30 feet from my house but yet I don’t want to take a second trip so I’m putting every grocery bag I can on my hand.”

3. Gamer: “That’s a new one. You’ll see that run heavy this weekend for the playoffs. It just is Jedrick and Baker in their element. They’re both gamers. It just came across so natural. We were able to shoot that spot in less than 20 minutes. … It’s a fun spot where they’re just a bunch of kids playing games getting yelled at by their mom or dad or girlfriend or wife. Again it’s just so relatable.”

CLEVELAND ROCKS

Even though Progressive Insurance’s “At Home with Baker Mayfield” is a national advertising campaign the company wanted the series to give a little love to Cleveland.

Progressive is based in Mayfield Heights a suburb of Cleveland that is only half an hour from FirstEnergy Stadium where the Browns play. With the commercials being shot at the stadium and featuring the Browns quarterback the Cleveland connections were already strong.

But Matt Dillon Progressive’s business leader for creative development said there are other tips of the cap to Cleveland.

Easter eggs they’re called in the ad business.

*Jedrick Wills. He’s not widely recognizable — yet — but the rookie offensive lineman was the Browns’ top pick in last year’s draft after a stellar career at Alabama and has become the starter at left tackle this season. He appears in the “Book Club” and “Gamer” commercials and Dillon said Mayfield and Wills met for the first time while shooting last summer. Because of the pandemic they hadn’t had a chance to meet face to face prior to that day. It was also the first time Wills got to walk on the field at FirstEnergy Stadium.

*Heinen’s bags. When Mayfield fills his hands with grocery bags in one of the commercials the blue plastic ones might seem nondescript to many viewers. But to people in Cleveland and the surrounding area they are clearly from Heinen’s Grocery Store. The popular regional chain has locations in Ohio and Illinois.

*Rock n roll. Mayfield grumbles about the neighbors complaining over the volume of his video games in the “Gamer” spot. His wife Emily said they called to complain and Mayfield asks “I have no idea how they can complain! All they do is blast rock and roll all day.” The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is located less than a third of a mile from the stadium just across a parking lot. The hall is literally the stadium’s neighbor.

BAKER’S BIO

Baker Mayfield’s portfolio of companies that he works with and endorses includes some big names.

Progressive Insurance.

Nike.

Nissan.

Hulu.

Bose.

But he is also linked with several companies through venture capital investments. His family has long owned a private equity buyout firm Camwood Capital Group and in 2018 it spun off a venture-capital arm Camwood Ventures. Some of Mayfield’s money has gone toward that investment vehicle.

The companies that Mayfield has invested in through Camwood Ventures include: beam a CBD company; EarBuds a shared-listening app; Goodmylk Co.; Legends an athleisure brand; Pumpjack Dataworks; Season Share a season-ticking-sharing app; Wave a sports-media publisher; and Where I’m From an apparel company.

On January 17 1961 Patrice Lumumba a Congolese revolutionary independence leader and the first democratically elected prime minister of the Congo was overthrown and assassinated by CIA-backed forces.

With Lumumba’s assassination neocolonial forces won an important victory in the mineral-rich country. They were able to install a dictator Mobutu Sese Seko who for decades facilitated (and profited from) the pillaging of the country’s natural resources and labor power by transnational corporations as well as the brutal repression of all opposition. Mobutu was finally ousted but democracy in the Congo is fragile and leaves much to be desired. Corporate imperialist interests continue to reign supreme over the interests and well being of the majorities.

60 years following Lumumba’s assassination the Congo is still grappling with the central questions of how to stand up to imperialist domination how to defend national sovereignty how to build truly democratic institutions that will defend and work for the people how to leverage the country’s resource wealth in favor of the people and not favor secessionist processes and how to address the pressing socio-economic issues of poverty lack of basic services and growing violence.

In order to address these crucial questions as well as what the impact has been on the rest of the region and the world Peoples Dispatch will join Progressive International Friends of the Congo Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research Centre for Research on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Centre Culturel Andrée Blouin International Peoples’ Assembly Socialist Forum of Ghana Pan-African Television and African Risings in an event “Long Live Patrice Lumumba.”

Even young TV viewers have likely heard the song at one time or another. The theme song was linked to the show from its pilot episode but the footage that went along with that theme changed three times throughout the show’s eight seasons. The final intro footage included John Ritter’s son.

Why was Three’s Company so successful?

Three’s Company ran for eight seasons from the late 1970s into the 1980s and was one of the most successful shows of its time. Following Jack Tripper Chrissy Snow and Janet Wood’s lives as they navigated life as platonic roommates the show offered plenty of hijinx. They faced one problem; their landlord Mr. Ropper was far from progressive. Mr. Ropper only allowed the living arrangement under the assumption that Jack was gay. Most of the series followed the three roommates as they tried to avoid detection.

The show was a success for a variety of different reasons but Chris Mann the author of Come and Knock on Our Door: A Hers and Hers and His Guide to Three’s Company argues that the show gave fans something a bit refreshing and light in the face of much rawer television shows. The innuendos were ahead of their time and according to Mann liberating for viewers. Ritter’s penchant for physical comedy didn’t hurt any either. The show sexual innuendos or not at its core was about a family of one’s choosing and the actors’ families showed up on the series in interesting ways too.

Jason Ritter can be seen in the intro of Three’s Company starting in season 6

Three’s Company was a bit of a family affair. Over the years friends and family members of the main cast appeared in the show. For example Ritter’s then-toddler son appeared in the intro for the show starting in season 6. The footage of Jason Ritter was used in the intro until the show went off the air after its eighth season.

According to IMDb fans can see Jason in footage from the petting zoo. In the brief scene Jason walks up to Joyce DeWitt who portrayed Janet. The younger Ritter was barely old enough to walk when he appeared in the show’s intro. Ritter was born in February of 1980 and his footage in the introduction began appearing in 1981. The second child shown in the scene has not been identified.

The show’s intro footage often changed but the music stayed the same

Three’s Company has one of the most recognizable theme songs in television history. Most people born before 2000 can instantly recognize the tune that invites viewers to “come and knock on our door.” The show’s theme was a hit from the first season but the production team didn’t believe in keeping the same footage to go with the song. Three’s Company changed its intro footage multiple times during the show’s eight-season run.

The first intro lasted for three seasons. It starts with footage of the beach and boardwalk before panning out to show Jack riding a bicycle while looking at a girl. When he turns around too much to check her out he falls off the bike. The rest of the intro focuses on the building that Jack Chrissy and Janet call home. Season 4 brought a shakeup with footage of the group at a carnival replacing the footage of Jack falling off his bike. The intro was reshot once more to accommodate Suzanne Somers’ still-controversial firing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMTcvdGhlLXNtYWxsLWJ1dC1wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS1oZW5nLWh1YS1jb21tdW5pdHktaW4tbWlyaS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The small but progressive Heng Hua community in Miri,"“WHENEVER I see bananas I would think of the Japanese Occupation” said Ah Jee.

The octogenarian duo came to Nanyang in the same boat landing in Sibu first before moving to Sungai Teku where they grew up got married and started families.

Their children moved out of Sungai Teku in later years to seek their fortunes in Miri and they prospered.

The two women are the mothers of Heng Hua towkays in Miri and from them thesundaypost learned about their difficult days during the Japanese Occupation and their struggles after the war. A diet predominantly of bananas kept them and many of their relatives alive during those tough times.

This is the gruelling background of a group of Heng Huas who migrated to Miri after the Second World War looking for greener pastures and achieving success through sheer hard work.

Today the Heng Huas or Hing Huas are still a minority Chinese group in Miri. Their life stories form part of the tapestry of the Heng Hua diaspora in Miri.

Early dialectic groups

There are many Chinese dialectic groups in Miri. According to some historians the earliest migrant arrivals in Miri were the Hainanese who came via Singapore to work for the foreign oil company.

They were recruited by agents from Singapore. As oil exploration expanded and demand for services and goods increased the Hakkas Teochews Cantonese Hockiens and Shanghainese came to Miri in successive batches. Some even arrived in their junks while some came via Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu) in the first half of the 20th century.

Based on historical records by 1895 there were a few wooden shops in Miri operated by Chinese traders and a lone Arab trader.

These Chinese traders must have arrived in bigger boats passing through the narrow body of water formed by the sand spit — which later made up the Piasau Peninsula — and the mainland.

They started trading with the Malays or Mirieks as early as the 1850s. Gradually some settled along the banks of the Miri River after setting up their trading shops.

At that time there was probably a little village of about 100 people around this area without a name on the map of Sarawak.

Claudwville or Claudetown was the only known bazaar there back then. With a fort — known as Hose Fort — to provide security more traders began to arrive. Bird’s nests were a much sought after commodity at the time.

Furthermore peace-making efforts led by Charles Hose who became resident of Baram District in 1891 to restore peace among warring ethnic tribes also help to explain why more Chinese traders came to the Baram as fears of headhunting had been allayed.

Arrival of Heng Huas

Extreme poverty in Putien historically known as Xinghua or Heng Hwa a prefecture-level city in eastern Fujian province was the main reason for the Heng Huas to migrate to Nanyang. Besides the Brooke government was keen to import agriculturalists to help develop vast arable land.

The first Heng Hua group had arrived in Kuching earlier and settled in Bintawa and Sungai Apong. Most were fishermen while others became rickshaw pullers and mechanics.

The first batch of ‘invited’ Heng Huas arrived in Sibu in 1912 as the Rajah had granted them land in Sungai Merah and Sungai Teku via an agreement with Rev William Brewster.

The Heng Hua-speaking missionary then serving in the Heng Hua district of China mooted the idea of allotting land in these two areas to Heng Hua migrants seeking a better future in Nanyang.

It was from this small Heng Hua group that many of their younger generations came to Miri to start a new life especially in the bicycle and motorcycle business.

There were also opportunities for stevedores general labourers workshop employees mechanics and drivers.

Oil in Miri

Oil was struck at Miri Well No. 1 (The Grand Old Lady) and Sarawak’s first oil refinery built in 1914 by Shell in Lutong 11km north of Miri saw the arrival of more Chinese migrants.

The setting up of the Tua Pek Kong Temple next to the fish market provided a sure sign to intending migrants that Miri was a peaceful liveable town. And armed with a strong belief in the protection of their deity more Chinese migrants started to arrive.

Based on the Hin Ann Association or community records 22 Heng Hua families were the first to arrive in Miri. They found their niche in the early years of the then small oil-rich town. Four of them worked as trishaw drivers three as barbers five as bicycle shop operators and six as lorry drivers.

Japanese Occupation

It was a chaotic time and transport was down to the bare minimum. Only Japanese ships could dock outside Miri. Businesses were at a standstill.

The hard-working Heng Huas moved to Bakam for shelter and planted rice in Sibuti. They depended on their bicycles to transport their harvests home.

Those who owned tongkangs (light wooden boats used to carry goods along rivers) were required to serve the Japanese with loading and unloading goods.

The Heng Huas have always been known to be strong stevedores a much-needed source of labour at the time.

Family reunions

After the war more Heng Huas migrated to Miri from Kuching and Sibu and also from China to reunite with their families.

The Heng Hua community started to get more organised post-war. Several of the members got together to register their transport association.

The 1960s saw the biggest influx of Heng Huas into Miri due to political problems in Kuching and Sibu. The move also coincided with the development of the timber industry in the Baram area.

Miri was booming and business enterprises were mushrooming. The Heng Huas who ventured into timber business prospered and helped their fellowmen to find jobs in the industry bringing more Heng Huas to Miri.

The transport industry also flourished. Most of the Heng Huas who upped sticks and left for Miri became taxi and bus drivers and bicycle shop-owners.

Besides setting up transport companies the Heng Huas also ventured into oil palm business and prospered. Many started buying land for farming and real estate development.

Heng Ang Association

The Heng Huas formed the Heng Ang Association 40 years ago as an umbrella body to unite and help them work for the benefit of clan members.

The association gives them a clear mission and vision. It gathers the community together during festive seasons and other annual celebrations.

The present chairman is Datuk David Goh.

A community elder noted “Our festive occasions bring many families together. We seldom get to meet at other times.

“Although we visit each other during Chinese New Year we cannot always gather in such big numbers. Sometimes we also don’t have the time because of our commitments. So thanks to the association for organising events where we can meet and update ourselves on the latest news. It’s heart-warming.”

He said the Heng Huas value education. Many among the new generations are well-known doctors in the UK Singapore and KucHeng. There are also Heng Huas in oil and gas tourism and hospitality industries and even politics.

Siaw Ai Kin an accountancy graduate from the UK who started his firm in Miri in the 1980s told thesundaypost “I strongly believe our Heng Hua people have achieved success in Sarawak over the past 100 years because of a top family priority of putting food on the table solidarity in our community and above all our strong faith in God.

“The womenfolk also play a very important role in bringing up and setting the young on the right path.

“We’re known to be straightforward and trustworthy. Trust and ethics come from the teacHengs of our religion. We’re very grateful to our religious leaders like the late Rev Ling Kai Cheng and many others who built churches in Sungai Teku and Sungai Merah.

“Our new generation continues the good work by becoming good and trustworthy professionals pastors and leaders in the Boys’ Brigade and Girls’ Brigade. We have had very good role models. With God at the centre of our lives we feel strong and blessed.”

A group some 2000 members from the community are making a mark in Miri today.

Though considered a minority group they have made significant contributions to the development of Miri because of their resilience enterprise strong values progressive thinking and strong faith in God.",,,

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 largest industrial companies in the US. Before we get started let's first try to understand what an industrial company is. After all all companies operate in either individual or multiple industries right so isn't this just a list of the biggest public companies in the world filtered for the US? Well not really. An industrial company is a company which is engaged in the production of capital goods which in turn are generally used in either manufacturing or construction. Among the businesses that these companies engage in are the production and selling of machinery supplies and equipment which are basically used for the production of other goods and aren't products geared towards the end consumer.

The biggest industrial companies in the US are involved in various sectors which include aerospace lumber production tools defense construction waste management cement and metal fabrication among many others. In the United States the sector has become smaller than what is used to be as the manufacturing sector decreased comparatively in scope while the services sector has increased by leaps and bounds. However the sector is characterized by many small dynamic firms even though we also have some major companies which we will take a look at later. Further wages paid in the sector are quite high compared to other sectors and there is a lot of potential for the growth of the sector too. 8.5% of the total number of employed Americans belong to the manufacturing sector and even though employment in the sector has reduce by a third since the 1980s it has also increased production by at least 2.5 times through automation technology and greater efficiencies. The industry is also responsible for providing employment indirectly to many other people as well. In fact in 2013 17.1 million jobs were directly linked to manufacturing.

Also there is little doubt that the industrial sector has a lot of growth in store with at least 1.1 million jobs already being added since 2008. And while there may be some stagnation in the biggest cities such as Houston Chicago or Los Angeles there is significant growth being observed in smaller cities which are witnessing more and more manufacturers being established. By 2025 there are estimates that more than 2 million more jobs may be established in the industrial sector as well as adding $530 billion with electronics automation and aerospace driving this growth.

Story continues

Of course in 2020 there has been little to cheer about in most sectors and industries and the industrial sector did not escape the wrath of the Covid-19 pandemic which has seen nearly 95 million cases and over 2 million deaths and the worst part is both figures are expected to be severely understated. Since the industrial sector is dependent on many different industries which have all been affected by the lockdowns and the recessions and depressions that followed the lockdowns not just in the US but across the globe. And as cases and deaths continue to soar in the US so does the uncertainty and the exact impact of the pandemic on the industry will only be ascertained later on.

However if anyone can survive the effects of the pandemic it will be the biggest industrial companies in the US which are absolute giants in their industry. The combined revenues of these companies exceed $380 billion while their profits are a massive $26 billion despite just one company making a loss of nearly $5 billion. They also have assets worth more than $676 billion and provide direct employment to close to a million people. The market cap of these companies at March 2020 was more than $480 billion. To rank these companies we have used their assets revenues profits market cap and employees with all the information being taken from the Fortune 500 list for industrial companies in the US.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest companies that have been hacked. The revenue obtained by major corporations plays a huge role in furthering the economy and GDP of a country. Typically such companies will require over ten thousand employees to fill jobs from entry level positions all they way up to corporate- making them a source of income for a considerable majority However the impact is not just limited to who the company pays but rather those who pay the company as well. Large companies such as Walmart Google and Amazon are now household names with their products being used by millions of people all over the world. Whether it be for income employment or products it goes without saying that many individuals depend on these companies for one reason or another.

Hence this makes it even more dangerous and destructive when one of these companies gets hacked. Being “hacked” is a layman’s term for a serious security breach where an individual not associated with an organization gains unauthorized access to a computer system or private network. Once access to this confidential information has been gained hackers can steal destroy or tamper with that information in whatever way they desire. Many attacks are done by individuals with no specific animosity to the company; instead their motivation is to use the attack to gain large amounts of money from the company. These attacks are known as “Ransomware attacks” and typically involve a hacker gaining access to a company’s important data and then locking it so the company no longer has access. They then threaten the company employees to pay a specific very high amount of money for their access to be restored.

Regardless of what the motive behind a security breach attack is the impact is almost always negative. Companies can lose millions of important files and documents about an upcoming product. Then if those files and documents fall into the hands of a competitor. the result is even more disastrous. A significant amount of money can also be lost such as in the case of a ransomware attacks as discussed above. However the biggest consequence with the most lasting impact is a security breach in which details of a company’s users is made public. Users trust these large corporations with a significant amount of information about themselves. This information can be anything from basic details such as name age and gender to more specific such as address phone number and credit card information. If this data were to go into the wrong hands the effects could be disastrous. A study conducted by Poneman Institute showed that out of all those users that reported being a victim of a data breach 65 percent claimed to have lost trust in the company while 27 percent stopped doing business with the company altogether. Once a company has been hacked everything from their revenue and losses to reputation and customer trust is affected.

Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021.

“We have been working hard to finally get the wind production tax credit to expire but its extension was once again slipped into must-pass legislation in December” said Senators Hoeven and Cramer. “We appreciate the Administration recognizing it’s time for this credit to end and urge our colleagues to join our efforts and support this recommendation.”

The rescissions list is a series of measures contained in the appropriations package the Trump Administration believes Congress should reconsider and vote to eliminate. Senators Hoeven and Cramer urged OMB Director Russ Vought to include a sunset of the wind PTC writing a letter to him last week.

In December as the appropriations package was being considered the senators objected to the inclusion of the wind PTC on the Senate floor attempting to remove it from the package.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvbG93LXRlYWNoZXItdHJhaW5pbmctZ3JhZGVzLXJldml2ZS1lZHVjYXRpb24tZGViYXRlLTE2NDE0MjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Low teacher training grades revive education debate,"Kampala. Educationists have warned that unless the teaching profession is made attractive it will continue to absorb poor grades in the training colleges and individuals who join it as a last resort.



This follows emerging results that almost half of the Primary Teachers’ Colleges admitted candidates who appeared in grade three in the recently released 2015 Uganda Certificate of Education results.



Of the 29 PTCs out of 45 Daily Monitor looked at it was established that entrants have their cutoff points as high as aggregate 56 in the best done eight subjects (grade three). A total of 8119 students were admitted to PTCs out of 274863 who passed last year’s UCE examinations.



According to ministry of Education information a student to qualify to join the PTC should have scored at least a pass in English language and Mathematics as well as a pass in two other science subjects such as Biology Agriculture Physics or Chemistry. In total the student needs a minimum of six passes to be admitted.



By Uganda National Examinations Board (Uneb) standards children in grades one two three and four have passed and qualify to proceed in their academic career. But candidates who fall in grade four according to Mr Daniel Odongo Uneb deputy executive secretary “have almost failed and few institutions would be interested in taking them”. The best students lie in grade one; where candidates exhibit high levels of knowledge and skills.



Mr Odongo further pointed out that grade one stops at candidates whose score is between Aggregate 8 to 32 grade two (aggregate 33 to 45) while Grade Three is between aggregate 46 to 58. The last grade pass which is grade four has students who have at least one pass and any six credits or a minimum of six passes.



For example Moyo-erepi PTC will take candidates with Aggregate 56 Mukujju Busubuzi and Kabukule will each admit candidates with at least Aggregate 50 while Kotido Kapchorwa and Kabulasoke had their cutoff points at Aggregate 48. Kabale Bukinda PTC had the best students after it picked girls and boys who scored Aggregate 38.

Ms Goretti Nakabugo Uwezo country director said it was a pity that the best performers in academics opt for other professions except teaching and appealed to government to make teaching competitive to ensure every student aspires to join the profession. She said teachers should be paid well and given incentives like housing and health allowances.

A 2011 National Assessment of Progress in Education (NAPE) report by Uneb which for the first time tested teaching abilities in numeracy and literacy skills among 500 teachers showed that those who had higher qualifications performed better than their counterparts.



Ms Sylvia Acana an official at Uneb recommended that entry requirements to PTCs be revised to a student with a Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE) instead of the current UCE certificate. “Consider raising the minimum entry qualification into Primary Teachers Colleges to UACE” she said.



But Ms Elizabeth Kisakye ministry of Education teacher instructor education and training department disagrees. She argues that their training in PTCs looks at what a student is able to do unlike Uneb which assesses theory. “Uneb research was a desk research. Somebody sat down and imagined. We used to have A-Level students on diploma primary education but this was cancelled in 2004 because of their lack of competences in handling children. Uneb is looking at awarding marks of 80 per cent and they think you can perform. What makes you think that when you get distinctions you have competences?” Ms Kisakye said.



She added: “Uneb is a deadly thing we have now. That is why we have many unemployed youth who have gone through the system but are on the streets because they can’t even make a pancake. Uneb has killed the country because of their subjective numbers. At PTCs we look at projects how can you handle children professionally understand them learn how they thrive methodology on how to teach them and carry out continuous assessment which is accumulated in the course of study.”



Ms Kisakye maintained that the two years spent in college are enough to charnel out a good teacher but appealed for monitoring supervision and retooling after every six months to equip the teachers with updated training skills.

The St. Louis County Planning Commission is holding a videoconferenced public hearing at 7 p.m. Monday Jan. 25 by WebEx videoconference only due to COVID-19.

Members of the public who want to attend can join virtually through the videoconference or by phone. To join by web go to webex.com/downloads.html/ and follow prompts. Enter Meeting ID 132 322 0831 and password pcph0125. To join the meeting by audio call 1-408-418-9388 and enter the same Meeting ID and password as above.

All the projects are in the 6th District of Councilman Ernie Trakas R-Oakville but the Sappington self-storage is in the 5th District of council Chairwoman Lisa Clancy D-Maplewood. The Trakas projects are in the Mehlville School District while the Clancy project is in the boundaries of Lindbergh Schools.

Savoy Investments of St. Charles is proposing a new QuikTrip on the corner of Lindbergh Boulevard and Lemay Ferry Road 3934 Lemay Ferry Road. The 0.39-acre site is the current location of Lindbergh Tire & Auto Center and borders the Ritz Center shopping plaza.

The QuikTrip would require a change from C-8 Planned Commercial zoning to C-3 Shopping District commercial zoning.

The new gas station would be surrounded by two other nearby QuikTrips down either adjoining road: There is a QuikTrip at South Lindbergh in Green Park and there is a QuikTrip at 3475 Lemay Ferry Road just blocks from the new proposed location.

McBride Homes is proposing a 26-acre subdivision of single-family houses at Telegraph and Fine roads proposing a Planned Environment Unit or PEU in the R-2 15000 square foot Residence District.

The subdivision would be located at 7676 Fine Road next to Rogers Elementary School.

The developer did not submit any further information to the county about the proposed subdivision. In 2014 the county rejected a plan from Pulte Homes to build a 30-acre subdivision at the site due to the extreme grading that was necessary and because of a historic house on the site.

Jered Gallagher of Gallagher Bros. Construction is proposing a contractor’s office on 0.38 acres on the southeast side of South County Center Way 500 South County Center Way north of Interstate 255. The location looks like a house but is the current site of PondMarket.com.

Gallagher is requesting a zoning change from C-3 to C-8 for the office which would include construction storage.

In Sappington developers propose using a 4.7-acre tract of land at 11411 Gravois Road and 11431 Gravois Road on the north side of Gravois roughly 780 feet east of Denny Road as a self-storage and retail sales facility with RV and boat storage. It is the current site of an automotive business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuZmllbGRyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8xNi9kZXZlbG9wZXJzX21jY29yZHN2aWxsZV9sZWFkZXJzX211bGxfbWl4ZWR1c2VfZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Developers McCordsville leaders mull mixed-use development,"McCORDSVILLE — Developers plan to ask officials to consider their idea for a community of commercial multi-family and single-family properties on the south side of town.

Harold Gibson of Greenfield-based H. Gibson Land Surveying representing Rogelio Mancillas of Indianapolis and Harold Mize of Greenfield gave an informal presentation on the potential project at a McCordsville Town Council meeting this week.

Those behind the project intend to file a request with the town for the plan which would require approval from the plan commission and town council.

The community called Morningside at McCordsville would go on just over 61 acres on the west side of Mt. Comfort Road south of County Road 600N. It would border the Easton at Stansbury neighborhood’s east side.

“We’re located along the coveted Mt. Comfort Corridor which is not only an important corridor through the town but it’s also a major artery … through Hancock County and even now it’s being considered important to the metropolitan Indianapolis area” Gibson said.

Commercial buildings would go along Mt. Comfort Road. Multi-family buildings and a self-storage facility would be in the middle of the property and the single-family properties would be on the west side near the homes in Easton at Stansbury.

Anticipated permitted commercial uses would include restaurants and offices.

“We’re not looking for big-box buildings; we’re not looking for one retail center” Gibson said. “We would prefer to have three or four multiple out-lots in there so that we can break that up.”

Gibson said the multi-family development would meet current trends by having more one- and two-bedroom units and a limited number of three-bedroom units.

“We’re being told by the market specialists that today’s multi-family projects look different than they did 10 or 15 years ago” he said. “Because of the rising cost because of the rising lease amounts they prefer … more quality inside the unit than space. And we also see that the number of occupants in those units are going down instead of up.”

A minimum unit size of 730 square feet is currently being considered Gibson continued adding rents would be at or above market rate targeting $1100 to $1500 a month. The multi-family development would also have attached garages.

A market study for the project indicates a large need for multi-family housing in the area led by jobs coming online through the dozens of large buildings in western Hancock County that have been planned and built over the last couple years Gibson said.

Larry Longman a McCordsville Town Council member agreed.

“I think we’re deficient in multi-family in McCordsville so I think this fills a void for us” Longman said.

The community would also have a clubhouse pool and walking trails.

In the single-family portion of the community properties would be single- or two-story and sizes would be about 1400 square feet and up Gibson said.

The project’s planners intend to petition the town for a planned unit development which would establish the community’s own development standards.

But building design and architectural standards already in place for the area would be followed Gibson said. He added a planned unit development is not being pursued to avoid them but rather so that a mix of commercial multi-family and single-family uses could be accomplished.

Gibson estimated the community would take five to 10 years to finish.

“We envision the multi-family and the single-family and a portion of the self storage units starting immediately” he said. “The commercial uses are going to lag behind that. As we get more rooftops I think you’re going to see those would fill in.”

Town council members expressed support for the project but also a desire for the self-storage units to avoid poor aesthetics which Gibson said he would be willing to work on with officials.

“The mixed use is a good use of that land a good place for it so if we can get the architectural stuff worked out then I think we’re good to go” said Barry Wood president of the town council and a member of the plan commission.

The library was established in 1628 by the Venetians who owned the island. Currently it hosts 50000 rare editions and 20000 books of the last decades.

The Zakynthos library and the wealth of books had been abandoned for years with the books stored on dusty shelves or locked storage rooms.

As representatives explain to the Athens-Macedonian News AgencyPE-MPE the Public Historical Library of Zakynthos had only two staff members out of the nine allocated without a single librarian or archivist.

However as of July 2020 the administration of the Library was taken over by a new Board of Trustees appointed by Minister of Education Niki Kerameus with the aim to reconstruct and renovate it.

The library returns to book lovers and researchers

With little money from the regular budget the magnificent neoclassical mansion in the central square of the city turned into what was originally built for.

Not without problems though as president of the Ephorate Council Filippos Synetos told AMNA:

“Our biggest problem is the lack of staff and the maintenance of the rare editions of the historical library. We are consulting on how to achieve this with the services of the Ministry of Education.”

“We try to generate interest to private sponsors to support certain functions of the library. We have a group of volunteers from experts and friends. It is the only way we can continue operation until proper hirings are made” Synetos added.

The library’s history

The Public Historical Library was established in 1628 when Venetian governor Thomas Flagginis donated 200 volumes of books to the Community of Zakynthos.

It was officially founded in 1803 by the Ionian State. In 1882 by decision of the Minister of Education Konstantinos Lombardos the library became an independent public service with the historian Panagiotis Chiotis as its first Director.

It was then enriched with books from donations and included an archeological and monetary collection and a gallery.

In 1935 the Public Historical Library and the Municipal Foskoliani Library which has existed since 1888 were merged into the Public Historical Library of Zakynthos.

Immediately after the earthquakes of 1953 the library was rebuilt with donations and bequests. The Library includes about 70000 volumes of books a local archive CD-ROMs video cassettes.

It also hosts a collection of dolls with local costumes a collection of paintings a collection of photos of the pre-earthquake (1953) Zakynthos and old furniture.",,,,,,

Qualcomm's $1.4 billion startup buy takes aim at Apple,"Qualcomm has agreed to purchase Nuvia for approximately $1.4 billion. The news is music to the ears of Qualcomm’s various partners. Samsung Sony OnePlus LG and others with products spanning smartphones to smart car systems have issued supportive statements. This could be one of the most significant tech acquisitions of the year.

But why is Nuvia joining Qualcomm such a big deal? The short version is that the deal sees Qualcomm return to custom CPU designs based on the Arm architecture. This has wide-ranging implications for Qualcomm’s silicon portfolio from high-performance servers to energy-efficient smartphones. However there’s much more to the story than that.

What is Nuvia and what does it do?

Nuvia designs CPUs based on the Arm architecture. Ex-Apple CPU design chief Gerard Williams founded the company in early 2019. It was also co-founded by John Bruno who was a System Architect at Google before spending five years at Apple in a similar capacity. These two have decades of processor design experience between them alone.

It’s particularly noteworthy that Williams was Chief CPU Architect at Apple. He worked on the company’s Cyclone Typhoon Twister Hurricane Monsoon and Vortex CPU architectures for various Apple A series SoCs. Prior to his work at Cupertino Williams spent 12 years as an Arm Fellow working on the Cortex-A8 and Cortex-A15 architectures that powered early smartphones over a decade ago. The two are joined by Manu Gulati another ex-Google and Apple silicon employee and lead architect for Apple’s mobile SoCs.

Nuvia was founded by ex-Apple and Google CPU lead designers.

In December 2019 Apple sought to sue Gerard Williams for breach of contract. It asserted that Williams started work on Nuvia and recruited some of his fellow colleagues while still employed at Apple. Williams however claimed that Apple engaged in anticompetitive practices in an attempt to prevent him from co-founding with John Bruno. Apple wasn’t happy that some of its lead CPU designers took their expertise elsewhere.

Since its inception Nuvia has designed datacenter processors targeting industry-leading performance and energy efficiency. Its data center CPUs use a custom version of the Arm CPU architecture. It is not unlike the licensing agreement Apple uses for the CPUs powering its iPhone iPad and now Arm-based MacBook product ranges.

Why buy Nuvia now?

Gary Sims / Android Authority

In a nutshell Qualcomm is after Nuvia’s custom Arm design expertise. The logical starting place will be in the data center market where Nuvia is already designing chips. Arm-based CPUs are gaining steam in the cloud computing space with Amazon’s Graviton Arm Neoverse looking to shake up the market. This deal will therefore have caught the attention of Intel and AMD. Qualcomm has already made it clear that it plans to leverage Nuvia’s custom design approach to cover swathes of its chipset portfolio too.

5G the convergence of computing and mobile architectures and the expansion of mobile technologies into other industries are significant opportunities for Qualcomm. Cristiano Amon President and CEO-Elect Qualcomm Incorporated

Qualcomm’s press release makes heavy mention of combining Nuvia CPUs alongside its in-house GPU DSP AI and multimedia accelerators for comprehensive platforms for a variety of markets. Smartphones driver assistance systems extended reality networking and next-generation laptops are all on the list. It’s that latter option that could turn out to be the driving factor behind the whole deal. That’s because it would provide Qualcomm with the technology to compete with Intel AMD and now Apple in the consumer PC space.

Qualcomm’s more recent Kryo CPUs now use off-the-shelf Cortex-A CPUs designed by Arm. This approach has worked well for smartphone processors. Cortex-A performance has proven more than good enough leaving Qualcomm to focus on in-house GPU DSP ISP and other components that play a key part in its heterogeneous approach to mobile computing. Arm vs x86: Instruction sets architecture and all key differences explained

However Apple’s custom CPU approach has yielded superior performance for tablet and laptop products. The latest Apple M1 processor is overseeing a transition away from dependence on Intel’s x86 architecture to Arm for its MacBook products. It’s targeting performance well above what we’ve seen from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx rebranded Microsoft SQ2 chips. Qualcomm’s last in-house Arm CPU design on the other hand was its Krait series. It last appeared in 2016. However with ex-Apple engineers at the helm Qualcomm could soon get back into the custom-CPU game and change its approach to the Arm compute performance problem.

It’s exciting to see NUVIA join the Qualcomm team ... moving forward we have an incredible opportunity to empower our customers across the Windows ecosystem. Panos Panay Chief Product Officer Microsoft.

Qualcomm is assisting Microsoft with its own support for Arm-powered PCs providing Snapdragon platforms for the Windows on Arm initiative. Current-gen performance is fine for portable home and business laptops but is underwhelming for more demanding creative applications and enterprise solutions. If the two companies share the vision for a single Arm architecture spanning mobile PC and server products Qualcomm will require even more performance than Arm’s Cortex-A CPUs have offered thus far. The solution appears to be to take a leaf from Apple’s book and go down the custom architecture route.

Hedging against NVIDIA buying Arm

Nvidia

Another thought that may have influenced Qualcomm’s purchase is the looming prospect of NVIDIA purchasing Arm pending regulatory approval.

As noted Qualcomm is dependant on Arm for its CPU needs. NVIDIA’s purchase of Arm casts doubt over future business arrangements. Of course NVIDIA has gone to great efforts to ensure the industry that it will be business as usual for Arm if the acquisition goes ahead but prudent businesses hedge their risks. Remember NVIDIA and Qualcomm are direct competitors in a number of markets including automotive and data center segments.

Returning to at least some level of custom CPU design affords Qualcomm greater control over its destiny.

It’s possible that the direction of Arm’s Cortex-A roadmap may change under NVIDIA’s influence and may not align with Qualcomm’s ambitions or needs. Access to or pricing of Arm’s portfolio could also change with NVIDIA retaining the highest performing part for internal use only. Or the business model may stay the same.

Returning to at least some level of custom CPU design affords Qualcomm greater control over its destiny. Building up an in-house design team would also be an invaluable asset in the unlikely event that Qualcomm wants to transition from Arm to an entirely new instruction set in the future. This is a sensible plan when one of your biggest competitors is set to control an essential business partner. At the same time Arm may not be too happy at potentially losing out on-chip royalties from one of its biggest customers.

What to expect from future Qualcomm/Nuvia CPUs

The acquisition of Nuvia is a major move that could eventually shake up Qualcomm’s entire silicon portfolio. With ex-Apple CPU design leads at the helm it’s clear that Qualcomm will reintroduce custom Arm architecture CPUs back into its roadmap. These designs could span products for low power smartphones right through to cloud computing servers.

In the consumer space the link back to Apple cannot be overstated. Investment in its Apple A-series of CPU is helping the company unify mobile and PC products under a single architecture. Apple is carving out a unified approach to computing for the coming years thanks to its approach to CPUs with performance and battery life benefits in tow. No doubt Qualcomm shares a similar vision for its expansive chipset portfolio.

Ironically Qualcomm’s return to the custom CPU space arrives not long after Samsung ended the development of its custom Mongoose Arm CPU cores. Future Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets may drop Cortex-A CPUs for in-house designs. If Qualcomm can succeed where Samsung ran into difficulties Qualcomm smartphones may pull ahead of their Android rivals and close the single-core CPU gap with Apple. However smartphone performance is reasonably fine as is. It’s laptop and server chips that could use a new approach.

Transitions of this nature will take many years to play out. In the short-term Qualcomm’s roadmap likely won’t change much if at all. Nuvia’s first server products were already not expected to arrive until 2022 at the earliest. Reconfiguring its smartphone and other chipset roadmaps around this acquisition could take even longer. We’ll keep an eye out for announcements in the coming months and years.

Even though they released the quirky LG Wing 5G last year it was not as marketable as they expected. This could probably be because of its expensive price tag which is why T-Mobile has discounted the phone.

Upon its release last year the LG Wing 5G cost $999. Despite having a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 processor LG gave this device a flagship price.

The good news is that T-Mobile has permanently discounted the price of the LG Wing 5G to $696. You can even choose from the Illusion Sky or Aurora Gray color option.

At that price you are getting a device with a rotating screen. There is a 6.8-inch P-OLED display on top and a 3.9-inch G-OLED screen when you swivel the first display up. From within the device runs on a 2.4GHz Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor with 8GB of RAM 256GB onboard storage and a microSD card slot of up to 2000GB memory expansion.

There are three cameras on the back with a 64-megapixel main camera a 13-megapixel ultra-wide sensor and another 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensor. In front there is a motorized 32-megapixel camera that pop-ups up when activated. Other features include a 4000mAh battery NFC an in-screen fingerprint scanner splash and dust resistance and 5G connectivity. It runs Android 10 OS upon release.

There’s no strings involved in this deal. It’s possible that this price reduction is a permanent one since it isn’t technically being offered as a deal.

Will you be buying the LG Wing 5G now that it has a $303 discount?

From recognising faces to voice searches on the web the modern smartphone can do things that were unimaginable a decade ago.

The semiconductor industry’s growth is the biggest contributing factor to this change. When it comes to silicon that power your smartphones Qualcomm is the name in the game spanning over 32% of the Android smartphone market.

Every year Qualcomm updates its Snapdragon processors and keeping up with the trend it released the new Snapdragon 888 processor to power the flagships of 2021 — well at least those coming out in the first half of the year.

So if you plan to buy a flagship and can’t decide between a device powered by Snapdragon 865+ and 888 you have come to the right place. In this article we will be talking all about there is to the new Snapdragon 888 and how it compares against the older Snapdragon 865+

Also read: Snapdragon 865+ 5G vs 865 5G vs 855+ vs 855

Manufacturing process

An SoC’s manufacturing process is a critical factor in influencing the chip’s power consumption and processing power. A smaller manufacturing process enables chipsets to have lower power consumption and high computational power as more transistors can be etched into the same silicon.

The Snapdragon 865+ uses a 7-nanometre manufacturing process whereas the new Snapdragon 888 uses a 5-nanometre process. Hence the 888 can offer better power to performance ratio when compared to the older 865+.

CPU

Although the Snapdragon SoC has multiple components the CPU performs all the operating system’s computational tasks to function properly. Therefore having a beefier CPU helps.

Being the flagship process of Qualcomm the Snapdragon 888 has the most powerful CPU in Qualcomm catalogue. Both the Snapdragon 865+ and the 888 have an octa-core design with a tri-cluster architecture but they use different ARM cores.

The 865+ is powered by a high-performance Cortex-A77 (Kryo 585 CPU) clocked at 3.1GHz three Cortex-A77 gold cores at 2.42 GHz and four Cortex-A55 silver power-efficient cores at 1.80 GHz.

On the other hand the Snapdragon 888 uses Cortex-X1 super core (Kryo 680 Prime CPU) at 2.84 GHz four Cortex-A55 silver cores (Kryo 680 Efficiency CPUs) at 1.80 GHz and three Cortex A78 gold cores (Kryo 680 Performance CPUs) clocked at 2.42 GHz.

Source: Qualcomm

Although both the CPUs use different clock frequencies the Snapdragon 888 uses newer cores which offer better performance and higher power efficiency. In terms of numbers ARM claims that the Cortex A78 offers 20% higher performance when compared to the A77 on a 1-watt budget.

Simultaneously they take 15% lesser space on the silicon when in a quad-core configuration as each core is 5% smaller compared to previous generation processors. The newer cores also consume 50% lesser energy while delivering similar performance than the older A77 cores.

The new Cortex X1 core on the Snapdragon 888 is the first processor developed in the CXC program. It offers 23% faster integer calculations than the A78 performance cores and 30% faster computation than A77 cores. Due to the higher computational power of the X1 it consumes more power compared to the A78 cores.

Qualcomm claims that the Kryo 680 package offers 15% more computational power when compared to Kryo 585 on the Snapdragon 865+.

AI

The most significant improvement on the Snapdragon 888 can be seen in the AI processing area which elevates the overall experience of gaming photography and networking as AI algorithms are used intensively in these areas.

The Snapdragon 888 uses the all-new hexagon 780 AI processor with a fused design which incorporates the scalar tensor and vector units into a single core improving the chip’s AI computational power. In addition to this the AI core is connected to 16 times larger memory unit enabling bigger AI algorithms to be accessed in a single time.

Source: Qualcomm

In terms of numbers the new AI core enables the Snapdragon to carry out 26 trillion operations per second which greatly improves the older chip capable of performing 15 trillion operations per second. The new chip can also perform tensor calculations at double the speed and scaler calculations are also improved by 50%.

Although the chip’s AI computational power is very high it delivers this performance by decreasing power consumption three times than older generation processors.

As we make this decision our hope is that Mr. Thomas does the hard and necessary work in order to partner with us again – truly examining this incident learning growing and ultimately using his platform to promote inclusion.

Gay former professional golfer Maya Reddy told Sky Sports this week that Thomas’ anti-LGBTQ language in her opinion reflects homophobia in professional golf.

In 2016 Reddy qualified at the age of 23 to play on the Symetra Tour – the LPGA’s developmental tour – but decided to walk away from the sport due to incidents of discrimination and a lack of inclusivity in the culture of professional golf.

“I’m kind of in two minds about it” said Reddy about the Thomas incident. “I think the fact that he apologized about it so quickly and with force saying that this wasn’t OK and that he should do better is really important because he acknowledges the harm that using that specific slur causes.

“I think the PGA Tour saying that it wasn’t OK and acknowledging the harm it causes is also very important” she added. “That being said what is frustrating for me and many who watched this play out was that it was so easy for him to jump to that word.”

Thomas the world No 3 was heard using the derogatory word towards himself after missing a par putt on the fourth hole at Kapalua last weekend.

The 27-year-old later apologised for the remark. He told the Golf Channel: 'There's just no excuse. I'm an adult I'm a grown man. There's absolutely no reason for me to say anything like that. It's terrible. I'm extremely embarrassed.'

But Ralph Lauren this weekend announced it had severed ties with the golfer.

In a statement the American clothing brand said: 'We are disheartened by Mr Thomas's recent language which is entirely inconsistent with our values.

'While we acknowledge that he has apologised and recognises the severity of his words he is a paid ambassador of our brand and his actions conflict with the inclusive culture that we strive to uphold.

'In reflecting on the responsibility we have to all of our stakeholders we have decided to discontinue our sponsorship of Mr Thomas at this time.'

The 27-year-old apologised after making the remark following a missed putt on the fourth hole

Thomas is expected to be fined for by the PGA Tour for the incident.

The PGA Tour said in a statement: 'As he expressed after his round we agree that Justin's comment was unacceptable.'

In March last year PGA Tour player Scott Piercy was dropped by his sponsors after sharing a homophobic meme on Instagram about former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg who was a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination."

In 2020 the global pandemic caused WrestleMania at Raymond James Stadium to be canceled — the event instead emanated from the WWE performance center in Orlando. The pandemic again has caused WWE to rethink the event and so it is officially set to take place in Tampa at Raymond James Stadium. It will be a two-night event on Saturday April 10 and Sunday April 11.

“The opportunity for Tampa Bay to host WrestleMania in April is in true WWE fashion the perfect comeback story and marks a clear indication that our beautiful city is poised to bounce back stronger than ever. We can’t wait to once again showcase all that team Tampa Bay has to offer” added Tampa Mayor Jane Castor.

In coordination with local partners and government officials WWE will announce ticket availability and safety protocols for WrestleMania 37 in the coming weeks. Information on additional WrestleMania Week events is forthcoming.

WrestleMania has a proven track record of generating a massive economic impact on this cities its takes place in. NOLA.com’s Gene Guillot reports that WrestleMania 34 generated $175 million in economic impact for New Orleans. A release from the WWE states WrestleMania 34 which took place in Orlando generated $181 million in economic impact.

Currently WWE is filming Raw and SmackDown “ThunderDome” inside Tropicana Stadium in St. Petersburg Florida. Its third brand NXT is filmed at Full Sail University in Winter Park.

WWE announced that the event will take place on April 10 and 11.

Tampa was scheduled to host WrestleMania in 2020 but it was moved to a closed site in Orlando due to the coronavirus pandemic.

WWE did say how many fans would be allowed at the event but said that they would work in partnership with government officials and will announce ticket availability and safety protocols in the coming weeks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS90di9uZXdzL3dyZXN0bGVtYW5pYS0zNy10YW1wYS1iYXktd3dlLWRhbGxhcy1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy0xMjM0ODg2OTA0L9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS90di9uZXdzL3dyZXN0bGVtYW5pYS0zNy10YW1wYS1iYXktd3dlLWRhbGxhcy1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy0xMjM0ODg2OTA0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE Moves WrestleMania 37 to Tampa Bay Sets Dallas and LA for 38 39,"WWE is officially moving WrestleMania 37 to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay Florida. The date has also shifted from March 28 to a two-night event on April 10 and 11.

In addition the sports entertainment company also announced that WrestleMania 38 will take place in Arlington/Dallas at the AT&T Stadium on April 3 2022 and WrestleMania 39 will take place in Inglewood/Los Angeles at the SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park on April 2 2023.

“The opportunity for Tampa Bay to host WrestleMania in April is in true WWE fashion the perfect comeback story and marks a clear indication that our beautiful city is poised to bounce back stronger than ever” said Tampa mayor Jane Castor. “We can’t wait to once again showcase all that team Tampa Bay has to offer.”

WWE’s flagship pay-per-view was originally supposed to take place at the newly constructed SoFi Stadium this year but those plans have shifted amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Most major sports venues across the country are still not allowing in-person attendance at live events but Florida has been allowing fans to attend in a limited capacity. Ticket information and safety protocols will be announced for WrestleMania 37 in the coming weeks as will information about other WrestleMania week events.

Popular on Variety

“The City of Inglewood looks forward to the opportunity to host WrestleMania in 2023 and celebrates the deferral of this year’s event to Tampa Bay so they can have their rightful WrestleMania moment” said Inglewood mayor James T. Butts Jr. “Our time will come.”

WWE employed a similar strategy with WrestleMania in 2020 which was filmed with no audience at the company’s performance center in Orlando Florida. It was filmed in late March and aired across two nights on April 4 and 5. The event received mostly positive reviews from fans who praised matches such as Drew McIntyre’s win over Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship as well as the Boneyard Match between The Undertaker and AJ Styles.

“We are elated for WrestleMania’s return to Arlington’s AT&T Stadium and look forward to building upon the success from 2016 when more than 101000 fans were in attendance for WrestleMania 32” said Arlington mayor Jeff Williams.

The move also comes around two months after WWE announced that it was moving its ThunderDome residency from the Amway Center in Orlando to Tropicana Field in Tampa Bay. The company began using the ThunderDome set in August which features large LED screens that virtually bring fans into the arena via live video.

“On behalf of everyone at WWE we thank Governor DeSantis Mayor Castor Mayor Williams and Mayor Butts for their graciousness and flexibility in what was a collaborative effort to bring the next three WrestleManias to these iconic stadiums in their world-class cities” said WWE chairman and CEO Vince McMahon.

Per WWE tapings at ThunderDome are closed sets with only essential personnel in attendance. Health and safety protocols including COVID-19 testing social distancing and wearing masks are also in effect. Still the risk of COVID remains very real with WWE announcing last week that McIntyre had tested positive for the virus and was placed in quarantine.

“Florida is excited to welcome back WrestleMania to Tampa in April at Raymond James Stadium” said Florida governor Ron DeSantis. “Florida has continued to work with professional sports and entertainment to safely operate while generating revenue and protecting jobs. WrestleMania will bring tens of millions of dollars to the Tampa area and we look forward to hosting more sporting and entertainment events in Florida this year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wMS8xNy93cmVzdGxlbWFuaWEtcmV0dXJucy10by10YW1wYS10aGlzLWFwcmlsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WrestleMania returns to Tampa this April,"TAMPA — A year after the pandemic took away Tampa’s opportunity to put on professional wrestling’s biggest annual spectacle the city again will have its chance to host WrestleMania at Raymond James Stadium.

The WWE announced the next three host cities Saturday night and Tampa will host this year’s event which will be spread out over two days April 10 and 11 and include limited seating capacity.

Initially this year’s event was slated for SoFi Stadium in Inglewood Calif. outside Los Angeles. Inglewood now will now host in 2023 and AT&T Stadium in Arlington Texas will host next year.

WWE chairman and CEO Vince McMahon thanked Gov. Ron DeSantis and Tampa mayor Jane Castor for their “graciousness and flexibility.”

“WrestleMania will bring tens of millions of dollars to the Tampa area and we look forward to hosting more sporting and entertainment events in Florida this year” DeSantis said in a statement provided by WWE.

How many fans will be allowed to attend has yet to be determined — the Bucs played home games this season at 25 percent capacity in a stadium that seats almost 66000 and Florida is one of the few states allowing stadiums to have fans. The event certainly won’t have the packed-house atmosphere that past WrestleManias have been known for. But by expanding to a two-day event it will not only allow WWE to expand the card but give more fans the opportunity to attend while following health and safety social distancing protocols.

“No two WrestleManias have ever been alike” said John Saboor WWE’s executive vice president of special events. “And we look forward to creating another unprecedented experience for fans attending at Raymond James Stadium. Our job is clear for the presentation of WrestleMania and that is to create now a two-day journey of sights and sounds meant to stimulate every one of our fans’ senses and to offer a memorable experience that will be designed in every respect to put smiles on people’s faces of those attending.

“I have no doubt given our history and the heritage of this event that it will be special unique and unprecedented in its own way.”

Saboor said WWE will announce more details on ticket availability and safety protocols in the coming weeks.

“Safety is our absolute top priority” he said. “We will do everything in terms of coordinating the entire plan and presentation with our local partners and government officials.”

Tampa finally landed last year’s WrestleMania after a decade-long pursuit of the event which has taken place in Orlando twice and Miami once. When the coronavirus pandemic hit in March shuttering all professional sports and mass gatherings WrestleMania was relocated from Raymond James Stadium to the WWE Performance Center in Orlando where it was produced on a closed set.

The conversation about a return to Tampa never stopped. While closed-set shows currently are being produced across the bay at Tropicana Field WWE wanted to return to a live stadium atmosphere for WrestleMania. And over the past several months another opportunity to host the event locally materialized.

“After Team Tampa Bay’s more than 10-year pursuit of WrestleMania ended with us not being able to safely host this past April we naturally could not be more excited to have WrestleMania 37 land right back at Raymond James Stadium a year later” Tampa Bay Sports Commission executive director Rob Higgins said.

While the area won’t benefit from the economic boon of a fully-attended event Higgins said this still might be the time when Tampa Bay needs WrestleMania most to help a tourism and hotel and hospitality industry that has been devastated by the pandemic.

“We’re thrilled with not only the timing of this but also the fact that this will be the first-ever two-night WrestleMania to take place at a stadium which is the exact type of history our community loves to make” Higgins said.

The return marks the latest chapter in a growing partnership between the area and WWE. Last month the WWE relocated its ThunderDome set to Tropicana Field and the company is producing its Monday Night Raw Friday Night Smackdown and pay-per-view events there through the end of March. The WWE’s first developmental center was based in Tampa and several prominent wrestlers — past and present — call Tampa Bay home.

Though the WWE’s ThunderDome setup was designed to integrate fans virtually through large LED boards outside the ring — allowing them to reserve spots on the set and see themselves on broadcasts as they log on through video — the company has been preparing for fans safely returning to the stands.

“We have been studying collaborating and planning for the return to live events and part of that exploration has been sharing best practices with contemporaries within the world of sports and entertainment” Saboor said. “So while we have been focused on our presentation of ThunderDome and the associated fan experience for that we have been all the while working in earnest to develop our strategies practices and presentation of live events when that became available.”

The announcement comes at a time when the local sports and entertainment landscape grapples with how to begin bringing people into arenas and stadiums as coronavirus positivity rates rise and vaccines begin to roll out.

The Toronto Raptors played four home games at Amalie Arena with just 3800 fans in the stands last month but just before the Lightning’s season began this past Wednesday the arena pivoted and decided it would not allow fans in the building through at least Feb. 5. Amalie still has shows scheduled for February including Mike Epps’ Super Comedy Jam and concerts by Christian hip-hop artist TobyMac.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said last month that he planned to bring “as many fans as we can safely” to Raymond James for Super Bowl 55 on Feb. 7. The Rays announced Friday that they plan on opening the upcoming season with about 7000 fans each game at Tropicana Field.

Just two weeks before the official announcement of the GeForce RTX 3060 NVIDIA changed the specifications of the new SKU from 3840 CUDA cores to 3584. The manufacturer’s shift to the lower-end GA106 variant has clearly caused confusion among AIBs.

Official render of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Source: NVIDIA

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 debuted at CES 2021 as the first GA106 based graphics card. NVIDIA officially did not disclose the GPU model of the new graphics cards nor when exactly would it card be available. However a few add-in-board partners have provided more information on the new SKU.

NVIDIA did reveal the clock speeds on their website but for some reason the values were rounded up and thus not very accurate. However thanks to AIBs we have learned that the card default clock is 1320/1777 MHz (base and boost). Some AIBs were not yet ready to list the clock speeds due to the fact that their cards are factory overclocked and still under evaluation however they seem certain that the memory speed will remain at 15 Gbps.

Only one board partner (Galax) confirmed that the RTX 3060 features GA106-300 GPU while Gainward confirmed that the GPU is 8nm. This would prove that all three Ampere GPU are based on 8nm architecture and manufactured by Samsung.

PNY and PALIT appear to agree on RTX 3060’s memory capacity power consumption and CUDA core count however manufacturers disagree on clock speeds and the maximum bandwidth of the new SKU. We have not been able to confirm why PNY lists specifications that are so much different from other AIBs but we believe that the specifications are based on a different SKU that wasn’t released yet (RTX 3060 6GB) thus the listed specs are in fact a mistake:

The official specification sheet for the Chinese Galax models confirms that cards are based on a GA106-300 graphics processor:

A confusing official RTX 3060 teaser

The official RTX 3060 teaser video showcases a new RTX 30 graphics card design likely to be a render of a reference RTX 3060. It is unclear if NVIDIA has any plans to sell this reference design as Founders Edition but since official slides did not feature any pictures of the card itself it would appear that RTX 3060 is an AIB-only launch.

The teaser features GA102 GPU instead of GA106. The number of memory modules does not appear to correspond to RTX 3060 either. We’re not sure which card is being shown here as a part of the RTX 3060 teaser video but this certainly is not the card in question.

NVIDIA officially declared that GeForce RTX 3060 will be available in late February. The card will cost at least 329 USD.

All of these graphics cards are expected to launch in the coming months however new information regarding the postponed nature of the RTX 3080 Ti graphics card has also surfaced in the rumor mill.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti RTX 3050 Ti RTX 3060 & RTX 3050 Graphics Cards Imminent Submitted To The EEC By PALIT

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is the only graphics card in the submitted list that has been confirmed since before the GeForce RTX 30 series launch. This graphics card was abandoned repurposed and then delayed as per the rumor mill. The latest rumors seemed to suggest that NVIDIA will launch the card sometime in January but that's not the case anymore as at CES the company only confirmed the GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB model.

The card was later suggested to launch in February though that also doesn't seem to be the case anymore so while the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti may launch we don't have an exact date for this card. It could be due to a shortage of DRAM and NVIDIA focusing on getting a better supply of the existing 30 series cards than offering more premium SKUs.

With that said Videocardz has spotted several unreleased NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series cards that include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GeForce RTX 3050 Ti GeForce RTX 3060 6 GB & GeForce RTX 3050 over at EEC. The submission was made by PALIT for its upcoming lineup. The full list of those cards can be seen in the table below:

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications

NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 Ti FE (Founders Edition) graphics card is expected to feature the PG133-SKU15 PCB design and the GA102-250-KD-A1 graphics core. The GA102-250 GPU has also changed since the last time we saw them and is now exactly the same as the GeForce RTX 3090 at 10496 FP32 CUDA cores.

As for memory the card will feature 20 GB of GDDR6X memory. Unlike the 19.5 Gbps speeds of the RTX 3090 the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is said to retain the same memory speeds as the RTX 3080 at 19 Gbps. Since we are getting a 20 GB bus interface NVIDIA will be using a 320-bit bus interface which equals a total bandwidth of 760 GB/s. TGP for the card is set to be the same as the RTX 3080 at 320 Watts. That's definitely needed to feed the extra cores so NVIDIA might have to optimize the clocks a bit here.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications

The GeForce RTX 3060 is suggested to feature the GA106-300 GPU which is expected to feature 3584 FP32 cores in a total of 28 SM units. The graphics card will make use of the PG190 SKU by board partners which are both GA104 and GA106 pin-compatible. Both 12 GB and 6 GB variants are likely to feature the same DRAM specs clocking in at 15 Gbps for a combined bandwidth of 360.0 GB/s.

Considering that the 12 GB variant starts at $329 US it is expected that the 6 GB variant should be priced at $279 US.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications

Just like the GeForce RTX 3060 the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti will also be featuring the GA106 GPU but a cut-down configuration. The card is expected to be based on the PG190 SKU (stock) board which will be different than the 60 variant that the RTX 3060 will utilize. The GPU is expected to come with 3072 FP32 cores in a total of 24 SM units.

The GeForce RTX 3050 Ti is surprisingly going to feature a 6 GB GDDR6 memory interface too which is a big upgrade over its 4 GB predecessors. This suggests a 192-bit bus interface and we can also expect similar bandwidth numbers from the card if it ends up utilizing 15 Gbps memory dies. The card is expected to feature a price point of around $200 US.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications

The GeForce RTX 3050 is suggested to feature the GA107-300 GPU which seems to be the most entry-level Ampere GPU at this point in desktop graphics cards. Only time will tell if we will see something even lower-end like the GA108 GPU but the RTX 3050 leaves little room for that. The card is expected to feature 2304 FP32 cores in a total of 18 SM units and is suggested to feature a 90W TGP.

RTX 3050 GA107-300 2304FP32 90W TGP — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) November 9 2020

This would mean that the GeForce RTX 3050 will require an external 6-pin connector to boot unlike its predecessor the GeForce GTX 1650 which conformed to a 75W TGP and didn't require any plug to boot in several custom variants. The GeForce RTX 3050 should feature a 128-bit bus interface & up to 4 GB of GDDR6 memory. We are likely to see speeds of 14 Gbps on the card but that remains to be confirmed.

The GT 1010 is a Pascal card featuring the 14 nm GP108 GPU similar to the GT 1030. The GT 1010 has only 256 CUDA cores enabled supports 2 GB GDDR5 VRAM and has a TDP of 30 W. Availability information is not known yet.

Update (01/18): TechPowerUp has updated their specifications to indicate the TDP as 30 W which is about the same as the GT 1030. The same has been updated in the headline abstract and the article. Readers may kindly note.

NVIDIA is apparently not fully done and dusted with the Pascal architecture yet. The company seems to have clandestinely launched a GT 1010 GPU a couple of days ago and no one even knew about it. Search results for the GT 1010 GPU throw up few relevant results at this point. However the GT 1010 is indicated on NVIDIA's official driver download page. So what really is the GT 1010 and when can you get it?

The first report that a GT 1010 card actually exists came from user Dapz's YouTube video who happened to have spotted the card's name on the NVIDIA driver download page. Dapz contacted NVIDIA customer support via live chat to which he received a response in the affirmative that such a card indeed exists. However the rep said that the card was just announced not released. The rep neither confirmed any specifications nor could give a release date.

TechPowerUp however has managed to put up the specifications of the NVIDIA GeForce GT 1010. According to the site the GT 1010 is based on a GP108 GPU fabbed on the 14 nm process. The GP108 has a die area of 74 mm2 and is comprised of 1800 million transistors. Essentially the GT 1010 is the same GPU as the GT 1030 with some CUDA cores disabled. While the the GT 1030 offered 384 CUDA cores the GT 1010 will offer only 256 (i.e. two streaming multiprocessors).

The GT 1010 supports 2 GB of GDDR5 VRAM on a 64-bit memory interface. The base clock of the GPU is 1228 MHz and can boost up to 1468 MHz. Additionally the card features 16 texture mapping units (TMUs) 16 raster operation pipelines (ROPs) and a TDP of 30 W which means it can run on just PCIe power without the need for power connectors.

It is not yet clear whether the GT 1010 will be available for OEM systems alone or for the general public as well. While such a cut-down Pascal GPU may seem odd in 2021 NVIDIA clearly thinks otherwise and sees a potential market for it. Who knows we may even seen a GT 1020 as well to complete the series.

Manufacturers have unveiled the first Mini-ITX graphics cards based on NVIDIA Ampere architecture.

MSI announced its AERO ITX series (OC and non-OC) variants at CES 2021. The company has not yet listed the graphics card on their website but the first picture of the card was attached to the press release. We have not seen the AERO series this much in the current generation as those cards were usually based on a blower-type cooler design with an exception for the ITX sub-series. The card appears to use standard display outputs and a single fan. MSI has not yet confirmed the clock speeds nor if the card has more than one 8 pin power connector although it would have been surprising if it did.

Meanwhile PALIT revealed its StormX model alongside the RTX 3060 Dual. Both cards feature NVIDIA reference clock speeds as well as default TGP and power connector configuration (1x 8pin). PALIT has not yet confirmed its plans for the OC variants.

At CES 2021 Gainward launched its Pegasus RTX 3060 video card. This model is a 2-slot design with a single fan that wider than the PCB itself. The card features a standard display output of three DisplayPort 1.4 and one HDMI 2.1. The RTX 3060 Pegasus is not overclocked and ships with a 1320 MHz base clock and 1777 Mhz boost clock.

Max Holloway returned to the win column on Saturday when he beat fellow contender Calvin Kattar in the UFC on ABC 1 main event.

Holloway (22-6 MMA 18-6 UFC) earned the first headlining victory on network television during the UFC’s Disney era when he shut down Kattar (22-5 MMA 6-3 UFC) by incredibly one-sided unanimous decision in Abu Dhabi. With the win the former champ snapped a two-fight losing skid both of which came in title fights to Alexander Volkanovski.

Radio 1 DJ Matt Edmondson has spoken about the rare mood disorder he is living with which makes him need to keep constantly busy.

Edmondson 35 revealed that he suffers from cyclothymia which could lead to bipolar disorder if it goes untreated.

He told The Sun on Sunday: “I need to be doing something at all times but I have a condition called cyclothymia.

“I have these extreme episodes where I feel really productive and positive and then periods where I feel low and unmotivated – thankfully this is more rarely.”

Sharing that he had been given his diagnosis in his late 20s Edmondson added that he felt in control of his condition.

He said: “I’m on top of it now but it was a little confusing when I was younger.”

Edmondson presents his BBC Radio 1 show on weekend afternoons with Mollie King.

Cyclothymia is a rare disorder affecting less than one per cent of the population and its symptoms involve periods of low mood followed by highs where the person feels full of energy and as if they don’t need much sleep.

If it goes untreated with medicine or talking therapy cyclothymia can develop into bipolar disorder which may have much greater effects on mood and behaviour.

Edmondson’s radio co-host King has recently got engaged to partner Stuart Broad.

She shared a photo of the couple kissing and a diamond ring on her finger at New Year writing: “A thousand times yes! I still can’t believe it the most magical start to the new year! I can’t wait to spend all my years with you @stuartbroad.”

Certificates of deposit or CDs which require you to lock up savings for a predetermined amount of time offer slightly better interest rates but not much better than the paltry 0.07% annual percentage yield (APY) that is the current national average for savings accounts according to Bankrate.

But one crypto startup BlockFi is letting users earn at a rate that’s nearly 123-times higher on dollar-backed cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins. More specifically the company is currently paying an 8.6% interest rate on savings accounts holding the Gemini dollar the stablecoin introduced by the Winklevoss twins’ regulated and audited New York trust company Gemini. Interest is paid out monthly by BlockFi in either a dollar equivalent or a favored cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ether.

BlockFi's savings accounts are not FDIC insured but they do offer interest rates currently 123-times higher than the national average as measured by Bankrate.

“You can start earning your interest and gaining passive exposure into a new asset class” BlockFi co-founder Flori Marquez explained in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live. “The people who use our products span from everyday consumers who are buying bitcoin for the first time to even some small corporates.”

It’s important to note that the higher interest rates BlockFi offers on its accounts carry a special set of risks. Unlike traditional savings accounts BlockFi’s are not FDIC-insured which means they don’t carry the traditional $250000 of protection per depositor. Even BlockFi’s disclaimer warns customers that their savings account “is not a risk-free product and loss of principal is possible.”

Despite those risks hundreds of thousands of customers have turned to the Peter Thiel- and Coinbase Ventures-backed platform to either trade cryptocurrencies or earn interest through BlockFi’s savings accounts according to Marquez.

“As opposed to most fintech platforms our average account size is actually $50000” she said. “So people are depositing... a meaningful amount of assets.”

Comparing a $25000 deposit at Marcus by Goldman Sachs which offers 0.5% interest rates on its savings accounts and BlockFi's 8.6% rate shows the difference in expected earnings over a year.

Similar to banks BlockFi acts as a financial intermediary that’s able to benefit in the gap between borrowing and lending. As Yahoo Finance’s Brian Cheung recently explained in this week’s Yahoo U installment banks profit by enjoying a larger return on money loaned out than the interest they pay on deposits. As BlockFi CEO Zac Prince explained to Yahoo Finance in the past the company’s similar role as an intermediary comes with another perk unique to the crypto space: a lack of other established players.

“We're the largest lender of cryptocurrencies to institutional borrowers who today are primarily market makers and proprietary trading firms that are active in this asset class and have been for a while but they can't finance that activity with their traditional prime broker relationships because banks aren't active in the space yet” he said. “That's the reason why the yields are still high because this is a new asset class. It's nascent it's growing quickly and it doesn't have access to the traditional sources of debt capital. And as a result when we're lending we're able to charge higher rates and then we pay that back to the folks who are our clients on the front end.”

Story continues

As the industry matures Prince expects that BlockFi will likely have to lower interest rates on its savings accounts at some point but rates have held at 8.6% for more than a year.

Prince also stressed that interest earned on BlockFi’s accounts are also taxed much like interest revenue from traditional bank accounts and that BlockFi provides users with an annual 1099 form to help with tax filings.

“We’re heavily regulated at the federal level and at the state level as a financial services company in the U.S.” he said.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 largest gay pride parades in the world. Gay pride parades are also called pride marches pride events and pride celebrations. It normally includes a series of occasions and frequently includes a parade including marchers and vivid floats from the LGBTQ people group and its supporters. These parades are outside occasions organized for celebrating lesbian gay bisexual transsexual non-binary and queer (LGBTQ) self-acknowledgment accomplishments lawful rights and pride.

These events additionally now and again fill in as demonstrations for lawful rights for example same-sex marriage. Most pride occasions happen yearly and many occur around June to celebrate the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City which started in the early hours of June 28 1969 after police attacked the Stonewall Inn bar in New York City's Greenwich Village area. The Stonewall Inn was a gay bar that was famous with many different individuals in the gay community including transvestites effeminate youngsters transgender individuals and destitute youth. Even though the LGBTQ people group had stood up against police discrimination in a few other small events before in the late1960s in urban communities like San Francisco and L.A. the Stonewall incident cut through in an unprecedented way. This event is considered crucial for the development of present-day LGBTQ social movements.

Before the Stonewall riots LGBTQ people had commonly not disclosed their sexual orientation or personality but this occasion aroused the gay community and started more noteworthy political activism on gay rights development. In 1970 on the first anniversary of the event hundreds of demonstrators walked along Greenwich Village's Christopher Street which runs past the Stonewall in what many consider the principal Gay Pride walk. Besides those different celebrations were additionally held that year. Early Gay Pride events also called Freedom Day or Gay Liberation Day were attended in small numbers and protests were held against them. In 1978 what is maybe the most-perceived image of Gay Pride made its presentation at the event organized in San Francisco where the first rainbow banner was seen. The banner with its eight tones represented important themes. Hot pink represented sexuality red represented life healing represented by orange the Sun by yellow nature by green art by blue harmony by indigo and violet represents spirit. The next year a six-shade banner which is used widely and embraced around the world was presented. This flag used red orange yellow green blue and purple/violet.

The purpose of these parades is to make local communities honor the historical backdrop of the movement. The early parades usually centered around members' individual freedom the variety of the LGBTQ people and is pleased to be out of the closet which is a term used to representing accepting one's true sexual orientation. In the mid-1970s the energy was amassed in a little region of Christopher Street in New York City's West Village. At that point it was the uncommon neighborhood where gay individuals could proceed to meet out in the open and Pride parades worked at a neighborhood area level size in comparison to the 5 million individuals who went to last July's World Pride event in New York City the biggest LGBTQ festivity ever.

By the 1980s political and social activism had gotten integral to pride occasions and a large number of the marchers held placards and signs that raised the social issues of the day. As acknowledgment of LGBTQ people group expanded among the straight people political leaders who supported the LGBTQ people group and gay-friendly businesses and enterprises started participating in these parades. The number of people including gay and straight people increased and pride occasions were held in numerous parts of the globe. Such events faced opposition in countries like Jerusalem Moscow and Warsaw. In other countries like Amsterdam Chicago London Mexico City New York Paris San Francisco and São Paulo pride occasions generally draw in a few hundred thousand to more than a million. These gay friendly businesses include Dell (NYSE:DELL) Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)  Nike (NYSE:NKE) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Toyota (NYSE:TM) among many others.

Despite the aforementioned advances for the LGBTQ community a lot more still needs to be done. Despite many countries normalizing these communities many people still face discrimination every day in their lives which should not be happening in 2021. But even this pales in comparison to the treatment meted out to these people in most Asian and Africa countries where LGBTQ people are derided and treated as second class citizens while in many Muslim countries gay acts are actually punishable by death. While few countries have actually carried out death sentences just the fact that these laws exist are something which needs to be worked on. The reason why Muslim countries are against these communities is because Islam has declared same sex acts as a major sin and hence believers of the religion aren't quite as tolerant of the beliefs and acts of other citizens.

EuroPride is an event organized to celebrate LGBTQ pride hosted by an alternate European city every year. For as long as a month various artistic basic human rights events are organized all through the host city. EuroPride includes a pride march that is attended by hundreds of thousands of people.

Apparently in California this occurs because it “is not the protocol doctors use around here.”

A friend reported that she and her husband are recovering from Covid. “My husband has COPD so he ended up hospitalized but is home now and doing better” she said. However and this is where it gets bad “The doctors around here won’t treat anyone until they can’t breath then they say ‘go to the hospital.'”

What doctor would refuse to treat a patient until the illness reaches a life-threatening emergency?

She continued: “We got meds online through the America’s Frontline Doctors or I don’t think we would have done as well as we did.” She said they asked her husband’s two doctors for antibiotics and steroids. “Both said ‘no.’ It’s no wonder the hospitals are filling up” she said.

Is this by design? Did California’s public health officials really issue a stand-down restriction on life-saving medications so COVID-19 would get worse in the state?

As we reported in “California’s Public Health Doctors Are Violating Hippocratic Oath ‘First Do No Harm’” Public health doctors while not in a medical practice must still adhere to “Primum non nocere” the Latin phrase that means “first do no harm.” But they aren’t.

My friend said she has heard the same thing from others friends: “Doctors won’t ‘treat’ their patients. It’s like they’ve all been told to stand down or something” she said. “When I asked one doc about getting Hydroxychloroquine he acted like I insulted him. Craziest thing I’ve ever seen.”

She said her daughter who lives in Texas was exposed to friends who contracted COVID and her Texas doctors immediately prescribed she and her husband a Z-Pak (Zithromax) and steroids. Both apparently recovered quickly.

When my friend and her husband asked her husband’s cardiologist – who knows her husband has COPD – why he would not prescribe the steroids and Z-pak and/or Hydroxychloroquine he said “that is not the protocol doctors use around here.”

What exactly does that mean? What protocols? And who issued them – the Governor? Dr. Mark Ghaly Gov. Newsom’s appointed Health and Human Services Secretary? County public health officials?

Is this malpractice?

America’s Frontline Doctors report the restriction on HCQ is severe in western democracies. “But during Covid-19 State Pharmacy Boards and State Governors have passed regulations that have restricted only hydroxychloroquine and only when being used for Covid-19! This dramatic departure from the way medicine has always been practiced is very alarming to people who are concerned about the doctor-patient relationship.”

“It has never happened that the government has restricted physicians from prescribing an FDA approved medication” they explain (emphasis theirs).

As California Globe has reported American’s Front Line Doctors which exist to counter the massive disinformation campaign regarding the pandemic warn that U.S. Governors’ attempt to ban hydroxychloroquine is the real problem.

Dr. Simone Gold who is also a lawyer exposed a “massive disinformation campaign” about coronavirus and treatment and was rewarded with de-platforming by Facebook Google and Youtube.

The doctors have a map on their website showing which states allow for hydroxychloroquine and which make it difficult or impossible – note that California is “fairly difficult:”",,,,,,,,,

In this age of globalization international expansion is increasingly factored into the forward planning and growth estimates of ambitious companies. Yet many corporate leaders and business owners remain wary of investing in Latin America and the Caribbean because of obstacles historically associated with doing business in the region.

But to what extent should those risks be considered barriers to investment today?

Latin America is one of the fastest developing regions in the world making it an enticing destination for foreign businesses. Yet challenges still remain for anyone interested in doing business in Latin America.

There are a few commonly mentioned obstacles to investment in the region namely corruption bureaucracy language barriers and funding availability. Considering the current economic environment and the role of local governments let’s weigh each one of those potential risks with investing in Latin America:

Corruption

Latin America and the Caribbean is a region that has long been associated with having a corruption problem. In some countries in the region it has permeated both the state and private sectors. The infamous and widely spread Odebrecht scandal has demonstrated that corruption has not gone away.

Yet corruption does not necessarily affect the region in a universal fashion as countries like Chile Costa Rica and Uruguay have reported lower perceived levels of corruption than several European nations according to Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2019 (CPI).

Meanwhile according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) some of the countries in the region that have been historically most victimized by corruption such as Honduras have shown some progress in addressing the societal problem.

Moreover leaders in the region have made abolishing corruption a priority over recent years.

In 2007 the Organization for Economic Operations and Development (OECD) created the Latin America and Caribbean Anti-Corruption Initiative to encourage sharing the best-practices for tackling the issue. A drive to combat corruption that swept through the region that began in 2018 only just stalled recently in the face of the major economic and social disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

Bureaucratic hurdles

Doing business in Latin America has a reputation for involving a significant amount of administrative red tape. While efforts to deal with corruption have necessarily generated numerous additional checks and balances — especially with regards to banking and funding sources — in many other ways governments across the region have worked hard to streamline their processes and make life easier for businesses and investors.

Once again it is difficult to discuss bureaucracy in Latin America in terms of it being a homogeneous aspect of commercial life around the region because it can vary greatly between countries. Company formation in Brazil for example can take significantly longer than starting a business in Chile.

That is in part because Chile stands out along with the likes of Panama and Colombia as being particularly favorable towards business investment and free trade. As the Financial Times highlighted earlier this year Colombia’s recent moves to cut red tape have paid dividends for entrepreneurs.

In countries where the governments tend to be less market-orientated or in countries which simply have not yet implemented comprehensive reform of such processes a higher burden of administration can be expected.

Yet even in those countries there are options available to companies and investors who want to enter the market quicker than the normal administrative process might allow. For example companies have the option of contracting a professional employer organization (known as a PEO) as a stop gap while going through the incorporation process.

Contracting staff through a PEO in Brazil for example could have your business moving in a couple of weeks rather than the months it could take to set up a company.

Language barrier

While English is spoken as a second language among business communities in Latin America and the Caribbean it cannot always be assumed to be spoken to a high level. As such a language barrier can pose a problem for investors from English-speaking countries in Spanish- Portuguese- French- and Dutch-speaking countries in the region.

The issue is not purely limited to one of business-related communication because having some grasp of the local language can give you some critical cultural insight that can also be extremely valuable in terms of building relations and doing business in the region.

The good news for those who do not speak a second language proficiently but who are keen to enter one the region’s markets is that in several countries the level of English is high. Argentina Chile Costa Rica and Paraguay all appear among the top 40 countries in the Education First English Proficiency Index 2020.

Meanwhile throughout the region there is a growing awareness of the importance of spoken English not only in relation to professional and business dealings but also thanks to the growth of outsourcing.

In 2015 Uruguay rolled out an ambitious government program to provide remote English lessons to students in schools that did not have a qualified English teacher on staff. This has allowed the rate of students graduating from primary school with at least lower-intermediate English proficiency to soar from 56 percent in 2014 to 80 percent in 2019.

Access to funding

Because of the risks associated with investing in Latin America funding has not always been easy to come by in the past. Even today venture capital is often less readily available than in other emerging market regions. However that trend is definitely changing and in 2019 Brazil was the fourth-largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) globally.

The emergence of several countries in the region as hubs of technological innovation as well as greater investor confidence in the region’s political stability have undoubtedly contributed to a growing interest among investors in the region and a subsequent increase in available funding.

Latin America has seen a significant increase in venture capital investments with the $4.6 billion (USD) invested in startups across the region in 2019 representing a 133 percent increase on the amount invested the previous year and a ten-fold increase on that invested just four years earlier.

International business heavyweights are getting in on the action too with Japanese corporate titan Softbank announcing in 2019 the launch of a $5 billion fund to support tech innovation in Latin America.

Nevertheless funding does remain an issue with the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor’s 2019 report highlighting how the reliance on a handful of venture capitalists in Chile is restricting the country from achieving its full potential. Yet for potential investors able to offer or secure the sort of funding that is lacking such circumstances can represent major opportunities.

Moreover entrepreneurs have found innovative ways to deal with scarce funding such as by working with venture builders.

Venture builders are business entities that focus on creating and developing ideas into fully operating business initiatives. Instead of investing money in startups and entrepreneurs they use in-house resources and dollars to launch new companies under their parent company portfolio generally developing multiple companies and counting on shared resources in the process.

Although working with a venture builder – also known as a company builder or venture studio – often means operating with less freedom the financial stability and availability of resources on offer to entrepreneurs for doing so makes them an attractive option.

The takeaway

It would be unreasonable to cast Latin America and the Caribbean as a land of milk and honey for investors because the region continues to confront challenges especially in the face of the ongoing global pandemic.

However many of the risks traditionally associated with the region are no longer the barriers to investment they once were. While corruption bureaucracy the language barrier and funding availability do still affect commercial life in the region considerable progress is being made.

For anyone who is looking at investing in Latin America there are now more options available in terms of finding a local partner who can help you navigate and mitigate those risks.

Overall as a region with a lot of growing yet to do and in which many governments are making moves in the right direction to overcome the challenges they face and better prepare their populations for a more globalized world the future is bright and commercial opportunities are abundant.

puede ser consecuencia del consumo de alcohol. Un dispositivo de avance mandibular puede despejar tus vías respiratorias al dormir.

Descubre como dejar de roncar en 7 sencillos pasos.





La apnea o síndrome de hipoapneas del sueño (SAHS) afecta a entre 5 y 7 millones de españoles según la Sociedad Española del Sueño. Quienes lo padecen dejan de respirar entre ronquidos desde 10 segundos hasta más de un minuto. Te explicamos como puedes combatirlo para que puedas volver a dormir con moralidad.

1.NO ABUSES DE LA BEBIDA

Unas cervezas antes de acostarte pueden hacer que te entre sueño más fácilmente pero el alcohol es también un depresor del sistema nervioso central. El resultado: puede reducir tu ritmo respiratorio e incrementar la relajación lo que deriva en más ronquidos y apnea del sueño. Deja de beber alcohol de dos a tres horas antes de acostarte. Recuerda que padecer apnea puede incrementar el riesgo de cardiopatías.

2. PRACTICA CARDIO

Montar en bicicleta correr caminar a paso ligero… Investigadores canadienses y

australianos han realizado un estudio en el que afirman que el aumento de la actividad física está asociado con un menor riesgo de apnea obstructiva del sueño de hasta un 10%. El ejercicio es un factor protector y tiene muchos otros efectos positivos en la salud general además de ponerte fuerte.

3. USA UNA MÁSCARA PARA DORMIR

Acostarse con una máscara ResMed AirSense 10 CPAP (dispositivo de presión aérea positiva continua) todas las noches ayuda a dormir mejor. Una vez que encuentras el ajuste adecuado descansas más y a la mañana siguiente te sientes despejado. Hay que dar tiempo hasta que te acostumbres y por supuesto elegir la mascarilla correcta que debe quedar ajustada mientras estás en la posición en la que vas a dormir y con el flujo de aire a la presión prescrita (resmed.com).

4. PIERDE PESO

Perder unos pocos kilos podría ayudar a aliviar la constricción de la garganta. En algunos casos la apnea del sueño puede resolverse si vuelves a tener un peso saludable pero puede reaparecer si recuperas el sobrepeso. Otra cosa que te tienes que quitar es el tabaco. Fumar hace que la nariz y la garganta se inflamen un hecho que provoca que se reduzca el espacio por el que pasa el aire. Y aunque parezca contradictorio no tomes pastillas para dormir pues relajan los músculos en la parte posterior de la garganta lo que interfiere en la respiración… La última cosa pero no menos importante es que te metas en la cama lo más cómodo posible: si te molestan el reloj o el pijama quítatelos.

5. SI NADA DE LO ANTERIOR FUNCIONA:

En primer lugar intenta dormir de lado. Si eso tampoco funciona y eres reacio a usar una máscara quizá quieras probar un dispositivo de avance mandibular que abra tus vías respiratorias para lo que desplaza tu mandíbula y lengua hacia delante.

Esto funciona con muchas personas con apnea del sueño leve o moderada. Si es grave puede que seas candidato a la cirugía que modifica el tejido en la parte trasera de la garganta. Habla con tu médico sobre nuevos procedimientos como implantes que estimulan los músculos de las vías respiratorias para evitar que se relajen.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Lee's birthday: Bust returned briefly to Fort Myers site,"A bust of Robert E. Lee returned briefly Sunday to the stone pillar it has been absent from in downtown Fort Myers for half a year as a small band of people gathered to celebrate the Confederate leader's birthday.

The bust often the focus of controversy was removed by the Sons of Confederate Veterans in June 2020 and was said to be in a safe place being refurbished. An exact location was never reported.

The bronze likeness of the general was back atop the gray stone obelisk for about an hour Sunday around noon as people in period garb and others laid a wreath at its base.

The rose and daisy flecked wreath contained a note proclaiming ""Happy Birthday General Robert E. Lee from the Maj. William Footman Camp 1950."" Lee was born Jan. 19 1807.

One of those attending the event Ross Barnett confirmed the event was organized by the Footman Camp.

""Thirty-five Lee county citizens and camp members attended a birthday remembrance and silent guard duty to honor the 214th anniversary of the birth of Robert E. Lee"" Barnett responded via email. ""Attendees were requested to wear period clothing and military uniforms if possible. The ceremony lasted one hour. It was a fine event.""

At the time of the bust's removal in 2020 it was unclear if placing the likeness away was prompted by national protests over the death of George Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota.

Descendant of Robert E. Lee: Bust removal in Fort Myers would be historical awakening

A number of Confederate-themed statues and related monuments were removed toppled or defaced during and after the protests.

When the bust was removed in 2020 the great-great-great-great nephew of Gen. Robert E. Lee Robert W. Lee IV opined that things like the bronze bust of his ancestor should be removed.

""I refuse to be a Lee who goes down in history accepting the status quo"" he said in a exclusive interview with The News-Press.

Lee IV a pastor at a church in Boone North Carolina used to vacation in the Cape Coral area as a child and knows the area well.

It was dedicated in 1966 archives show.

It’s how the NFL’s first Muslim head coach a Lebanese-American was raised in Dearborn Mich.

Eric Holm saw it first-hand.

Saleh’s college coach at Division II Northern Michigan will never forget what one Wildcats trip to the Detroit area revealed about his tight end’s roots.

“We once went downstate to play Wayne State in Detroit. Robert was from there had played at Fordson (High School). And his parents insisted we come to their house after the game for dinner. Not just the coaches. The whole team” Holm 61 told the Daily News in a phone call on Thursday.

“I remember being reluctant at first because that is a big undertaking” he said. “We’re in Division II so you have about 50 players you’re traveling with about 65 or 70 people after a game. But his parents and his dad in particular insisted. I remember how happy they were and gracious they were. They set up tables and his parents the family everybody they were so happy to have us.

“So he comes by his servant leadership and his graciousness naturally” Holm said.

Robert Saleh is the Jets’ pick to be the franchise’s next head coach and becomes the NFL’s first Muslim coach in the process.

The home of Sam and Fatin Saleh also was the setting of the seminal moment that jarred Robert Saleh 41 into reconsidering his path and choosing coaching as a career.

Saleh was 22 years old and had just been hired at Comerica Bank in Detroit when the 9/11 terrorist attacks shook New York the world and more personally his own family.

Saleh’s older brother David was a financial advisor for Morgan Stanley working on the 61st floor of 2 World Trade Center. David was still in the stairwell of his building when the second plane hit.

David got out but spending that day bracing for news watching his parents in tears Robert Saleh was jarred into reevaluating what he really wanted out of life.

“For a good portion of the day I’d say eight or nine hours we didn’t know whether or not (David) was alive” Robert Saleh told KPIX5 San Francisco in 2018. “And once he was home and safe and you get a chance to reflect you just look at what if he didn’t come back?”

“Here’s my brother who’s only a couple years older than I am and was he actually pursuing the job he loves and that he wants to do? Or was he just being satisfied with chasing money?” Saleh continued. “And I kinda looked at myself and whether or not I was actually doing what I wanted to do. And I wasn’t.”

Months later after the Patriots defeated the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI Robert Saleh called his brother David crying saying he couldn’t take it anymore per Sports Illustrated. He had to go back to football.

The irony and history of this Jets head coaching hire is unmistakably powerful: that the 9/11 terrorist attacks which engendered so much Islamophobia and vitriol toward Arab-Americans would also be the impetus for the eventual hiring of the NFL’s first Muslim head coach.

Saleh the third of four children is the third Arab-American head coach in NFL history joining Abe Gibron (Chicago Bears) and Rich Kotite (Jets Philadelphia Eagles) according to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. But Saleh is the first Muslim-American head coach in the NFL.

Saleh’s father Sam was born in Michigan but spent some of his childhood in Lebanon. His mother Fatin was born abroad and emigrated as a teenager.

Saleh’s parents are now retired from running a furniture store in Dearborn but Saleh says his father regretted not getting into coaching as a career when his playing days were done also.

Sam had played linebacker at Eastern Michigan and had his first and only NFL training camp with the Chicago Bears cut short by a knee injury.

So Robert reached out to his Fordson coach Jeff Stergalas for help. Stergalas warned Saleh who was already doing well financially in the business world that “you’re gonna get paid peanuts.”

“But he said ‘I don’t care. I want to do it'” Stergalas 62 now the athletic director at Riverview High School (Mich.) recalled on Saturday. “I know Robert well enough I knew there was no way he was going to be talked out of the decision he was making right then.”

Stergalas understands the public perception of Saleh is that he’s a “very emotional intense and excited” coach because of how fiery he is on the sidelines during games. And Saleh is that person too. But outside the lines the substance of his passion shows through.

“If you met him on a golf course or at a restaurant he’s 100% different than he is on a football field” Stergalas said. “He’s very reserved and calculated in everything he does. But once he has something in his mind that he wants he’s going 100% after that.”

So Stergalas put Saleh in touch with Mike Vollmar whom Stergalas had coached as a freshman quarterback at Riverview.

Vollmar was Michigan State’s assistant athletic director for football operations. He also tried to explain to Saleh the risk he’d be taking leaving finance for a graduate assistant job.

“Robert came up and met with me at Michigan State and actually had a pretty darn good job in banking” Vollmar said Saturday. “I probably tried to talk him out of it more than anything else and I joke now I sure as hell won’t talk him out of this one (with the Jets).”

“I was like ‘Hey do you know what you’re getting into here?'” he remembered. “You’re going to be making copies making coffee. If coach asks you to wash his clothes or pick up his dry cleaning… But he was very passionate about wanting to coach.”

“I could tell by the look in his eyes he was going to coach” Vollmar 55 now a senior associate AD for football administration at Kansas recalled. “Period. That’s what he wanted to do it was that simple and that’s obviously what he’s done and been very successful. And it doesn’t surprise me at all.”

So from Bobby Williams’ Spartans staff in 2002 Saleh embarked on a winding road of coaching stops that also included grad assistant stints at Central Michigan and Georgia.

At Central Michigan in 2004 on the staff of Brian Kelly now Notre Dame’s head coach Saleh worked with a fellow grad assistant named Matt LaFleur. And the two became inseparable.

Robert Saleh

Saleh would bring LaFleur along with him to the Houston Texans’ coaching staff in 2008. LaFleur became the best man at Saleh’s wedding. And now they are both NFL head coaches. LaFleur 41 has been the Green Bay Packers head coach since 2019.

Saleh then worked his way up through the NFL coaching ranks on the staffs of Pete Carroll’s Seattle Seahawks (2011-13) as a defensive quality control coach and Gus Bradley’s Jacksonville Jaguars (2014-16) as linebackers coach.

He even won a Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium which he now will call home with the Jets. He was on the Seahawks’ staff for their 43-8 blowout win over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII on Feb. 2 2014.

But still he had to take a leap of faith to secure the San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator job that would elevate his profile and status to being a head coaching candidate years later.

Niners coach Kyle Shanahan was turned down by Bradley and Vic Fangio to be his defensive coordinator in 2017. Saleh agreed to leave Jacksonville to become Shanahan’s linebackers coach provided that Shanahan promised to interview him for the coordinator vacancy.

“He kept his word gave me the interview and the rest is history” Saleh told KPIX5.

Fast forward to 2019 and Holm a 17-year Kansas City Chiefs season ticket holder was watching his former D-II tight end coaching against the Chiefs for the Niners in the Super Bowl.

Holm says Saleh exudes more confidence and is more “demonstrative” now than when he was younger but he remembers Saleh was “extremely coachable” and “clearly a leader” who “understood the game.”

“He was a good player. He was a classic tight end an every down player” said Holm who retired in 2019 as the athletic director of Truman High School in Independence Mo. “Good enough and tough enough to block. Really good hands understood the game. Wasn’t fleet of foot but of course if he was a bit more fleet of foot he might not have been at Northern Michigan (laughs).”

Still Holm believes that what “has helped shape” Saleh is that “he has a really strong tight-knit family” with the gregarious “Big Sam” as Stergalas called Saleh’s dad at the head.

Robert Saleh and his wife Sanaa now have six children of their own — four sons and two daughters — and a seventh child on the way. And now they’re all on their way to the Jets welcoming all of New York and New Jersey to the Saleh table.

“I feel really full and happy for him to have this opportunity” Holm said. “It’s an American story.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZmNiYXllcm4uY29tL2VuL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wMS9sZXdhbmRvd3NraS1zaG9vdHMtYmF5ZXJuLXRvLXRvcC1zcG90LWF0LXRoZS1oYWxmd2F5LXN0YWdlLXdpdGgtYW5vdGhlci1yZWNvcmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lewandowski shoots Bayern to a belated top of the table spot at the halfway stage with yet another record,"Praise from Flick and teammates

""It's an unbelievable [scoring] rate"" marvelled team-mate Leon Goretzka. And coach Hansi Flick also joined in with words of praise: ""What he did last year but also this season is already outstanding"" said the Bayern coach putting it simply but succinctly: ""Robert is there up front to score goals. That's why we're really happy to have him.""

The Polish forward's diligence to duty led to him surpassing Gerd Müller's previous goalscoring best of 20 goals in the first half of the 1968/69 season. For decades the nation's former ""Bomber"" stood for unassailable goalscoring records in the German top flight but Lewandowski has long been chasing Müller's milestones. The 1974 World Cup winner's 40 goals at the end of the 1971/72 season has yet to be matched even today but the reigning World Footballer of the Year now has more than half of Müller's goal tally in that famous year - after less than half of the season.",,,,,,

Suppress your yawn for Ms Barra’s announcement is the latest sign of a quiet but powerful revolution. “The convergence of software and hardware seen in the carpeted parts of enterprises is now seen on factory floors in every industry we serve” says Blake Moret chief executive of Rockwell Automation a giant of the industry. His firm runs a full-scale manufacturing facility at its Milwaukee headquarters to prove that automation enables it to make competitive products despite America’s high labour costs.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 largest industrial companies in the US. Before we get started let's first try to understand what an industrial company is. After all all companies operate in either individual or multiple industries right so isn't this just a list of the biggest public companies in the world filtered for the US? Well not really. An industrial company is a company which is engaged in the production of capital goods which in turn are generally used in either manufacturing or construction. Among the businesses that these companies engage in are the production and selling of machinery supplies and equipment which are basically used for the production of other goods and aren't products geared towards the end consumer.

The biggest industrial companies in the US are involved in various sectors which include aerospace lumber production tools defense construction waste management cement and metal fabrication among many others. In the United States the sector has become smaller than what is used to be as the manufacturing sector decreased comparatively in scope while the services sector has increased by leaps and bounds. However the sector is characterized by many small dynamic firms even though we also have some major companies which we will take a look at later. Further wages paid in the sector are quite high compared to other sectors and there is a lot of potential for the growth of the sector too. 8.5% of the total number of employed Americans belong to the manufacturing sector and even though employment in the sector has reduce by a third since the 1980s it has also increased production by at least 2.5 times through automation technology and greater efficiencies. The industry is also responsible for providing employment indirectly to many other people as well. In fact in 2013 17.1 million jobs were directly linked to manufacturing.

Also there is little doubt that the industrial sector has a lot of growth in store with at least 1.1 million jobs already being added since 2008. And while there may be some stagnation in the biggest cities such as Houston Chicago or Los Angeles there is significant growth being observed in smaller cities which are witnessing more and more manufacturers being established. By 2025 there are estimates that more than 2 million more jobs may be established in the industrial sector as well as adding $530 billion with electronics automation and aerospace driving this growth.

Story continues

Of course in 2020 there has been little to cheer about in most sectors and industries and the industrial sector did not escape the wrath of the Covid-19 pandemic which has seen nearly 95 million cases and over 2 million deaths and the worst part is both figures are expected to be severely understated. Since the industrial sector is dependent on many different industries which have all been affected by the lockdowns and the recessions and depressions that followed the lockdowns not just in the US but across the globe. And as cases and deaths continue to soar in the US so does the uncertainty and the exact impact of the pandemic on the industry will only be ascertained later on.

However if anyone can survive the effects of the pandemic it will be the biggest industrial companies in the US which are absolute giants in their industry. The combined revenues of these companies exceed $380 billion while their profits are a massive $26 billion despite just one company making a loss of nearly $5 billion. They also have assets worth more than $676 billion and provide direct employment to close to a million people. The market cap of these companies at March 2020 was more than $480 billion. To rank these companies we have used their assets revenues profits market cap and employees with all the information being taken from the Fortune 500 list for industrial companies in the US. So without further ado let's take a look at some of the giants in this industry starting with number 15:

Ross Dress for Less. Burlington. Shoe Carnival. PetSmart.

According to information provided by WestRidge all five national retailers are under lease and coming to WestRidge Commons in 2022.

The stores will bring a total of 100000 square feet of retail space to shoppers joining a 175000 square-foot Menards which is set to open next month and a 70000 square-foot Bass Pro Shops currently under construction in WestRidge Commons located directly off I-79 Exit 153.

Site work for the new stores is complete and vertical construction is expected to begin by early next month.

“The team is very excited to finally be able to make this public especially given the last year that we’ve had because of COVID-19” WestRidge Leasing Manager Emily Sipes said.

Ryan Lynch representing WestRidge explained that the ongoing pandemic has delayed the process substantially explaining “Everything right now is in the context of COVID-19.”

“We’ve been talking to these tenants for a long time long before COVID” he said noting his appreciation that these chains as well as Menards and Bass Pro Shops have stayed committed to WestRidge.

“There was a lot of stress and uncertainty but ultimately if it is just a six or 12-month delay we’ll feel pretty fortunate. So it is exciting to announce them and will be even more rewarding to announce them after the challenges caused by COVID.”

Much of that commitment Sipes explained comes down to the strength of the Morgantown/I-79 corridor market. Morgantown is considered a super-regional shopping destination with a 75-mile draw to 2.8 million square feet of existing retail space between Exits 152 and 155.

“These retailers have new store plans and target markets. I used to work for Dick’s Sporting Goods on their corporate real estate team so I’ve seen it from that side” Sipes said. “They have a list and Morgantown was on these retailers’ lists because they see the success across the street at University Town Centre and they want a piece of that pie.”

Sipes went on to say there are likely additional announcements forthcoming for WestRidge Commons as well as WestRidge’s corporate campus which opened more than 130000 square feet of office space in the first half of 2020 and includes tenants like Leidos Steptoe & Johnson MVB Bank and Larson Design Group.

Monongalia County Commission President Sean Sikora said the WestRidge announcement is welcome news. He said he’s also excited to see what a reconfigured Exit 155 will do for the development of that area and beyond.

The Division of Highways is in the process of conducting environmental and engineering studies to that end. Last August the DOH estimated the cost of turning Exit 155 into a divergent diamond interchange with a flyover heading west at $66 million.

Commissioner Tom Bloom said the continued expansion of WestRidge a reconfigured Exit 155 the recently announced agreement for Longview Power’s solar and gas expansion and planned growth at the Morgantown Industrial Park — including the possibility of a new Harmony Grove exit — are all part of a years-long push by the commission to diversify and connect the county.

“This has been an economic plan the commission has been working on with different individuals across the community and it’s coming to fruition. I think a lot of people talk but here you’re seeing results. And this has all gone on despite a pandemic. When many other areas are just trying to maintain we’re growing” Bloom said. “I’m just very excited. I’m thrilled in fact.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3RndWFtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NvbWluZy1zb29uLXJlb3BlbmluZy1vZi10aGVhdGVycy9hcnRpY2xlXzZjZmJkNDNlLTU3MTMtMTFlYi04N2ZiLTk3YTdiMzA3YThlMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coming soon: Reopening of theaters | Guam News | postguam.com,"While Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero allowed movie theaters to reopen as early as Jan. 16 with 50% occupancy it won't be until February when big-screen fans can watch the latest movies at Tango Theatres at Micronesia Mall.

""We are gearing up to reopen. Early February is a moving target"" Tango Theatres General Manager Kit Lanuza told The Guam Daily Post.

It would be the first time in nearly a year that Tango Theaters will open its doors to the public because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We're surprised"" he said upon reading the governor's executive order on Friday allowing movie theaters to reopen within 24 hours.

While taken by surprise it was nevertheless welcome news for Tango Theatres to open its doors once again and for all its furloughed employees to be back to work he said.

It would take about two weeks to order new feature films and for them to get here he said.

Nationwide with more major movie theater chains reopening big studios like Universal Disney Sony and Warner Bros. have started releasing movies.

The movie theater spaces at Micronesia Mall would also need to be spruced up on top of the regular maintenance since March last year Lanuza said.

Regal Guam Megaplex at the Guam Premier Outlets in Tamuning is awaiting word from its corporate office according to Regal Guam Megaplex Manager J.N. Milan.

COVID-19 protocols

There's optimism that after being cooped up at home for months people would want to get out of their houses while still practicing social distancing wearing masks and washing their hands Lanuza said.

At Tango Theatres COVID-19 health and safety protocols will be in place to provide the moviegoing public a safe experience when they visit the theaters including temperature checks mask wearing social distancing shields at concession stands and frequent sanitization.

With occupancy limited at 50% each auditorium will have ample space for social distancing whether it be for 50 or 150 moviegoers Lanuza said.

Dine-in restaurants are now allowed to have customers up to 50% capacity. Amusement parks bingo halls game rooms and similar facilities have been allowed to reopen. Most COVID-19 restrictions have been eased.

Closed for good

Because of the prolonged closure due to the coronavirus pandemic and lack of new films Tango Theatres made the painful decision last year to permanently close its theaters at the Agana Shopping Center.

Despite the closure of this second theater Tango Theatres didn't let go of employees and placed them on furlough instead.

Everyone will be at the Micronesia Mall theaters Lanuza said.

Lanuza also said Agana Shopping Center's recent announcement of Ross Dress For Less opening a branch at the Hagåtña mall will not have any effect on Tango Theatres' prior decision to close their theaters there.

The news of Ross opening at Agana Shopping Center stirred excitement from shoppers. Ross is anticipated to spur activity at the mall which saw several of its tenants close for good or temporarily or move somewhere else over the last year.",,,,,,,,,

We’re here once again to make sure you’re all updated on some of the most impactful cruise headlines of the week. We’ll go into the further cancellations by some of the major cruise lines there’s been a fair amount of sad news about cruise ships being scrapped Royal Caribbean to homeport from Barbados for the first and more.

Costa Toscana Floats Out at Shipyard

The float-out ceremony was held for the Costa Toscana cruise ship on Friday morning at the Meyer Turku shipyard in Finland. This is a major milestone for the vessel and Costa Cruises as the ship touched the water for the first time. The basin was flooded under cold temperatures and the ship will remain floated until she is delivered in December 2021.

The shipyard released new photos of the Costa Toscana float out. Even during the icy conditions. You can take a look at the photos over on cruisehive.com.

Once completed Costa Toscana will be an impressive 185000 gross tons with a maximum guest capacity of 6730. She will be in the top 10 largest cruise ships in the world.

The ship will debut in Brazil kicking off with an inaugural New Year’s Eve cruise that will depart from Santos on December 26 2021. The ship will sail a week-long itinerary from Santos through April 10 2022. Costa Toscana will eventually depart back to Italy from Santos on April 17 2022.

Royal Caribbean Extends Suspension

As the new round of cancellations continues to be announced from major cruise lines around the world Royal Caribbean has now joined the list. The cruise has extended its suspension in the U.S. through April 30 2021 with the first sailings from the country now planned for May.

The cruise line was previously planning on returning in March but now that won’t be the case. Spectrum of the Seas sailings are canceled through February 28. And the new update excludes Quantum of the Seas as that ship has already resumed operations with cruises to nowhere out of Singapore.

Celebrity Cruises which is part of Royal Caribbean Group has also canceled sailings until the start of May 2021. This includes the cancellation of the Celebrity Apex May 1st transatlantic voyage. Celebrity Edge and Celebrity Constellation European and transatlantic voyages through October 2021 are also now canceled.

MSC Cruises Extends Suspension

MSC Cruises has become another major cruise line that’s decided to extend its suspension on U.S. operations. The cruise line is now aiming to resume cruises from April 2021.

The further setback impacts four MSC cruise ships that were set to sail out of two popular Florida homeports. MSC Seaside and MSC Divina sailings out of Port Canaveral are now canceled along with cruises for MSC Meraviglia and MSC Armonia out of PortMiami.

There will now be many guests disappointed by the further cancellations but it doesn’t come as a surprise during these difficult times. Those who have already paid their booking in full will be offered a 125 percent future cruise credit (FCC). Guests can choose to transfer their booking to any future sailing through April 30 2022.

Guests who no longer want to take a cruise with MSC in the future can also request a full refund.

Grandeur of the Seas to Sail from Barbados

Royal Caribbean has announced that Grandeur of the Seas will make a comeback and be deployed out of Barbados. The island nation will become a new homeport for the cruise line and itineraries will include three new ports of call.

The Royal Caribbean cruise ship will begin sailing from Bridgetown Barbados in December 2021 for the winter season. The ship will make calls at Tobago Trinidad and St. Vincent for the first time which is part of an enticing Caribbean offering.

Just like many other older cruise ships she became a victim of the global pandemic and the suspension of operations. The 55-year-old vessel was previously part of the Cruise & Maritime Voyages (CMV) fleet but unfortunately the British cruise line went into administration in Summer 2020 and the fleet went up for auction.

Marco Polo was auctioned off by CW Kellock & Co. There was hope she would sail for Offshore Solutions Unlimited but has since been removed from their web site and beached. Four other former CMV vessels were also put up for auction and have now been sold to another line or for scrap.

Grand Celebration Beached for Scrapping

A fan favorite for short breaks to the Bahamas from Florida the vessel had been sailing for Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line since 2014. As early as September 2020 the cruise line announced that the vessel would return to sailing on November 4 2020. While that date never happened due to the CDC’s no-sail-order it is staggering to think how fast these things can change.

This makes the Grand Celebration the next in a long line of cruise ships that have been beached this year and the previous. Named Celebration she sailed for Carnival Cruise Line between 1987 and 2008. She was one of three Holiday class ships the first set of new-builds by Carnival Cruise Line.

We also reported yesterday that her sister ship and the first in the class formerly named Holiday could also be heading for the scrapyard. You can read that article on the site and all the latest developments on which cruise ships are being sold and scrapped.

Costa Victoria Heading for Scrapyard

Costa Cruises and Carnival Corporation had sold the vessel in the summer of 2020. There were some doubts about whether the ship would be scrapped where it would be scrapped and if she would become a hotel ship. Scrapping is the preferred choice it now seems.

Costa Victoria was handed over to Costa Cruises in July 1996. The ship was built to carry 2394 passengers is 252 meters long and weighs 75166 gross tons. It is currently not known when she will be beached.

During WICO Interim President and CEO Anthony Ottlety’s report at Friday’s board meeting he mentioned that MSC Cruises Carnival Cruise Line Holland America Line Norwegian Cruise Lines and Disney Cruise Line have a proposed sailing date at the start of April. Royal Caribbean and Princess Cruisers have a proposed sailing date in May. WICO had previously sought to resume cruise travel this month but the pandemic has not let up and with the United Kingdom strain of the coronavirus set to become the dominate version of the pathogen in the U.S. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a timeline for cruise ship travel resumption remains elusive.

Enrique Rodriguez a member of the WICO Board pointed to the over 4000 people who died in the U.S. as a result of Covid-19 on Jan. 12 alone and asked for a realistic timeline on when cruise travel would resume at the WICO port.

“That is very difficult. In my conversations with some of the lines they are anxious to come back they are making the provisions on the ships to come back"" responded Mr. Ottley. At this particular moment I think the April calls may be a challenge but I am hoping and wishing for May and anticipate we should have something for May.”

Mr. Rodriguez did not feel the same way. He said “I doubt we are going to see a cruise ship in 2021 with the rates going the way they are going the death rates are only moving upward. I think in the back of your mind Mr. Ottley you should prepare some type of plan that allows us to get to the end of 2021 without a single ship in port.”

The latest CDC update on cruise ship travel states that the federal agency intends to take a phased approach to resuming passenger operations.

""These phases include (1) establishment of laboratory testing of crew onboard cruise ships in U.S. waters; (2) simulated voyages designed to test a cruise ship operators’ ability to mitigate COVID-19 on cruise ships; (3) a certification process; and (4) a return to passenger voyages in a manner that mitigates the risk of COVID-19 introduction transmission or spread among passengers and crew onboard ships and ashore to communities"" said the CDC. ""These phases will be further determined based on public health considerations including the trajectory of COVID-19 transmission and the demonstrated ability of cruise ships operators to successfully employ measures that mitigate the risk of COVID-19.”

There is a possibility that cruise lines will require all their staff and passengers to get vaccinated. If this requirement is finalized it is expected that all start dates will be further pushed back.

The WICO board meeting began with some housekeeping as Joseph Boschulte WICO chairman opened by asking the board if there were any nominations for leadership positions on the board. Pash Daswani WICO board member moved that the current slate of officers remain in place for one more year and this motion passed with no objections.

Jason Charles WICO vice-chairman expressed gratitude for the trust that the board placed in the officers by granting them another year of leadership.

Silversea Cruises’ new cruise ship Silver Dawn touched water for the first time when the vessel was floated out at the Fincantieri shipyard in Ancona Italy. The cruise ship will be the ultra-luxury cruise line’s 10th vessel.

The third ship in the Muse-class series and part of a long-term plan to grow and enhance the cruise line’s already luxurious fleet Silver Dawn will be a sistership to Silversea’s Silver Muse built in the Fincantieri shipyard of Sestri Ponente (Genoa) in April 2017 and Silver Moon which was delivered in Ancona in October 2020.

Accommodating just 596 guests in 298 ocean-view suites – 96% of which will have a private veranda – and with a crew-to-guest ratio of 1:1.45 Silver Dawn will maintain the small-ship intimacy and spacious accommodation which are the hallmarks of the Silversea experience.

She will offer guests many exciting enhancements when compared to Silver Muse and Silver Moon which will be unveiled in due course. Providing superlative comfort and an enhanced onboard experience she will unlock authentic travel experiences for Silversea’s discerning guests in the world’s most spectacular destinations.

Carnival’s Costa Cruises also had a new cruise ship float-out this week. Costa Toscana the cruise line’s new flagship joins sister ship Costa Smeralda in being powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG).

During the float-out ceremony Costa Toscana officially touched the sea for the first time with the flooding of the basin where she has been built in recent months. She will enter service in December 2021 once the interior fittings have been completed.

Costa Toscana has been designed to be a traveling “smart city” where sustainable solutions and circular economy concepts are applied to reduce environmental impact.

The new flagship is a tribute to Tuscany the result of an extraordinarily creative project curated by Adam D. Tihany designed to enhance and bring to life in a single location reflecting the best of this wonderful Italian region which gives its name to the ship its decks and main public areas.

The facilities on board the cruise ship will fit perfectly into this extraordinary setting: from the Solemio Spa to the areas dedicated to entertainment; from the themed bars in collaboration with major Italian brands to the 16 restaurants and areas dedicated to the “food experience” including the restaurant dedicated to families with children and the LAB Restaurant where you can try your cooking skills under the guidance of Costa’s chefs.

Comfortable and elegant the more than 2600 cabins on board perfectly reflect Italian style and taste. The “Sea Terrace” cabins will offer a beautiful veranda where you can have breakfast sip an aperitif or simply enjoy the view.

Costa Toscana will make its debut in Brazil in the 2021-22 season. In particular the inaugural New Year’s Eve cruise will depart from Santos on December 26 2021 with a week-long itinerary visiting Salvador and Ilhéus and returning to Santos on January 2 2022.

From January 2 to April 10 2022 Costa Toscana will offer another 15 cruises with the same itinerary embarking in Santos and Salvador. The 15 cruises also include the Carnival and Easter departures which will be the ship’s last cruise before the Brazil-Italy crossing departing from Santos on April 17 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzYW1lcmljYXNub3cuY29tL2NhcmliYmVhbmVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudG5ld3MtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWZsb3VyZ29uLWNhcmliYmVhbmFtZXJpY2Fua2FtYWxhLW1vbnR5YWxleGFuZGVyLWZsb3VyZ29uLXBhcGFtaWNoaWdhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caribbean Entertainment - Top Caribbean Musicians Pay Tribute To Kamala Harris At Global Caribbean Inauguration,"News Americas NEW YORK NY Jan. 18 2021: Some of the Caribbean’s top musicians gathered on Sunday night to celebrate the first black and female Caribbean-American US vice-president – Kamala Harris at the Global Caribbean Inauguration celebration conceptualized by Felicia J.

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’I’m the best decision your organization has ever made’"" Ross said.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Brady likely knew there were going to be some things said that he might not like but he seemed to want the subject of the jokes to stay with him not his former owner.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWFjY291bnRhbnQtamVmZnJleS1zLW1jY29ubmV5LW9uLWhpcy1zdG9ybXktZGFuaWVscy1jb3ZlcnVwLW5vdGVzLWktbWFkZS1hLWJvby1ib2_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump Accountant on His Stormy Daniels Coverup Notes: 'I Made a Boo-Boo',"Jurors who will determine Donald Trump’s fate got their first look at the damning paperwork tying the former president to his porn star hush-money coverup with testimony from the buffoon accountant who took notes of a meeting that set it in motion.

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjIxYWxpdmVuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA2L2Z3cGQtbXVsdGlwbGUtcGVvcGxlLWh1cnQtc2hvb3Rpbmctcy1oYW5uYS1zdHJlZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FWPD: Multiple people hurt in shooting on S Hanna Street,"FORT WAYNE Ind.

You’ll find the regularly $330 64GB configuration marked down to $229.99 shipped in all three colorways but the regular $400 128GB version is also now seeing a deep sale price down at $259.99 shipped. That’s $100 in savings on the base model and $140 off the higher-end configuration. Both options undercut our previous mentions by as much as $70 but it’s hard to deny the value on the 128GB model for $30 more.

As companies and business leaders likely face another year of uncertainty because of the pandemic they're looking for ways to be better prepared than they were in 2020 when the coronavirus initially upended everything.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff who led the cloud giant through its own tumultuous year has a key piece of advice for his fellow business leaders: Plan for various outcomes.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""We can see where we are right now: We're all at home"" Benioff said at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet conference earlier this week. ""Will we be at home 6 months from now? A year from now? When will we really be back at our office? And when will we really be traveling the world again? I don't know. So we need to plan for multiple scenarios. We have to look at all the different potential outcomes here because we're in a new pandemic world.""

Companies should take a ""digital-first"" approach he said because that will allow them to be better prepared for a world in which some aspects of distributed work are permanent. That transformation goes beyond just setting up an ecommerce site for retail he said to broader digital transformation initiatives that modernize a business like helping sales teams reach potential customers remotely or beefing up security.

Salesforce has actually found that it can ""sell more aggressively in a digital environment"" without the need to coordinate travel or in-person meetings Benioff said. Organizations should continue to focus on ways to reach prospective customers and sell their products using digital tools because they don't know when in person meetings and travel will be allowed again he added.

""You think about your whole organization: Are they enabled and empowered to make those sales calls?"" Benioff said. ""There's never been a more important time to have a sales organization that's able to do that.""

One reason behind Salesforce's $27.7 billion deal to acquire Slack was to position Salesforce to become a more remote-friendly company he said with productivity and collaboration tools that integrate seamlessly with its sales and marketing software so it's easy for users to get their work done regardless of location.

""Companies like ours have to take the risk to be able to amplify our core — like we're doing with Slack — so that we can deliver massive value this year for our clients"" Benioff said. His advice to other business leaders navigating the uncertainty right now is to trust their own decisions even when they're risky.

""We're altering our company to prepare for the future because we want to be well-positioned and relevant for our customers in the future. We have been this year but we also want to be for the next decade"" Benioff said. ""I think every CEO needs to look at that as a model.""

A leader should be able to define their company's values and work through what prevented success achieving those values in the past in order to guide them on achieving them this year.

He urges leaders to ask themselves how they'll know when they're successful ""in this new world.""

Developer says its total revenue increased by 655 since Q2 2020

Samana Developers’ total revenue increased by 65% since Q2 2020 marking the ninth consecutive month – April to December 2020 – that the developer has reported a growth in revenue generated month-on-month despite roadblocks raised by the pandemic.

In a statement Samana said that the company has increased its headcount by 55% and has doubled its sales revenue target for 2021. In addition the ongoing COVID-19 vaccine drive by the UAE and Expo 2020 in October this year are predicting a positive outlook for 2021 which will lead to growth across sectors.

Imran Farooq CEO of Samana Developers said: “Dubai has performed well and is capable of fighting with a major pandemic. The city has launched a massive COVID-19 vaccine drive to protect the 9.89 million population. UAE converting the empty hotel apartments into quarantine centres was an innovative idea and helped reduce the spread of coronavirus.

“Dubai emerged has emerged as one of the fastest cities in the world to get over with the pandemic as UAE’s 12% population has already been given the first dose of the vaccine. Around 80000 people get shots in a day. This is resulting in economic recovery and growth in tourism.”

Coming off the back of record highest sales revenues in 2020 and a positive outlook for 2021 Samana Developers has increased its headcount by 55% for 2021 to double up the sales revenue the statement adds. The company has also announced plans to launch three new residential projects in investor hotspots in Dubai.

It said that it has completely sold out its AED185 million Greens and Hills projects in 2020. The company managed to fast-track the construction of these projects by introducing drastic changes in the way construction is done for the 327 units. Samana’s new construction management strategy helped complete the construction ahead of time the statement added.

Earlier in 2020 the superstructure of the AED110 million Samana Hills residential project was completed ahead of schedule. Located at Arjan Dubailand the resort-themed Samana Hills covers an area of 100000 sqft and houses 205 units including studios one and two-bedroom apartments. The ground was broken in September 2019 and is scheduled for handover in Q3 2021 coinciding with the expected high time of Expo 2020 mega-economic opportunity.

The construction of the AED75 million Samana Greens project has also been completed and fully sold out. The delivery of this project is expected in January 2021 as the project is in the final stages of getting the Building Completion Certificate (BCC) from Dubai Land Department.

The AED100 million Samana Golf Avenue project at Dubai Studio City has been fast-tracked and is sold out by 85% as of January 16 2021. It will be ready for handover in Q1 2023.

“Samana Developers provides 50% financing to its buyers. Its assets guarantee competitive 24% returns at 8% per year over three years. This makes Samana projects attractive propositions for end-users and investors alike. With a payment option of paying 10% on booking followed by 80 months at just 1% makes it an excellent option for those that are looking to move from the rented accommodation to owning a house in Dubai” the statement concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxlMmUuY29tL25ld3MvaW5mb3N5cy1idXlzLWRpZ2l0YWwtZGVzaWduLWFnZW5jeS1jYXJ0ZXItZGlnaXRhbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Infosys Acquires Digital Design Agency Carter Digital -,"Global IT consulting and software development firm Infosys has acquired Carter Digital a digital design agency based in Australia.

Correspondent

No Worcester player — IceCats Sharks or Railers — has ever posted consecutive 30-goal seasons but Mike Iggulden almost did.

An original Shark Iggulden notched 30 in 2006-07 the team’s first season at the DCU Center then came back with 29 the next year. However Iggulden thinks he should have had one more.

“It was near the end of the season” he remembered “and we had a power play maybe a five-on-three and I roofed one in off the back crossbar then it bounced back and just sat on the goal line. Graham Mink then tapped it in from there and he got the goal. There was no video review then and I think that might have been my 30th.”

Iggulden’s 59 goals for the Sharks are tied for third on the team’s all-time list with Riley Armstrong behind John McCarthy and Dan DaSilva. HIs 123 points are sixth in that category.

Iggulden grew up in Southern Ontario and went to Cornell University but has gone south like so many ex-Sharks. He and his family live near Palm Beach on Florida’s East Coast which works well in that he is nearly a scratch golfer.

That’s another Worcester hockey thing or at least a hockey thing. IceCats defenseman Derek Diener became a pro Sharks forwards Bracken Kearns and Joe Pavelski are low-handicappers and former Railer Nick Sorkin is one of the best hockey golfers around.

During his second Sharks season Iggulden got to make his NHL debut with San Jose playing one game. He joined the Islanders organization after that and played 83 games in 2008-09 between Bridgeport and New York scoring his first NHL goal for the Islanders that season against Carey Price in Montreal.

And that was it for North America. Iggulden went to Europe and spent seven seasons there his career ending in 2015-16.

“We talked about a one-way (NHL) contract with the Islanders” Iggulden said “and while the Islanders didn’t make the playoffs that year Bridgeport did and I got a bad concussion in the third game. That made me evaluate Europe a little harder.

“The KHL pays well and the ice surfaces are bigger so it’s not so physical. If I had gotten a one-way contract I probably would have stayed that year but I’m glad I went. I got paid well and the fans were awesome. I had an amazing experience over there.”

Iggulden’s first European gig was in Riga Latvia. The KHL road trips are legendary and he had some memorable ones too. For instance:

“One trip we got on the plane and the pilot came on and said some message in Russian which I didn't understand. So I asked someone to translate and he told me ‘The pilot said that this is the last flight this plane will ever take. After we land it’s being retired.”

Yikes.

And there was the road trip to the KHL’s east side.

“Basically you’re in China” Iggulden recalled. “It’s about a 13-hour trip and you go through eight time zones. It turns you into a complete zombie.”

Iggulden met his wife Joey when they were in high school and they were a couple in Worcester. Joey’s family eventually relocated to Florida so it was an easy call to move there full time after Mike’s hockey career ended. His first job post-hockey was with a new technology company that grew like crazy but wound up growing too fast and crashed.

He is now an account executive at Salesforce in Palm Beach Gardens. Iggulden has a son Aussie and a daughter Ivy. He isn’t far from where the Florida Panthers are based and takes in a few games a year there.

Iggulden came to Worcester along with the team which had previously been the Cleveland Barons. The Sharks had a very strong first year in town but missed the playoffs the second one. His Worcester memories are good ones.

“I’ll always have a special place for (coach) Roy (Sommer) Iggulden recalled. “He understood me as a player was always looking out for my best interests always advocating for me to get called up.”

Sommer has a special place for Iggulden too since the forward was the best shootout player ever to wear a Worcester uniform. He holds the city record for shootout goals with 12 overall and was 8 for 12 in 2007-08. Sommer notoriously hated shootouts and couldn’t bear to look when they were going on.

Iggulden’s only return to Worcester since he played for the Sharks was when he skated for Bridgeport as far as he recalls.

“I don’t think I’ve been back since then I don’t” he said “but it was a fun time and I look back on it very fondly.”

Except maybe for that one wrist shot off the back crossbar.

StorPool Hits Version 19.2

StorPool announced that its block SDS has hit its newest version StorPool v19.2. New capabilities include:

Reliability

Maintenance mode – Automates the checks needed to stop or start storage services without impacting user workloads. Administrators can enable Maintenance Mode on a per-node basis. As long as there is sufficient redundancy in the cluster the given node has no running server instances and the storage system is not rebuilding or rebalancing the node transitions to maintenance mode. Administrators can transition a node to maintenance mode for a set period. Administrators can also trigger maintenance mode on a per-cluster basis to sync context between the customer and the StorPool support team.

Administrators can also trigger maintenance mode on a per-cluster basis to sync context between the customer and the StorPool support team. In-Server Disk Tester – Automatically runs a set of reliability checks on any drive that fails an Input/Output operation if it is still visible to the operating system. If the device passes all tests StorPool returns it to the cluster. Administrators can also trigger the disk tester manually to test drive reliability proactively.

Data-at-Rest Encryption – When data is stored in nodes using only self-encrypting drives encryption can be enabled for data at rest during deployment.

– When data is stored in nodes using only self-encrypting drives encryption can be enabled for data at rest during deployment. Introduced a Public Knowledge Base

Business Continuity

StorPool VolumeCare – Builds on top of the snapshots and clones features many-to-one and one-to-many asynchronous replication introduced in 2016. A few notes about this new capability: Administrators can now create and manage consistent atomic snapshots of volumes by defining retention policies and can store the snapshots both in their primary StorPool Storage systems and in remote clusters. Detects if multiple volumes belong to the same virtual machine (based on tags added by the Cloud Management Platform) to create crash-consistent snapshots for the whole virtual machine. Enables administrators to revert to a previous state based on the virtual machine ID instead of volume by volume. Supports multi-cluster and multi-site deployments – administrators can use backup clusters to store snapshots instead of or in addition to storing them in the primary cluster. In this configuration the service runs in each of the clusters. Enables backing up multiple primary StorPool Storage systems to a single backup cluster provided the sites have aligned retention policies. The StorPool support team proactively ensures that the retention policies do not contradict each other. After the initial transfer of a given volume or virtual machine snapshot to a backup cluster additional replications are incremental – StorPool only sends new or changed data to the backup cluster.

– Builds on top of the snapshots and clones features many-to-one and one-to-many asynchronous replication introduced in 2016. A few notes about this new capability:

Management

Major Installation Package System Changes – New implementation of most core installation tools. Service files are now handled as rpm/deb packages.

– New implementation of most core installation tools. Service files are now handled as rpm/deb packages. Implemented Infrastructure that Provides Access to StorPool Packages – Customers can independently complete deployments or StorPool Storage updates.

Monitoring Support for IPv6-only Environments – nodes with IPv6-only Internet connectivity can now connect to the StorPool Hosted Monitoring System. They send the comprehensive list of metrics typically collected from StorPool clusters. Metrics include cluster status info (disks services running rebuild/rebalancing tasks iSCSI configuration etc.) host status info (control groups kernels connectivity etc.) and performance metrics (latency IOPS and throughput per disk/volume/node CPU usage etc.).

Automatically detects the operating system the type of interface configuration used for the storage system and iSCSI and depending on the configuration type (i.e. exclusive interfaces or a bond) prints the interface configuration on the console. The Auto-interface Configurator automatically creates non-existing interface configurations and does not replace those that already exist unless explicitly instructed to do so.

Hardware Support

Added support for Micron 9300 NVMe drives Samsung PM173x NVMe drives and Micron 7300 Pro NVMe drives. StorPool Storage supports standard DC-grade hardware on a per-component basis.

Software support

Added support for RHEL/CentOS 8.

And it's not only Gelsinger: In June VMware lost its SVP of worldwide customer services Jim Delia to ServiceNow followed in July by chief customer officer Scott Bajtos fleeing for FinancialForce. In December COO Rajiv Ramaswami resigned and joined Nutanix as CEO. (In late December VMware actually sued Ramaswami accusing him of breaching his legal and contractual duties to the company by taking ""secretly meeting"" with Nutanix for two months.) Most recently cloud management general manager Ajay Singh departed to become chief product officer at Pure Storage earlier this month.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Those departures among others have investors concerned.

""The recent executive turnover is such that it is hard for us to not interpret it as a signal of weakened confidence in VMware's growth outlook"" Karl Keirstead managing director at UBS wrote in a note to clients this week.

The executive exodus is especially concerning analysts say as VMware is working through its strategy of selling software for the cloud and facing a possible spin out of parent company Dell.

VMware leaders customers partners and investors all respected Gelsinger Keirstead said and his surprise departure lends a ""negative read on VMware's outlook.""

While the firm still has a ""deep management bench"" including interim CEO Zane Rowe and co-COO's Sanjay Poonen and Raghu Raghuram ""the collective impact and timing of these departures signal to us that there may be trouble brewing beneath the surface at VMware"" William Blair partner Jason Ader wrote in a note to clients.

Indeed Piper Sandler slashed its price target for the $56.6 billion company's stock to $157 down from $178 and UBS lowered its 12-month price target to $145 from $152. Mizuho and William Blair meanwhile maintained price targets of $147. The firm's stock worth about $135 per share as of Friday afternoon is down 5% since the announcement on January 13 and down roughly 10% over the past year.

""We're not confident that [VMware] will execute smoothly going forward"" Gregg Moskowitz managing director at Mizuho wrote in a note ""And we remain cautious on the overall compute business."" While VMware's initial focus was data center virtualization it has expanded its reach into cloud and security among other areas under Gelsinger's eight-plus year watch.

In response to a question about recent turnover and the effect on the firm a spokesperson said that VMware has a ""strong executive bench"" and continues ""to attract outstanding talent"" including recent hires like chief marketing officer Carol Carpenter who joined from Google Cloud in June chief digital transformation officer Mike Hayes who joined from Cognizant in October and SVP of worldwide partner sales Sandy Hogan who joined from Rackspace in June among others.

VMware needs a 'high-caliber replacement'

With Gelsinger leaving VMware is on the hunt for a new CEO and several analysts told Insider that VMware's current COO Sanjay Poonen is the most logical choice.

Others however said VMware would be better served by finding an external candidate.

""Regarding the CEO search management noted there are several internal candidates but opening up the search to external candidates is the right thing to do given the opportunity to continue the transformation of a company of this size and importance in a post-COVID world that moves 'Faster to the Future'"" RBC Capital Markets managing director Matt Hedberg wrote in a note to clients.

Analysts previously told Insider that if VMware were to look to an outside candidate it would likely seek a leader in cloud computing from the likes of Amazon Web Services or Microsoft.

""We expect the company to seek a high-caliber replacement externally"" Mizuho's Moskowitz wrote ""Although VMware nevertheless faces a number of challenges and it's unclear who will fill [Gelsinger's] shoes.""

The company told Insider that its board is ""committed to a thorough global executive search process of diverse candidates.""

VMware is 'going to be fine'

Although the departure of key executives at VMware leaves some analysts concerned others say VMware will be able to continue its path of growth. In its most recent earnings report VMware posted revenue 8% higher than the previous year and projected an 5% year-over-year increase for the following quarter.

VMware is still in a good position to drive revenue growth in the coming year and ""remains in good hands"" even without Gelsinger RBC's Hedberg said.

Lopez Research founder and principal analyst Maribel Lopez says the company has an advantage in winning over new customers for its hybrid cloud products.

""They've got a leg up because people are already using them"" Lopez told Insider. ""They've got a leg up because they found a way to gracefully work with Kubernetes and other things. Now the question is what's next?""

VMware has so far ""pivoted nicely into the cloud world"" Forrester vice president and research director Glenn O'Donnell said. However it will need to attract application developers and push into edge computing which brings computing and data storage closer to the location where it's needed.

""From the VMware context it's a solid company"" O'Donnell told Insider. ""VMware is going to be fine and Intel needs some help. Pat is the right guy to run it.""

Sherwin-Williams which currently operates at 112 S. Main St is making plans to move to the three lots at 702 708 and 714 E. Fifth St. (Photo submitted)

A Marysville paint store is planning a move.

Sherwin-Williams which currently operates at 112 S. Main St is making plans to move to the three lots at 702 708 and 714 E. Fifth St.

At Wednesday’s Design Review Board meeting the board heard SWE Development LLC’s request to have the three parcels combined into one parcel and for permission to construct a 3500 square-foot paint store. Currently two of the lots have homes and the other is vacant

The property is properly zoned as business residential. Because of the timing of the application the request is being made under the city’s previous zoning code. Moving forward the site will be zoned neighborhood commercial and village residential.

The board approved the site design plan. The developer tabled portions of the application dealing with architecture of the building as well as a mural on Fifth Street light fixtures and the building entry way.

At the meeting City Council member Donald Boerger questioned the lighting at the building and what impact it could have on neighbors. Officials said they would work on a lighting plan to minimize impact to the neighbors.

Tony Eufinger speaking for property owner John Eufinger said there had been conversations with the neighbors about the possibility of having a commercial development though they did not say specifically what that development would be.

City Planner Ashley Gaver said that while developers are working through the landscaping and lighting items for Design Review Board they are also working on engineering and other plans so when the final approval is given they can move forward.

She said the city does not know the details of when that project will be complete or what will happen in the building where Sherwin-Williams is currently.

Also at the meeting the board heard plans for Sunbelt Tool Rental which intends to build a new facility at 1050 Coleman’s Crossing Boulevard. The location is a six-acre lot at the corner of Coleman’s Crossing Boulevard and Industrial Parkway.

According to plans submitted to the city Sunbelt will construct a building with 2437 square feet of office space 5162 square feet of warehouse space and a 1303 square foot wash bay.

Plans indicate the Sunbelt lot will have parking with heavy duty concrete for storage for the rental equipment on three sides.

Although a traffic impact study is not required for this project the company will be required to make what the city calls “a traffic contribution” to go towards the upcoming traffic signal installation located at Coleman’s Crossing Boulevard and Industrial Parkway. The contribution amount will be based on the anticipated trip generation of the project compared to the existing traffic.

Sunbelt Rentals is currently located at 1000 Delaware Avenue on the northeast corner of the intersection of Delaware Avenue and Connolly Street in Marysville.

The company was in negotiations to purchase and relocate to the Coleman property 1329 E. Fifth St. Marysville. In the spring of last year it was announced that sale had fallen through.

The move paves the way for a proposed Thornton’s gas station and convenience store at the 1000 Delaware Avenue location. According to the plan a new 4516 square foot convenience store building will be constructed and the current building will be taken down.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vbmV3cy9kcHctZW5lcmd5LXRvLWhvbGQtZW5lcmd5LXN0YXItcmF0ZWQtZWxhc3RvbWVyaWMtcm9vZi1jb2F0aW5nLXByb2R1Y3QtcHJvbW90aW9uYWwtZXZlbnQtb24tamFuL2FydGljbGVfN2MzYzE1N2EtNTY2NS0xMWViLWI5MDUtNmJmN2MxNDlmMzYyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DPW-Energy to hold Energy Star-rated elastomeric roof coating product promotional event on Jan. 16,"You have permission to edit this article.

[KINGSTON Jamaica] – The birthplace of Jamaica’s modern political movement and popular music downtown Kingston was once the go-to location for Caribbean progressives. That was before crime and urban decay transformed it into a haven for undesirables and the homeless.

Kingston Creative a non-profit organization founded in 2017 stepped in three years ago to stop the rot. They have gradually changed the face of what was once the country’s business district through a series of colorful murals by local artists.

Eye-Catching Murals

The murals adorn facades and buildings in the Water Lane area. They are part of Kingston Creative’s Paint The City series similar to the eye-catching paintings in Wynwood Miami.

“We believe the development of an Art District and a Creative Hub will build on some of downtown Kingston’s most under-utilized assets — the history architecture the waterfront and the creative people that live there” said Kingston Creative co-founder and executive director Andrea Dempster-Chung.

She added that “Water Lane is a central East-West pathway that connects the National Gallery of Jamaica on Orange Street to the museums on East Street and is also the site for the Kingston Creative Artwalk and the Kingston Creative Hub co-working space so Water Lane is a natural focal point for cultural and community tourism.”

Dempster-Chung noted that 63 murals have been developed since 2018 three years after the UNESCO designated Kingston a creative city for music.

With financial support from the Tourism Enhancement Fund (part of the ministry of tourism) European Union and Sherwin Williams Paints murals were commissioned for communities such as Rae Town Tivoli Gardens Trench Town and Parade Gardens.

Most of the paintings are done by artists from these neighborhoods which like Wynwood have experienced years of gang violence.

Dempster-Chung says they have given a much-needed lift to an area where the Jamaican independence movement began in the 1930s. Downtown Kingston is also the birthplace of Marcus Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) as well as Ska rock steady and reggae.

“The response has been positive from the community and the creatives alike. People intuitively understand Jamaica’s creative potential and its position as a cultural powerhouse across the globe” she stated. “Creatives are excited to see the visitors coming in the events and video shoots taking place the increased patronage of the restaurants and bars in the area and the overall improvement in the infrastructure and look of the area.”",,,,,,
SPG,Simon Property Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lL25hdGlvbmFsLWphbnVhcnktMjAyMS9tYWxsLW1hY2hpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Namdar Realty Group Plows Forward as Mall Properties Decay,"At the Regency Square Mall in Jacksonville Florida roaches roam freely the air conditioning is broken and the roof leaks according to a series of lawsuits filed over the past four years.

But the mall’s owner Namdar Realty Group did not disclose any of that to its tenants a handful of retailers alleged.

When the issue was raised Namdar painted over the water stains and the problem got worse as mold grew and another leak developed International Decor Outlet asserted in a 2017 suit.

Namdar “is an absentee landlord with a reputation as a ‘slumlord’” the home furnishings store’s complaint reads. The lawsuit was later voluntarily dismissed.

In another part of the mall the leaky roof allegedly made it impossible for a tenant to move in. A certificate of occupancy was never issued and the leaks caused two electrical fires according to another lawsuit filed against the property by the Jacksonville Automotive and Motorcycle Museum.

And when the electricity went out in one part of the mall in June 2017 it took Namdar four months to restore power a local church claimed in a third lawsuit. As a result a build-up of moisture caused the chiller pipes to rip through the ceiling destroying the tiles dry wall and floor according to the church.

That comes on top of complaints against Namdar and its sister company Mason Asset Management from local officials and residents in several regions.

Namdar and Mason which co-owns and co-manages the Regency Mall and others declined to comment on specific lawsuits but denied the accusations.

“We feel that we’re doing very good for the communities and the properties that we own within those communities” said Mason’s president Elliot Nassim. “Once in a while you come across someone who doesn’t necessarily agree with what you’re doing.”

Despite being hit with allegations of neglect at several of their malls Namdar and Mason are rapidly growing. With 86 million square feet across more than 400 properties combined they now stack up against some of the industry’s biggest players. By comparison Macerich owns 51 million square feet across 47 malls and Simon Property Group owns 186 million square feet across 250 properties.

“We still believe in [brick and mortar] retail and we think there’s a place for it” said Igal Namdar Namdar’s president.

Through extensive interviews with Namdar and Mason executives and examination of public filings and lawsuits The Real Deal took a closer look at the two firms and their strategy at a time when many malls are in turmoil.

“Prime locations”

Based in the upscale enclave of Great Neck Long Island Namdar and Mason are both family run.

The companies operate jointly: Namdar handles most of the finances while Mason focuses on leasing. Some of the properties are owned by one and managed by the other and some are owned by both.

Curiously Namdar and Mason continue to fly under the radar. They have been gobbling up properties even as the market for malls shrinks and other owners and operators pull back. In 2019 Namdar bought 30 properties and Mason acquired 23. Last year Namdar bought 12 more and Mason added eight.

Malls were at one point seen as the future — places where people of all ages could gather and shop under a single roof. But as online shopping grew and consumer habits changed many malls found themselves plagued by dwindling foot traffic and rising bankruptcies.

When the pandemic hit those issues were only exacerbated. Dozens of retailers have filed for Chapter 11 in the past year including mall staples such as J.C. Penney and Ascena Retail Group. Others like Macy’s and Gap have decided to pull out of malls altogether.

At the same time many tenants have simply stopped paying rent as countless malls struggle to regain their footing.

In New York City malls lost half a year to the pandemic before being permitted to reopen in September. In Los Angeles malls got the green light that October after reopening and closing again in mid-July.

For big names revenue plummeted. Even Simon Property which has one of the best balance sheets in the business saw its net income fall to $145.9 million in 2020’s third quarter from $544.3 million in the same period a year earlier.

None of this seems to faze Namdar and Mason executives who say they’ve survived downturns before. “It doesn’t matter to us if people are selling” Igal said. “If we see that our business idea works and we can run these models and we can fix them up and we can manage them and we can bring value we’ll keep on buying.”

Namdar was founded in 1999 the same year Time named Amazon’s Jeff Bezos Person of the Year. Mason was founded more than 10 years later as the country was coming out of the Great Recession.

Nassim is the cousin of Igal’s wife. Their joint operation began when Igal started buying small retail locations in Great Neck using money from his family’s jewelry business; Nassim took up the leasing. Nassim brought in the national tenants and managed to fill spaces that brokers couldn’t Igal said.

“You go in and you don’t know much” he noted. “You make a lot of mistakes and you learn from every mistake on the way.”

The two talk every day brainstorming their next moves and see each other on weekends. That time is vital now as they navigate the heavy turbulence of the pandemic.

Igal and Nassim’s strategy lately has been similar to that employed by Simon and Brookfield which have been buying up bankrupt retailers including J.C. Penney and Brooks Brothers. Namdar and Mason have been acquiring smaller distressed local retailers including a Midwest movie theater chain that filed for bankruptcy last year. Namdar also recently hired a director of redevelopment with plans to repurpose some of the partnership’s properties.

“Most of the [malls] are built in prime locations” Igal said. “So there’s great value there.”

A fading industry

More than 20 percent of U.S. malls will close by 2022 according to a 2017 report by Credit Suisse. Some may die a slow death as stores are shuttered one by one. Others will be demolished by their owners.

Of course not all may be worth saving. And it may be natural to have issues at some mall locations especially if there’s not enough capital to make changes industry sources say. If the ultimate goal is to redevelop the property criticism can occur.

“Communities often want the world. And then there’s reality” said Alexander Goldfarb managing director senior and REIT analyst for Piper Sandler who declined to comment on Namdar in particular. “So the community may want one thing but economically it’s not feasible.”

But in the meantime according to retail strategist Marshall Kay malls serve a purpose for the communities that they’re in regardless of the backlash they may face over their condition. He raised the possibility that another owner might not keep some of Namdar’s malls open at all.

“If Namdar wasn’t the owner of these properties would it mean that certain areas would be underserved? That’s a question worth considering” said Kay who argued that there “isn’t an obligation to revitalize every retail property.”

“What is the alternative for consumers?” he added. “What is the alternative for the retailers who rent from them?”

“Depreciation purposes”

In Mansfield Ohio Namdar’s Westpark Shopping Center looks ill.

The canopy is peeling off the building and its signage has fallen. The overflowing dumpster has become a public nuisance according to a letter from the city to Namdar last September. A spokesperson for Namdar said it is actively working to fix the property.

It’s not the first time the shopping center has been in trouble. In October 2019 Dollar General received an order to evacuate: The fire alarm system was out of service and needed to be replaced.

At a Namdar property in Sterling Illinois photographs show a sinkhole that formed after a storm drainage tube collapsed. The damage may be causing water to infiltrate the city’s sewer system according to emails between town officials sent throughout 2020 provided to TRD.

Mall employees and customers voiced concerns to the city but outreach to Namdar went unanswered until the city threatened litigation according to the emails. Namdar’s spokesperson said the company has worked “diligently” to repair the storm drain and any remaining issues surrounding the collapse.

As Namdar rushes to acquire more properties some worry that the ones it owns are being left behind.

“Over time you do become what you’re perceived” Cushman and Wakefield Vice Chair Mark Gilbert said of Namdar in a 2018 interview with Reuters. “I think that in many respects if they don’t define what they’re going to do with these malls in general then they may get defined by the bad ones.”

At a shuttered mall in Hazelwood Missouri near St. Louis the local newspaper published images of burned-out light bulbs and waist-high grass. The mall looks abandoned but isn’t.

“We’ve redirected our efforts at the St. Louis Outlet Mall and have since entered into a multiparty agreement to resolve outstanding taxes and assessments” Namdar’s spokesperson said in a statement.

At the now-shuttered Phillipsburg Mall in New Jersey following a heavy rain in 2018 the roof of a vacant Sears collapsed bringing a water pipe down with it according to police reports.

Namdar’s spokesperson blamed “hastily completed contracting work that Sears had commissioned a number of years back” before the retailer shut its doors.

“Given that the property was slated for a redevelopment and ultimately would be demolished this accelerated the plans for the building” the spokesperson noted.

Upset communities allege that Namdar and Mason are looking to turn a profit by not investing in their malls.

Brad Schrader Sterling’s superintendent of public works said he suspects the city is the victim of Namdar using the local mall “for depreciation purposes.”

“We get stuck holding the bag in the end” he said. “It’s an economic drain on us because they’re not reinvesting and it’s a moral drain on the community watching something that was once a vibrant center for the community falling into disrepair.”

Smoke and mirrors?

After soaking Florida’s DeSoto Square Mall for management fees Namdar attempted to sell the property for $30 million according to a lawsuit filed by the financial services firm ML Holdings in 2018.

Namdar ultimately traded the property to ML Holdings for $25.5 million. But when the new owner took a closer look after the sale it found things were not as they appeared.

Despite carrying significant expenses for security waste disposal landscaping and parking lot repairs on its books the mall was in poor condition and its gross income was slashed from $6 million to $4 million ML Holdings claimed.

Soon after the sale closed tenants allegedly began to flee.

Namdar had verbally agreed to lower rents for store owners in some cases to as little as 25 percent of what was reported in leases while others had been allowed to stay rent-free to prop up occupancy rates according to the complaint.

“While we cannot say much on the matters related to the Midtown DeSoto Square Mall it has been made public that we sold the property in early 2017” Namdar’s spokesperson said.

Over time ML Holdings fell into default on its loan. The lawsuit contends that the mall should have sold for about $5 million — one-fifth of what the company paid.

That was no accident said Meyer Silber ML Holdings’ lawyer in the case against Namdar which is ongoing.

“Their strategy generally was to suck out as much money from a mall as possible” said Silber “and they try to just dump it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzY2ZGYzOGY5LTcwMWUtNGFiYS1iNzg5LTIxNTA5NjY0ZDVlM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to bring Brooks Brothers back from the brink,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

For a brief window the video rental store Blockbuster held that power.

It was a year after Nintendo released the Pokémon Red and Blue video games for the Game Boy in the US introducing a wild strange world where kids could befriend and battle the mysterious creatures. In 1999 Nintendo took the premise further. For the Nintendo 64 console it released Pokémon Snap in which pocket monsters wandered the wild—their first 3D incarnation—and players took pictures of them luring them out with apples. Professor Oak judged the photos’ quality by Pokémon rarity and stylistic sophistication.

Going on a Pokémon safari piqued the imagination. Suddenly Pokémon had their own lives off-camera. As a visitor you could briefly appreciate them at their most authentic not in captivity. Scrolling through digital Pokémon Snap photos was like browsing a collection of signed baseballs caught after a moment of greatness. But they were digital; at the time widely considered less real than collectables you could hold. This was the magic of Blockbuster’s Pokémon Snap Station.

Nintendo teamed up with Blockbuster in the ’90s to design a kiosk that fully capitalized on kids’ ardent and impossible wish to make Pokémon real. It was a royal-blue arcade cabinet trimmed in electric yellow with a matching yellow N64 controller popping out the front. A happy image of Pikachu sprung from the bottom. A Samsung CRT television was connected to an N64 hidden inside. It also contained a small printer. Kids who had Pokémon Snap at home or rented it from Blockbuster could slot in their cartridge and print their digital photographs of Pokémon onto the Pokémon Snap Station’s sticker sheets.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snap Counts: Justin Fields Wyatt Davis and Shaun Wade Lead Ohio State in Playing Time in Unusually Short 2020,"Ohio State’s final snap counts for the 2020 season are in and they’re a little lower than what you’d typically see at the end of a Buckeye football season.

In each of the first three seasons we tracked Ohio State’s snap counts for the season here at Eleven Warriors the Buckeyes’ leaders in playing time each played at least 900 snaps for the year led by a whopping 1102 snaps for former offensive linemen Michael Jordan Isaiah Prince and Malcolm Pridgeon in 2018.

Because the Buckeyes played only eight games this season however no player even hit 600 snaps. Justin Fields as you might expect led Ohio State for the season with 576 snaps played but only five other Buckeyes topped the 500-snap threshold; Wyatt Davis played 546 Shaun Wade played 520 and Thayer Munford Josh Myers and Nicholas Petit-Frere each played every snap with the exception of the Michigan State game they missed due to COVID-19 to play 510.

Other leading snap-getters for the 2020 season included Pete Werner (494) Sevyn Banks (483) Garrett Wilson (471) Harry Miller (464) and Chris Olave (441).

You’ll see the full table of how many snaps every Buckeye played this year at the bottom of this article but first we take a look back at the snaps from the final game of the season against Alabama.

Sixty total Buckeyes saw the field in Ohio State’s 52-24 national championship game loss on Monday night the same number that played in the 49-28 Sugar Bowl win over Clemson though not all of the same players. Several Buckeyes who played against Clemson were unavailable to play against Alabama – notably including defensive linemen Tommy Togiai and Tyreke Smith and kickers Blake Haubeil and Dominic DiMaccio – but several others returned to action for the final game of the year while defensive tackles Antwuan Jackson and Jerron Cage and running back Marcus Crowley were among those who finished the season playing their biggest roles of the year.

As we did all season the following Snap Counts were compiled by Eleven Warriors and should be considered unofficial. These snap counts only include the number of snaps played on offense or defense but participants on special teams units are also listed.

Quarterbacks

Justin Fields: 65

In what was likely his final game as a Buckeye Fields played every snap against Alabama even though he had to battle through a hip injury he suffered against Clemson. Fields wasn’t as sharp as he was against Clemson completing only 17 of his 33 passing attempts for 194 yards and one touchdown but he did lead the Buckeyes with 67 rushing yards on six attempts and put his trademark toughness on display one more time.

For the season as a whole Fields played all but 18 of Ohio State’s offensive snaps at quarterback.

Running Backs

Master Teague: 40

Marcus Crowley: 23

Trey Sermon: 2

Steele Chambers: Special teams only

Xavier Johnson: Special teams only

After playing nearly all the snaps at running back against Northwestern and Clemson Sermon was injured on the very first play against Alabama when he landed on his shoulder. Sermon stayed on the field for one more play before realizing the extent of his injury which forced him to leave the game and eventually head to the hospital for treatment ending his career as a Buckeye in unfortunate fashion.

Teague who missed the Sugar Bowl after suffering an injury in the first quarter of the Big Ten Championship Game took over as the Buckeyes’ lead running back following Sermon’s injury and ran for 65 yards and two touchdowns on 15 carries.

With Miyan Williams also unavailable for the national championship game Crowley saw his only offensive playing time of the entire season against Alabama coming off the bench behind Teague and rushing for 14 yards on six carries while also catching one pass for four yards. 17 of Crowley’s 23 snaps came in the fourth quarter after Alabama had already scored all of its 52 points.

Wide Receivers

Chris Olave: 62

Garrett Wilson: 52

Jameson Williams: 40

Jaxon Smith-Njigba: 23

Julian Fleming: 3

Gee Scott Jr.: 2

Kamryn Babb: Special teams only

Chris Booker: Special teams only

Demario McCall: Special teams only

Olave played all but three snaps in what was likely his final game as a Buckeye with Fleming taking his place on the field for those three plays. Olave led the Buckeyes with eight receptions for 69 yards against Alabama.

Wilson played all but one offensive snap in the first three quarters against Alabama but went to the bench for most of the fourth quarter with Smith-Njigba taking his place in the slot. All but one of Smith-Njigba’s snaps against Alabama came in three-receiver sets with his earlier snaps in the game alongside Olave and Wilson coming as an outside receiver.

Williams continued to play exclusively in three-receiver formations but was on the field for a majority of Ohio State’s offensive plays against the Crimson Tide. Scott checked in for a pair of snaps at outside receiver in the fourth quarter marking the third time he saw playing time on offense in his freshman year.

Tight Ends

Luke Farrell: 40

Jeremy Ruckert: 37

Jake Hausmann: 1

Mitch Rossi: Special teams only

Cade Stover: Special teams only

Even though Alabama had struggled to defend tight ends in the passing game all year Ohio State didn’t use two-tight end sets as frequently in the national championship game as it did in most of its other games this season putting Farrell and Ruckert on the field together for only 12 plays against the Crimson Tide. Ruckert made a one-handed 36-yard catch for Ohio State’s longest play of the day but that was the only catch by a Buckeye tight end in the national title game.

Hausmann’s only snap on the game came when the Buckeyes kneeled the ball down on the final play of the first half.

Offensive Linemen

Thayer Munford: 65

Josh Myers: 65

Nicholas Petit-Frere: 65

Matthew Jones: 62

Wyatt Davis: 35

Harry Miller: 27

Paris Johnson Jr.: 6

Gavin Cupp: Special teams only

Max Wray: Special teams only

Munford Myers and Petit-Frere each played all 65 of Ohio State’s offensive snaps against Alabama just as they did in all seven games they were able to play in this season.

Jones made his third start of the season (and second in a row) at left guard and played all but three snaps of the game at that spot. Johnson played three snaps in his place during the Buckeyes’ second-to-last possession of the game.

Davis the only offensive lineman to start every game for the Buckeyes this year left the game and did not return after suffering a knee injury on the Buckeyes’ final possession of the first half. Miller who was unavailable to play against Clemson and began the national championship game on the bench after starting the first six games of the season took Davis’ place at right guard until the Buckeyes’ final possession of the game when Johnson checked in for three more plays.

Defensive Ends

Jonathon Cooper: 63

Zach Harrison: 49

Tyler Friday: 33

Javontae Jean-Baptiste: 22

Cormontae Hamilton: 3

Noah Potter: 3

With Tyreke Smith unavailable to play Cooper and Harrison both played their highest snap counts of the season. Jean-Baptiste started the game opposite Cooper but Harrison ended up playing more than twice as many snaps off the bench while Friday also played his second-highest snap count of the season as the four of them rotated at defensive end throughout the game.

Hamilton and Potter substituted in for the final three plays of the game.

Defensive Tackles

Haskell Garrett: 61

Antwuan Jackson: 47

Jerron Cage: 32

Taron Vincent: 25

Jaden McKenzie: 2

Enokk Vimahi: 2

Garrett played a career-high 61 snaps against Alabama lining up at 3-technique for more than 70 percent of the Buckeyes’ 85 defensive plays against the Crimson Tide.

With Tommy Togiai out at nose tackle Cage started the game in his place and played a career-high 32 snaps but Jackson – who had a career-high five tackles and the only sack of his Ohio State career – ended up playing the majority of snaps at nose tackle also setting a career-high for playing time. Vincent also played one series at nose tackle alongside Garrett but otherwise rotated with Garrett at 3-technique.

Vimahi who typically plays guard checked in at defensive tackle for the final two plays of the game – which were just kneel-downs by Alabama – along with McKenzie.

Linebackers

Pete Werner: 75

Tuf Borland: 68

Baron Browning: 62

Justin Hilliard: 55

Teradja Mitchell: 10

Dallas Gant: 8

K’Vaughan Pope: 1

Cody Simon: Special teams only

Werner topped 70 snaps for a third game in a row to conclude the 2020 season playing linebacker for all but 10 defensive plays against Alabama. Mitchell took his place at Will linebacker for a pair of snaps in the second quarter as well as the game’s final defensive series.

Borland who led all Buckeyes with 14 tackles in the national championship game tied his season-high by playing 68 snaps against Alabama. He was on the field for all but nine of the Buckeyes’ first 77 plays against the Crimson Tide only coming out of the game on nickel packages. Gant took his place at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes’ final defensive series.

Ohio State utilized its four-linebacker package heavily against Alabama putting four linebackers on the field for 33 of its defensive plays in the national championship game so Browning and Hilliard also both played a majority of the Buckeyes’ defensive snaps as a result. Hilliard started the game at Sam linebacker but Browning ended up playing slightly more snaps. They rotated at Sam in the base defense and played opposite each other as the two outside linebackers in the four-linebacker packages while Browning also stayed on the field with Werner in nickel packages.

Pope also played one snap as an outside linebacker in the four-linebacker defense.

Cornerbacks

Sevyn Banks: 84

Shaun Wade: 83

Lathan Ransom: 9

Tyreke Johnson: 2

Banks was on the field for all but one play against Alabama coming out only for a fourth-down goal-line play in the first quarter where Wade was the only defensive back on the field. Wade was on the field for all but the final two plays of the national championship game for which Johnson took his place on the field for the Crimson Tide’s final kneel-downs.

The Buckeyes didn’t run as much nickel against Alabama as they did against Clemson but Ransom came into the game at slot cornerback for all nine plays on which Ohio State had five defensive backs on the field.

Safeties

Josh Proctor: 84

Marcus Williamson: 52

Marcus Hooker: Special teams only

Bryson Shaw: Special teams only

Proctor like Banks only left the field for Alabama’s fourth-and-goal (on which Najee Harris ran for a touchdown) in the first quarter and tied for the team lead with a career-high 84 snaps.

Williamson like he did against Clemson played mostly as a second high safety rather than as a slot cornerback against Alabama. He was on the field for all of Ohio State’s base and nickel plays against Alabama but was the defensive back who substituted out when the Buckeyes brought a fourth linebacker into the game.

Lovren left Anfield for Zenit last summer after six years of service in Merseyside with the club yet to replace the Croatian in the squad.

The 31-year-old’s absence – not to mention that of our No.4 – has been keenly felt this season with Jurgen Klopp forced to convert Fabinho into a makeshift centre-back.

Continued fitness concerns around Joel Matip have meant that Liverpool have had to rely on some interesting solutions in the meantime from utilising Academy graduates alongside our Brazilian midfielder to pulling Jordan Henderson into the heart of defence.

We’re keeping our fingers crossed that the Cameroonian will be available for the pivotal top-of-the-table clash with Manchester United this afternoon though we’ve no doubt Klopp would have loved to have been able to call on Lovren for the tie.

Both Apple and Southern Company which is Alabama Power’s parent company are founding partners with the Southern Company Foundation and Apple each contributing $25 million to the effort.

“We know inequities exist in our society and it’s up to each of us to be more intentional in our efforts to make a difference and bridge the gap” said Southern Company CEO Tom Fanning. “We know more must be done and the establishment of the Propel Center is another important demonstration of Southern Company fulfilling our commitment to move our communities to a more equitable future. Partnering with Apple in this initiative is an exciting way to connect future leaders with these critical resources.”

“We’re proud to partner with Southern Company on this groundbreaking new project to build a global hub for innovation and learning for the entire HBCU community” said Lisa Jackson Apple vice president of environment policy and social initiatives. “This important effort builds on our long-standing collaboration to advance educational equity and we are thrilled to be working together to help HBCU faculty create best-in-class curriculum and ensure their students have access to cutting-edge skills and opportunities.”

The $25 million investment from the Southern Company Foundation will help grow Black entrepreneurship and provide much-needed technology resources to the workforce of the future. This commitment is part of the $50 million multiyear initiative Southern Company and its subsidiaries announced in 2020 to provide scholarships internships leadership development access to technology and innovation to support career readiness for students attending select HBCUs within the Southern Company system’s service footprint in Alabama Mississippi Georgia North Carolina Tennessee and Virginia.

“We are incredibly encouraged by the future possibilities presented through our support of HBCUs” said Chris Womack president of Georgia Power. “By investing in better outcomes we create new opportunities for the students of today to become the leaders of a more prosperous tomorrow.”

Propel is both a physical and virtual campus that is designed to provide HBCUs with shared resources to support their work of preparing leaders to improve the world. Via a physical campus and digital learning tools students from 100-plus HBCUs will be able to connect with the brightest minds in the world through one-of-a-kind global opportunities. The students will also be able to connect with each other – a key component as they become more civic-minded leaders and entrepreneurs of tomorrow.

“Tech jobs offer lucrative salaries and among the best opportunities for growth yet the workforce in the nation’s top firms still does not reflect the country’s diverse population” said Dr. David A. Thomas president of Morehouse College. “Black and Hispanic professionals continue to be underrepresented in STEM (science technology engineering and math) careers. What students need are more opportunities at the college level to show and grow their skills in coding programming and data analysis in partnership with industry leaders. Apple and Southern Company are committed to developing the talent found at HBCUs and are committing resources to help improve diversity in STEM.”

Miles College in Fairfield near Birmingham is part of the partnership with Propel Center and will collaborate with the center and other HBCUs to bring leadership and career development programming to its students.

“We look forward to being an active contributor to this groundbreaking center of learning and opportunity for Miles College students” Miles College President Bobbie Knight said.

Propel’s physical campus will be in Atlanta at the Atlanta University Center a consortium made up of Clark Atlanta University Morehouse College Morehouse School of Medicine Morris Brown and Spelman College. Southern Company will serve as the energy partner for the construction of the building ensuring it is sustainable and environmentally friendly.

“The Propel Center will be a tremendous asset to Atlanta’s thriving HBCU community and will advance the mission of these institutions in the United States and around the world” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. “Thank you to Apple and Southern Company for investing in our youth and our communities. We are honored to join you in this monumental effort.”

The Propel Center continues the work that was established by Alabama Power and Apple in February 2020 with the launch of Birmingham’s Ed Farm an education initiative supported by the Alabama Power Foundation. Ed Farm aims to equip educators and communities in Alabama with innovative tools and strategies that support active learning for all students. Among Ed Farm’s goals: to increase educational equity improve learning outcomes through technology and prepare the future tech workforce.

Anthony Oni vice president Southern Company Gas who is the founder and chairman of Ed Farm designed the Propel initiative to advance collaboration and innovation at HBCUs. He will continue to work on the project going forward actively engaging with academic and institutional partners.

“These investments are critical as we begin to truly scale Black innovation ecosystems” Oni said. “By leveraging technology and partnerships to connect students with unique learning opportunities we can lift up the talent that already exists at these institutions of higher learning and accelerate their development. In doing so we will have a hand in shaping the workforce of the future – and the leaders of tomorrow.”

“Ed Farm’s foresight to bring together this collaboration will forever impact opportunities for our students as innovators in the future workforce” added Miles College’s Knight. “The Propel Center exemplifies the sincere commitment of our partners Apple and Southern Company to value the cultivation of the HBCU graduate.”

Yoe Fire Co. and Rescue Fire Co. No. 1 in Dallastown recently merged to form Southern Area Fire and Emergency Rescue or SAFER.

""We’ve always worked very close with Dallastown so ... it was a natural fit"" said Barry Myers former chief and president of Yoe Fire Co. and the new president of SAFER.

Both companies will continue operating out of their respective stations Myers said and in May they will officially go online at York County 911 as Station 13-1 and Station 13-2.

The combined company has 20 to 25 active members Myers said.

Two other volunteer fire companies in the region — York Township Fire Co. and Goodwill Fire Co. No. 1 in Jacobus — chose not to merge with Yoe and Dallastown but the option is always there if they change their minds in the future Myers said.

Myers has been with Yoe Fire Company for 44 years and served as chief for about 20 of those years.

In the early days there were so many volunteers at Yoe that when a fire call went out Myers said there wasn't enough room on the trucks for everyone who responded.

Business owners who were volunteers would shut down their shops and race to the fire company he said.

But as people got older retired from their businesses or moved out of the area the number of active volunteers waned.

""Unfortunately the volunteer fire side I don’t care where it’s at — it’s a dying breed"" Myers said.

York County's fire companies are not alone in the struggle.

Pennsylvania's volunteer firefighter ranks decreased from about 300000 volunteers in the 1970s to about 38000 in 2018 according to a state legislative report released in 2018.

Depleted ranks and lack of funds have led to many companies merging and regional consolidation has become familiar territory in York County in recent years.

In late 2019 Leo Independent Fire Engine Co. No. 1 in Red Lion and Union Volunteer Fire Co. in Felton merged to form Alliance Fire and Rescue Services.

Fire departments in Springettsbury and Spring Garden townships merged in 2007 to form York Area United Fire and Rescue and Manchester Township became a third chartered municipality in 2018.

Franklintown Community Fire Co. and Citizens’ Hose Co. of Dillsburg merged in 2018 to form Northern York County Fire Rescue.

And in 2017 Jackson Township's two volunteer fire companies Nashville Fire Co. and Lincoln Fire Co. merged to become Nashville Volunteer Fire Co.

York Township Commissioner George W.W. Jones Jr. said the merger between the Yoe and Dallastown companies both of which serve York Township will allow them to combine their costs for training and equipment and expand the ranks of their membership.

I remember it well. It was my first day as a trainman on Southern Railway of British Columbia in June 2006 and I was nervous. I had just landed a dream job fresh out of high school and while I had been a railfan for my entire life I quickly learned that meant nothing in the world of railroading. I was told to bring all appropriate personal protective equipment including a hardhat. As I sat in the crew room a grizzly engineer walked in looked at me and my hardhat and said “That’ll really help when a boxcar falls on your head!”

More than a decade later thankfully no boxcars have fallen on my head. At first it was a steep learning curve but I’ve progressed to become an experienced conductor and locomotive engineer. It has been a whirlwind of a career but my favorite part has been working with a small group of unique individuals many of whom I consider my closest friends.

Much like the people who operate the railway SRY is incredibly distinctive. Based in New Westminster B.C. the railway is owned by Washington Companies (which also owns Montana Rail Link) and operates on nearly 125 miles of track stretching through the Lower Mainland and scenic Fraser Valley. Perhaps the railway’s most impressive attribute though is its adaptability particularly given the company was established well over 100 years ago as a passenger-focused railway.

Interurban Origins

In 1897 several interurban and street railway systems operating in Vancouver Victoria and New Westminster were combined into British Columbia Electric Railway. The railroad grew eventually reaching Chilliwack in 1910. The railroad also leased the Canadian Pacific-built Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway a north-south route through Vancouver connecting the island city of Richmond. While its primary focus was moving people the growing Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley produced plenty of freight traffic too.

The railway flourished until the 1940s when automobiles and highways proved more attractive to passengers. The final blow came in 1958 when the last remaining interurban route between Marpole and Steveston closed; however the freight business remained. Three years after the last interurban ran the freight operation was absorbed by the crown corporation British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (BC Hydro). The railroad’s locomotives operated with a distinct yellow and red paint scheme with the company’s logo.

The 1980s were the most turbulent time in the railway’s history. First CP resumed operations on the 22-mile Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway after nearly an 80-year lease with the railway. Then in 1988 BC Hydro sold the railway. Itel Rail Group a U.S.-owned division of Itel Corp purchased it and renamed it Southern Railway of British Columbia. The company kept the red white and blue livery BC Hydro had introduced shortly before the sale (which had replaced the yellow and red scheme). But the new owners were not well received and the employees went on a strike within a year after the company tried to change its pension program. Six years later Itel sold the railroad to Washington Companies which soon painted all the equipment (mostly SW900s MP15s and SD38s) into blue and black like its other railroad Montana Rail Link. Nearly all of SRY’s present motive power is original to the railroad except for some GP9s from MRL and Canadian Pacific…

On a 5 a.m. flight from New York to Dallas he sat in the window seat and spying an open exit row aisle she sat down beside him. She assumed they’d have an empty middle perfect for the 1381 mile journey.

However Bonny Andrews a pastor from India visiting to start a new ministry sat between them in the middle seat – and struck up a conversation. At 5. A. M.

The three ended up talking the entire flight about their faiths families childhood and current life experiences. About two hours into the conversation Michael and Cathlyn realized that Michael’s aunt and uncle live next door to her family in Austin. After the three parted ways Cathlyn texted her mother to tell her she had just met her future husband. And as luck would have it at that same moment Michael texted his sister saying he just met his future wife.

A week later they had their first date. A year later he proposed inside of the very first Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-200 (which was almost a DC-9) at the Frontiers of Flight Museum in Dallas.

The couple was married at the end of 2020 in Austin – by seat opponent Bonny Andrews – and with a guest from Southwest in attendance.

There were plane motifs throughout the entire night including plane snacks and marshalling wands.”

It's been less than two weeks since Washington DC was rocked by an assault on the US Capitol Building as rioters attempted to prevent the certification of the Electoral College. Now as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to be sworn into office on Wednesday airlines are doing their part.

New security measures are being implemented on flights to and from the nation's capital starting this weekend with the hopes of preventing another day of violence. Airlines are keen not to repeat the mistakes of last week as the days surrounding the Capitol riots saw increased tensions in the nation's skies.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""These new security measures are more extensive and stringent compared to those implemented after 9/11"" industry analyst Henry Harteveldt of Atmosphere Research Group told Insider.

Delta Air Lines has already banned six passengers who had been harassing Utah Senator Mitt Romney and running afoul of the airline's face mask rule. The senator was accosted in the airport terminal and endured chants of ""traitor"" while in the air for opposing President Donald Trump.

Rioters were also able to board flights home amidst the chaos of the last week despite the best efforts of local authorities to stop them from boarding flights. Onboard disturbances were a reoccurring theme as Phoenix-bound American Airlines plane erupted in ""USA"" chants while non-compliance with mask requirements saw Alaska Airlines ban 14 passengers.

Here's how airlines are doing their part to protect the inauguration.

No weapons allowed

All major US airlines that fly to Washington's two area airports will prohibit passengers from transporting firearms in their checked luggage in the days surrounding the inauguration on flights to and from the region. That list includes American Airlines Delta Air Lines United Airlines JetBlue Airways Alaska Airlines Frontier Airlines and Southwest Airlines.

Each airline is different in its restrictions but some include other area airports as far away as Baltimore/Washington International in Maryland and Richmond International in Virginia. Unloaded legal firearms are typically allowed to be transported in checked baggage as long as they are in a locked case.

Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air are banning firearms on flights to Baltimore as the airlines do not fly to either of Washington's local airports.

Harteveldt said he doesn't recall any firearms restrictions on flights to Washington following the September 11 2001 attacks.

Some airlines are allowing those passengers who had planned on transporting firearms will be allowed to change their flights free of charge and allowing exemptions for law enforcement and active-duty military personnel.

Alaska Airlines will require passengers to stay seated on the first hour of a flight from Washington or Baltimore or the last hour of a flight when arriving in the two cities.

The policy builds upon a safety measure enacted after the 2001 terrorist attacks where passengers couldn't get out of their seats when within 30 minutes of Washington on a flight to or from National Airport. Alaska's policy adds an additional 30 minutes to the 9/11-era rule and expands it to Dulles International and Baltimore/Washington International Harteveldt told Insider.

""I do recall taking a shuttle flight from LaGuardia to National when the policy was in effect"" Harteveldt said. ""The gate agent reminded us of the restriction several times before boarding and encouraged passengers to use the restrooms before boarding due to the short flight which would require we be seated for its duration.""

""Onboard the flight attendants said that we couldn't even stand up to retrieve or place something in the overhead bin and told us that if we needed something such as a computer bag to let them know"" Harteveldt said.

No other airline has enacted a similar policy.

A temporary prohibition movement on flights

American Airlines will not be serving alcohol on its flights to and from Washington and Baltimore between January 16 and January 21 a spokesperson told Insider. This policy was also enacted in the days surrounding last week's riots.

The airline currently doesn't sell alcohol in economy; rather alcoholic drinks are only served to first class passengers on most domestic flights. Airlines have largely stopped serving alcohol in economy as a result of the pandemic.

Harteveldt told Insider that no such restrictions were enacted post-9/11 and no other airline told Insider that alcohol sales would be put on hold.

Limiting ticket sales on DC-bound flights

Alaska Airlines will be limiting ticket sales on its flight to Washington and Baltimore to stem the flow of travelers to the region. The inauguration has gone mostly virtual as concerns of a super-spreader event have prompted authorities to warn against travel.

""To support law enforcement's calls to avoid travel to the area we will limit the number of tickets purchased on flights to and from the DC metro area"" the airline said in a statement.

No other airline has told Insider that they would be limiting ticket sales. The Seattle-based airline flies to Washington and Baltimore from Seattle Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Ensuring mask compliance

Mask enforcement will be a top priority on flights to and from the region multiple airlines told Insider after onboard incidents following the Capitol riots involved passengers defying mask-wearing policies.

The number of passengers banned by airlines for not wearing masks only increased in the days following the Capitol riots. A single Alaska flight saw 14 passengers banned for non-compliance while United banned 60 passengers during the week of January 4 alone a spokesperson told Insider.

Sun Country Airlines which doesn't currently fly to Washington also reported an uptick in mask incidents following last week. American will update its pre-departure announcements to stress the importance of wearing a mask while flying.

Airlines have been tough on mask enforcement as wearing a covering has been proven by the Department of Defense and Harvard School of Public Health studies to curb the onboard spread of coronavirus and airlines don't want to jeopardize the fragile recovery by appearing lax on enforcement. Currently the only exception is for actively eating and drinking.

Most airlines will remove passengers from the banned list once the pandemic is over and the rule is no longer in effect unless the banned person commits another offense that warrants a longer ban.

Support from the federal government

To top it off the Federal Aviation Administration is continuing to warn passengers that any unruly behavior can result in jail time and a fine of up to $35000. Administrator Steve Dickson on Wednesday also enacted a zero-tolerance policy through March 30 2021 that could land flyers in legal trouble.

""Effective immediately however the FAA will not address these cases with warnings or counseling"" the FAA said in a statement. ""The agency will pursue legal enforcement action against any passenger who assaults threatens intimidates or interferes with airline crew members""

Wearing a mask is currently not required by federal law but the FAA has brought civil charges against passengers who have refused to cooperate with airline mask policies. The strongest punishment recommended by the FAA in those charges is a $15000 fine for a passenger who the agency says ""screamed obscenities at and hit a flight attendant"" before grabbing a phone the flight attendant was using to talk to the pilot and causing the flight to divert.

Lisa Eisenhart 56 of Woodstock Georgia was taken into custody by the FBI in Nashville on Saturday on charges relating to the U.S. Capitol riots according to the Office of the U.S. Attorney Middle District of Tennessee.

Charges include conspiring with her son Eric Munchel to violate federal statutes according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

Eisenhart will appear before a judge in Nashville on Tuesday.

Law-enforcement database information also show Eisenhart's aliases include Lisa Marie Gavelek. Munchel's middle name is Gavelek.

A further search of law-enforcement databases revealed that Munchel and Eisenhart had a common physical address in Fort Myers and a common post-office box address in Blue Ridge Georgia.

Munchel 30 is believed by authorities to be the ""zip tie guy"" whose picture was among those circulated around the country following the Capitol invasion.

A photograph purported to be Munchel shows him dressed in combat gear jumping over a railing in the Capitol holding a handful of the ties which are used by police officers when detaining suspects.

According to U.S. District Court documents during investigation law-enforcement agents discovered that Munchel flew on Southwest Airlines from Nashville Tennessee to Fort Myers in March 2020 and the flight was booked by a person named Lisa Eisenhart.

Investigators said Eisenhart has the exact name and same date of birth as the individual who rented room from the Grand Hyatt from Jan. 4 to 7 and who was seen in security and other video together with Munchel during that time.

Munchel was listed as a resident of Reflection Cove Drive in the sprawling Reflection Lakes community and as a registered voter in Fort Myers as recently as November Lee County voter records show.

Eisenhart currently holds an active registered nurse license in Georgia expiring in 2022 and has had similar RN and related medical licenses in Florida California Georgia Washington and Texas.

Lee County court records also show Eisenhart with two court actions in Florida. Both were traffic infractions one a January 2014 ticket for failure to obey a traffic control device and the second an October 2015 ticket for refusing to obey traffic laws and she paid a $161 fine for each offense.

Authorities believe Eisenhart and Munchel ""knowingly and willfully joined a mob of individuals to forcibly enter the U.S. Capitol with the intent to cause a civil disturbance"" an arrest warrant includes.

There is video that authorities believe shows Eisenhart and Munchel in the U.S. Capitol together which includes being in the vicinity of a mob that attacked two police officers according to an arrest warrant.

Eisenhart's arrest affidavit also said that video footage eventually shows officers run past Eisenhart and Munchel with members of the mob pursuing them. Right after they pass Eisenhart and Munchel immediately follow the individuals pursuing the officers.

The warrant states both were holding flex cuffs in the Capitol. Eisenhart while leaning over a banister appears to shout at officers as they escaped the warrant states.

The arrest affidavit also reported an encounter between law enforcement and Munchel on Jan. 6 at the Grand Hyatt where he was seen wearing black camouflage pants and a black holster containing what looked like a handgun.

The affidavit also shows surveillance video and photos of Munchel and Eisenhart together at the hotel as well as walking the Capitol grounds prior to the attack.

""Law-enforcement authorities interviewed Munchel and identified that he was carrying a black and yellow “Taser Pulse” that emits electrical shock"" the affidavit reads. ""Munchel told authorities that he participated in the rally at the U.S. Capitol earlier that day and that he possessed the taser for self-protection.""

The documents also say that authorities searched Munchel's home in Nashville and reported finding ""similar if not the same"" clothing that he allegedly wore inside the Senate chambers as well as ""five pairs of white flex cuffs""

Munchel had previously been arrested and charged with entering restricted building or grounds and violent entry and disorderly conduct.

Now Munchel and Eisenhart are charged with conspiring to impede or attempting to impede law enforcement officers during a civil disorder knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives.

Global Cost Reduction Program Supporting Gross Margin Expansion

The Company continued executing a series of initiatives that are expected to generate $1.5 billion of pre-tax run-rate cost savings by the end of 2024 growing to $2 billion by the end of 2025. Of the $2 billion savings $1.5 billion is expected to be delivered through a supply chain transformation that leverages strategic sourcing drives operational excellence consolidates facilities and optimizes the distribution network and reduces complexity of the product portfolio.

These actions are expected to return adjusted gross margins* to historical 35%+ levels. Additionally the Global Cost Reduction Program is expected to optimize the Company's cost base to fund investments that accelerate growth in core businesses.

The Global Cost Reduction Program generated incremental pre-tax run-rate cost savings in first quarter 2024 of $145 million. Since inception of the program in mid-2022 the Company has generated approximately $1.2 billion in pre-tax run-rate savings and reduced inventory by $1.9 billion.

2024 Outlook

Patrick D. Hallinan Executive Vice President and CFO commented ""The actions we are taking to advance our strategic transformation are progressing successfully and despite the tepid market backdrop so far in 2024 our profitability remains on an upward trajectory. We will continue our disciplined approach to cost management as we drive toward our target of 35%+ adjusted gross margins* while funding additional organic revenue growth* investments. The organization is focused on delivering margin expansion cash generation and balance sheet strength while working together to position the Company for long-term growth and value creation.""

Management is reiterating 2024 guidance and expects EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $2.85 on a GAAP basis adjusted EPS* between $3.50 to $4.50 and free cash flow* to approximate $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion.

The difference between 2024 GAAP and adjusted EPS* guidance is approximately $1.65 to $1.90 consisting primarily of charges related to the supply chain transformation under the Global Cost Reduction Program.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

SBUX,Starbucks,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL3N0YXJidWNrcy1yZXdhcmRzLXN0YXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guide To Maximizing Starbucks Rewards Stars,"The offer for the Starbucks® Rewards Visa® Credit Card has expired. Learn more about the current offers here

A few days ago I wrote a detailed review of the Starbucks® Rewards Visa® Card. I briefly talked about how to redeem Starbucks Rewards Stars though after publishing the post a colleague of mine made me aware of the fact that there was so much more I could be doing to maximize my Stars.

For example did you know you a caffe misto with 12 shots of espresso six pumps of syrup and cocoa powder costs the same number of Starbucks Stars as a plain cup of coffee? Okay the former admittedly sounds horrifying but the point is that the possibilities are endless. 😉

I’ve been down a Starbucks Rewards rabbit hole the past few days and I kind of love it. I love learning the ins-and-outs of loyalty programs — while I usually focus on travel loyalty programs there are some really cool aspects to the Starbucks Rewards program.

Now I think context is important — I’m not the world’s biggest Starbucks fan. Rather I sometimes go to Starbucks because the product is consistent and ordering is easy. My usual order is a cold brew to drink and a spinach feta wrap to eat.

What is Starbucks Rewards?

Starbucks Rewards is Starbucks’ rewards program. “Stars” are the rewards currency of the program and you can earn them through purchases at Starbucks stores or through Starbucks’ co-branded credit card.

What makes Starbucks Rewards more exciting than some other loyalty programs? Well the program isn’t strictly revenue based but rather has a rewards chart where you can get a wildly different dollar value for your Stars depending on how you redeem them.

I love how there are drinks that cost $3 and drinks that cost $15 that both require the same number of Stars for a redemption.

How can you earn Starbucks Rewards Stars?

There are several ways you can earn Starbucks Stars:

Earn 2x Starbucks Stars per dollar spent at Starbucks when you pay with a prepaid digital Starbucks Card (you can load funds onto this from your credit card and there’s no cost to join — make sure you use a credit card offering bonus rewards on dining since Starbucks qualifies as that)

Earn 1x Starbucks Stars per dollar spent at Starbucks when using any other payment method (you just have to scan your Starbucks Rewards account separately from your payment method)

Earn Starbucks Stars for spending on the Starbucks Rewards Visa Card; for example you can earn up to 4800 Stars when you sign-up for the card and complete qualifying activities and then can earn up to 1x Stars per dollar spent

To maximize your Stars you should always be using a registered Starbucks Card for your Starbucks spending with a preloaded balance. Furthermore Starbucks sometimes has double Stars days where members can earn 4x Starbucks Stars for spending rather than 2x Stars.

Do Starbucks Stars expire?

Starbucks Stars expire six months after the month in which they were earned. In other words if you earn Stars on January 15 2020 they’d expire on August 1 2021. Note that if you have the Starbucks Rewards Visa Card then all the Stars that you earn don’t expire so that gives you quite a bit more flexibility.

How can you redeem Starbucks Rewards Stars?

Starbucks Rewards has five different redemption rates ranging from 25 to 400 Stars per item. Here’s how much you can expect to pay:

Redeem 25 Starbucks Stars to customize your drink — this includes an espresso shot dairy substitute or a syrup

to customize your drink — this includes an espresso shot dairy substitute or a syrup Redeem 50 Starbucks Stars to get a brewed hot coffee bakery item or hot tea

to get a brewed hot coffee bakery item or hot tea Redeem 150 Starbucks Stars to get a handcrafted drink hot breakfast sandwich oatmeal or your favorite drink

to get a handcrafted drink hot breakfast sandwich oatmeal or your favorite drink Redeem 200 Starbucks Stars to get a salad sandwich or protein box

to get a salad sandwich or protein box Redeem 400 Starbucks Stars to get select merchandise or at-home coffee

Tips for maximizing Starbucks Stars

When it comes time to redeem Starbucks Stars there are some general things to keep in mind:

The redemption cost is the same regardless of what size drink you order so in general order a venti rather than a tall when redeeming Stars

Be aware of the free add-ons you can include with some redemptions which I’ll talk more about below; this is really the key to maximizing your Starbucks Stars

Be strategic about the items in each category that you redeem for; for example both an almond croissant and petite vanilla bean scone cost 50 Stars but the former costs 160% more when paying cash (screenshot below)

Starbucks Rewards members can receive free refills of hot or iced brewed coffee or tea during the same store visit whether paying with cash or redeeming Starbucks Stars so this is a great way to maximize your value

The Starbucks Rewards caffe misto sweet spot

My colleague made me aware of the website Starbucks Hacker and I love it. The website goes into the ins-and-outs of the Starbucks Rewards program as much as I go into the details of frequent flyer programs.

This also taught me what’s probably the single best use of Starbucks Rewards Stars:

50 Starbucks Stars is near the lower end of the redemption options and it gets you a brewed hot coffee bakery item or hot tea

A caffe misto is half brewed coffee and half steamed milk and that costs just 50 Starbucks Stars

Meanwhile a latte would cost 150 Stars which is three times as much

If you redeem for a caffe misto you can add espresso shots syrups and more to the drink at no extra cost. A venti caffe misto costs $3.65 or 50 Stars.

But that’s kind of boring no? Let’s make some modifications…

How about we add in four espresso shots some pumps of syrup some cocoa powder and some almond milk foam? This would still only cost 50 Stars while the cash cost would be over $10.

My colleague ordered one of these yesterday and said it actually tasted good. Personally I feel kind of sick even looking at the order as much as I love the value of this on paper.

So you could also take it easy on the syrups but still get significantly more value. If you order enough espresso shots in one drink then I think your coffee with milk actually becomes a full-on latte.

I’m an old fashioned guy — leave out all the syrups I think I’ll just take a 12 shot caffe misto which would retail for over $15 (warning: proceed at your own risk). 😉

To be clear I’m not at all suggesting that this is what anyone should actually order. Rather I’m just having fun with all of this and playing around with the possibilities.

What about the Starbucks free birthday reward?

One other great perks of the program is that Starbucks Rewards members receive a free reward on their birthday ever year:

This is automatically loaded to your account and is only valid on the date of your birthday

You can have either a handcrafted beverage food item or ready-to-drink bottled beverage

To qualify you must have signed up for Starbucks Rewards at least seven days prior to your birthday and make at least one Star-earning transaction prior to your birthday every year

You can use similar strategies to the above for maximizing your Starbucks birthday reward. However you can just go straight for the handcrafted beverage because any eligible drink is covered.

How much are Starbucks Stars worth?

It’s hard to give a concrete answer as to how much Starbucks Stars are worth:

Everyone likes to redeem for different things

Pricing varies based on the location

There’s a difference between what you can order to get the most value per Starbucks Star and what you might actually want to order; in other words adding 12 espresso shots to a drink is possible but it’s probably not advisable

In trying to come up with a valuation let’s pick items at random from some of these categories (I’m going off of Miami pricing here):

A venti blonde roast usually costs $3 and requires 50 Starbucks Stars; that’s a value of 6.0 cents per Starbucks Star

An almond croissant usually costs $3.50 and requires 50 Starbucks Stars; that’s a value of 7.0 cents per Starbucks Star

A spinach feta and egg white wrap usually costs $4.50 and requires 150 Starbucks Stars; that’s a value of 3.0 cents per Starbucks Star

A venti cold brew usually costs $4.50 and requires 150 Starbucks Stars; that’s a value of 3.0 cents per Starbucks Star

A venti latte usually costs $5.50 and requires 150 Starbucks Stars; that’s a value of 3.7 cents per Starbucks Star

A grilled chicken and hummus protein box usually costs $7 and requires 200 Starbucks Stars; that’s a value of 3.5 cents per Starbucks Star

A chicken & quinoa protein bowl usually costs $9 and requires 200 Starbucks Stars; that’s a value of 4.5 cents per Starbucks Star

A bag of veranda blend beans usually costs $14 and requires 400 Starbucks Stars; that’s a value of 3.5 cents per Starbucks Star

This is just a random selection of items without any sort of add-ons. As you can see we’re looking at anywhere from 3.0-7.0 cents of value per Starbucks Star. Based on that personally I’d conservatively value Starbucks Stars at somewhere in the range of 4-5 cents each.

Bottom line

I love loyalty programs of all kinds and particular ones where there are ways to get outsized value. While Starbucks Rewards is hardly as lucrative as an airline frequent flyer program I’ve had a lot of fun playing around with it given all the creative redemption opportunities.

Redemption values vary significantly so it’s worth at least putting some thought into how you redeem your Starbucks Stars.

To summarize my Starbucks Rewards advice:

The 50 Stars category is the sweet spot whether you’re redeeming for a coffee or a bakery item; generally items costing 150 Stars aren’t 3x as expensive if paying cash

The absolute best value is ordering a caffe misto with some modifications; this is a way to live the latte lifestyle on a coffee budget 😉

If you don’t want to go totally overboard with modifications at a minimum ordering drinks with additional espresso shots is a way to get more value; maybe don’t order a drink with 12 shots though

Unfortunately my go-to Starbucks orders only get me three cents of value per Star so I need to do better. I guess I’ll be trying a caffe misto on my next visit to Starbucks. 😉

Anyone have any other tips for maximizing the Starbucks Rewards program? What’s your go-to reward redemption?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzE2L2JldHRlci1idXktbmlrZS12cy1zdGFyYnVja3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Nike vs. Starbucks,"Which of these consumer favorites should you add to your portfolio?

One way for many investors to improve their returns while lowering their risk is to focus on companies that have a long track record of delivering great products to consumers. Nike (NKE 1.31%) and Starbucks (SBUX -0.29%) with their powerful brands belong in a rare group that have been consumer darlings for a long time.

Owning shares in both companies over the past decade would have been a winning move. At recent prices Nike shares are up 566% since early 2011 while Starbucks shares aren't far behind at 524%.

But investors can't rely on the past as a decent guide for the future. Let's see which one of these businesses is deserving of a place in your portfolio for the next decade.

The leader in sports apparel

Nike's business took a major hit from the coronavirus pandemic in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2020 (which ended May 31) as revenue fell 38% and the company posted a loss of $790 million due to worldwide store closures. But Nike has recovered nicely thanks to its digital infrastructure and impressive gains in China. In the second quarter of its fiscal 2021 (which ended Nov. 30) e-commerce sales jumped 84% while the Greater China segment recorded 24% revenue growth.

This resulted in overall quarterly revenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rising 9% and 11% respectively over the prior-year period. Nike's resiliency is on full display and management's investments in technology are paying off. ""Innovation has always been our life blood at NIKE"" CEO John Donahoe said on the most recent earnings call.

Nike's desire to utilize technology to connect more with consumers is working. Its different digital applications are resonating extremely well. For example the SNKRS app which gives shoe fanatics access to new product releases and upcoming events hit $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2020. Donahoe believes SNKRS ""remains one of Nike's greatest competitive advantages.""

Technology is clearly becoming an increasingly important tool to drive higher brand recognition and engagement and Nike is riding this trend. The business has returned to growth following the pandemic's disruption and its impressive performance in e-commerce and in China indicate the company's long run isn't over.

The king of caffeinated beverages

Starbucks also suffered a setback due to the coronavirus but its business has not fully returned to pre-pandemic levels. Sales in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2020 (which ended Sept. 27) were 8.1% lower than the prior-year period. Despite this management still strongly believes in the company's long-term growth story.

Starbucks held its biennial investor day in December where CFO Patrick Grismer announced that he thinks Starbucks ""will reach approximately 55000 stores across 100 markets by the year 2030."" Although those of us in the U.S. view Starbucks' stores as ubiquitous this may not really be the case globally. Investors welcomed the news -- the stock popped 5% after the virtual event.

With nearly 33000 locations today this is quite an ambitious target and it would make Starbucks the largest food and beverage chain in the world. Similar to Nike Starbucks will rely on China for much of this growth. Fueled by openings of the Starbucks Now concept which are smaller-format retail outlets located in high-traffic areas the company is forecasted to have 6000 stores (up from the current 4700) in the country by the end of fiscal 2022.

Starbucks is also known for its outstanding rewards program. The company ended the most recent quarter with 19.3 million 90-day active members in the U.S. a 10% increase compared to the prior-year period. What's more remarkable is that these customers accounted for close to 50% of revenue. It's apparent that Starbucks like Nike has benefited greatly from using technology in its business model.

The final verdict

Nike and Starbucks were forced to shutter locations worldwide because of the coronavirus pandemic and have since recovered at different rates. Nike's business is back in growth mode while Starbucks improves with each passing quarter.

I think long-term investors would gain by adding both companies to their portfolios. These are two global businesses with exceptional brands that sell products consumers absolutely love. Furthermore it's evident that their growth will be bolstered by the smart use of technology to acquire and engage customers as well as continued progress in China.

But if I had to choose I'd give the slight edge to Starbucks simply due to valuation.

The process started as soon as Trump announced his first run for the presidency. His agitations then shifted into higher gear when like a bat out of hell blue and red became as far away on the color spectrum as any two colors can be. That's the nature of Trump: he drives everything into opposite extremes. He's a virus that infects minds into believing dualities — if you're not for me you're my enemy.

Masking became a political symbol and with the aid of America's denier-in-chief and some of his supporters COVID-19 caused ICUs to fill-up restaurant workers to lose jobs and gravediggers to work overtime. But this is how the nature of belief works. Facts are puny in the face of belief. That's the nature of mind. There are more connections going up to the frontal lobes from the limbic system the emotional center of the brain than the other way around. Trump poured accelerant on an all-too natural dormant but smoldering inclination of mind.

The mind of Trump and his loyal legions

Trump supporters are largely made up of three groups of people: people who just want to hit out at the world people whose only concern is their wealth and people who feel they have been marginalized by the traditional powers that be — and perceive Trump as poking a finger in the eyes of those who have slighted them. This last group — mostly folks from more rural areas who are blue collar and don't have college degrees — experiences Main Street and Wall Street as opposite seats of a seesaw: One side's up and theirs is down … for far too long.

Income inequality is a heavy burden to bear when you're the one worrying about where your next meal or paycheck is coming from. And fear can plays havoc with one's cognitive capabilities. Fear limits one's vision to ""now"" and feelings of humiliation have no half-life as we know from places such as Kosovo. We all are sometimes prone to what cognitive science calls ""confirmation bias"" — that is accepting information or twisting input so it coincides with one's own already established beliefs. The idiom that ""seeing is believing"" is not quite true. It would be more precise to say ""believing is seeing."" It's typical that this ""blinder"" mentality is increased when a person is under stress.

Trump is full of rage and likes to hate. As such he instinctively tapped into an undercurrent of resentment in a big part of the U.S. population. But something that is not often addressed in understanding the Trump interval is that it's easy — too easy — for us humans to cast ""the other"" as part of a hateful lot. We can quickly go from seeing a ""stranger"" to ""I really don't like you"" with the speed of a symbolic association made by the mind. It takes little time and effort.

Emotion and symbolic connections — not literal objective or rational ones — rule the cognitive roost. What we believe is largely a matter of temperament worldview biology and biography. And therein lies the rest of the story which is as old as our species. To describe how easy it is for hate to take hold in a mind we can turn from the importance of presidential politics and look at a more mundane context: how Dunkin' Donuts loyalists and Starbucks loyalists make each other into ""its"" and not ""thous.""

Even Starbucks and Dunkin' loyalists can hate each other

I am a cognitive anthropologist and I study how people ""make meaning."" I've cast a primal eye on politics business health care technology and on how everyday products are marketed. I've studied primitive warlike tribes in Amazonia street gangs in New York and Rio de Janeiro and schoolyard fights in America and Britain. I've studied how a person can think his or her God is supreme and all others are a fraud. The same goes for people who like Coke but not Pepsi or vice versa.

A decade ago I undertook a project to better understand peoples' experience of the morning. I've always been interested in beginnings and endings; they tell you a lot about the middle. So I decided to look at how people relate to their morning coffee. During a two-week period I paid Starbucks lovers and Dunkin' Donuts lovers to only go for morning coffee to the brand store (or that store-bought brand they have at home) that they usually do not choose. In return I asked them to write me a daily diary about what they felt about their temporary brand switch. After the two-week period I asked them to come in to be interviewed by me sometimes individually and sometimes in groups of people who loved one brand or the other.

I soon realized that what had started out as something like an applied marketing project turned out to be a study in tribalism. Looking back on that work now it seems to reflect a similar dynamic that we have seen recently on the airwaves and in the streets of America — the clash between MAGA caps and those who look at them and shake their heads in disbelief.

Dualities obliterate complexity

Tribes can be defined by differences of membership displays of dress language and rituals and also by more abstract things such as time perception and narrative tropes. Each tribe has different beliefs about self and about how the world works. It turns out that Dunkin' Donuts lovers and Starbucks lovers exhibit such differences and as all tribes have a tendency to do they exaggerate differences by painting the out-group as ""bad.""

Dunkin' lovers seem overly annoyed by Starbucks lovers calling a small cup of coffee a ""tall"" and describing skim milk with the term ""nonfat."" Dunkin' loyalists commonly relate to Starbucks lovers as ""those pretentious and pedantic jerks."" Each group complains about the other brand's store design — ""Starbucks lighting is too bright. I don't want to linger I just want my regular cup of Dunkin' not-too-strong coffee and then to get on with my morning."" Dunkin' drinkers often repeat the mantra ""It's coffee it's not rocket science."" In contrast people who like the Starbucks brew complain about Dunkin' stores being ""too bland and too dull just like its coffee."" Another big difference between the two tribes is their subjective perception of time. Dunkin' loyalists seemed to be in a rush while Starbucks-goers like to linger in the store focus on the sensual experience — taste color aroma — of their coffee and want to it match their mood. One morning they may want a double latte caramel frappuccino and the next a grande macchiato. Starbucks loyalists want things personalized. Dunkin' loyalists see that as ""obnoxious.""

The most startling observation I made after talking to these respondents and reviewing the videotape of the sessions was how very quickly both tribes segued from talking about the products to talking about who is good and who is bad. Talk about coffee blurred into talk about what I came to call ""identity struggles."" Each group came to conceive of the other as a kind of pseudo-species. I've seen a similar process take hold in both in family therapy sessions and diplomatic negotiations between American and foreign diplomats.

Dualities make complexity inadmissible so everything becomes an absolute: Black versus white red versus blue right versus wrong Dunkin' versus Starbucks. We can do that with products people and ideas. In the process nuance paradox and irony get sucked out of reality and the insight that every one of us is both fierce and fragile defiant and delicate is abandoned. Few want to hear Walt Whitman's lines: ""Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself I am large I contain multitudes.""

Donald Trump's world is made up only of dualities: If you're not for me I hate you you're my enemy. Trump's supporters perceive this as an expression of his toughness. They like that in him. It makes them feel. They find Trump's anger soothing. It confirms their own state of being. They don't know of hope as a dimension of the soul an orientation of the heart. They can't see possibility over the horizon. So eventually the storm the gates of the U.S. Capitol.

Hope

A strange but valid way to think about viruses is that adapting to the threat of a virus — even a killer virus — makes nature stronger better more evolved. Trump is a deadly virus but one that can leave us stronger once he no longer occupies the White House. For this to happen however certain other changes in how politics operates must change too.

For too long the paradigms of politics and political negotiation have avoided the basic unit of human affairs: emotion. This must change if we are to address the new challenges that modernity has put before us. Humans as humans — with all the complexity and paradox engendered by human nature and the nature of mind — must be brought into the lexicon of geopolitics as well as domestic politics. Only then can the emotional logic of humiliation and hate enter the calculus of human affairs in a way that opens the possibility of hope.

There was a glimpse of this when former Sen. George Mitchell helped to lead a peace process that culminated in the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 that brought an end to decades of conflict between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. The U.S. has engaged in peace processes with all manner of hostile foreign actors. Why not create one now focusing on ameliorating our own current civil war? Sure that might sound naive — but why not try?

This time though do it in a way that faces up to the fact that an immense capacity for patience commitment and courage is required to go beyond the stale and stifling blame-game language of dueling political tribes. It will take a new poetics of political discourse that utters what's not expected to be said. Surprise is the only thing that stands a chance of opening up and recalibrating one's familiar. We need not walk on new ground. Others have shown us examples: Vaclav Havel Mikhail Gorbachev Nelson Mandela Martin Luther King Jr. Joe Biden has big challenges ahead: the pandemic the economy racial injustice. No less important in the long run is changing the American context of duality: elites versus ""deplorables"" haves versus have-nots rural versus urban blue collar versus white collar. Abraham Lincoln's work although great is yet unfinished. The time is right to see it through.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L3Byb3Rlc3RzLXN0YXJidWNrcy1jbG9zZXMtc29tZS1uZXcteW9yay1zdG9yZXMtZHVlLXNhZmV0eS1jb25jZXJucy80MTk5Nzc1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Protests: Starbucks closes some New York stores due to safety concerns,"As a tense nation braced for possible violence in the wake of the U.S. Capitol riot Starbucks closed some New York City stores out of concern about potential protests.

""Out of an abundance of caution and in keeping partner (employee) and customer safety top of mind local leaders have made the decision to close select stores in the Manhattan area due to potential protests happening today'' the company said in a statement Sunday. ""We will resume operations tomorrow.""

National Guard troops have been dispatched to Washington D.C. and state capitals from Sacramento California to Albany New York to deal with possible violence in the days leading up to the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.

Law enforcement has said protests were being planned across the U.S. by supporters of President Donald Trump who falsely claims he was the actual winner of the presidential election.

On January 6 following a pro-Trump rally rioters attacked and ransacked the Capitol building leading to the deaths of five people.

But as of Sunday afternoon pro-Trump protests appeared to be scattered small and quiet with only a few sometimes armed demonstrators appearing outside statehouses in South Carolina Michigan and Ohio.

He planned to use St. Augustine as a platform to bring about national change for civil rights but became part of a movement that sought a local transformation. While the effort sparked obvious changes officials say work still remains.

In King's footsteps: St. Augustine-area sites connected to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Dr. Benjamin Chavis former leader of the NAACP and current president of the National Newspaper Publishers Association worked for King as a youth coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He became involved when he was 14.

King told SCLC members that ""St. Augustine Florida was a place that could help determine the future of race relations for the whole state of Florida at that time in the 1960s. It was sort of a pivotal area"" Chavis said.

Much attention was on St. Augustine during the time. While the city prepared for the 400th anniversary of its founding which included events with high-profile officials including then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson its racial tension over segregation made national headlines.

For King St. Augustine was a stage that would illustrate the importance of the proposed Civil Rights Act historian David Nolan said. At the time the national media covered stories of many non-violent civil rights activists in St. Augustine being beaten and arrested as racists pushed back against their efforts.

Ku Klux Klan members attacked peaceful protesters. People feared for their lives and livelihoods and the homes of those involved in the civil rights movement were shot up and firebombed.

Law enforcement officers also abused protesters. On Labor Day 1963 police used dogs and cattle prods to stop a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza where they arrested 27 people according to David Colburn's book about the St. Augustine civil rights movement ""Racial Change & Community Crisis.""

Local civil rights leaders sought help from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in making changes in St. Augustine according to Colburn. The group launched a massive campaign inviting college students and others nationwide to participate in sit-ins and protests throughout the city.

But the violence continued.

While visiting St. Augustine in May of 1964 a beach cottage where King stayed was sprayed with bullets but he was unharmed. In June of that year King was arrested along with other activists during a demonstration at the Monson Motor Lodge where the Bayfront Hilton is located today.

Desire for change

Some credit the widespread news coverage of protests and violence in St. Augustine with helping to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibited racial discrimination among other issues.

The St. Augustine movement included goals at the local level and beyond.

Local civil rights leaders wanted to form a biracial committee to address racial issues in the city. That effort never flourished.

The Lincolnville Museum and Cultural Center housed in a former Black high school is based in an area that became home to freed slaves in the 1860s. Part of the museum focuses on the civil rights movement and King including a fingerprint card from his arrest in St. Augustine.

150 YEARS:Despite changes Lincolnville residents still cherish the tight-knit community

The movement also focused on economic equality said Gayle Phillips executive director of the museum.

Lincolnville once had a thriving business community that met the everyday needs of Black citizens who dealt with discrimination in other parts of the city.

“The whole next phase of the civil rights movement was to be about economics and that's where St. Augustine I think failed terribly in the sense that all those Black businesses that had been here once integration came on board they pretty much disappeared"" she said.

According to Nolan's book ""The Houses of St. Augustine"" ""A leaflet put out in the 1920s by the Colored Business and Professional Men's League … included a long list of barbers cafes gas stations dry cleaners drug stores grocers insurance agents doctors shoe repairers and undertakers mostly on Washington Street which was the main business district of Lincolnville.""

Phillips also pointed out that there is now a void of Black leadership on the city and county commissions and other leadership positions ― something King would find appalling Phillips said ― and a lack of completeness in the national narrative about St. Augustine's history.

Often overlooked is that Black people have been involved in the city since its founding Phillips said.

""The soul of the city has a big hole in it when it relates to Black people because they haven't really been portrayed as … an integral part of the fabric of what made this city this great historic place"" she said.

Some efforts have been made to tell the city's history in a more complete way including leading up to the 450th anniversary of the city's founding in 2015. City officials put together a major exhibit called ""Journey: 450 Years of the African-American Experience.""

St. Augustine has made changes over the years. In recent times the city government implemented body cameras following the protests of George Floyd's death in 2020. However the police force lacks Black representation; as of June 2020 four of the 50 officers were Black.

The City Commission also decided in 2020 to include diversity equity and inclusion as an objective in its strategic plan which is the foundation of the city's budget.

A new day

Attitudes in the city including general contempt for King among some people were slow to change over the years following the civil rights movement Nolan said.

Even in the 1980s some wouldn't support naming a street after King he said. But that eventually happened and what was Central Avenue is now Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue.

St. Augustine saw its Black population dwindle in the years that followed as businesses shut down and young people began to move away looking for a place that would offer them opportunities Nolan said.

""There was just this bitter attitude in St. Augustine (against the Black community) you know: 'You may have won that one but we're not going to lift a finger to help you'"" Nolan said.

Florida Memorial College a Black college in West Augustine whose students participated in the movement left the city in the late '60s which was another major blow to the area.

But King's efforts in St. Augustine sparked obvious progress in the city and around the country.

The civil rights movement of the '60s was upheld by young people and there are many young people seeking change today.

National and local protests over the death of George Floyd an unarmed Black man at the hands of police fueled change in St. Augustine.

Commissioners reversed course from a previous decision and voted to remove the city's Confederate memorial from the Plaza de la Constitucion. It's now at Trout Creek Fish Camp on State Road 13 North.

Chavis said the decision will have a positive impact on the city and is a step toward healing racial divisions.

""First of all by removing the Confederate symbols it says that we want a better future than the worst of the past and those symbols represented and continue to represent the worst of the past"" he said.

St. Augustine eventually went from a city where some people reviled King and other civil rights leaders to a place where people gather annually to celebrate his work and walk to the Plaza following the same route as activists decades ago.

And while there is no longer a symbol of the Confederacy standing in the city square there are monuments in the Plaza honoring civil rights activists including a ""foot soldiers"" memorial dedicated to the many people who sacrificed for the civil rights movement in St. Augustine but never received recognition by name.

That would have been unthinkable to those in power in St. Augustine back in 1964 Nolan said.

""It's a sign of St. Augustine growing up and becoming a more decent place and we are honored that he (King) came here"" Nolan said.

See where King walked

These are just a few of the places that King visited while in St. Augustine:

Monson Motor Lodge

​​​​​​One of the most famous images from the civil rights movement in St. Augustine was shot at this site when hotel owner James Brock poured acid into the whites-only pool after black activists jumped in on June 18 1964.

And before that happened King was one of several people arrested for taking part in an attempted sit-in at the segregated lodge.

The Bayfront Hilton which is on the site today has a plaque posted on one of its buildings describing the incident.

81 Bridge St.

The home of Cora Tyson gets pointed out daily by trolley drivers because of its connection to King. King stayed with Tyson and her family during the movement.

“He loved iced tea and I always kept iced tea in the freezer for him” Tyson said in a previous interview with The Record.

King and other civil rights leaders stayed at multiple homes in the area switching their locations to try and stay safe. The Tyson family Bible bears the signatures of several of the people who visited including King.

St. Paul AME Church

The church is at 85 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. in Lincolnville on a street that was Central Avenue when King walked on it.

King spoke at this church during the civil rights movement as did Jackie Robinson. Hundreds or more attended rallies at the church and also marched to the Plaza de la Constitucion in downtown St. Augustine to advocate for civil rights.

Some of those who marched suffered serious injuries including broken bones.

“I think (King) was taken aback at how much violence there was (in St. Augustine)” Nolan said in a previous interview.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L2l0cy1oaWdoLXRpbWUtc2FsdC1sYWtlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More skyscrapers are coming to downtown Salt Lake City,"(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Salt Lake City's skyline will change in 2021 with several new skyscrapers and midsize towers going up across Utah's capital city.

“Small” Lake City keeps growing up.

Need proof? Check out the ever-rising skyline where 2021 and 2022 will bring three new skyscrapers to the heart of Utah’s capital:

• The 24-story Liberty Sky apartment tower climbing 250 feet.

• The 25-story 95 State at City Creek office complex soaring 393 feet.

• The 26-story Hyatt Regency convention center hotel climbing 375 feet.

None of these high-rises will displace the city’s top two skyscrapers in terms of height. Those are the 26-floor Wells Fargo Center on Main Street (at 422 feet) and the 28-story LDS Church Office Building (420 feet). (It’s a myth that Salt Lake City ever had a rule against building anything taller than the North Temple behemoth housing offices for the state’s predominant faith.)

The Wells Fargo building will lose its lofty status however when the planned 39-story 448-foot Kensington Tower peaks above all the others. Home to a vacated Carl’s Jr. restaurant the northwest corner of State Street and 200 South will at a date not yet set see luxury residences replace fast-food burgers.

(Renderings courtesy of Kensington Investment Co. via Salt Lake City) A wider view of Kensington Tower a new skyscraper proposed by a Boston real estate investment company at the northwest corner of 200 South and State Street in Salt Lake City. As designed the 380-apartment luxury residential tower would rise 448 feet with an open-air rooftop terrace and other top-flight features.

On Monday global developer Hines based in Houston unveiled its latest plans for a new 31-story skyscraper at 150 S. Main where the historic Utah Theater is to be demolished under a deal inked in late 2019 by former Mayor Jackie Biskupski.

If it rises as planned the 392-foot tower to be called Main Street Apartments will offer 400 new dwellings with 40 more affordable 355 at market rates and five penthouses. It will have a separate parking structure and a new wide-corridor plaza and park running east to west at ground level on Main even with Regent Street.

(Courtesy of Hines/Dwell Design Studios via Salt Lake City Planning Department) Global developer Hines has filed plans to build a 31-story apartment complex at the former site of Utah Theater on Salt Lake City’s Main Street. The tower at 150 S. Main to be called Main Street Apartments will include more 400 apartments and stand 392 feet tall initial plans show. (Jan. 12 2021)

Designs also call for a striking two-story open and columned sky lounge at the midrise 21st and 22nd floors and a private terrace on the rooftop near the tower’s luxury residences.

Little slowdown in 2020

Not even a global pandemic could knock Salt Lake City off this upward trajectory. With construction deemed essential under health edicts a multiyear downtown building boom kept rolling last year and will now reach well into 2021 and beyond — pushing the city upward and out as it adds new skyscrapers scads of office spaces and hundreds of apartments and hotel rooms.

Though they all shuddered with the coronavirus only a small fraction of nearly 50 major developments in the city center’s pipeline has faltered due to COVID-19. Volumes of new building permits and plan reviews even strained City Hall at times as a long-sought critical mass of downtown residents and housing units added since 2010 continues to mushroom.

The new skyscrapers will be unmistakable on the city’s mountain-framed horizons. They will bring additional height and density new standards of residential and office luxury and a distinct architectural feel.

Under city standards adopted just before this latest building spurt the new downtown landmarks are designed for lively ground floors to create a sense of vibrancy. Their facades and relationship to the street are shaped to make walking the city more interesting with engaging entrances big windows and street-side shops eateries and other eye-drawing features.

“All these kind of work together to create an ensemble effect that is much more visually lively” said Brenda Case Scheer University of Utah professor emeritus of architecture and planning.

If struggling downtown merchants can hold on Scheer and others insist the construction and new residents are likely to elevate foot traffic and commerce well past a vaccine while bumping up the city’s world profile in general.

“I’ve been waiting for Salt Lake to be a city for a long time” joked Scheer who heads the city’s Planning Commission. “Every city advertises its skyline” and especially with the Wasatch range as a backdrop “we have the potential for a really beautiful skyline.”

Dozens of other projects underway in 2021 will bring new midsize buildings including the Post District spanning more than a city block from 500 South to 600 South between 300 West and 400 West. And while these may not greatly alter the skyline their office retail and residential offerings will continue to change life downtown.

Here’s a look at the projects coming on line this year and soon afterward.

The skyscrapers

95 State at City Creek

(Rendering courtesy of Skidmore Owings & Merrill via Salt Lake City) 95 State at City Creek will rise 25 stories at the northeast corner of State Street and 100 South in Salt Lake City.

At 25 stories this top-end office tower at 100 South and State Street is set to open in fall 2021. It’s the work of City Creek Reserve a development arm of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which also built the 25-floor 380-foot 111 Main a little over a block away.

The building dubbed 95 State at City Creek aims to be a pinnacle in what’s called Class A office life with 515000 square feet of workspaces that backers say will “reinvent the 9-to-5” experience and promote the health and well-being of its occupants. It also will include a ground-level meetinghouse.

At 393 feet high it will edge out 111 Main as the city’s third tallest building in today’s lineup.

Designed by Chicago-based architects at Skidmore Owings & Merrill the tower also further solidifies the LDS Church among downtown’s top developers of office retail and residential properties a portfolio that includes the neighboring City Creek Center opened in 2012.

Hyatt Regency Salt Lake City

(Renderings courtesy of Portman Architects) Rendition of the new convention center hotel being built at the northwest corner of 200 South and West Temple in Salt Lake City above the Salt Palace Convention Center. The 26-story hotel to be called Hyatt Regency Salt Lake City will have 700 rooms and 60000 square feet of meeting space and will be built into the existing Salt Palace for “seamless access.”

Tourism boosters in Salt Lake County toiled for more than a decade to make this tower at West Temple and 200 South happen hoping its big room count and spacious meeting halls will help draw some the country’s largest national conventions.

The new $377 million 26-story Hyatt Regency Salt Lake City won’t open until fall 2022 but three levels of concrete construction above that southwest corner near the Salt Palace are already complete and vertical steel will start going up later this month according to Salt Lake County.

Work on the building’s exterior facade and additional stories will be notable in 2021. The long rectangular tower will boast a distinct curved exterior at its south end and extend north like a wall along a portion of that block on West Temple. Earlier plans for multistory LED screens facing onto 200 South have been discarded.

According to the county pandemic-related event cancellations at the Salt Palace are letting construction crews make unexpected headway on the hotel which is being built by Portman Holdings of Atlanta and southern Utah-based DDRM.

Liberty Sky

(Rendering courtesy of Cowboy Properties) Cowboy Properties and Boyer Co. plan to open the residential tower Liberty Sky in late 2021 part of a doubling of rental units downtown since 2010. The 24-story $90 million apartment building is rising on the east side of State Street between the Federal Building on 100 South and the Maverik headquarters building on 200 South.

This 24-story residential tower going up at at 151 S. State will be a stunner on several scores not least as the city’s first building of that height devoted to high-end apartments for rent.

Pushed by developers Cowboy Partners and The Boyer Co. the $90 million tower will offer up to 300 primarily one-bedroom dwellings with some studios and two-bedroom units all at market rates. Residents get access to a penthouse clubhouse pool game room fitness center and a ground-floor parking structure.

The building’s exterior is clad in glass and exposed concrete with a distinct industrial feel designed by Atlanta-based architects Smallwood Reynolds Stewart Stewart & Associates.

The tower is scheduled for completion in late 2021 according to its builder Utah-based Jacobsen Construction.

Midsize high-rises

650 Main

(Rendering courtesy of Patrinely Group) Developers broke ground in July on 650 Main a 10-story office and retail development located at the corner of Main Street and 600 South in downtown Salt Lake City. A new TRAX station is scheduled for construction nearby.

Most of the heavy lifting on this 10-story building of new offices to be named 650 Main located at Main Street and 600 South will happen this year with an opening planned in early 2022.

Developers with Houston-based Patrinely Group broke ground in July after securing EnerBank USA a consumer lending company as a tenant for the building’s top three floors.

The office and retail tower will have a new TRAX station nearby to be funded with contributions to the Utah Transit Authority by the city its Redevelopment Agency and several developers now chasing projects in the neighborhood.

The tower is designed by HOK a global firm based in St. Louis and plans call for a spacious lobby ground-floor shops a private courtyard and spaces for indoor and outdoor dining.

Assuming 650 Main succeeds Patrinely says it plans to construct a similar office tower on adjacent land at 645 W. Temple.

Mya The Shop and Avia (aka The Exchange)

(Rendering courtesy of KTGY Architecture + Planning via Salt Lake City) Rendering of The Exchange a cluster of new mixed-use structures called Mya The Shop and Avia going in the northeast corner of 300 East and 400 South in downtown Salt Lake City.

This $124 million residential and commercial project also called The Exchange is spread over the high-profile corner of 300 East and 400 South and is expected to wrap up in 2021.

Developers with New York-based Domain Cos. which is partnering with Salt Lake City’s Giv Group say Mya will have 126 units of mostly affordable apartments opening early in 2021 to be followed by The Shop a $14 million coworking community.

According to Giv Group most rents in the five-story Mya are to be kept within reach of those making as low as half the city’s median wages. Avia at nine stories will be more of a high-end complex with 286 one- two- and three-bedroom units to be finished in spring 2021.

The city which partnered with Giv and Domain to make the affordable piece possible says it needs housing of all types but especially at more moderate prices and rents even as planners approved nearly 3500 new units in 2020.

The Exchange complex will have ample room for street-level retailers as well as rooftop gardens and a solar-powered heating and cooling system.

The Exchange joins several apartment complexes built along that commercial corridor since 2012 when city officials gave 400 South and other arteries with mass transit special zoning rules meant to encourage higher-density development along TRAX lines.

Paperbox Lofts

Developers PEG Development and Clearwater Homes are putting up three mix-use buildings with a total of 195 residential units and about 2266 square feet of retail space on the two-acre strip of land formerly occupied by the Paper Box Company.

Built by ClearWater Homes in Salt Lake City and Provo-based PEG Cos. this residential complex with two six-floor structures and a three-floor building all at 340 W. 200 South will open its first units in spring 2021 just south of Vivint Smart Home Arena.

Paperbox Lofts has a total 195 new apartments built around an inner plaza on what was a thin two-acre former industrial site once used to make paper boxes. Like The Exchange drawing on financial backing from Salt Lake City Paperbox Lofts also will have affordable units with 39 of its apartments rented to residents making 60% of area median incomes.

The project will deploy a new multilevel automated parking system for the first time in Salt Lake City too. Made by Oakland-based CityLift the structure is akin to a vehicle vending machine that will stack and retrieve residents’ cars.

The West Quarter

(Rendering courtesy of The Ritchie Group/Architectural Nexus via Salt Lake City) An early rendering of The Ritchie Group's proposed Block 67 development in Salt Lake City also known as The West Quarter as though looking north along 300 West. Supporters of Japantown along 100 South fear the development could overwhelm the historic cultural enclave.

This huge development with its first stage rising 11 floors on the city’s Block 67 bounded by 100 South and 200 South from 200 West to 300 West will effectively push some of that new downtown height farther west and tie in downtown pedestrians with an emerging entertainment and office district being shaped out of former retail spaces at The Gateway.

Developers with The Ritchie Group in Salt Lake City and Garn Development Co. in Layton are constructing the commercial and residential pieces of The West Quarter in phases with rolling completion dates through 2022 and beyond.

Phase one will include an 11-story tower of 240 luxury apartments for rent to be called The Charles with more than 11655 square feet of ground-level retail space. That and a second 11-story building dubbed The Grid Hotel with 270 guest rooms are set for completion in June 2022.

Along the way The Ritchie Group has floated plans for as many as 650 dwellings over The West Quarter’s many phases along with two hotels an office tower retail shops a tree-lined street cutting through the block and an underground parking structure offering more than 1200 stalls.

Developers and the city are in talks with members of Utah’s Asian community on ways The West Quarter will acknowledge and celebrate adjacent Japantown a once-thriving neighborhood along 100 South possibly with a pocket park or other amenities.

255 S. State

(Rendering courtesy of Brinshore Development) A summer 2020 rendering of proposed 13-story and eight-story residential towers planned by Chicago-based Brinshore Development at 255 S. State Street in Salt Lake City.

Groundbreaking for this high-profile housing project at 255 S. State St. tentatively planned in early 2021 will bring immense sighs of relief at City Hall.

After more than eight years of delays engineering problems and financial struggles for other developers the site was empty and in disrepair when the city’s Redevelopment Agency hired Brinshore Development in 2018. The Chicago-based firm has since finalized plans and financing to build 190 studios and apartments and more than 20000 square feet of lower-floor commercial spaces in 13-story and eight-story glass and steel towers on the city-owned lot.

The two buildings will face onto a signature midblock “paseo” or walkway designed for special events. Construction is set to start in January 2021 and Brinshore says it’ll be done in two years.

All but 22 of the project’s apartments will be kept affordable including some accessible to residents making as low as 20% of average wages.

Akron Beacon Journal

Two police officers and a male suspect were shot after police responded to a report of a burglary in the 1500 block of East Summit Street near Loop Road around 8 a.m. Saturday.

According to Kent police Lt. Michael Lewis the two officers were “physically engaged” by a man inside the home as soon as they arrived. The man had a weapon and shots were fired he said.

The two officers and the man were hit by gunfire. All three were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.

“We’re very grateful to say that the injuries to our police officers are relatively minor and they are expected to be fine and make a full recovery” Lewis said in a video news release.

Kent State University faculty and students received alerts at 9:26 a.m. and 10:11 a.m. about the incident calling it an “emergency situation” and cautioning them to avoid the area.

“This incident happened off campus and there is no current threat to the campus community” the alert advised.

The site of the shooting is located a few hundred feet southwest of the Kent State campus near WKSU and southwest of the Student Recreation and Wellness Center.

Kent police requested that people not call police dispatch about the incident.

Lewis said that an occupant of the house was threatened by the suspect. The two knew each other but the extent or nature of the relationship wasn't immediately known.

“There was some type of relationship there” he said. “We’re still trying to figure out exactly what that was.”

In a recording of the 911 call the occupant of the house speaks with dispatchers while locked in an upstairs bathroom. At one point in the call gunshots are heard as the caller moans in fear.

A dispatcher tells the caller to remain in place until told to come out.

Lewis said police were unaware of any link to Kent State students or the university.

The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation remained at the scene of the shooting Saturday afternoon.

“They will be the ones who will be conducting the investigation into the officer-involved shooting” Lewis said.

The experience is said to be more “native” on the S21 models with optimizations made to make it feel more a part of One UI and in addition it was made the default messaging app on the phones. For Samsung who has always loved using its own apps for this sort of thing this is a big deal.

There’s a big problem though as this native experience is only available to Galaxy S21 units outside of the US. WTF folks.

No specific reason is known why Samsung is keeping its own messaging app as the default in the US but the move was confirmed yesterday by Google’s Hiroshi Lockheimer. While it would have been nice to have a uniform messaging experience across Android devices an upside exists in the fact that Samsung’s messaging app also supports RCS and it is probable that most Galaxy owners are quite familiar with it by this point.

There’s nothing to stop any Galaxy S21 buyers from installing Google Messages but it doesn’t look like it’ll be this new “native” experience that’s referenced. Oh well.

The three US wireless carriers really want to sell you a Galaxy S21—as long as you kick them some money.

The new Samsung Galaxy S21 lineup presents a big chance for wireless carriers to lock you in for the next few years. Fortunately with support for the new C-band spectrum they're relatively future-proofed so they'll be able to hop onto upcoming 5G networks as well as the ones currently out there.

The Galaxy S21 series will be available everywhere. Unlike last year there will be only one physical S21 S21+ and S21 Ultra model across all three US carriers so any phone you buy in the US should work with any US 4G or 5G carrier. (There will still be different models in different countries though.)

At AT&T AT&T you can get up to $800 off a new phone but there are some caveats. You have to trade in your previous phone buy it on a 30-month installment plan and have an eligible unlimited data plan.

The Samsung Galaxy S20+ ($1199 and up) is the best phone right now for the upcoming 5G transition. All of the Galaxy S20 models have class-leading features. Their Snapdragon 865 processors are the fastest in the Android world and they power butter-smooth 120Hz screens that make it hard to go back to jittery 60Hz displays. Their multi-camera systems have better zoom than competing US phones and they have generally solid battery life. The question is which one to choose; the answer is the S20+.

The middle child of three new Samsung phones the S20+ has all of the multi-band 5G power of the $1499 Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra but without that phone's gigantic size price or camera focus problems. The $999 S20 is even less expensive and one-hand-friendly but it lacks high-band 5G. That makes the Galaxy S20+ the happy medium in the series as well as our Editors' Choice for premium smartphones.

Design: All Pluses

The Galaxy S20+ is a big phone. At 6.4 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (HWD) it feels large in the hand but it probably won't poke out of your pocket. Samsung focused on increasing height rather than width for usability and as a result the phone is taller than the Galaxy S10+ but fortunately not wider; it doesn't reach the hand-busting 3-inch width of the Galaxy S20 Ultra or the iPhone 11 Pro Max. At 6.56 ounces it's pretty heavy but once again it doesn't feel nearly as heavy as the 7.76-ounce Galaxy S20 Ultra.

Comparing all three Galaxy S20 models (as well as my own Galaxy S10e) the S20 feels like a modern phone. The S20+ feels like a big modern phone. The S20 Ultra especially with its super-large camera setup feels like something else.

The dedicated Bixby button on the side of the S10 series is gone; now Bixby is a long press of the power button which is on the right side of the phone with the volume rocker (and which you can disable). On the back there's a camera/microphone patch with six elements: the four cameras (wide regular 3x zoom and time-of-flight) the flash and a microphone. Like other S20s the S20+ has no headphone jack on the bottom but it ships with a set of AKG-branded USB-C earbuds.

There's no more Bixby button.

The screen is a 6.7-inch 3120-by-1440 AMOLED panel. The screens on the three new S20 models are all the same resolution which means they get denser and even better to look at as the sizes go down. They're 14 percent brighter than last year's displays according to DisplayMate Labs and you can definitely see the difference between this and a Galaxy S10e.

The phone should stay in its new 120Hz 1080p screen mode though. The 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling noticeably smoother and improves the phone experience all around. If you're concerned about the 1080p resolution I didn't find it to be a problem but remember that the pixels get tighter as the screen size gets smaller so this phone is a better bet to use that resolution than the Ultra is.

Also like the Ultra the Galaxy S20+ still relies on Qualcomm's first-generation in-display fingerprint sensor. In my experience this sensor requires a clear direct press on its relatively limited target area—not ideal as there's no tactile guide as to where to press. But it's not a deal breaker and you can also use face unlock PIN or password.

I rarely comment on phone colors but the Best Buy-exclusive deep blue color on my S20+ is absolutely killer. It shimmers under the glass creating slight rainbows in the things it's reflecting in my home office. It also comes in black gray and a gray-blue called Cloud Blue.

Alas there's also no headphone jack.

Power: Plenty of It

The Galaxy S20+ benchmarks exactly like the Galaxy S20 Ultra. The default configuration has a 2.84GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (107GB of which available); there's also a 512GB version for $150 more. If you don't want to pay that difference right now you can put a microSD card in the phone later but you can't use that card to store 8K video recordings.

The Snapdragon 865 delivers about 20-percent better CPU and GPU performance than last year's 855. You probably won't feel that. Rather the new chipset is there to enable distinct new capabilities—that 120Hz screen 8K video recording the multi-frame camera night mode and 5G for example. It does so with aplomb. On our GFXBench graphics benchmarks the phone was able to hit 60 or 120fps depending on screen mode as long as the scene being rendered wasn't too strenuous. We have a full benchmark story looking at the Galaxy S20 Ultra; the S20+ as I said is about the same.

Also like the S20 Ultra the S20+ runs Android 10 with Samsung's OneUI 2.0 skin over it. Samsung's version of Android isn't very Google-centric and it's going to have a ton of bloatware if you buy it from a carrier. There's a huge amount of settings and confusing optional features. There are some things to like though such as a system-wide dark mode a focus mode that blocks distracting apps and a Link to Windows/Your Phone feature that lets you manage notifications and cut and paste text and images from your Windows PC.

Battery-wise the S20+'s 4500mAh cell sits right between the S20 Ultra's 5000mAh and the S20's 4000mAh as you'd expect. On our Wi-Fi video rundown test with the screen set to full brightness I got 11 hours 11 minutes in HD 120Hz mode and 13 hours 13 minutes in WQHD 60Hz mode. That's about one hour more of screen-on time in 120Hz mode than with the S20 and two hours more in 60Hz mode. There's a similar difference between the S20+ and the S20 Ultra with the Ultra's battery life being longer.

The S20+ like all of its peers comes with a 22-watt fast charger that gets the phone to 41 percent in 20 minutes and 100 percent in 70 minutes. Using Samsung's 45-watt ""super-fast"" charger didn't seem to make any difference at all to the point that I'm pretty sure that the 45W charging software isn't turned on in the phone. Hopefully an update will fix that.

The phone also has wireless charging and reverse charging which lets you charge watches and earbuds on the back of the phone. Wireless charging is slow but wireless charging is always slow.

5G: We Go Low We Also Go High

The Galaxy S20+ and S20 Ultra are the most advanced 5G phones in the US at the moment. They're the only phones able to handle the entire layer cake of 5G frequencies—low middle and high—including reusing 4G frequencies through dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS).

The small Galaxy S20 on AT&T and T-Mobile/Sprint gives up high-band millimeter-wave which has very little coverage right now but delivers awesome speed and will expand over the next three years. (Verizon plans to have a mmWave version of the small phone later in Q2.)

The Galaxy S20+ has the same 5G hardware as the Galaxy S20 Ultra but I found that it performed slightly better on Verizon's 5G network than the Ultra did. It was a slight difference but a repeatable one. At a Verizon 5G site in Astoria NY I got a maximum speed of 1.25Gbps with both phones but the Galaxy S20+ held onto 5G signal 10-20 feet farther away than the S20 Ultra did.

Why? I suspect it's because of the death grip I have to hold the Ultra in. It's just so big and heavy that I'm unconsciously white-knuckling the thing while I'm walking down the street and that can slightly impact performance and range. Or it could be some quirk of software. I'm not sure.

I expect to see the same advantage on AT&T high-band 5G which I tested on the Ultra in Manhattan. I can't get to Manhattan right now because of coronavirus-related travel restrictions.

The small S20 lacks the ""5G+"" technology that gets these amazing speeds

The Galaxy S20+ has all of the 5G pluses that the Ultra does but it also has one minus: Like the S20 Ultra it hasn't received a software update needed to accelerate T-Mobile low-band 5G performance. That update currently available in the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren helps make 5G slightly faster than 4G LTE in many areas as opposed to sometimes slower. The latest rumors I've heard are that the update is coming in April.

Otherwise I tested the S20+ on Sprint's 5G and on Verizon and AT&T 4G. I didn't see a convincing difference between the S20+ and the larger model on those technologies. All of the S20s are state-of-the-art here.

Sprint's 5G which will soon become the New T-Mobile's mid-band 5G pretty much doubles Sprint's 4G speeds in New York right now and will probably have better performance once New T-Mobile starts using more of its available spectrum.

The phone supports Wi-Fi 6 and I got effectively the same performance as I did on the Ultra and the S20; that's not a differentiator. Wi-Fi 6 like 5G hasn't shown much effect in our tests right now but will become increasingly useful as time goes on especially if it's implemented on public hotspots. (The technology helps crowded Wi-Fi networks perform better.) Once again like 5G it's an investment in the long-term future of your phone's performance. Bluetooth and NFC are here too of course.

The Galaxy S20+ camera goes to 30x.

Camera: Better Than the Ultra

The Galaxy S20+ has three main cameras. There's a 12-megapixel wide-angle unit; a 12-megapixel main camera; and a 64-megapixel 3x zoom lens. On the front there's a 10-megapixel unit. Samsung says that it uses multi-frame ""space zoom"" to achieve up to 30x zoom but the longer I've spent with all of these devices the more it just feels like digital zoom in a pretty outfit.

The cameras in general are all better than the ones on last year's Galaxy S10 series. In good light images seemed a little clearer than on the Galaxy S10e with better contrast and deeper blacks.

The Galaxy S10e is fine but the Galaxy S20+ refines the image with better blacks.

The S20+ really steps ahead of last year's Galaxy devices at night. There's an adjustable multi-frame night made which you can set to take shots for up to 10 seconds and then combine the images into a brighter image. The approach isn't great for moving subjects but it works wonders with still scenes.

The Galaxy S20+'s night shot is distinctly brighter than the S10e's was.

The physical 3x zoom lens meanwhile is a distinct improvement over last year's 2x; unlike the 3x on the OnePlus 7T versus the 2x on the OnePlus 7 Pro it's just as sharp and it's more zoom. At 4x you can definitely tell the difference between this and a 2x-based phone like the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+.

The Galaxy S20+ image at 4x and at night is noticeably better than the Galaxy Note 10+.

So how much zoom do you expect to use? Out and about I rarely went to more than 5x. Maybe at concerts I appreciated 10x. The Galaxy S20+ matches the Ultra which costs $300 more at 3x or 4x and beats last year's phones in terms of zoom sharpness. At 5x in good light the Ultra looks a little sharper. At 10x the difference is somewhat noticeable and at 30x it's quite noticeable. (The Galaxy S20 Ultra's 100x zoom mode is a useless gimmick.) I don't think the difference is worth $300 even if Samsung fixes the Ultra's focus problems.

1x shots on the S20+ ""64MP"" camera and the S20 Ultra ""108MP"" camera look very similar in 12MP mode

At 3x it's hard to tell the difference between the S20+ and the S20 Ultra

At 10x the difference becomes clearer

At 30x neither camera looks great

The S20+ cameras are otherwise superior to the Ultra's. The major difference is that the S20+ (and the S20) do not have the infuriating focus-hunting problem I experienced on the Ultra. They lock in quickly as accurately as any other leading smartphone. That's a major key difference and a big reason why I recommend these phones over the Ultra.

Night mode is more usable here than on the Galaxy S20 Ultra

Low-light performance is as good as the Ultra and sometimes better. It's also considerably better than the Galaxy S10. Some of the difference I suspect is in software as the Ultra tends to over-brighten some night scenes. There is an especially noticeable difference in low-light photos taken with the front-facing cameras.

The Ultra's front-facing camera made my face look gray in low light

I feel like the S20 Ultra over-brightens this scene

In identical circumstances the S20+ would sometimes choose a shorter night mode exposure than the Ultra—four seconds instead of five—making it more convenient to take pictures.

Like with the Ultra's 108-megapixel mode I'm unimpressed with the S20+'s 64-megapixel mode. While the goal here is to let you crop and zoom after the fact a zoomed-in 64MP picture seems less sharp than a 12MP picture taken with the dedicated 3x lens and colors are a bit odd.

8K video on the other hand continues to wow (and has less focus hunting than on the Ultra). The goal of recording 8K video isn't really to output 8K; it's to have the freedom to pan and zoom after the fact when you're outputting to 4K or 1080p. Right now the Galaxy S20s are the only phones in the US able to capture 8K video.

Now the S20 Ultra's problems might still be solvable with a software update which we are still waiting for. But why wait? Buy the S20+ instead pay less and don't worry.

Comparisons and Conclusions

At $1199 (or more) the Samsung Galaxy S20+ is an expensive phone. It's the same price as the iPhone 11 Pro Max. But it offers much more than the iPhone does including a super-high-resolution or 120Hz display; longer battery life; a better camera zoom; 8K video; and especially all the forms of 5G that US carriers will deliver this year.

There are three Galaxy S20 models—we like the middle one best

There are less expensive alternatives. The smaller S20 costs $999. You give up a bit of battery life and high-band 5G (except on Verizon) but you keep the screen camera and low-to-mid-band 5G capabilities. If you're on T-Mobile and looking for a big phone the OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren costs $900 also has a high refresh rate display and has better T-Mobile low-band 5G performance along with mid-band. Sprint's $840 OnePlus 7 5G is similar although it only has mid-band 5G.

There will be more phones this year that will support the full range of 5G technologies. I have high hopes for the OnePlus 8 the upcoming Motorola flagship and of course the iPhone 12.

At the moment though the Galaxy S20+ is your best two-to-three-year investment in a phone. That's important: We shouldn't just be thinking of the networks we have right now but what the situation will be 18 months from now. The Galaxy S20+ sets you up to succeed in the multi-band 5G future making it worthy of our Editors' Choice.",,,

The biggest question in gaming is undoubtedly when will Rockstar Games finally release GTA 6? It’s a question that nobody not even the best Rockstar insider really has an answer for.

There has been a whole laundry list of leaks – some about where the game will be set who will be the main characters and some even claiming when the game will be revealed. However nothing has been confirmed by Rockstar Games. They’re staying tight-lipped on everything.

While fans have been digging inside GTA V and GTA Online looking for possible teasers others have been looking elsewhere – including the patent and trademark filings that Take-Two the publishers for Rockstar have been making.

Rockstar Games An incredible amount of ‘leaks’ have surfaced about GTA 6 with a return to Vice City being the most popular.

The most recent of which that players were able to uncover seemingly refers to GTA 6’s online mode given that there’s mention of dedicated servers rather than solely peer-to-peer connections.

Not just that but the patent also indicates that these would also be used for AI’s and NPCs in the world. Theoretically that might mean that we could see a more densely populated world – more traffic on the road and NPC’s walking around for example.

Article continues after ad

Additionally last year a patent was uncovered for Rockstar working on additional session merging tech. That could mean that GTA 6 Online could have massive lobbies – say in the 100s rather than just the current limits.

As Twitter user chi_colossimo who broke down the patent pointed out there is also mention of a mechanism to avoid car duplication glitches via session merging.

Car duplication glitches have been a big thing in GTA Online over the years so Rockstar could be using that technology in the current-gen.

Though it seems likely that if it’s successful it would carry over into what GTA 6 Online has in store.

As spotted by Gematsu the episodic series was rated for current-gen consoles and PC in December but went unnoticed until now. The listing lends some credence to a March 2020 rumor of a “Redux” version and a sequel. To refresh our readers’ memories a leaked trailer popped up on Reddit last year which teased a Redux release and a second season. The videos are still up at the time of this writing so make sure to check out our previous coverage.

Tales From the Borderlands is a five-part episodic series developed by Telltale Games. It’s set on Pandora after the events of Borderlands 2 and boasts the Gearbox series’ trademark humor. An overview is as follows:

You’ll play as Rhys a Hyperion ‘suit’ with dreams of being the next Handsome Jack and Fiona a Pandoran con artist looking to score her biggest ever swindle. Thrown together as unwilling partners in an adventure to recover cash they both think is theirs their journey will take you on a wild ride where gangsters bandit lords and Vault Hunters are just some of the obstacles you’ll encounter in this new take on the award-winning universe created by Gearbox Software. • Play as Rhys on a mission to make Hyperion his

• Play as Fiona on a mission to make the money hers (all of it)

• Explore Pandora as never before: familiar and new locations brought to life as more than mere cannon fodder

• Your choices matter changing the story around you and making the tale yours

Steele has reason to still be smarting from last year. He had the tournament all but won until a series of errors over the last three holes he played to lose in a playoff to Cameron Smith.

And if Saturday was any indication even a two-shot lead isn't safe.

Overnight rain at Waialae Country Club coupled with the tropical wind not even strong enough to make palm trees sway left the course as vulnerable as it has ever been.

Steele didn't even have the low score to himself. Kevin Na also had a 61 and was two shots behind along with Kapalua runner-up Joaquin Niemann. Na had it going so well he thought about a 59 when he stood over a 10-foot birdie putt on the 17th knowing that would leave him an eagle away from golf's magic number. On this day he had to settle for a 61.

Niemann squinted his eyes into the setting sun as his approach on the par-5 bounced up to 10 feet for a birdie-eagle finish and a 63. In two holes he went from outside the top 10 to the final group Sunday.

Steele was at 18-under 192.

Stewart Cink birdied his final hole for a 65 and was three shots behind along with Charley Hoffman (64) Peter Malnati (64) Chris Kirk (65) and Russell Henley (65).

Starting times have been moved up by two hours Sunday with hopes of finishing ahead of heavy rain in the forecast.

Steele had a two-shot lead with two holes to play a year ago when he missed a 6-foot par putt on the 17th hole hit a wild hook on his approach to the easy par-5 18th and had to settle for par and then missed the 10th green with an 80-yard shot in the playoff. It was a final hour when everything went wrong.

On this blissful day everything went right.

And he wasn't alone.

Keith Mitchell who had a 62 on Friday took the lead at one point in the third round and was 8 under through 15 holes on his round when his tee shot landed near a cement wall of a house and cost him a penalty drop. A mediocre finish gave Mitchell a 63 which felt even higher being in the same group as Na.

There were 10 scores of 64 or better. The average score for the third round was 66.7.

Nick Taylor who took a two-shot lead into the third round was keeping pace until a pair of bogeys on the back nine. He shot a 68 and was still only four shots back.

Such is the nature of this tournament in this kind of weather. It was wide open on Saturday and it's not likely to be any different in the final round.

New Delhi: State-owned NMDC aims to utilize 97 per cent of its production capacity to produce 35 million tonne (MT) of Iron ore this fiscal and has set an ambitious target of producing 100 MT by 2030 in a bid to ensure a continuous and smooth supply of the mineral for steel makers according to a senior official.By the targeted year 2030 the government also aims to increase India's total steelmaking capacity to 300 MT. Iron ore is the main ingredient used for producing the metal besides coking coal.""In the ongoing financial year NMDC has targeted to utilize 97 per cent of its production capacity to produce 35 MT of Iron ore. Going forward NMDC has a target of achieving 50 MT production capacity by 2023 and 100 MT by 2030"" P K Satpathy NMDC Director Production told.He said while the country's overall production reported a sharp fall of 27.5 per cent at 110.5 MT in April-November of ongoing fiscal from 152.3 MT in year ago period National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) produced 18 MT during the period under review against 18.9 MT and April-November of FY 2019-20 registering a decline of just 4.7 per cent.On the supply and price of iron ore the official said the prices of the mineral are soaring globally. The values for 62Fe (ore with 62 per cent iron content) reached approximately at USD 172 per tonne by the middle of December. This level was last recorded in early 2013.Demand growth particularly in China is driving the increase in international cost of the raw material. The effect of the same is being felt in the domestic market as well he said.""However a closer look into the industry prices show NMDC's iron ore prices are still at a discount of 30-40 per cent than the imported iron ore price and 20-25 per cent lesser than the domestic iron ore suppliers"" he said.Satpathy noted that supply normalcy is yet to be achieved and the sharp shortages in India and abroad is aiding the iron ore rally.Higher demand for finished products like steel and the disruption in Odisha have also resulted in high iron ore prices. Aggravating the situation is the problem of non-operationalisation of merchant mines in India he said.He said a disruption in supply of iron ore in the current financial year is owing to the expiry of 49 merchant iron ore mines of which 34 were operational on March 31 2020. Of these 17 are operational mines in Odisha and contributed to about 25 per cent of the total domestic production.Speaking on the company's ambitious target NMDC CMD Sumit Deb said ""it is imperative that NMDC would contribute significantly to the economy in line with the Prime Minister's vision of an 'AatmaNirbhar Bharat'. NMDC will leave no stones unturned to convert India's abundant mineral resources into reserves and boost domestic production.""He said COVID-19 caused uncertain times and that had a withering effect on the performance of all sectors including mining and steel Industry.""We learnt early on that the way forward was to mobilise our operational capabilities owing to which NMDC was able to overcome the initial setback in production and we are sure we would excel the cumulative figures of the previous financial year in spite of the COVID challenges"" Deb said.NMDC understands the need for wider economic and national interest and stands strong in support of the domestic steel industry. India is committed to becoming the key player in building a globally competitive steel industry with a crude steel capacity of 300 MT by 2030-31 as envisioned by National Steel Policy he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vcmVtaXR0YW5jZS1mcm9tLW5sbmctc3VycGFzc2VzLWZncy10YXJnZXQtYnktbjYzLTZibi_SAU1odHRwczovL3B1bmNobmcuY29tL3JlbWl0dGFuY2UtZnJvbS1ubG5nLXN1cnBhc3Nlcy1mZ3MtdGFyZ2V0LWJ5LW42My02Ym4vP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remittance from NLNG surpasses FG’s target by N63.6bn,"Okechukwu Nnodim

The share of dividend remitted to the Federal Government by the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas company between January and December 2020 exceeded the projected target in the 2020 revised budget of the government by N63.62bn.

Nigeria LNG Limited is one of the world’s top 10 suppliers of liquefied natural gas.

The company is an incorporated joint venture owned by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 49 per cent; Shell Gas B.V. 25.6 per cent; Total Gaz Electricite Holdings France 15 per cent; and Eni International N.A. N.V. S.àr.l 10.4 per cent.

A document obtained from the Federal Ministry of Finance Budget and National Planning on the Federal Government’s

revenue performance in 2020 showed that the government projected a retained revenue of N80.38bn as its share of dividend from NLNG in the 2020 revised budget.

The government however got N144bn from the gas company as actual dividend during the review period representing an increase of N63.62bn when compared to the target for the year.

This represents 79 per cent higher value than the N80.38bn projected target in the 2020 revised budget.

The revenue performance document also showed that the Federal Government garnered more revenue than it projected in the 2020 revised budget from oil.

The 2020 revised budget put the Federal Government’s projected revenue from oil at N1.01tn but the actual retained revenue for the year under review was N1.52tn.

This showed that the government retained N507.67bn higher than it projected in the revised budget for 2020 which represented a 50 per cent increase on the target.

Also while the 2020 revised budget projected a retained revenue of N1.9bn for the Federal Government from minerals and mining the actual revenue that was generated from the sector was N2.09bn.

However it was observed that the actuals from non-oil revenue Company Income Tax and Value Added Tax were lower than their respective projected targets in the revised budget.

The retained revenue projections of the Federal Government for non-oil revenue CIT and VAT in the revised budgets were N1.62tn N821.67bn and N284.11bn while their actuals were N1.28tn N673.22bn and N192.66bn respectively.

Also the actual revenues from Customs and federation account levies were lower than their targets as captured in the revised budget for 2020.

The actual revenue from customs that was retained by the Federal Government during the review period was N396.37bn whereas the projection in the 2020 revised budget was N450.7bn.

For federation account levies the projection was N68.46bn but the actual retained revenue of the Federal Government was N13.84bn.

Minister of Finance Budget and National Planning Zainab Ahmed recently said revenue generation remained the most critical fiscal issue over the medium term.

She noted that several measures were being instituted to improve government revenue and entrench a regime of prudence with emphasis on achieving value for money.

Foreign brokerage CLSA is bullish on certain stocks from the oil & gas sector and has also raised its target price on them. It prefers Mahanagar Gas GAIL India Gujarat Gas and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) from the sector.

It further said that large gains in crude and refining margins are likely to be limited by continued worries on the pace of demand recovery. Also CLSA prefers oil and gas marketers over producers because the liquefied natural gas price may cool off after the winter spike.

The brokerage has raised its target price on BPCL to Rs 440 from Rs 360. Shares of the oil marketer closed 2.88% higher at Rs 414.40 on Friday.

Further it raised the target on HPCL to Rs 270 from Rs 225. The company's shares were last seen trading at Rs 230.20 on NSE.

CLSA raised its price target on GAIL (India) to Rs 170 from Rs 125. Shares of the company were down 3.3% at the close on Friday at Rs 139.20 despite the announcement of buyback and dividend approval.

The brokerage has also upgraded Oil India to outperform from sell and raised target price to Rs 120 from Rs 60. However it has downgraded shares of Indraprastha Gas to outperform from buy while increasing target price to Rs 615 from Rs 525.",,,,,,

But Musk failed to deliver on promises including launching the ""full self-driving"" feature and starting to build the Tesla Roadster.

Elon Musk Tesla's outspoken and oft-tweeting CEO doesn't shy away from bold predictions.

While many corporate executives would rather temper expectations and stick to the script — also known as underpromise and overdeliver — Musk sometimes seems to take the opposite approach. The eccentric billionaire never backs down from an opportunity to hype up whatever Tesla and his other companies have coming down the pike.

And although Musk's predictions sometimes come to bear they're often way off. The Model X Tesla's third production vehicle hit the market two years behind schedule and we're still waiting for the Tesla Semi which was unveiled nearly four years ago.

That issue though may not be much of an issue at all. Despite Tesla's sometimes overly-aggressive goals and missed timelines investors remain confident. Shares in the company have surged more than 13000% since it went public in 2010 and well over 700% in 2020 alone — easily outpacing the broader market — making Tesla the most valuable automaker and Musk the richest person on the planet.

Musk promised Tesla would do a lot in 2020 — here are some of the things that panned out and some that didn't.

Fleet of 1 million robotaxis

Tesla didn't unleash a fleet of robotaxis in 2020 but New York saw its first Tesla yellow cab hit streets. Drive Sally

""Next year for sure we'll have over 1 million robotaxis on the road"" Musk said during Tesla's ""Autonomy Day"" presentation in April 2019. To date Tesla hasn't launched one driverless taxi let alone 1 million.

Musk has described the future ride-sharing network as something of a cross between Uber and Airbnb where Tesla owners can set their cars to roam the streets picking up passengers while they sit at home or at work earning them passive income. The automaker would also deploy its own cars to areas that don't have enough customers participating.

Intriguing as the idea may be it has evidently been tough to roll out. Part of the issue is that Teslas need to have an extremely high level of autonomy to function as driverless taxis — and that's something neither Tesla nor any other automaker currently offers.

Musk later softened his tone with respect to the robotaxis in April 2020 one year after he first announced the plan shifting his target date to 2021.

""Punctuality is not my strong suit but I always come through in the end"" Musk said on a conference call in April 2020. ""So I think we could see robotaxis in operation with the network fleet next year not in all markets but in some.""

Release ""full self-driving"" capability

The latest is that Tesla will offer the feature as a subscription in early 2021. Brandon M. / YouTube

Tesla has been beating the drum that its self-driving cars would be coming ""soon"" for years now. And while there's no denying that Tesla's Autopilot and ""full self-driving"" features are among the most advanced driver-assistance systems available they still require full driver attention despite their clever branding.

In 2020 Tesla launched a limited beta of its ""full self-driving"" feature — a $10000 option — and its CEO said that the system would see a wide release by the end of that year. But early videos posted online showed that the system was not yet ready for primetime.

With that deadline looming Musk announced that Tesla would release ""full self-driving"" as a subscription in early 2021.

Still he doesn't have a stellar track record when it comes to predicting his company's autonomous-driving capabilities.

In 2017 Musk said a Tesla would be able to drive itself from New York to Los Angeles without intervention by the end of that year and that Teslas would allow drivers to fall asleep and wake up at their destination by 2019. Neither of those things have happened yet.

Deliver 500000 cars

Tesla delivered nearly half a million cars last year and had its best quarter ever. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Tesla said at the beginning of 2020 that deliveries would ""comfortably exceed 500000 units"" in the coming year and the automaker just barely missed that goal coming up short by 450 units. It also smashed its previous quarterly sales record by more than 40000 by delivering 180570 vehicles in Q4.

It's remarkable that Tesla nearly reached its sales targets and beat many of Wall Street's expectations during a pandemic that ground auto manufacturing to a halt and dealt a hefty blow to consumer spending. But it's less impressive given that Tesla has set and missed aggressive delivery goals in the past JPMorgan analysts said in a January 4 note.

In 2016 Musk said Tesla would deliver 500000 vehicles by 2018 — it ended up delivering only 246000. He also said that Tesla would sell up to to 650000 cars in 2019 and 1 million by 2020 the analysts wrote.

Launch Model Y

Tesla launched its fifth production vehicle — the Model Y crossover — last March one year after its debut in spring 2019. The vehicle completed the ""S3XY"" acronym and arrived months ahead of schedule which is unusual for the EV maker. The Model X was delayed for two years before it launched in late 2015.

Tesla doesn't break down its sales numbers by product but the Model Y is expected to boost the automaker's sales as demand for compact crossovers explodes in the US.

In 2020 Tesla delivered 442511 Model 3s and Model Ys compared to 57039 Model Xs and Model S sedans.

Begin limited production of Semi

The Semi which was supposed to go into production in 2019 is now two years late. Tesla

Production of the Tesla Semi has been on the company's back burner for years.

When the battery-powered class 8 truck was unveiled in 2017 Tesla said it was eyeing 2019 for the first deliveries. When the company reported its third quarter 2019 earnings it said it was ""planning to produce limited volumes of Tesla Semi in 2020.""

But in April 2020 Tesla said it was delaying production and deliveries of the commercial vehicle again this time until 2021.

Tesla has racked up thousands of preorders for the $150000-$200000 trucks from juggernauts like Walmart PepsiCo and Anheuser-Busch.

Deliver Tesla Roadster

There's no specific word on when the Roadster will arrive. Tesla

Tesla wowed its legions of fans and the auto industry at large in 2017 when it announced a new Roadster would arrive by 2020. The sports car promised to hit a top speed of 250 mph go 620 miles on a charge seat four and sprint to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds — all starting at $200000 a bargain compared to the gas-powered supercars of the world.

But last May as the COVID-19 pandemic dashed automakers' plans for lots of things Musk said that the Roadster would have to wait until after the Cybertruck hits the market which should be in late 2021.

Unveil a million-mile battery

Tesla unveiled a new battery architecture at its ""Battery Day"" event in September. Tesla/Youtube

In April 2019 Musk said Tesla batteries would soon be able to power its cars for 1 million miles or more — which would be remarkable given that gas-powered cars tend to live for 200000 miles give or take. He said the new batteries would go into production by 2020.

Musk was expected to formally announce the million-mile battery at Tesla's ""Battery Day"" event in September but he didn't.

However Tesla did announce a new battery architecture at the event that would result in five times more energy a 16% range increase and six times the power output. Tesla said the new ""4680"" cells will be faster and cheaper to produce and that the new packs can add stiffness to the middle of a vehicle.

The cells won't reach full-scale production until 2022.

In November 2019 Musk announced that Tesla would build its Gigafactory Europe in Berlin and 2020 saw Tesla make significant progress toward realizing that goal. Despite hiccups like an unpaid water bill hibernating reptiles and concerns about deforestation from German environmentalist groups progress on Giga Berlin has chugged along.

Musk has said the plant will build the Model Y and Tesla's next-generation battery cells when it is up and running by July 2021.

Last March Musk announced via Twitter that Tesla was considering where to build its next US car factory which would produce the Cybertruck. By July Tesla had chosen Austin Texas as the site of the new factory. And by August construction had begun.

Build Model S with 746-mile range

The Model S currently can go up to 402 miles on a charge but a longer-range version is in the works. Tesla

Back in 2015 Musk said Tesla would build a Model S with a 1200-kilometer (746-mile) range by 2020.

Tesla has been steadily increasing its vehicles' range since then but it hasn't reached that goal yet. The longest-range Tesla is the Model S Long Range Plus which can go 402 miles per charge according to EPA estimates.

Tesla plans to launch the Model S Plaid which it promises will travel more than 520 miles on a charge in late 2021.

Release Tesla Tequila

Resellers didn't waste any time posting empty bottles for sale online with massive markups. Tesla

In October 2018 Musk tweeted cryptically that ""Teslaquila"" was ""coming soon"" along with an image of a tequila bottle he said was a ""visual approximation.""

Musk came through in November 2020 when Tesla launched a limited-edition novelty tequila for $250 per bottle. Inventory quickly sold out and early buyers moved to list empty bottles on eBay for massive markups.

But Musk wasn't able to name it ""Teslaquila"" as he had hoped — the branding was shot down by Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council.

Teslas able to blast jazz and elevator music

Elon Musk tweets a lot of things.

More often than not those things are simply memes. Sometimes they're completely random. And every once in a while there's a real product update amid all that noise.

Parsing between these categories can be challenging.

What complicates things is that occasionally tweets that seem completely random wind up being actual product updates. Case in point: when Musk announced in August that Teslas would soon be able to blast jazz and elevator music through their external speakers.

Tesla was born in 1856 in a small town called Smijlian in what is now Croatia. In 1875 at Graz University of Technology he enrolled in a physics course — the one that still strikes fear in the hearts of students today. I remember my own university experience: The physics professor came in on the first day and said that our class of 100 students would be down to 10 by the end then added “Enjoy the course!”

The theoretical knowledge of electrical force was already mature in 1875; Maxwell’s famous 20 equations unifying and describing magnetism and electricity date back to 1873 when Maxwell published his paper on electricity and magnetism. Indeed the course Tesla attended in Graz retraced a century of exciting progress. The static electricity studied by Cavendish and Franklin at the end of the 18th century the electromagnetic induction discovered by Oersted in 1820 and the experiments by Faraday that opened the door to the electric motor were the topics that most fascinated him and turned him over time into “the wizard.”

With a snap of the fingers let the show begin. Continuous or alternating current? Tesla would have offered a slight smile as if he had been upset by the question but he would have gotten straight to the point as he did here: “At the time almost everyone was betting on direct current. I immediately understood the limits of it and so I concentrated all my efforts on working on alternating current which allowed me to easily build transformers capable of increasing or lowering the mains voltage.”

It was a troubled period; following the scientific discoveries regarding electromagnetism the future of electrical industrialization had to rely either on direct current or alternating current. AC could be transmitted over long distances at high voltage using low currents thus reducing energy losses increasing transmission efficiency; finally a transformer would be used to supply energy to houses and factories. When generators transformers motors wires and lights were introduced for the alternating-current system in December 1887 it was clear that AC would define the future of electricity distribution.

The “war” between Tesla and DC developer Edison is well-known. Edison measured the value of a discovery in dollars earned; he was an entrepreneur first and a scientist second. Tesla prioritized the discovery over the money; he once said “The objective of an invention is first and foremost the exploitation of natural forces for human needs. If you are a scientist you are not doing it for money but for the love of science.”

During his school days and his university days bolstered with the many scholarships he received Tesla exhibited an obsessive commitment to his studies dedicating his heart and all his energies to books. He spent long hours on research sometimes from three in the morning to eleven in the evening and managed to pass seven exams in his first year at university.

Tesla might be considered the Leopardi of engineering: The eccentric scientist and inventor was able to draw people’s attention thanks to his genius in applied physics. At the time most people thought of electric current as something mysterious that flowed along the wires thanks to the intervention of a ghost hand. Tesla wanted to master the laws of this type of science and after his experience with Edison he became convinced that the future belonged to a system not yet applicable: alternating current.

His studies on wireless transmission led him to imagine what we know today as the internet of things. “When wireless is perfectly applied the whole Earth will be converted into a huge brain which in fact it is all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole” Tesla wrote. “We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly regardless of distance. Not only this but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face despite distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared to our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.”

His intuitions led him to design the Wardenclyffe Tower wireless transmission station in Long Island New York with funding from financier J.P. Morgan. By transmitting energy in the form of electromagnetic waves he set the goal of enabling the use of that energy miles away from the source. He planned to send highly energetic waves into the upper layers of the atmosphere via a series of towers like the Wardenclyffe station to distribute electricity worldwide. No other similar experiments had been conducted before. Albert Einstein visited one of Tesla’s various wireless towers with other scientists in 1921.

For his inventions Tesla received numerous awards — including the Edison medal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMS8wMS8xNy90ZXNsYS1pbmNyZWFzZXMtcHJpY2UtcG93ZXJ3YWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla increases the price of Powerwall again,"Tesla has increased the price of Powerwall its home battery pack again – the second time in just a few months.

Tesla Powerwall Demand is Crazy

Back in 2015 Tesla decided to use its expertise in making battery packs for electric vehicles to produce energy storage devices for homes and businesses by launching the Powerwall and Powerpack.

Powerwall became extremely popular with residential solar customers people looking to have backup power and even with virtual power plant projects more recently.

As we recently reported Tesla Powerwall is becoming extremely hard to get as demand increases due to home battery pack incentives.

California has strong incentives for installing residential energy storage capacity that has created more demand than Tesla the market leader with the Powerwall can handle right now.

Last year Tesla announced that it installed its 100000th Powerwall home battery pack.

Around the same time CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla is working hard on increasing Powerwall production as delivery delays are getting longer in many markets.

Tesla Powerwall Price

With the demand outpacing production for a long time Tesla has been increasing price of the Powerwall.

In October Tesla increased the price of the Powerwall from $6500 to $7000.

Now Tesla is again increasing the price of the Powerwall by $500.

The automaker updated its online configurator yesterday and now the price of the home battery pack is $7500 (hat tip to Risshiraj):

That’s just for the battery pack itself. Tesla also charges $1000 for the Gateway a device that is sort of the brain of the installation and the actual installation cost of $3500.

These costs have remained the same since the last price increase three months ago.

Electrek’s Take

Powerwall has quickly emerged as the No. 1 home battery pack with a growing number of sale channels.

Tesla prioritized Powerwall installations with its own solar power installation both rooftop solar panel installations and solar roof tiles and with those installations finally picking up for Tesla the Powerwall is even in higher demand.

Furthermore other solar installers including big ones like Sunrun are also using Tesla’s Powerwall with their solar installations.

It looks like Tesla is taking advantage of the demand to improve its gross margin on the Powerwall.

I can’t blame them – especially if they are using that money to increase production."

Here's What You Need To Remember: The body shape of the aircraft does appear to blend somewhat gradually up to the rotor blades as if to decrease sharp angles and engineer a gradual incline or slope from the front end of the aircraft up through the body to the rotor blades. Another huge measure of potential stealth for the aircraft likely resides in its ability to manage a heat signature as well something about which there may be little information available.

The Army’s Future Long Range Assault Aircraft is slated to enter war by 2030 bringing what service developers say is more than twice the range and speed of existing utility and attack helicopters.

There are several vendors now competing as part of an intense Army competition to ultimately choose and deploy a new fleet of aircraft with a much greater combat radius fuel efficiency speed weapons sensors and computer systems.

Lockheed Sikorsky-Boeing’s SB Defiant has taken flight more recently than Textron-Bell’s 280 Valor however both appear to be showing early promise. Sikorsky’s SB Defiant which recently took a demo flight at a Sikorsky range in West Palm Beach Florida before the Army’s Chief of Staff has reportedly hit speeds of 250 knots more than twice that of a current Black Hawk.

The SB Defiant uses an interesting counter-rotating dual blade technology known as a compound configuration. The counter-rotating blade is based upon innovative engineering methods that combines airplane-like speeds with the hovering and maneuvering capabilities unique to helicopters. The counter-rotating blades are engineered to reduce high-speed vibrations steady the aircraft and best optimize massive amounts of thrust coming from a pusher prop mechanism in the rear of the aircraft.

“These advancements will prove critical for Army operations in a theater like the Indo-Pacific where the dominant geographical feature is water and yet land forces remain the predominant military force in the majority of nations in the region” Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville said following the flight demo according to an Army report. “We are flying before buying.”

The Army plans to publish new requirements for the helicopter by 2021 based upon data gathered and lessons learned through ongoing experiments weapons development and test flights the report added.

The Sikorsky-Boeing tech demonstrator SB-1 Defiant first took flight in March 2019 and leverages Sikorsky’s X2 technology with a rigid compound rotor and pusher prop.

It is not at all unusual for weapons system requirements to be refined throughout the developmental process of a new platform given that new things are learned on an ongoing basis.

Interestingly the rounded oval-shaped defiant does look a bit stealthy and appears to operate with an internal weapons bay to limit detectable external shapes or contours likely to generate radar signature returns.

While rotor blades are quite naturally likely to generate some kind of radar signal to enemy systems depending upon range and the fidelity of a given air defense platform. However the counter-rotating blades also brings a “sound” advantage by virtue of enabling quieter stealthier flight trajectories generating a much smaller acoustic signature. Also some of the symmetry of the counter rotating blades closely mirroring each other in shape and size will decrease turbulence and therefore improve the airflow and stability of flight.

The body shape of the aircraft does appear to blend somewhat gradually up to the rotor blades as if to decrease sharp angles and engineer a gradual incline or slope from the front end of the aircraft up through the body to the rotor blades. Another huge measure of potential stealth for the aircraft likely resides in its ability to manage a heat signature as well something about which there may be little information available.

by Sangeeta Chakraborty Share To

On January 15th Thermo Fisher Scientific announced the acquisition of Henogen Novasep’s viral-vector manufacturing division in Belgium for about $879 million in cash. It will be part of Thermo Fisher’s pharma services business within the laboratory products and services segment.

Viral-vectors such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are used in gene and cell therapies to deliver RNA and DNA into cells. Biopharma giant AstraZeneca has been using an adenovirus vector for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate and Novasep last November had signed a multi-year deal with the company to support its large-scale manufacturing of the adenovirus vector.

Henogen – Low-Cost CMO

Henogen Novasep’s production facility across two locations in Belgium is a global provider of low-cost manufacturing services for a range of products and processes including active molecules vaccines and therapies to biotech and pharma companies. The company has more than 75000 square feet of clinical and commercial production space with about 400 employees. The business’s estimated 2020 revenue was approximately $97 million.

“Novasep’s viral vector business is an excellent strategic fit as Thermo Fisher continues to expand its capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies globally” said Michel Lagarde Executive Vice President of Thermo Fisher.

“The addition of their manufacturing capabilities in Europe complements our four development and manufacturing sites in North America” Lagarde said. “In addition they bring an incredibly talented team with more than two decades of experience across a broad range of viral vectors. The combination will benefit our global customers seeking support and capacity in the region as well as European customers bringing new medicines to patients inside and outside of Europe.”

Michel Spagnol President and Chief Executive Officer Novasep said “Thermo Fisher is an outstanding partner for our viral vector business and its future development. Our diverse customer base will benefit from the combination of our viral vector services capabilities with the scale and capabilities of Thermo Fisher. Our talented employees will bring deep expertise to an organization that shares our commitment to providing ground-breaking new medicines to patients.”

The acquisition of Henogen marks Thermo Fisher’s second big purchase of a viral-vector business after it acquired Brammer Bio in 2019 for $1.7 B. Riding high on the success of its COVID-19 test kit over the last year Thermo Fisher has made great strides in expanding its manufacturing capabilities to 20 million per week to accommodate the rising need.

The recombinogenic region consisted of a previously described [25] 77 bp exogenous sequence derived from the F1 phage genome (AK) (Table 1) which was placed downstream the donor splice site (SD) in the AAV-5′ VWF and upstream the acceptor splice site in the AAV-3′ VWF in order to increase the rate of the homologous recombination between the two genomes (Fig. 1a). We tested the efficiency of this dual hybrid AAV to reconstitute the large gene of VWF in vitro by infecting HUVECs at a MOI of 103 of each vector. Seventy-two hours post transduction we performed DNA extraction and analyzed the viral genome by PCR amplification with primer sets designed to specifically amplify regions of the 5′ VWF 3′ VWF or the junction between the two halves of the VWF CDS. We detected the presence of the 5′ VWF and 3′ VWF PCR amplicons (Fig. 1b blue and green lines) in the cells transduced with AAV-5′ VWF and 3′ VWF respectively. In the cells transduced with both vectors we detected the correct PCR amplicon corresponding to the junction region comprising the splicing donor AK sequence and splicing acceptor (Fig. 1b red lines) confirming the reconstitution of the full-length VWF transgene. On the other hand we did not detect PCR amplicons corresponding to the genomic product containing the AAV ITRs which is also expected upon recombination between the dual hybrid vector [23] most likely because of an inefficient PCR amplification of these DNA regions with secondary structures [35]. HUVECs do expresses VWF and therefore we analyzed whether protein levels would increase upon transgene expression. Whereas no effect on VWF protein levels upon transduction with 5′-VWF or 3′-VWF alone was observed an increase in VWF protein was observed for the 5′-VWF/3′-VWF combination both intra- and extracellularly (2 and 2.5-fold respectively Fig. 1c). Interestingly in the conditioned media from transduced cells we detected the secreted 310-kDa VWF precursor form which was not present in the control samples (Fig. 1c). In hepatocyte derived Huh7 and renal HEK293 cells transduced with the dual AAV vector in the same experimental setting as for HUVEC we did detect the genomic product derived from the correct recombination between the dual hybrid AAVs (Supplementary Fig. 1) but we did not detect any VWF protein expression (Fig. 1d) likely due of the lack of activity of the endothelial promoter ICAM2 in these cell types. To further optimize the vector for a transgene delivery into ECs we took advantage of a selected endothelium-targeting peptide to be expressed on the surface of the AAV capsid site A589 (VP1 numbering) a strategy which has already been described for AAV2 and AAV9 vector retargeting to various cell lines including the vasculature [30 3637383940]. Using a similar strategy we generated wt and mutant AAV9 vectors (AAV9wt and AAV9mut-A -B -C and -D) displaying different endothelium-targeting heptapeptides on the capsid (Fig. 2a). These peptides were previously obtained by in vitro selection of an AAV2 library (unpublished data). To compare the transduction efficiency of the different vectors they were all produced with an expression cassette consisting in a firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of the ubiquitous PGK promoter (Fig. 2a). We transduced HUVEC with the vector mutants at MOI of 104 and measured luciferase activity in the cell lysates after 48 h. The AAV9mut-A and -C mutants displayed an activity comparable to the one of cells transduced with AAV9wt while AAV9mut-D showed a 70% reduced activity compared to the control AAV9wt vector (Fig. 2b). On the other hand enzyme activity was significantly higher in cells transduced with AAV9mut-B (2.9 ± 0.06-fold p < 0.0001 Fig. 2b) thus indicating an increased HUVEC transduction efficiency of this vector compared to AAV9wt. We then performed a comparative study of AAV9wt and AAV9mut biodistribution and vector-mediated transgene expression following systemic delivery in C57Bl/6wt mice (n = 4 per group). To better highlight vector spread throughout the body the PGK promoter was used to drive the expression of luciferase. After the intravenous injection of the AAV vectors at a dose of 2 × 1010 vector genomes (vg)/mouse animals were imaged at 15 and 35 days post administration (Fig. 3a). All the animals displayed luciferase expression at day 15 which remained sustained over time (Fig. 3b). Total flux measured from the ventral images of the animals at day 35 defined a high expression group comprising AAV9wt (2.9 × 108 photons/s [p/s]) AAV9mut-B (1.7 × 108 p/s) and AAV9mut-C (2.5 × 108 p/s) while AAV9mut-A and -D showed a lower luciferase expression (9 × 107 and 2.5 × 107 p/s respectively) (Fig. 3b). We performed bioimaging analysis to compare vector biodistribution in the different organs. AAV9mut-B -C and -D showed a localization pattern similar to that of AAV9wt with the majority of the signal coming from the upper abdominal cavity and some signal from the head region at day 15 (Fig. 3c) and a widespread signal extended to the thoracic cavity and the hindlimbs at day 35 (Fig. 3c). AAV9mut-A animals displayed a significantly lower luciferase signal localized mainly in the abdominal and thoracic cavities with some expression from the head and the hindlimbs at both time points (Fig. 3c). We next compared the VGCN in liver lung heart brain and skeletal muscle (tibialis anterioris) which were collected at sacrifice (Fig. 3a d). AAV9wt showed a predominant tropism for liver heart and lung with less copies found in the brain and skeletal muscle similarly to what has been previously observed by analyzing vector biodistribution after tail vein injection of AAV9 serotype in mice [41]. In the liver VGCN was comparable for AAV9wt and AAV9mut-B while AAV9mut-A and -D displayed a significantly lower liver transduction (Fig. 3d). A slightly higher VGCN in liver was observed for AAV9mut-C (Fig. 3d). A similar trend was observed in the lung where VGCN was lower in animals injected with AAV9mut-A and higher in animals injected with AAV9mut-C (Fig. 3d). On the other hand no significant differences between the vectors were observed in terms of VGCN in the heart brain and muscle (Fig. 3d). Overall integrated data from luciferase expression and tissue biodistribution (Fig. 3b–d) showed two variants (AAV9mut-A and -D) displaying lower liver transduction resulting in less luciferase activity over time and two variants comparable to AAV9wt (AAV9mut-B and -C) with AAV9mut-C displaying a better liver and lung transduction. At the time of sacrifice we also collected aortic samples from the mice in order to analyze VGCN and transgene expression in the vasculature. The group injected with AAV9mut-B showed the highest VGCN in aortic tissue with 0.5 ± 0.1 copies/cell significantly different from AAV9wt and the other mutants (p = 0.01 Fig. 3e). In order to compare transduction efficiency of the different vectors in aortic tissue we examined the luciferase enzyme activity and we found that AAV9mut-B had the highest expression [17933 ± 3821 relative light units/mg total protein] this level of transduction being three-fold times more than the level observed with AAV9wt and the other mutants (Fig. 3f) data which correlated with the VGCN in aorta. Based on the observations derived from this study which paralleled the data obtained in vitro (Fig. 2b) we selected the AAV9mut-B as the variant to be further explored for the delivery of VWF transgene. We produced a dual hybrid vector named ICAM2-VWF with the previously described endothelial-specific expression cassettes (Fig. 1a) incorporated into the modified AAV9mut-B serotype. In parallel we produced a liver-specific dual hybrid vector named hAAT-VWF in which the expression cassette was put under the control of the alpha-1 antitrypsin promoter with Apo E enhancer an hepatocyte-specific regulatory element extensively used by us and others to provide strong transgene expression from the liver [31 42 43]. We evaluated the expression of the large VWF transgene in vivo after intravenous injection in VWF deficient mice [20] of either the endothelial-specific ICAM2-VWF or the hepato-specific hAAT-VWF dual vector used as control at a dose of 5 × 1011 vg/mouse of each vector (Fig. 4a). As negative controls the AAVs expressing VWF 5′ alone were administered (Fig. 4a). Mice treated with ICAM2-VWF or hAAT-VWF stably expressed the transgene over time showing VWF plasma levels between 1 and 1.5% of those of wt animals (Fig. 4b). On the other hand the protein was undetectable in control mice injected with the ICAM2- or hAAT-VWF 5′ vector alone (Fig. 4b). Because VWF circulates in a tight complex with the procoagulant FVIII thus playing an important role in its production stabilization function and immunogenicity [44] we measured FVIII activity (FVIIIa:C) before vector administration and 2 weeks post injection concomitantly with the first peak of transgene expression. We did not observe any significant increase in both mice injected with ICAM2- or hAAT-VWF thus indicating that in this experimental condition the residual VWF levels are not sufficient to appreciate changes in FVIIIa:C over time (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly the usage of a minimal ICAM2 promoter resulted in vivo in VWF expression levels comparable to those achieved with the liver-specific hAAT enhancer–promoter. However it has to be considered that when expressed from ECs in physiological conditions VWF release in circulation is tightly regulated [1] and the protein is stored into specialized secretory granules which are not present in hepatocytes [45]. Therefore we cannot exclude differences in terms of total expression from the two promoters since the intracellular VWF levels are likely not to be the same in hepatocytes and ECs. This was suggested also by an in vitro experiment in which HuH7 cells transduced with hAAT-VWF dual vector did not show VWF protein accumulation intracellularly 72 h post transduction (Supplementary Fig. 2). Importantly in our study we did not detect protein products other than full-size VWF in vitro by western blot analysis with the usage of a polyclonal antibody. These truncated forms could originate from the 5′ and 3′ VWF which do not undergo a productive genome reassembly [25 35 46]. We further confirmed this result in vivo in VWF deficient mice where we did not detect the presence of truncated proteins from in the animals injected with the 5′ VWF vectors. In conclusion we developed a capsid-modified AAV9 in order to reconstitute the large VWF gene expression via cell type-specific targeting providing the first proof of principle that a systemic injection of an endothelial-specific dual AAV vector provide VWF stable expression in VWF deficient mice. A limit of this study was related to the fact that VWF levels obtained in vivo were stable over time but subtherapeutic as demonstrated by the inability to rescue FVIII activity in this experimental setting. Future studies will be therefore needed to better investigate VWF expression profile from ECs and to further improve the expression cassette (i.e. testing of different recombinogenic regions or enhancers) in order to increase basal expression levels and evaluate the endothelial-derived VWF multimerization profile and hemostatic potential in plasma.

Investors might have thought they’d seen it all in 2020. But the stock market action was merely a preview of what’s to come in 2021.

Just to take a quick look back the market gave everyone a scare in 2020 when it bottomed in March. But then the S&P 500 surged 67% between March 23 and year-end.

Certain stocks like Tesla (TSLA) Zoom (ZM) and Moderna (MRNA) performed even better soaring by triple-digits.

And now we are going from one “year like no other” to another.

Here’s what I expect the new year will bring for investors…

Prediction No. 1: The Bull Will Still Run in 2021

As 2020 has shown us things outside your control—like a global pandemic—can render any prediction worthless.

But I have a lot of confidence in—and a lot of money riding on—this idea.

Why? Three reasons…

We have every reason to expect the Federal Reserve will keep money flowing into stocks.

Their easy money policies help push people out of “safe” investments (i.e. money market funds and bonds) and into riskier assets (i.e. stocks). With the Fed pledging to keep interest rates low until 2023 bulls can look forward to a multiyear boost.

Here’s something else investors can look forward to…

Congressional gridlock isn’t going anywhere.

With political leadership split nearly down the middle in Washington D.C. we are in for at least two years of political gridlock. Gridlock is historically great for stocks… especially Walmart (WMT) Hewlett-Packard (HPE) and IBM (IBM).

As is this…

Markets are at all-time highs… which typically lead to more all-time highs!

Since 1988 the S&P 500 returns were significantly higher on one- three- and five-year time horizons when the index was at all-time highs:

But while I expect the bulls to keep charging some sectors are looking even better than others.

Prediction No. 2: Tech Will Be 2021’s Top-Performing Sector

Technology stocks have been on an incredible run over the last five years. In fact it has been the best-performing sector in three of the last four years.

Forget those nattering nabobs of negativity who say the tech run is just about done. Get ready to see more outperformance in 2021.

For one while some tech names have had an incredible run in 2020 others have struggled… particularly in the second half of the year.

Household names like Amazon (AMZN) Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) have well underperformed both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since July. And smart investors will see this opportunity to buy great companies at a discount to their peers.

The other kicker is technology stocks are not expensive.

Compared to the dot-com bubble (when interest rates were 5X higher) the five largest US technology companies are relatively cheap:

Technology companies allowed many of us to keep working from home and biotechnology companies will help us return to normal.

That means we’ll see another big year from the companies that made—and will continue to make—this possible.

The worst of the COVID-19 pandemic will soon be behind us. The coronavirus vaccine will take effect both physically and psychologically and the global economy will find its footing again.

Some companies are already taking that side of the bet…

Prediction No. 3: 2021 Will Be the Best Year in a Decade for Dividend Hikes

2020 was the worst year in a decade for dividend investors. In total global companies cut their dividends by 22%.

That means 27% of all publicly traded companies slashed their dividends this year.

We stayed on top of these dividend cuts throughout the crisis. From cruise ships to casinos we steered away from companies whose payouts my Dividend Sustainability Index (DSI) identified as being in danger.

But what goes down… must come up. At least when it comes to dividends.

We have already seen a few dividends return from the dead. Kohl’s (KSS) TJX Companies (TJX) Marathon Oil (MRO) and Darden Restaurants (DRI) are among the first to reopen their purse strings.

Look for more where that came from… even among those that maintained and/or raised their payouts in 2020.

Why? We can use history as our guide.

In the two years after the 2008 financial crisis we saw global dividend payouts increase 39%.

With the Fed keeping the easy money flowing… techs and biotechs getting ready for another unbelievable year… and dividend income ready to be unleashed there’s never been a better time to be an investor.

The stock market is arguably the greatest wealth creator on the planet. Though there have been short periods when other assets have outpaced equities the broader market has been the most consistent outperformer of inflation for over a century.

Building wealth in the stock market is really an exercise of the mind. It requires the analysis to pick great companies and the resolve to hang onto their stocks for long periods of time. This patience in allowing your investment thesis to play out is how Warren Buffett became one of the wealthiest people in the world.

Had you invested in foundational companies like Amazon or Starbucks at the turn of the century (Dec. 31 1999) you'd be up on your initial investment by around 4000%. These are fantastic returns but still nowhere near the returns of the biggest gainers of the century.

If you'd invested $10000 into the following four stocks at the beginning of the 21st century or whenever they went public you'd have $1.6 million or more today.

Apple: $1.62 million

This may not come as a shock but the kingpin of tech innovation has been a huge winner over the past 21 years. Investors who had the wherewithal to invest $10000 into Apple (AAPL -0.91%) and let it grow over time (I'm talking about you Forrest Gump) would have seen their initial investment top $1.6 million this century.

There's no question that Apple's iPhone completely revolutionized the company. Despite an exceptionally crowded field Apple's many iterations of the iPhone have maintained the top smartphone market share spot in the U.S.

Apple's CEOs (the late Steve Jobs and Tim Cook) have also successfully kept the company ahead of the innovation curve. Cook has been positioning Apple to take advantage of growth on the services side of the business for the past couple of years. Services are home to high-margin subscription revenue which will help reduce the sales lumpiness occasionally associated with physical products like the iPhone iPad and Mac.

Even now as the largest publicly traded U.S. company Apple shows no signs of slowing down.

Tractor Supply: $1.67 million

If feel-good American growth stories are more your thing you'll be interested in the nation's largest farm supplies and equipment chain. Had you bought $10000 worth of Tractor Supply (TSCO -0.25%) stock on Dec. 31 1999 you'd have almost $1.7 million now.

To partly steal a line from successful entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis the CEO of Camping World and the star of The Profit Tractor Supply is successful because of its ""people and process."" The company goes out of its way to hire employees with firsthand knowledge of what they're selling. In other words it's often farmers and ranchers selling to other farmers and ranchers. That makes each visit meaningful for the company's customers and it results in a lot of sales. Since 2000 Tractor Supply's full-year sales have grown from $759 million to an estimated $10.4 billion in 2020.

As for the process the company aims to be a one-stop shop similar to what you see at Walmart or Costco but without the 100000-square-foot locations. By having virtually every product that rural customers might need for their farms or livestock Tractor Supply has ensured that its competition isn't grabbing any low-hanging fruit.

With Tractor Supply also spending aggressively on digitization it'll soon have yet another element to build trust with rural consumers and improve its operating efficiency.

Netflix: $4.11 million

Even though it didn't make its debut as a public company until May 2002 FAANG stock member Netflix (NFLX 3.04%) is still the second best-performing stock of the century. A $10000 investment into Netflix at the closing bell on its first day of trading would be worth just over $4.1 million today.

For much of its early existence Netflix focused on the DVD-by-mail model. While mailing movies to members was profitable Netflix saw the future of content demand shifting and took action. Beginning in 2007 it began to focus on streaming content. Little did investors know at the time that this early leap of faith would pay off enormously.

In 2012 Netflix not only embraced streaming but also began investing in its own original content. House of Cards the company's first original series was a resounding success. As of the end of September 2020 Netflix had amassed 195.2 million global streaming subscribers with the company more than quadrupling its annual generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating margin since 2016.

Though I've been critical of the company's ongoing cash burn Wall Street appears perfectly content to allow Netflix to spend aggressively to acquire overseas subscribers.

Monster Beverage: $10.32 million

But if you wanted to really impress your friends and family you'd have purchased shares of Monster Beverage (MNST -1.42%) at the turn of the century. Back then the company was known as Hansen's Natural. An investment of $10000 into this Monster some 21 years ago would be worth more than $10 million today (a greater than 103000% gain).

If you're wondering how such impressive gains are possible from a beverage company you can primarily look to energy drinks for your answer. Back in the early 2000s Hansen's Natural had a very small percentage of the energy drink market. According to data from research firm T4 Monster accounted for 39% of all energy drink market share in 2020 with NOS (also owned by Monster) picking up another 3% share. This high-growth category especially with teens and young adults has been a multidecade winner.

Monster's success in the energy drink market also caught the attention of beverage giant Coca-Cola (KO 0.29%). In August 2014 Coca-Cola invested $2.15 billion into Monster equating to a 17% stake in the company. Additionally the two companies essentially swapped assets with Monster sending its non-energy drink line of products to Coke and Coca-Cola allowing Monster to take control of its energy drink products. This is how Monster came to control the NOS and Full Throttle brands.

Monster's large share of the energy-drink market continues to yield high single-digit to low double-digit annual sales growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy52aWN0b3JpYWFkdm9jYXRlLmNvbS9jb3VudGllcy9kZXdpdHQvYW5udWFsLXlvYWt1bS1saXZlc3RvY2stc2hvdy1lbmRzLWF1Y3Rpb24td2l0aC1uZWFybHktMTMwLTAwMC1zcGVudC9hcnRpY2xlX2VhZTRjOGQ4LTU1ZjEtMTFlYi1iZjUzLWNmNmFiMzgzZWE4Zi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Annual Yoakum livestock show ends auction with nearly $130000 spent,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

No wonder. Only one other woman in NCAA history had ever done better in the triple jump than what Usoro did Saturday. In Texas Tech's season-opening Corky Classic at the Sports Performance Center the Lady Raiders' senior from Nigeria went 46 feet 10 1/4 inches on her first attempt.

""When I first saw the mark I was really surprised"" she said ""and I had to look back and check that it was really my mark. I felt very grateful to God and I'm really just thankful to God right now because he's the one who made this happen.

""I was so surprised when I saw it because I wasn't really expecting it at this time because it came so early.""

The meet was Tech's first since the Big 12 indoor championships last February. The COVID-19 pandemic that rocked the sports world beginning in mid-March kept the Red Raiders the Lady Raiders and most of their college track and field competition sidelined for the past 10 months.

But there was no easing back into the first meet in ages.

Usoro and Lady Raiders thrower Kayli Johnson won two events Saturday as did Tech men's sprinter Courtney Lindsey. Middle-distance runner Takieddine Hedeilli and thrower Gabriel Oladipo broke school records in the 800 meters and the weight throw.

And Baylor all-America pole vaulter K.C. Lightfoot set a U.S. collegiate record by vaulting 19-5 3/4.

Usoro used only five jumps in winning two events. She took the long jump with a 21-4 1/4.

But her first time on the runway in competition this season is one she'll long remember. The 46-10 1/4 broke her school record by 2 1/2 feet and broke her homeland Nigeria's national record. It's second in NCAA history only to the 47-8 that American record holder Keturah Orji posted while competing for Georgia in 2018.

""I would say it's overwhelming and it's a blessing"" Usoro said ""because I never thought I could actually go that far.""

Hedeilli did not even know he would be competing at the start of the week. The Algerian senior received an NCAA waiver on Friday that allowed him to compete.

Then he ran 1 minute 45.98 seconds to win the 800 and break current Tech assistant coach Zach Glavash's 15-year-old indoor school record. Only four men in the world ran faster times during the 2020 indoor season among them 2019 world champion Donavan Brazier and 2019 U.S. bronze medalist Bryce Hoppel from Midland.

""It makes me feel like really happy"" Hedeilli said. ""My plans and my goals are still far away. I'm looking for better. This is just the start for me.""

Lindsey a former NJCAA sprints champion at Iowa Central debuted as a Red Raider by winning the men's 60 meters in 6.59 seconds and the 200 in 20.45.

During the 2020 indoor season Tech's Jacolby Shelton and Derrius Rodgers ranked among the top 15 in Division I in the 60 meters and Karayme Bartley and Ashton O'Connor ranked in the top 15 in the 200.

Tech coach Wes Kittley said Lindsey will hold his own with them.

""He actually had bigger marks coming out of junior college than those guys did out of high school"" Kittley said. ""We felt like he was the cream of the crop in junior college and one of the hidden secrets a little bit. ... To see him come out and run so fast in the 60 and then a 20.45 200 didn't surprise me.

""He's going to be a great one for us.""

Johnson who transferred to Tech after graduating from Michigan State won the women's shot put (51-1) and the weight throw (60-6 1/2).

Oladipo broke his own Tech men's record in the weight throw with a mark of 71-10 3/4.

Former Coronado and Tech star Trey Culver who now competes professionally for Adidas cleared 7-4 1/2 to win the high jump. Second and third behind him were young Tech jumpers Cale Kassen and Coronado graduate Caleb Wilborn each of whom topped out at 6-10 1/4.

Though the reception from the Lansdale community has generally been warm including a local business award reaction to the store has gone both ways.

“I was getting mixed reviews as far as some people were saying how it was racist that they have a Black bookstore because there are no white bookstores” Muhammad said.

He wants to make one thing clear: The Black Reserve is not a Black bookstore. The store just happens to specialize in Black literature.

“When I go to bookstores … and say ‘Where is your Black section or your African American section?’ they would direct me to where the books were on the shelves usually a very small section right? One or two shelves” Muhammad said. “So you’re telling me that everything that Black people wrote in the history of literature can fit on two shelves right? So that bookstore is 99.8% white. So what do they call that bookstore? They don’t call it ‘the white bookstore.’ They call it Borders and Barnes & Noble.”

Reaching beyond Lansdale too

Although the Black Reserve does not have the resources of a large operation like Barnes & Noble that hasn’t stopped Muhammad from reaching bookworms.

“I have shipped books everywhere — California Colorado Texas Florida. Like literally everywhere. It’s been amazing” Muhammad said.

At the start of the pandemic he was forced to close his doors and shift completely online. And while many businesses struggled the bookstore found a niche as people began to gravitate to reading.

“When the pandemic first hit us in our infinite wisdom a lot of people felt that they would just go home they would lock themselves in their homes and they would just watch Netflix the entire pandemic or they would watch cable” Muhammad said. “But an amazing thing happened: A lot of people started contacting me for books and literature because I know they were getting tired of just sitting around watching movies and watching TV all day.”

Around the time the store was set to open again anti-racism protests were happening nationwide. And with those protests came a particular interest in Black books.

“So a lot of people were I would say trying to improve themselves or improve their understanding of what was going on. And what better place to improve your understanding of what’s going on especially from a Black perspective or with social justice issues than a bookstore that specializes in Black literature” Muhammad said.

Soon he began selling out of books including some that were out of stock at the larger bookstores.

With anti-racism book clubs all the rage newer white customers even came to the store with lists trying to find books like “How to Be an Antiracist” “White Fragility” and “The New Jim Crow.”

“So when these books came out they only came up with a certain number of them because … they weren’t that popular right? I mean some people got them” Muhammad said. “Everybody wanted them. You couldn’t get them on Amazon.”

When customers found out those books were not available he began to recommend that they read the classics. From James Baldwin and Richard Wright to Malcolm X and Assata Shakur there’s a list of Black writers whose catalogue is perfect for the moment we are living in Muhammad said.

He believes there was an inevitability to the events that transpired last summer.

“That’s one of the biggest problems with race relations. In any relationship for a relationship to bloom and blossom and to be amazing it takes a mutual exchange of information. It can’t be a one-sided story” Muhammad said.

And a one-sided story is written all over Lansdale a place where Confederate flags are not hard to miss he said.

“The first step to recovery is that you first have to admit that you have a problem. I think for the longest time in this area they believed there wasn’t a problem. But you only believe there wasn’t a problem because everybody looked like you” Muhammad said.

In a pandemic-less world Muhammad holds community outreach events at which he talks to youth in the area. Through those conversations he said he has learned of implicit biases negatively affecting Black students around the neighborhood.

“It’s hard to hear a young person a child … feel so defeated due to their experience inside the schools … And one of the biggest misconceptions is that Black children that live in the Greater Philadelphia area have it all together and our parents have it all together” Muhammad said.

The plight facing Black students in the schools is making them want to leave the community after graduating according to Muhammad.

“Things are not fine” he said.

However he was genuinely surprised to see protests around the neighborhood. “That’s fantastic because that tells me that something happened to a Black person and white people finally said ‘Hey that’s messed up.’”

As a resident of nearby Hatfield Muhammad said that his criticisms of the community come from the heart.

“I think people glaze over this fact about me and this area. I’m fully locked in here. My business is here. My family is here. My house is here … I am dug in. I’m fully vested. I’m not speaking about Lansdale from an ivory tower. I am Lansdale. I am this area.”

He wants protests and conversations to be more than a fad. He wants them to have a long-lasting impact on the broader community and his family including his 8-year old son.

The second American Civil War is here.

No official announced Trump’s Civil War. That’s why our major news organizations dance around the awful truth using confusing language.

But we don’t need a press release to recognize Trump directed white supremacist followers to attack a branch of our national government on Jan. 6. The treasonous assault on Congress capped years of also undermining the judiciary and the executive branch’s intelligence law enforcement and health agencies.

Trump apologists will quarrel with the word directed. Yes Trump spoke as he often does out of four sides of his mouth when he said he would march with the throng to our Capitol. Recordings show people shouting they were invited by the president and doing his will. It is the message the mob understood that matters as well as video during the siege where Trump expressed love for the insurrectionists.

That Trump will not attend the inauguration of Joe Biden should make you shudder. Without him on the outdoor platform rebels hellbent on overthrowing our government could assassinate Biden and incoming Vice President Kamala Harris with no risk to messianic and delusional Trump.

We face danger from more than the lawless Trump mob that attacked our Capitol.

This is why police and National Guard will flood that zone on Jan. 20. And it explains why Biden and Harris insist on being sworn in outdoors to signal fear has no place in the land of the free and home of the brave.

And it’s not just government buildings that require extra protection from disloyal and self-righteous Americans who love Trump more than our Constitutional liberties. Mosques synagogues and some churches especially Black churches will be vulnerable to attack by those who want to make America white again. Many claim to be Christians but are in fact the embodiment of evil.

Trump’s mob will not win this war. No matter what buildings they attack what leaders they assassinate they cannot win because there are not enough of them to destroy the United States of America in favor of a dictatorship under Trump his children or anyone else.

Making America Endure

Eager and willing as Trump’s army is to assassinate for perceived betrayal outgoing Vice President Mike Pence as well as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Biden and Harris our freedom and continuity of our government does not hinge on any individual.

Our nation endures so long as we sustain a broad and deep commitment to the five noble objectives of the Constitution articulated in our Preamble. Each objective is designed to perfect our union over time.

If you don’t know the Preamble please click here and read the 52 words again and again until you memorize them. Take note that riches neither are mentioned nor implied. Liberty the general welfare and justice are along with their byproducts peace and tranquility.

Even though the outcome of Trump’s Civil War is certain Trump’s band of domestic terrorists can and already have imposed enormous and lasting damage.

These true believers in Trumpian rule can dissuade many from peaceful and joyful mingling in houses of worship government buildings sports arenas and political venues. While Biden and Harris are brave millions will hold back because of their rational fear of violent attack. Doubt that? How eager are you to visit on vacation or ride a bus in Jerusalem? Kabul? Baghdad?

Our nation’s capital is an armed camp today. So are the downtowns of many of our state capitals. Law enforcement and the intelligence community sift through plots organized on the Internet in the hope of disrupting attacks before they occur. The police and soldiers are backups for the inevitable failures to prevent attacks.

Among the Attackers

We also need to recognize we face danger beyond the lawless Trump mob.

We now know the insurgents attacking our Capitol included rogue active-duty military and police officers. Dozens of people on FBI terrorist watch lists were among the attackers evidently not being watched at all closely. There are disturbing indications some members of Congress Republicans all may have helped the attackers reconnoiter the Capitol pointing out hidden offices of Democratic Party leaders.

One Republican lawmaker openly encouraged rebellion. Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama outfitted in camo riled up the Trumpian mob before its attack. Another Republican Lauren Boebert of Colorado tweeted out the location of Pelosi who was then being hunted by the mob. A Boebert text described a plan to put a bullet in Pelosi’s head on TV. Think about what America would be like today had the insurgents assassinated leaders by firing squad or hanging them from the gallows they set up outside the Capitol.

Brooks and Boebert must be expelled from the House. Failure to do this will only give succor to others tempted by traitorous opportunity.

Democratic lawmakers who reported seeing pre-siege extremist Republicans giving guided tours to insurgency leaders are worried the riot had even further traitorous inside help. Coming investigations will tell us the facts especially if prosecutors are smart about leveraging cooperation in return for less severe sentences.

That we may have a Fifth Column in Congress immediately alarmed unwitting collaborators from the dominant economic force in America big corporations. From American Express and AT&T to Tyson Foods and United Parcel Service many big companies stopped at least for now aiding and abetting with money these faithless enemies of America.

We live in strange times when we need help from soulless corporations to defend our liberties. To be sure they acted out of self-interest. Under a dictatorship corporate directors and executives would be forced to bend to the will of an unelected and unaccountable autocrat who could eviscerate their privileges and plunder their wealth.

Disloyalty and oath-breaking by officials also marked the 1860s when some representatives senators and federal judges used their power to wage war on the United States. Until they were stopped. Texas lawyer Barbara Radnofsky tells some of this compellingly in her concise book A Citizen’s Guide to Impeachment.

Our Noble Purpose

The costs of Trump’s Army waging war on our government will drain resources from improving America from perfecting our union.

To secure our safety National Guard troops sleep on the cold marble floors of America’s Capitol. Fences and walls are becoming ubiquitous a twisted outgrowth of Trump’s lie that he would build a wall. Other barriers metal detectors and other protections against domestic terrorists are abounding.

Trump’s Civil War did not begin with the murderous attack on our Capitol. It dates to at least August 2017 when his violent thugs marched in Charlottesville Va. shouting Nazi slogans. “Jews will not replace us” and “blood and soil” they chanted while marching past a synagogue. The next day one of them drove his car into a crowd killing Heather Heyer the first fatality in Trump’s Civil War.

What these rebels heard the next day what instilled them with bravado was not Trump’s confusing comparison of anti-Semitic racists and the counter-demonstrators but this line about themselves: “very fine people.”

Don’t make the mistake of thinking there is no Second Civil War just because all is peaceful where you are. Six days before rebels bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12 1861 The New York Times reported that an attack was imminent. But once the fighting began there was no battle of Grand Rapids no skirmish in Rochester no siege in Cincinnati. In some states such as Oregon all regular Army were withdrawn and volunteers maintained military outposts and kept watch on Confederacy sympathizers.

That is how wars take place. People may be sipping espresso in sidewalk cafes or picnicking beside a stream while soldiers fire on one another within earshot.

As we prosecute this war on Trump’s militias and half-organized renegade insurgents we must give no quarter in terms of criminal prosecution especially for seditious conspiracy and murder. Where they fire their arms we must respond with lethal force as the laws of war allow. But we must be better than the attackers.

We must take care not to give Trump’s army a perverse victory by destroying the soul of America by losing sight of our nation’s great purpose. We must not descend into a militarized safety zone.

Instead we must build up the institutions we have damaged with decades of malign neglect—schools colleges public health and more. We need law enforcement to act as guardians instead of warriors. Even restoration is needed of public furniture to parks and bridges making life pleasant and commerce efficient.

We must make our union more perfect through caring for our citizens providing the tools for stable and prosperous lives and vigorous debate about the way we want to order our liberty.

We must keep in our hearts and our politics the fundamental purpose of our government—to ennoble the human spirit with liberty and fraternity so that our people can attain the best that our nature makes possible.

With the rollout of vaccines underway and a new round of economic stimulus landing soon JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup each said on Friday that they had begun to pare back the enormous reserves they had socked away in case of an economic disaster.

Citigroup’s chief financial officer Mark Mason cited the vaccines the most recent round of stimulus and the election outcome — which is likely to result in a bigger stimulus package — as drivers of the bank’s decision to raise its economic forecast lower its expectations for the unemployment rate in 2021 and release some rainy-day funds.

“There are a lot of favorable indicators that support the direction of the variables and make for a more positive outlook in 2021” Mr. Mason said on a call with journalists to discuss the bank’s results adding that things had improved even more since Citi had closed its books after calculating its fourth-quarter performance and its economic forecast this month.

Some of the changes that banks are making to their forecasts could be temporary. New accounting rules force them to tweak their reserves and their forecasts more frequently to keep up with changes to conditions in the financial markets and the economy.

But the strengthening of the Israeli shekel against the US dollar is creating an “existential crisis” that outstrips those other challenges he says leaving him and other industrialists struggling for a response.

“In the first Lebanon war we knew we had to grit our teeth and go on and during Operation Protective Edge there were rockets flying over Ashkelon” said Cohen 64 referring to the 1982 war and the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict respectively. “Both were existential crises one could say. But we knew that it would end one day. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis we knew to take steps to ride the crisis out. But I have no idea when this shekel crisis will end. It is an existential threat and I don’t know how to handle it and I’m not sure I or others like me can handle it.”

The US dollar dropped this month to its lowest value against the Israeli shekel in the past 24 years as the US currency has weakened globally on bets that President-elect Joe Biden will boost aid packages to help curb the economic wreckage caused by the coronavirus pandemic flooding the market with dollars and diluting their power.

The weakened dollar has helped Israeli consumers and importers but is devastating local manufacturers who rely on exports and other businesses that get paid in dollars.

On Thursday with $1 equal to NIS 3.116 the Bank of Israel made a dramatic move announcing that it intends to purchase over $30 billion in foreign currency in 2021. But some manufacturers are skeptical that the move will be enough to pull them out of a tailspin.

The Bank of Israel’s signaling of its intention in advance which Deputy Governor Andrew Abir called “an unusual step for unusual times” was made in hopes of keeping the shekel in check and stabilizing the exchange rate as well as keeping multinationals from fleeing.

“The advance announcement of the scope of the purchases is intended to provide the market with certainty regarding the Bank’s commitment to dealing with the recent sharp appreciation” of the Israeli currency the central bank said.

“The export sector is feeling threatened recently” Abir told reporters according to TheMarker financial daily. “We don’t feel we can play with the future of workers who see their livelihood in danger especially in high-tech.”

The announcement caused the shekel to immediately fall to NIS 3.19 to the dollar on Thursday and by the weekend was trading at NIS 3.27 to the dollar a 5% decline against the greenback highlighting market confidence in the move. Economists at Bank Hapoalim Ltd. said Sunday they expect to see the shekel continue to weaken in the coming weeks following the central bank’s announcement on Thursday.

Buying dollars to weaken the shekel is nothing new for Israel. The bank has purchased billions of dollars annually as part of a strategy first put in place during the global financial crisis of 2008. In 2020 it bought a record $20 billion worth of dollars in the foreign exchange market but the greenback still weakened 7.5% against the shekel over 12 months. The shekel has risen 23% against the dollar since 2015 according to data provided by the Manufacturers Association of Israel before the Bank of Israel’s announcement on Thursday.

The shekel’s strength comes with the nation facing political instability a national budget essentially held hostage by political machinations and the coronavirus pandemic which has caused one of the biggest economic crises in Israeli history.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is being tried for corruption in three cases and the country run by a dysfunctional government coalition that failed to pass budgets for 2020 or 2021 will hold its fourth general election in two years in March.

The budget deficit for 2020 was nation’s highest ever — NIS 160.3 billion ($50.4 billion) or 11.7% of its GDP some three times higher than the deficit a year earlier the Finance Ministry said last week.

The treasury estimated that GDP for the year contracted by some 3.3% and the Central Bank estimated the drop at 3.7% both of which are still better than some earlier gloom and doom forecasts that predicted a drop of as much as 7%.

The coronavirus pandemic has caused record levels of unemployment in Israel — 16% this year according to a Bank of Israel estimate. A strong shekel which hurts exports could hinder the economy’s recovery from the blow dealt it by the virus central bank governor Amir Yaron has said.

Booming foreign equity markets are causing the shekel to strengthen against most currencies as investors hedge their investments in foreign stock markets by selling foreign currency reserves.

In addition Israelis are mostly eschewing travel because of the coronavirus leaving at home some $3 billion worth of foreign currencies they normally spend abroad.

The shekel is also buoyed by the strong fundamentals of the Israeli economy. The nation has a big surplus in the balance of payments current account because its exports exceed imports mainly due to its strong high-tech industry which is seeing rapid revenue growth and is attracting large amounts of foreign investment. Natural gas production from massive gas fields since 2013 has also helped to cut back on energy imports and savings by households in Israel in savings and pension plans are high. All of this impacts the nation’s current account giving it a surplus.

The signing of normalization accords with the UAE Bahrain Morocco and Sudan with the promise of other accords to come is also boosting the shekel by taking away some the geopolitical tensions that have traditionally weighed on the Israeli currency said Terence Klingman an economist and chief investment officer at the Heritage Family Office Partners Ltd. which advises wealthy families on where to invest their funds.

A strong shekel is good for Israeli consumers — it makes imported products and travel abroad cheaper. This will come in handy as the nation exits the coronavirus crisis.

But the rise of the currency spells disaster for local manufacturers and exporters which pay workers taxes and other expenses in shekels but sell their products in dollars.

The firms have been forced to raise prices and become less competitive in the global market or see their profit margins be whittled down or a combination of the two. Companies are responding by cutting back on expenses laying off workers or relocating to cheaper locations.

“Businesses are being murdered” said Mer’s Cohen.

Mer Group has global subsidiaries in a variety of business activities from telecommunication infrastructure products to homeland security and smart city solutions defense technologies and cybersecurity services. Set up in the 1980s as a family business it is today a publicly traded company with a market capitalization of NIS 42.2 million ($13.4 million).

The company started its activities with sales in Israel and over the years has expanded overseas. “Seventy percent to 75% of our turnover is generated abroad and 90% of our profitability is from foreign sales” said Cohen. But in the last few years as the shekel has strengthened against the dollar selling projects and products has become more challenging he said.

“The dollar is becoming weaker and weaker and our position versus competitors is getting weaker too” he said. “Industrialists are always thinking of how to cut costs and become more efficient; we are always in survival mode. But there is a limit to how much we can do. There comes a point when we have to fire workers — or even worse shut down operations. And that is not something temporary. A factory that has been closed will never reopen.”

Five years ago Mer Group employed 1550 workers globally he said. That number is now down to 700 “because of the weak dollar.”

Similarly the group has shut down operations of two antenna-tower manufacturing plants in Israel and is now producing them in joint ventures abroad with Chinese Turkish and Mexican partners.

It’s not only the weak dollar. Cohen says high local costs and a difficult regulatory environment in Israel have also hurt businesses.

Thursday’s announcement by the Bank of Israel is a step in the right direction Cohen said. But monetary tools to curb the shekel are not enough he added urging a laundry list of other steps like lowered taxes and a reduction in employer-funded benefits to remedy what he described as an environment in which firms were being hurt by business-unfriendly government policies.

“We are being burdened more and more all the time” he said.

The plight of the Israeli industrialists is falling on the deaf ears of a dysfunctional government he said. “There is no one to talk to. We don’t burn tires or block highways in protest. But processes are underway and closures will follow. We must protect our future.”

A mixed bag

Just as the government come up with a variety of programs to protect the economy from the pandemic it must now find a “vaccination for the economy” against the strong shekel said Netanel Haiman head of the economics division at the Manufacturers Association of Israel. “If they don’t understand that we have an emergency here that needs addressing then all the efforts to get the economy and employment back on track will be hurt.”

The effects of the shekel on exports are not immediate; rather they will trickle down slowly Haiman said. “You may not see the depth of the problem in the daily data but it will emerge eventually. The situation is very bad.”

“It is a mixed bag” said Klingman the economist. Policymakers need to weigh a number of factors when mulling the shekel’s rise. On the one hand a strong shekel will be good for consumers battered by the pandemic as it will help them spend more on cheaper imported products. On the other hand it is bad for manufacturers whose production plants are mainly in Israel and who rely on exports.

Fast-growing tech firms in Israel have seen strong sales growth which is helping them outpace the weakness of the shekel he said. The companies that are most affected are those that have been around for a number of years and that see lower growth margins and the more traditional industries where revenue growth is slower. “They are facing double headwinds because of shrinking demand due to the pandemic and the strong shekel.”

Economists have been talking about a “K”-shaped recovery from the pandemic with some industries recovering swiftly and others lagging and Klingman beleives exporters will also see a “K”-shaped recovery — from the pandemic and the strong shekel: Mid-cap firms that have set up operations abroad and are manufacturing globally to be close to their markets will recover faster than those that only produce in Israel.

“These will be the most challenged” he said.

Romold Technologies Ltd. a maker of plastic products for the construction sewage and telecommunication industries was founded in Israel in 1992 and is now owned by Romold GMBH in Germany.

The firm currently exports some 25% of its products. “A few years ago our exports accounted for 70%-80% of our sales” said CEO Dovi Frumovich who has led the firm for the past 15 years. “It has become very expensive to produce here so we have moved production to Germany and the Czech Republic.”

For each $1000 of products sold the company used to get around NIS 4000 shekels which would go to pay local salaries and other costs. Now for each $1000 worth of products sold the firm gets only some NIS 3200 he said because of the shekel’s appreciation. Meanwhile local costs in shekels are high. The minimum monthly wage in Israel is NIS 5300 ($1600) a month (equivalent to about $9.25 an hour) municipal and other taxes are high and regulation is burdensome.

“I can’t ask my customers to pay more because of the high shekel” Frumovich said. “It is not their problem. Once we had trouble competing with Asian firms or Turkish companies. Now I can’t compete against European or US manufacturers either.”

The firm has cut back some 20% of its workforce in Israel in recent years from 100 workers to 80 and Frumovich said if things don’t change he will continue to move operations abroad.

“The government must decide if it wants an industry in Israel or not and if yes it must support it” he said. The size of the local market is small and companies cannot survive by just selling locally. They must be able to export he says.

The Bank of Israel’s interventions in the foreign currency market help a bit but “it should be doing much more” Frumovich said. He admits though that “it is not easy to control the currency fluctuations.”

Like Cohen Frumovich says the government should be helping businesses in other ways than just trying to control the shekel such as by lowering taxes and easing regulation he said.

“It took me four years to move my plant in Israel from one location to another. It took me 11 months to build a new factory in Austria” he said.

On January 12 the Globes financial website said that US cybersecurity software provider McAfee will be shutting down its development center in Tel Aviv to cut costs mainly as a result of the strong shekel.

That same evening the Israeli High-Tech Association an umbrella group for the tech industry that is part of the Manufacturers Association convened a committee meeting.

“There was full attendance” said Cohen the Mer Group chairman. “Everyone is frustrated and disgruntled. And that is because there is no one to talk to. We can make all kinds of suggestions and proposals but there is no one on the other side who is listening.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9wb2NrZXRzLW9mLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktYXZlbnVlLWluLXN0LXBhdWwtdHVybi1mcm9tLWJsaWdodC10by1icmlnaHQvNjAwMDExNDQ3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After riots St. Paul's Midway works to turn blight to bright,"Four nights after George Floyd died in the custody of Minneapolis police four men were caught on camera breaking into the Enterprise Rent-A-Car building in St. Paul's Midway neighborhood. They set it on fire.

""It was a total loss"" said building owner Paul Gonyea founder of Gonyea Commercial Properties. ""The roof collapsed. The inside walls collapsed. What remained had to be turned down.""

The four men were caught by authorities. After delays hiccups with hazardous debris removal and $800000 in costs (some not covered by insurance) the building at 1161 University Av. is 85% rebuilt and due to open in March with Enterprise back in as the tenant.

""It's been more difficult than I would like"" said Gonyea. ""I'm in a hurry to finish this. My tenant wants to be there and they want to open as soon as they can. It's on the Green Line. It's a good spot.""

The restored building one of an estimated 280 buildings damaged during last spring's riots in St. Paul is a welcome sign of progress for the hard-hit Midway area a busy 4-mile commercial corridor that scoots along University Avenue — roughly from the State Capitol to Hwy. 280.

""The area took the brunt of the damage from the riots in St. Paul"" Midway Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Chad Kulas told St. Paul Building Owners and Managers Association members during a recent Zoom call to update neighbors about recent improvements. ""Piece by piece we are collecting ourselves and opening up more and more of the Midway. It's hard to say things will be back to normal in two years"" but there is progress.

Local developers such as Reuter Walton Suntide Commercial Realty Kraus-Anderson Cornerstone Construction Wellington Management Inc. and Gonyea among others have recently worked ""the avenue"" bulldozing or repairing damaged buildings replacing broken windows and doors and snatching vacant lots for future development as offices or apartments.

About 12 projects are in the works equaling hundreds of million of dollars in development. The recovery ""is like after a wildfire when you start to see vegetation arise from the damage. That's what is happening in Midway"" Kulas said.

This week Kraus-Anderson is demolishing the vacant U.S. Bank branch near Keys Cafe at University and Raymond avenues. The graffiti-covered building KA bought in December will make way for a $50 million apartment building with 220 units. Blocks east a former boarded-up auto garage at 1835 University Av. was knocked down to prepare for affordable rental units.

Across from the Ax-Man Surplus store near University and Snelling avenues a soon-to-open Bank of America bank branch has replaced the shuttered Pawn America. A little over a mile east an office complex will replace the soon-to-be-razed Johnny Baby's bar at 981 University Av.

""For the neighborhood we are well aware with daily reminders of what transpired [in May]. But I think there is overall a sense of hope"" said Kate Mudge director of the Hamline Midway Coalition. ""We celebrate every time we see a really damaged building come down and get cleaned up or we hear about somebody managing to reopen.""

Two new apartment buildings are being built a soccer ball kick away from Allianz Field soccer stadium on land that used to house a Bremer Bank and Furniture Barn. One mile east Minneapolis-based Alatus LLC plans this summer to begin constructing a six-story $60 million apartment and retail complex near the White Castle at N. Lexington Parkway and University Avenue.

Last year's riots caused Alatus' ""builders risk insurance"" premium to triple for the 288-unit project to nearly $550000 said Development Director Chris Osmundson. Insurers re-evaluated their risks for all Minneapolis and St. Paul construction in the wake of the riots.

Not all area projects are on track. The 34-acre Midway Shopping Center and Big Top Liquors near Allianz Field burned and damaged by water in the riots remain shut awaiting demolition. But there's no word from the city or the shopping center's owners — Rick Birdoff and Minnesota United FC owner Bill McGuire — about when the site will be razed.

In 2016 the city approved a master plan for the site to eventually become an ""urban village"" of offices apartments a hotel and parking surrounding Allianz Field home to Minnesota United. But the master plan lacks a timeline and hasn't been updated since May's fires city officials said.

Through a spokesman Birdoff and McGuire declined to comment for this article. Kulas said McGuire told his chamber in July the strip mall would be knocked down but didn't say when.

Nicolle Goodman director at St. Paul Planning and Economic Development said the city doesn't know when work will begin. The city's biggest concern she said is that any redevelopment meet the community's needs and not price neighbors out of the area. ""Redevelopment is great"" she said. ""But we need to do everything we can to ensure that the character and the identity of the area don't disappear.""

Days after George Floyd's May 25 death Suntide Principal Jeff Hart watched on TV as protesters gathered by the 1000 University Av. office his team bought and rehabbed 10 years ago. Some rioters spray-painted graffiti and then moved up the block.

Suntide scrubbed off the paint and looked for ways to uplift the neighborhood. They had already bought the building across the street — Johnny Baby's — a problematic bar at 981 University Av. Now was the time to knock it down to build nice offices. Demolition starts this spring. ""We are trying to do our part and clean up the neighborhood"" Hart said.

For University Avenue businesses the 2020 riots were perhaps the most dramatic of a string of disruptions. They have endured years of light-rail construction that finally ended in 2014. Then Sears Walmart and Herberger's stores shut. The global pandemic and recession followed.

Then in May rioters torched the street's Enterprise car rental shop the Sports Dome Napa Auto Parts Bole Ethiopian Cuisine's two restaurants and the Midway Shopping Center's Foot Locker Game Stop and Big Top Liquors. Smoke and water damage wrecked the rest of the strip mall.

""What a whammy! If you survived University Avenue and all of that [2010-2014] light-rail construction just to live for today? God help you!"" said Twin Cities commercial real estate veteran Jim Durda who now manages the City Center for Ryan Cos.

Setbacks aside neighbors are encouraged by ripples of progress. Recently dozens of boards came off store windows. Last month a shuttered auto-repair shop near University and Fairview avenues came tumbling down to be replaced by two affordable apartment buildings projects worth $64 million. ""That's fantastic"" said Mudge.

The property held past lives as an Andy's Garage Andy's Eat Now Diner and a secondhand store. Nothing stuck.

Developer Reuter Walton (RW) bought the site in November and bulldozed it. The St. Paul Housing and Redevelopment Authority approved $30 million in bonds while Bridgewater Bank AFLCIO-HIT and Fannie Mae made loans. The state spent $330000 to decontaminate the land.

This week contractors plan to pour concrete footings for the apartment's coffee shop and underground parking. The project is RW's first on University Avenue.

""The Reuter Walton team is proud that we are able to bring these 243 much-needed affordable homes to the Hamline Midway neighborhood"" said CEO Nick Walton.

More housing is coming. Friday a wrecking ball readied to topple the vandalized former U.S. Bank branch that Kraus-Anderson bought at University and Raymond.

The $64 million effort is KA's latest on University. In March 2019 it paid $31 million for the Midway Marketplace by Hamline Avenue that includes the riot-damaged but restored Cub Foods TJ Max Dollar Tree plus the nearby LA Fitness and shuttered Walmart.

KA has been mum about the future of the former Walmart store that shut in 2019.

""We don't have any redevelopment plans for the site at this time"" said KA Senior Vice President Matt Alexander.

State Senator Scott Wiener told us “I spoke with senior Bank of America folks yesterday about the incredible importance of this sacred site to our community. They have agreed to remove the signs. Previously the bank manager would take care of the area and store memorials that had been up for a while until someone could claim them. This branch has been closed for months however so there was no one to monitor the site and Bank of America was concerned after political and other signs were pasted to the building itself and covered the windows. However B of A immediately acknowledged the importance of the site to the community and agreed that it was of the utmost importance that people be able to post memorials on the small fence as usual. The bank branch will be putting up different signs eventually that will discourage people from posting things other than in that area which they are reserving for the community. We are working on activating community groups to take over the maintenance.”

This afternoon the signs posted by Bank of America warning against memorials being set up on Hibernia Beach were removed. Photo by Gerard Koskovich

Bank of America spokesperson Colleen Haggerty sent us the following statement: “After speaking with community members we realized the code enforcement signs created confusion and therefore we had them removed immediately. We absolutely understand the significance and importance of the space and will continue working with the community to ensure it remains a memorial as it has for decades.”

Meanwhile historian Gerard Koskovich added context to the importance of Hibernia Beach: “The angled corner of the building at the intersection of Castro and 18th streets has been a profoundly marked territory for expressions of shared queer public mourning since the darkest years of the AIDS crisis in the mid-1980s—well before Bank of America leased the space. Spontaneous folk memorials mounted in this location have commemorated the deaths of hundreds of members of the LGBTQ community as well as famous allies such as Princess Diana in 1997. They also have marked our participation in moments of national mourning including the death of Matthew Shepard in 1998 and the response to the attacks of Sept. 11 2001. The GLBT Historical Society has preserved the Matthew Shepard and Princess Diana memorials which can be accessed for research purposes.”

ORIGINAL STORY:

For decades at the southeast corner of Castro and 18th Street makeshift memorials have commemorated recently passed members of the LGBTQ community. The stretch of pavement a long-ago sunbathing and cruising spot known as Hibernia Beach after the adjacent Hibernia Bank branch now a Bank of America has served as a place to gather and grieve as photo montages and personal items of the deceased are displayed along the little fence bordering the bank. During the AIDS pandemic and horrific events like the Pulse Nightclub massacre and Ghost Ship fire these memorials provided solace and remembrance.

“That is our sacred ground soaked in the blood of our ancestors and family” former Assemblymember and Supervisor Tom Ammiano told us. “That was where we remember our dead especially in times when their own families refused to even acknowledge their existence. It is a place of profound importance to the community.”

That sacred ground appears under threat as new signs posted by Bank of America along the building warned “Please do not post or affix materials to the fence or building surface.” The signs cite San Francisco Police Code article 10 section 709 which prohibits posting signs on private property without the owner’s consent and states that violators can be “fined not less than $50 nor more than $500.” While a handful of memorials still stay up on the fence for now the possibility of future such shrines could be in doubt.

Anger and confusion quickly spread online at the news. The signs were posted with no warning to the community and seemed to many to ignore the magnitude of longtime cultural traditions. In an email to 48 Hills Bank of America spokesperson Colleen Haggertty wrote

As a longtime business located at this historic location we recognize the importance for people to honor this history and continue to temporarily preserve mementos placed onsite until regularly removing items for public safety and cleanliness needs.

In recent months the increased volume of items placed onsite in addition to being posted onto our walls and windows began to pose greater potential safety concerns. The signage recently placed is to help curtail safety risks for neighbors and visitors. We remain committed to the Castro and are working with community organizations to find a solution that continues to allow mementos honoring the LGBT historical significance of this location while maintaining safety and appearance especially once the newly renovated financial center reopens for business in March.

Supervisor Rafael Mandelman told 48 Hills that the move by Bank of America “absolutely” threatens sacred space. “It’s outrageous” he said. “We were given no warning of the signs going up. I spoke with the property manager and apparently there is a history of the bank being frustrated by maintenance burdens associated with the space. But this is not the solution to that problem.

“I told them the signs must come down” Mandelman said. “And we should find a different answer probably by bringing the Castro Community Benefits District the Castro Cultural District and the Castro Merchants together and finding away for them to take greater responsibility in the area’s maintenance. We remain in communication with the bank and are working towards that now.”

Current displays memorialize Patrick York Ron Flavin and Mary Elaine Botts an unhoused woman known as Princess Leia who died in December.

Bank of America’s signs come at an especially raw and painful time for the community. Like most other marginalized groups LGBTQ people have been touched deeply by death COVID-related and otherwise in the midst of a depression-spurring pandemic skyrocketing overdose rates and healthcare crisis. Formal memorial services are being delayed and it seems like everyone is going through an intense and extended personal grieving. Perhaps the uptick in volume of materials placed at Hibernia Beach is due to the exponentially increased need to mourn publicly.

The most recent huge loss for the community was Black LGBTQ and HIV activist giant Ken Jones a veteran who was the first African American chair of SF Pride and a member of the BART Citizens Review Board after the killing of Oscar Grant. He passed this week of cancer and many discovered the new signs while planning a memorial. Before this death Jones recalled the importance of Hibernia Beach. “In the 1970s before the Internet ironing board tables at Hibernia Beach were our community organizing headquarters” Jones wrote in a memoir cited by the Bay Area Reporter.

Fellow activist Cleve Jones echoed the importance of the location “This has been a tradition for many decades a place where we came together to mark the passing of people who mattered to us. It’s where we remembers the victims of the Pulse massacre. It was a place to remember everyone from our favorite bartenders to the most famous celebrities among us. For anyone to even think about taking that away is a grievous insult and must be reconsidered.”

Ammiano shared a funny memory of the Hibernia Beach area in the 1970s. “Every Friday the line outside the bank would stretch down the block. We all wanted to cash our paychecks and go out drinking. This was during the time of the Symbionese Liberation Army when Patty Hearst held up a Hibernia Bank branch. Well we were all waiting in this humongous line and one queen yelled ‘Patty Hearst didn’t have to wait!’ The whole place burst into hysterics.”

Ammiano’s mood turned dark at the thought of losing the space. “This is non-negotiable. We will protest we will organize I will pull out some nellie ninja shit. Nobody takes that space away from us. Nobody.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZXN0OS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2Jhbmstb2YtYW1lcmljYS1jbG9zZWQtZHVlLXRvLWNvdmlkLTE5LzUxMy0yODQyY2U4NC02MTcyLTRmODgtYTQ2MS03ZDI1OTg0NjAyNzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America closed due to COVID-19,"The Grant Avenue location in Odessa left many customers in the dark when it temporarily shut down because of COVID-19.

ODESSA Texas — These days banks have made it easy for people to access their money whether it be through an app or online but there are people who still like to go to the bank itself. However lots of customers ran into a problem when the Bank of America on Grant Avenue in Odessa closed.

Customers claimed that they weren't notified of the bank's closure and had little to no communication from the bank for a couple weeks while it was closed.

It turns out that the bank closed because of COVID-19. This left customers with only a few options.

The first was to use the ATM at that location but several customers reported negative experiences with the ATM and left them with even more problems.

The second option was to go to a Bank of America location in Midland. This was another problem as some customers didn't have the means to travel from Odessa to Midland just to go to the bank.

This begs the question when will the Grant Avenue location open back up?"

This month Uber and Lyft drivers got a small raise. That’s because a new Seattle law kicked in that increased how much money drivers earn per ride. It's too soon to know the law's full impact. But drivers say some kinds of rides are now paying more.

Uber driver Papa Diawara says he’s seen a small bump in his pay from Uber. For example when he drives someone to the airport. Before the law went into effect he earned $20 or $22 taking someone to the airport. Now he says he earns $26 to $28. At least that's true for fares originating in Seattle. When he turns around at the airport to take a new rider back to Seattle the fare originates in SeaTac and so doesn't benefit from the Seattle law requiring higher pay. Few drivers expect their line of work to be lucrative during the pandemic. Many drivers have stopped driving altogether fearing being in a confined space with a stranger in the time of Covid-19. Drivers who have continued working say the small raises help now and will help even more when the economy comes back. Driver Jamel Jara says he notices the increase most when he's giving very short trips. ""Before sometimes they pay you $2.97 for very short trips"" he said. ""But starting in January in Seattle the minimum payment is $5.00. It's a big change.""

Jara said it doesn't seem like much but those short trips add up quickly. Jara said he will use the money to buy food for his family and for his education (he's studying computer science). The higher pay is being phased in and will be at full strength by April. Uber worries the higher fares will scare off riders. ""There's every reason to believe that per trip earning the amount you're earning going from downtown Seattle to SeaTac is going to go up because you're earning more per minute and you're earning more per mile"" said Harry Hartfield an Uber spokesperson. ""The big question is what's going to happen to weekly and monthly earnings"" he said. ""If you're making more per trip but you're doing fewer trips you're not actually making more on a weekly or monthly basis. So we just need to see what the long-term impact is on trip volume before we can see the full impact of the law.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8va3ItYXNpYS5jb20vcmVjeWthbC1pcy1pbmRpYXMtdWJlci1vZi13YXN0ZS1jb2xsZWN0aW9uLXN0YXJ0dXAtc3Rvcmllc9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmtyLWFzaWEuY29tL3JlY3lrYWwtaXMtaW5kaWFzLXViZXItb2Ytd2FzdGUtY29sbGVjdGlvbi1zdGFydHVwLXN0b3JpZXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recykal is India’s Uber of waste collection | Startup Stories,"Hyderabad-based serial entrepreneur Abhay Deshpande likes to say he has always ventured into sectors before they become the next hot thing.

In 1998 Deshpande started what might have been India’s first e-commerce website Malamall.com which was essentially an online marketplace for ethnic wear brands. With a dash of pride Deshpande told KrASIA the market was not ready for the site. Even though Malamall didn’t do well he learned a lot from running the business.

His next startup formed in 2007 was a software-as-a-service company called Martjack which he again claimed was one of the first homegrown SaaS companies in India. Deshpande said Martjack worked with companies like Pizza Hut Walmart and Future Group. Eight years later he sold it to Capillary Technologies.

Afterwards Deshpande got into venture capital investment. This was a time when tech startups were the talk of the town. VC firms from the United States and China were making investments in the country. However the entrepreneur-turned-investor was not comfortable in his role as a VC. Deshpande still had at least one startup in him and didn’t yet want to hang up his boots as someone who starts and runs a business.

Deshpande did some research and decided that waste management an industry estimated to be worth USD 14 billion in India by 2025 could be the next big thing for him.

Along with his former associates Abhishek Deshpande and Anirudha Jalan Deshpande started Recykal in 2017 a waste collection company that works with ragpickers who collect waste from residential houses and deposit refuse at recycling centers. To streamline the process Recykal launched an app called Uzed where individuals can schedule waste pickups.

However the unit economics for Uzed weren’t sound. “Households are not massive waste generators on a daily basis and the amount of waste we were collecting wasn’t enough for recyclers” said Deshpande founder and CEO of Recykal.

Recycling waste involves multiple parties—ragpickers waste collection centers municipalities recyclers and bulk waste generators that include schools hotels restaurants factories and shopping complexes.

Deshpande realized one product or app could not cover everyone’s needs and particularities. As Recykal rejigged its business Deshpande realized that he should approach bulk waste generators who can provide at least 10 kilos of trash per day. That way it would be economically viable for the company as well as maintain a steady supply for recyclers.

In 2019 Recykal pivoted to a B2B model where it built products for everyone involved in recycling.

Recykal created a new app for companies to send waste pickup requests that include details such as the quantities and types of garbage. The company then sends ragpickers who transport this waste to different collection centers where it is sorted.

Then Recykal created a marketplace to connect waste collection centers and recyclers. Deshpande said this channeled six to 20 tons of waste each month to recyclers giving them a steady stream of raw materials for their business. The company works with 160 recyclers across 25 states and claims to have facilitated the recycling of over 30000 metric tons of plastic waste.

What encouraged Recykal’s pivot was the Indian government’s rule on plastic waste management that introduced extended producer responsibility or EPR in 2016. This mandates all companies that generate plastic waste to ensure they collect and recycle a certain percentage of it.

“These brands didn’t know who to connect with to take care of EPR and since we already had a marketplace we created an EPR tool for brands. They create their target on the platform which we ensure is met within the stipulated time and once it’s done they can file the details with the government through our EPR tool” Deshpande said.

Recykal works with more than 75 brands such as Coke Pepsi Unilever LG and Panasonic.

In addition to marketplaces the company has also built a cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) tool for dry waste collection centers. It is used by more than 2000 clients.

Currently Recykal only collects paper plastic and electronic waste. This year it is looking to expand its operations in two new categories—rubber and batteries. “These are the two categories where the government is looking to bring EPR” Deshpande said.

In late 2020 the company raised an undisclosed amount of money from Circulate Capital a Singapore-based firm. Recykal is looking to raise USD 10–14 million in its Series A round.

“I started this company because since I had made good money from the last business I wanted to get into a space that could make me more money as well as create value for the society” Deshpande said.

“My background is a scientific one: I am an engineer in agronomy” said Viguier-Hovasse who graduated from the Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon with a specialty in the genetics of plants and vegetables. “My passion is biology in general and it started very early in childhood.”

Studies took her to various tropical and emerging countries but then she was drawn by L’Oréal’s focus on science and research and innovation for a career. So Viguier-Hovasse sent her résumé to the group’s laboratories hoping to land a job there.

“A guy from human resources told me: ‘No you have to do marketing. I’m pretty sure you’re good for marketing’” said Viguier-Hovasse who took a bit of persuading before acquiescing.

That was in 1997 when she joined the group and spent six months in sales. There were stints at L’Oréal Paris cosmetics Gemey-Maybelline and Gemey-Maybelline Garnier in France. She served as general manager of LaScad for four years during which time Cadum was purchased and integrated.

Viguier-Hovasse was president of Carita and Decléor International and Garnier’s global brand president for more than four years while repositioning it in the natural space. She became general manager of L’Oréal Paris in June 2019 marking the first time a woman held the role.

Here the executive discusses the mass market key goals and what she loves best about the beauty business.

L’Oréal Paris returned to growth in 2020 despite the sluggish makeup segment. How is each product category performing now?

The brand is beating the market this year clearly and accelerated in the second semester. Hair color has really been the driver followed by skin care and hair care. The only category which remains difficult is makeup.

Unfortunately most of the salons have been closed in the world during the pandemic. For me it has been a wake-up call to see how much consumers are attached to the hair-color category. People who decide to fight their grays move from salon to at-home hair color very quickly.

We are starting to develop a lot of digital tools to explain how to use hair color at home. We very quickly rolled them out. The market took off extremely quickly. It has been a fantastic digital transformation.

Skin care and hair care were dynamic and not so much affected by the pandemic. People tend to buy more on e-commerce because some drugstores have been closed. But still we stay on a very good trend in hair care and skin care especially in China the U.S. and Brazil. The three big countries have been dynamic.

Of course we struggle on makeup. You wear a mask stay at home and so put less makeup on. I realize how much long-wear is important — non-transfer lipstick and foundation. We put our energy back on the long-wear makeup category and also on makeup that becomes more caring — adding hyaluronic acid in our True Match Foundation. I hope to turn makeup very quickly back to growth again.

How are you seeing the mass-market channel evolving for beauty overall?

The mass market will stay very dynamic because having accessible beauty products is a right for everyone.

We have a lot to do in the emerging and developed world. We will transform the consumer experience with more online plus offline. Very often the consumer even before buying a product in brick-and-mortar is searching Googling trying the products with virtual try-on tools. So we have to make an experience which is much more integrated.

E-commerce is booming everywhere so we accompany this trend by having products well-adapted to the channel with a lot of added tools for the consumer to try and discover products.

What does the huge acceleration of e-commerce due to the pandemic portend for mass-market beauty overall looking ahead?

There’s a practical reason you buy your beauty at the same time you buy your food in brick-and-mortar stores so it will last. And I think we have many opportunities to make a better experience there.

I often compare that to the music industry. Sometimes you hear [prerecorded] music and sometimes you go to a concert. When you go to a concert you have a 3D experience which is very different and you never forget. For a consumer that has a physical experience with a brand it’s something she’s more likely to remember. So that physical contact with the brand is still very important and we have to make this experience more pleasurable for the consumer whether it’s having some specific retail store branded L’Oréal Paris in China or a fantastic pop-up. Brick-and-mortar still has a future.

We have to make e-comm more sustainable making sure that we group consumer purchases in one box made with sustainable packaging delivered with electric transportation.

It’s more difficult to make the consumer discover new products online. Very often on e-commerce people are buying star products they know very well. You want to make the consumer navigate into the range and discover new products but by definition new products are smaller at the beginning. So they aren’t ranking high in the algorithm of our clients in e-comm. It’s where I need to find a way to make the consumer discover new products and have a great experience.

There’s a premiumization of mass in the U.S. like with the deal between Ulta Beauty and Target. What are the ramifications of this for mass-market beauty players?

We are observing a valorization of the U.S. market with specific lines that are more expensive because they are more concentrate or professional or differently formulated. We are seeing a kind of stretch in the price scale of the U.S. beauty market.

You still need to have accessible products but we saw in the U.S. that the valorized range of L’Oréal Paris is doing extremely well. For example on hair care we have a sulfate-free range called EverPure. It’s more expensive to produce because of the formulas. It is between one-and-a-half and twice the price of a current shampoo by milliliters.

We have skin care which is also stretched to a more expensive price because we’ve launched a serum highly concentrated in retinol and hyaluronic acid. We just launched in the U.S. and it already has 1 percent market share. It’s sold between 25 and 30 euros.

The U.S. is a very expert competitive market. Women there are super aware of what’s happening. There is a need and a demand from the consumer to have efficient and very specific products in the mass market but they are at an accessible price compared to the other channels.

E-commerce globally has blurred the lines. You used to have consumers buying only in selective or professional channels for hair care for example. With e-commerce everything is a bit mixed — on Amazon some Ulta e-comm platforms or even in Ulta brick-and-mortar — consumers also discover new brands that could be more accessible or expensive.

We have seen the consumer is circulating much more from one channel to another. The mass retailers saw that so they are also wanting to have different brands — more expensive — to really animate that and follow this trend.

It’s a bit the same in China where the competition between luxury and mass market has existed for a long time. L’Oréal Paris is really navigating from a luxury consumer to a more mass-market consumer. We are the luxury brand of the mass market.

How is L’Oréal Paris’ e-commerce activity developing in the U.S.?

We are growing by triple digits over there. We are ahead of the market but also surfing this massive wave of acceleration of e-commerce in the U.S. It’s true the U.S. were much less developed than China on e-commerce but they are catching up.

What are your top three priorities for L’Oréal Paris in 2021?

The brand’s mission: women’s empowerment — that we aid women to achieve their goals — is for me the number-one priority of the brand. The pandemic has been very difficult for many women on the planet. They have been the ones who very often provide home-schooling who sometimes stay at home in a very difficult context.

The reason that I came on the brand beside the science was its mission of women’s empowerment. We have this cause Stand Up Against Street Harassment. My new goal is to train 2 million people by the end of 2022 [on the issue].

My number-two priority is skin care. In this pandemic moment restoring the skin barrier making sure you have skin in the best condition possible is very important for the consumer.

And then hair color hair care and returning makeup to growth. But I’d rather say I will create strong innovative products in every category. More than thinking about categories themselves I’d rather think about the big star products that can be bestsellers in e-commerce and brick-and-mortar. People are not buying categories. They are buying good products.

I really want [my teams] to work on star products on pillars even if they have existed for a long time making sure they are widely distributed that we renovate the formula and ensuring they are very strong on e-commerce.

If other products of the category are struggling they have to be compensated by these top 15 or 20 products globally worldwide.

The consumer is not buying a brand she’s buying products she loves within a brand.

L’Oréal Paris has been expanding with its own retail doors in some markets and in travel retail. Do these remain relevant channels looking ahead for the brand?

We don’t want to compete with our retailers with our retail stores. They are a communication tool. For the consumer it’s the way to experience the full brand. There is not a lot of opportunity for my consumer to see the brand as a whole with all the categories.

Travel retail is important to me because L’Oréal Paris is the only accessible mass-market brand in the channel. It’s a way to show that L’Oréal Paris is a different mass-market brand. We are a player on the field of luxury with accessible prices.

Is travel retail booming this year? Of course not. But it will come back and we will be there.

What do you love best about the business of beauty?

The power you are giving to the consumer. You are giving women armor. My mission is to give them products to make them stronger.

Do you have any mentors?

At L’Oréal we work in partnership. When you struggle in your business the worst thing to do at L’Oréal is to isolate yourself. That is why when I had difficulties transforming the Garnier brand — it is a natural brand for everyone but that was not the case six years ago — I was helped by many people. By my labs that transformed the formulas my managers like Nicolas Hieronimus or Alexis Perakis-Valat who help me a lot; Alexandra Palt who taught me about sustainability and helped me so much with the Stand Up mission and by Lubomira Rochet [the chief digital officer]. I would say more than mentors I really have supporters.

How do you relax?

I’m afraid I don’t relax so much. I read a lot do a lot of sports. I have the chance to have a great family — great kids. I don’t know if I “relax” with them but for sure they give me energy youth and courage. And my husband of course.

What is your favorite question to ask during an interview?

I like to ask: “What have been your difficulties and how did you face them?”

Maybelline’s new Sky High Mascara hit shelves just a few short weeks ago and has already sold out at stockists worldwide (including four times at Ulta!) in part thanks to its virality.

The product gained traction online after TikTok user @jess.c.eid posted a sponsored video with Maybelline showing off her before and after results. The startling outcome— full thick and very long jet black lashes— started a trend on beauty TikTok prompting makeup lovers across the platform to “stitch” their first impression using the mascara with the 19-year-old’s initial video.

With thousands of impressive user results and 63 million views on the #SkyHighMascara hashtag since Jessica’s video Maybelline’s latest drop has reached cult-status practically overnight.

So now that we know it works here’s everything you need to know about the viral mascara sweeping our TikTok FYP.

Where can I buy the Maybelline Sky High Mascara?

This drugstore fave is available for purchase at most Maybelline stockists but as we know it sells out quickly! In Australia it’s available at Adore Beauty Amazon Big W Chemist Warehouse Coles Kmart lookfantasic Oz Hair and Beauty Priceline RY and Woolworths but we recommend checking availability online first before venturing into your local.

How much does the Maybelline Sky High Mascara cost?

It seems the Maybelline Sky High Mascara will run you anywhere from $12-$23 depending on your local currency— a serious bargain for such seriously fab lashes.

What kind of wand does the Maybelline Sky High Mascara have?

The Maybelline Sky High Mascara comes with a rubber wand that slightly tapers at the tip to help with precision application. The bush itself is flexible with long rubber bristles to avoid picking up globs of product like stubby rubber brushes tend to do.

How to apply the Maybelline Sky High Mascara

A major reason this mascara went viral is because of the application process. According to TikTok users will get the best results with three full coats— waiting until each coat dries tacky before applying the next.

How does the Maybelline Sky High Mascara wear?

While mascara will wear differently on everyone depending on lid shape eye sensitivity and how much oil your skin produces around the eyes most users agree that the Maybelline Sky High Mascara has little-to-no fall out and rarely transfers or smudges on the lid.

(The ballot measure failed.) At the time United said

United is deeply committed to promoting diversity equity and inclusion within our company as well as endorsing political action that supports furthering those efforts in citizens’ everyday lives. …As an organization made of a diverse workforce we are proud to support legislation that furthers the success of underrepresented communities.

When United furloughed 16000 employees they didn’t use race as a factor. However this fall they did commit to choosing board members based on race.

Now they’re reminding employees about United Airlines speech codes which threaten termination for criticizing anyone on social media on the basis of a protected category.

We work to promote a safe and inclusive environment. It’s valuable to bring together people from different backgrounds who express different views but we need to pay attention to our words and how they may impact our diverse population of employees and customers. It’s not okay to say (or post) things that are offensive or racially charged. This applies when using social media when posting comments on Flying Together and when simply having conversations. And where social media is concerned it doesn’t matter whether your post is public or within a closed group – nothing on the internet is truly private or anonymous. Use common sense and good judgment and if you have any doubt about whether or not what you’re saying or posting may be offensive you probably want to avoid it. …It’s never okay to criticize others on the basis of race gender age or any other protected category. This includes conduct within the workplace as well as outside of the workplace and on social media. We take this very seriously. Employees who violate this policy may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

At United Airlines if you aren’t sure whether someone might think your speech is offensive then you aren’t supposed to say it. For the record Luc Bondar as a MileagePlus member I find talk of devaluation offensive. I’m not usually in favor of chilling speech but if it avoided mileage devaluations I’d change my mind.

United Airlines has transformed itself into the woke hub-and-spoke carrier.

Each year sees a small number of airlines close up shop for any number of reasons but last year had the pandemic to speed some along.

A surprise announcement in February that the promising Qatar Airways-backed Air Italy would be liquidated set the stage for a year of losses even before lockdowns grounded the world's airlines. And while the coronavirus was well-known by then its destructive power in the airline industry was still yet to be realized.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

In the US all 11 major airlines remained intact but smaller regional carriers folded amid an unprecedented drop in passengers that remains low even into the new year. Three carriers operating flights on behalf of larger carriers both closed up shop after their services were no longer required by the majors costing thousands of jobs in the industry amid an already grim period of furloughs.

Brett Snyder of the aviation blog CrankyFlyer's yearly list of ""airlines we lost"" that reveals just how many didn't live to see the new year.

UPS teamed up with re:loom and Best Friends Animal Society’s Lifesaving Center in Atlanta.

“The last thing we wanted to do was to dump the old uniforms in a landfill” said UPS Director of Sustainability Patrick Browne. “That’s why we’re so happy to partner with these amazing nonprofits to give them a second life and do something special here.”

The Initiative for Affordable Housing nonprofit re:loom trains homeless and low-income individuals to make hand-woven products from excess textiles. These employees refashioned the uniforms into some 1200 dog leashes.

“Generous donations like this one from UPS help us change the lives of Atlanta families by providing housing training and steady jobs” said Lisa Wise the Executive Director at the Initiative for Affordable Housing.

The brown leashes will be used at the Best Friends Animal Society’s Lifesaving Center and go home with adopted dogs.

“I love these” said Candy Maciel of Best Friends Animal Society. “We’re so appreciative of UPS’s generous donation and the work of the skilled weavers at re:loom; and we can’t wait to send them out with our dogs to their new homes.”

“And as a pet lover myself I’m thrilled to see these awesome upcycled leashes benefitting not only our families but also Best Friends Animal Society” said Lisa.

Watch how “upcycling” is helping keep tails wagging.

The second American Civil War is here.

No official announced Trump’s Civil War. That’s why our major news organizations dance around the awful truth using confusing language.

But we don’t need a press release to recognize Trump directed white supremacist followers to attack a branch of our national government on Jan. 6. The treasonous assault on Congress capped years of also undermining the judiciary and the executive branch’s intelligence law enforcement and health agencies.

Trump apologists will quarrel with the word directed. Yes Trump spoke as he often does out of four sides of his mouth when he said he would march with the throng to our Capitol. Recordings show people shouting they were invited by the president and doing his will. It is the message the mob understood that matters as well as video during the siege where Trump expressed love for the insurrectionists.

That Trump will not attend the inauguration of Joe Biden should make you shudder. Without him on the outdoor platform rebels hellbent on overthrowing our government could assassinate Biden and incoming Vice President Kamala Harris with no risk to messianic and delusional Trump.

We face danger from more than the lawless Trump mob that attacked our Capitol.

This is why police and National Guard will flood that zone on Jan. 20. And it explains why Biden and Harris insist on being sworn in outdoors to signal fear has no place in the land of the free and home of the brave.

And it’s not just government buildings that require extra protection from disloyal and self-righteous Americans who love Trump more than our Constitutional liberties. Mosques synagogues and some churches especially Black churches will be vulnerable to attack by those who want to make America white again. Many claim to be Christians but are in fact the embodiment of evil.

Trump’s mob will not win this war. No matter what buildings they attack what leaders they assassinate they cannot win because there are not enough of them to destroy the United States of America in favor of a dictatorship under Trump his children or anyone else.

Making America Endure

Eager and willing as Trump’s army is to assassinate for perceived betrayal outgoing Vice President Mike Pence as well as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Biden and Harris our freedom and continuity of our government does not hinge on any individual.

Our nation endures so long as we sustain a broad and deep commitment to the five noble objectives of the Constitution articulated in our Preamble. Each objective is designed to perfect our union over time.

If you don’t know the Preamble please click here and read the 52 words again and again until you memorize them. Take note that riches neither are mentioned nor implied. Liberty the general welfare and justice are along with their byproducts peace and tranquility.

Even though the outcome of Trump’s Civil War is certain Trump’s band of domestic terrorists can and already have imposed enormous and lasting damage.

These true believers in Trumpian rule can dissuade many from peaceful and joyful mingling in houses of worship government buildings sports arenas and political venues. While Biden and Harris are brave millions will hold back because of their rational fear of violent attack. Doubt that? How eager are you to visit on vacation or ride a bus in Jerusalem? Kabul? Baghdad?

Our nation’s capital is an armed camp today. So are the downtowns of many of our state capitals. Law enforcement and the intelligence community sift through plots organized on the Internet in the hope of disrupting attacks before they occur. The police and soldiers are backups for the inevitable failures to prevent attacks.

Among the Attackers

We also need to recognize we face danger beyond the lawless Trump mob.

We now know the insurgents attacking our Capitol included rogue active-duty military and police officers. Dozens of people on FBI terrorist watch lists were among the attackers evidently not being watched at all closely. There are disturbing indications some members of Congress Republicans all may have helped the attackers reconnoiter the Capitol pointing out hidden offices of Democratic Party leaders.

One Republican lawmaker openly encouraged rebellion. Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama outfitted in camo riled up the Trumpian mob before its attack. Another Republican Lauren Boebert of Colorado tweeted out the location of Pelosi who was then being hunted by the mob. A Boebert text described a plan to put a bullet in Pelosi’s head on TV. Think about what America would be like today had the insurgents assassinated leaders by firing squad or hanging them from the gallows they set up outside the Capitol.

Brooks and Boebert must be expelled from the House. Failure to do this will only give succor to others tempted by traitorous opportunity.

Democratic lawmakers who reported seeing pre-siege extremist Republicans giving guided tours to insurgency leaders are worried the riot had even further traitorous inside help. Coming investigations will tell us the facts especially if prosecutors are smart about leveraging cooperation in return for less severe sentences.

That we may have a Fifth Column in Congress immediately alarmed unwitting collaborators from the dominant economic force in America big corporations. From American Express and AT&T to Tyson Foods and United Parcel Service many big companies stopped at least for now aiding and abetting with money these faithless enemies of America.

We live in strange times when we need help from soulless corporations to defend our liberties. To be sure they acted out of self-interest. Under a dictatorship corporate directors and executives would be forced to bend to the will of an unelected and unaccountable autocrat who could eviscerate their privileges and plunder their wealth.

Disloyalty and oath-breaking by officials also marked the 1860s when some representatives senators and federal judges used their power to wage war on the United States. Until they were stopped. Texas lawyer Barbara Radnofsky tells some of this compellingly in her concise book A Citizen’s Guide to Impeachment.

Our Noble Purpose

The costs of Trump’s Army waging war on our government will drain resources from improving America from perfecting our union.

To secure our safety National Guard troops sleep on the cold marble floors of America’s Capitol. Fences and walls are becoming ubiquitous a twisted outgrowth of Trump’s lie that he would build a wall. Other barriers metal detectors and other protections against domestic terrorists are abounding.

Trump’s Civil War did not begin with the murderous attack on our Capitol. It dates to at least August 2017 when his violent thugs marched in Charlottesville Va. shouting Nazi slogans. “Jews will not replace us” and “blood and soil” they chanted while marching past a synagogue. The next day one of them drove his car into a crowd killing Heather Heyer the first fatality in Trump’s Civil War.

What these rebels heard the next day what instilled them with bravado was not Trump’s confusing comparison of anti-Semitic racists and the counter-demonstrators but this line about themselves: “very fine people.”

Don’t make the mistake of thinking there is no Second Civil War just because all is peaceful where you are. Six days before rebels bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12 1861 The New York Times reported that an attack was imminent. But once the fighting began there was no battle of Grand Rapids no skirmish in Rochester no siege in Cincinnati. In some states such as Oregon all regular Army were withdrawn and volunteers maintained military outposts and kept watch on Confederacy sympathizers.

That is how wars take place. People may be sipping espresso in sidewalk cafes or picnicking beside a stream while soldiers fire on one another within earshot.

As we prosecute this war on Trump’s militias and half-organized renegade insurgents we must give no quarter in terms of criminal prosecution especially for seditious conspiracy and murder. Where they fire their arms we must respond with lethal force as the laws of war allow. But we must be better than the attackers.

We must take care not to give Trump’s army a perverse victory by destroying the soul of America by losing sight of our nation’s great purpose. We must not descend into a militarized safety zone.

Instead we must build up the institutions we have damaged with decades of malign neglect—schools colleges public health and more. We need law enforcement to act as guardians instead of warriors. Even restoration is needed of public furniture to parks and bridges making life pleasant and commerce efficient.

We must make our union more perfect through caring for our citizens providing the tools for stable and prosperous lives and vigorous debate about the way we want to order our liberty.

We must keep in our hearts and our politics the fundamental purpose of our government—to ennoble the human spirit with liberty and fraternity so that our people can attain the best that our nature makes possible.

Korea's parliament rubber stamps new development plans,"SEOUL South Korea (AP) — North Korea’s rubber-stamp parliament has passed decisions made by a major ruling party meeting where leader Kim Jong Un vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent and established plans to salvage the country's battered economy.

The North’s Korean Central News Agency said Monday that members of the Supreme People’s Assembly during Sunday’s meeting unanimously supported the development plans for the next five years that were revealed during the Workers’ Party congress that ended last week.

The assembly also approved a major reshuffle of the Cabinet which Kim had criticized over failures in economic policies. KCNA said six of the Cabinet’s eight premiers were replaced.

North Korean premier Kim Tok Hun who has led the Cabinet since August after his predecessor was sacked said during a speech at the assembly that “serious mistakes” were observed while the Cabinet implemented the previous five-year development plan that ended last year.

Reports and images from state media suggested Kim Jong Un did not attend the assembly. State media also didn’t mention a reshuffling of the State Affairs Commission the government’s highest decision-making body that is led by Kim.

Meetings of the Supreme People’s Assembly are usually brief annual affairs that are intended to approve budgets formalize personnel changes and rubber-stamp policy priorities set by Kim and the ruling party leadership.

During the party congress Kim called for accelerated national efforts to build a military arsenal that could viably target Asian U.S. allies and the American homeland and announced a long wish-list of new sophisticated assets including longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles nuclear-powered submarines spy satellites and tactical nuclear weapons.

But it’s unclear whether North Korea is fully capable of developing such systems. While the country is believed to have accumulated dozens of nuclear weapons outside estimates of the exact status of its nuclear and missile program vary widely.

The North showcased some of its most advanced strategic assets during a nighttime military parade on Thursday including what appeared to be a new ballistic missile that is being developed to be be fired from submarines.

In an article published last week on 38 North a website specializing in North Korea studies analyst Michael Elleman said that the new missile was similar in size with another submarine-launched ballistic missile the North rolled out during a parade in October. He noted that the new missile which the North designated as “Pukguksong-5” had a payload shroud that was slightly longer than the previous one.

Story continues

“These dimensional similarities indicate North Korea is still in the process of settling on a specific design for its next-generation SLBM” said Elleman who projected the Pukguksong-5 to have a possible range of around 3000 kilometers (1860 miles) when completed.

But “there have been no reports of North Korea ground testing large solid-rocket motors recently another indication that the Pukguksong-5 design remains on the drawing board"" he said.

Analysts say Kim with his repeated hardline comments is trying to pressure the incoming U.S administration of Joe Biden who inherits stalled nuclear talks from President Donald Trump that imploded over disagreements over sanctions and disarmament.

Kim also used the congress to announce new national development plans for the next five years to salvage his broken economy. Some analysts say the prolonged sanctions combined with pandemic-related border closures and natural disasters that wiped out crops last year are possibly setting conditions for an economic perfect storm in the North that destabilizes markets and triggers public panic and unrest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8yMC1vbGQtZGotc2NoZXItc29jaWFsLTEyMDAwMDAyMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20-Year-Old DJ Scher Is a Social Media Influencer Helping Others Achieve Insane Growth,"LOS ANGELES CA / ACCESSWIRE / January 17 2021 / David Scher or DJ Scher as most people know him has been helping brands unlock extraordinary growth on social media platforms like Instagram.

The North Carolina State Parks system began in 1916 with the preservation of the summit of Mount Mitchell. It was the first State Park in the Southeast and among the first in the nation. There are now 41 North Carolina State Parks throughout three different regions — coastal Piedmont (plains) and mountain.

The parks are diverse in nature but each one is naturally wonderful and scenic. Across the state you’ll find beaches lakes swamps sand dunes rock formations rivers streams and waterfalls.

North Carolina’s parks offer opportunities for a host of activities for the outdoor enthusiast including hiking camping picnicking nature study and environmental education. Each park offers free interpretive programs by rangers on a regular basis.

It doesn’t matter if you hike walk bike swim or ride. There’s something out there for you to enjoy and experience. Here are my picks for some of the most fabulous state parks in the North Carolina coastal region.

1. Dismal Swamp South Mills

In an area rich in history the northernmost coastal state park Dismal Swamp is the largest remaining swamp in the eastern United States.

Here visitors will find a unique wilderness experience. The abundance of wildlife at Dismal Swamp is probably the largest of the coastal parks. Visitors may see anything from wild turkey raccoon and deer to bobcat gray fox and even black bear.

The park features 20 miles of trails for hiking and biking. The Swamp Boardwalk is a wonderful half-mile wooden loop trail perfect for kids and mature visitors. Canoeing and kayaking as well as fishing are favorite activities on the park’s 22-mile canal. A launch ramp is conveniently located near the parking lot. Visitors may bring their own equipment or rent at the park.

Accessible parking and restrooms are available. The Swamp Boardwalk visitor center auditorium and exhibits are all accessible.

2. Jockey’s Ridge Nag’s Head

Located near the infamous Kill Devil Hills on the Outer Banks Jockey’s Ridge is home to the tallest sand dune on the Atlantic coast. It is a prime location for kite-flying and watching sunsets. The scenic views range from the Atlantic Ocean to the Roanoke Sound.

Hang gliders can sail the same skies as Wilbur and Orville Wright did long ago. The high sand dunes and year-round winds are ideal for this sport. Hang gliding lessons are available through a vendor in the park. Experienced hang gliders must have a current USHPA membership and get a flying permit at the visitor center.

The sound side of the park is a different experience offering sunbathing wading paddling and a 1-mile nature trail that opens onto wetlands grassy dunes and maritime thickets.

Visitors with mobility restrictions can ride in an ATV with park staff to the top of the dunes or out to the beach. Reservations are required. Shoes are highly recommended in the sand.

3. Pettigrew Creswell

Pettigrew State Park is perhaps one of North Carolina’s most interesting parks due to it being mostly a lake — 16000-acre Lake Phelps the second largest natural lake in the state. The lake is fed mainly by rainfall (not streams) making it one of the clearest and cleanest lakes in the state.

Located on a peninsula between the Albemarle Sound and the Scuppernong River Pettigrew is a fisherman’s dream. The shallow waters are home to bass yellow perch pickerel catfish and pumpkinseed. Anglers can fish from boats or from the shoreline fishing pier and boardwalk.

There are two hiking and biking trails in the park both rated easy. Canoe trails on Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River allow paddlers to get up close to the local environment.

Picnicking and swimming are also favorite activities for summer visitors. Picnic tables and grills are situated under the cool shade of the cypress trees. Water and restrooms are nearby. Designated swim areas are near both picnic areas.

The Boardwalk Trail and the fishing pier are both wheelchair accessible. Accessible parking and restrooms are provided.

History buffs will find much to explore in the area on land and in the water. Many Native American artifacts have been found including 30 dugout canoes sunken in the lake one of which is over 400 years old.

4. Goose Creek Washington

Just a short drive from the historic towns of Bath and Washington Goose Creek State Park is a haven for birds and bird watching. The visitor center has a bird-watching observation station to facilitate the viewing of hundreds of bird varieties. In addition to a variety of birds the park has a vibrant butterfly garden full of native plants.

Outdoor activities in the same waters that Blackbeard was said to have traversed include boating sailing paddling fishing and swimming. A boat ramp and separate paddling launch are located at the north end of the park across Goose Creek. Swimmers will enjoy a sandy swim beach on the south end of the park.

Landlubbers will be pleased with over eight miles of hiking trails and three separate picnic areas. Rated “easy” the trails lead visitors through a variety of coastal experiences — live oaks draped in Spanish moss wetlands and a cypress swamp. There is an accessible boardwalk trail as well.

Camping is available at Goose Creek at two campgrounds a 22-space area for RVs and trailers and a smaller more secluded tent-only site. Six camper cabins are also available. One cabin is accessible.

5. Hammocks Beach Swansboro

A unique state park in the barrier islands 20 miles east of Jacksonville Hammocks Beach State Park is a crown jewel on the North Carolina coast. A passenger ferry (or private boat) transports visitors from the mainland area to Bear Island which provides oceanside camping swimming and picnicking. Visitors can also reach Bear Island by canoe or kayak which are available for rent or bring your own.

Kayak canoe or paddleboard to explore water trails leading to marshes Bear Island or Huggins Island which is graced with unspoiled maritime forest. Hike the four mainland hiking trails or along the beach on Bear Island.

Fishing for drum flounder trout and bluefish is a favorite pastime at Bear Island. There is no fishing on the mainland.

At the mainland visitor center there are interpretive programs and exhibits that teach about park ecology and wildlife including endangered sea turtles and nesting shorebirds.

6. Fort Macon Atlantic Beach

American history buffs will love Fort Macon State Park. The 424-acre park has multiple facets including a perfectly restored Civil War-era fort. Construction of the fort goes back to as early as 1826. The stone jetties were a project of Robert E. Lee in the 1840s.

Visitors can explore the five-sided brick and stone fort on their own or join a guided tour. When the weather is hot you’ll enjoy the extensive museum’s indoor exhibits and gift shop. Fun for the whole family are the cannon and musket demonstrations that are held daily.

At the tip of Bogue Banks 20 miles east of Jacksonville the park offers unlimited natural beauty and opportunities to explore salt marshes estuaries and sand dune fields. Other park activities include a coastal education center hiking picnicking and bird watching. The peninsula’s 1.5-mile shoreline offers swimming fishing and beachcombing. You might even spot some dolphins playing offshore.

A bathhouse and wheelchair-accessible beachside areas are available. Visitors can spend the day or just a few hours.

7. Carolina Beach Near Wilmington

Located just twelve miles from downtown Wilmington Carolina Beach State Park is a popular coastal attraction on the Cape Fear River. There are nine “easy” hiking trails traversing through a variety of natural habitats. A half-mile boardwalk trail is host to a variety of carnivorous plants including the rare Venus flytrap the only place in the country where they grow wild.

A nearby marina with two public boat ramps provides access to some of North Carolina’s best fishing spots. Visitors can also fish from the park’s shore or wooden fishing deck. In addition to hiking and fishing the park offers kayaking and paddling picnicking and a secluded camping area beneath towering trees with 79 campsites and four cabins.

The park is wheelchair accessible throughout including the fishing deck Venus flytrap trail and some picnic and camping spots.

Older adults are among the highest-risk groups for developing cases that need hospitalization and nursing homes were especially vulnerable to outbreaks. While dealing with COVID-19 the elderly have also faced many other problems including the difficulty of accessing medical care for chronic conditions during lockdowns and isolation.

Many of these issues won’t go away after the pandemic. According to the United Nations the global population of people 65 and over is growing faster than any other age group. At the same time there is a critical shortage of caregivers especially for elderly people who want to continue living at home instead of moving into nursing homes.

Tech can help in many ways: By helping caregivers (and reducing burnout) allowing seniors to perform health monitoring at home and creating tools to combat isolation. During CES there were several “age-tech” presentations. One of the most notable was AARP Innovation Lab the nonprofit’s startup accelerator program. It presented nine companies at the virtual show.

One common theme among AARP’s group was tech that helps elderly people “age in place” or stay in their homes or communities instead of moving into a nursing home. For example Wheel Pad designs accessible home and work spaces that can be installed into existing structures and sites. Mighty Health is an app that pairs users with health coaches certified trainers and personalized nutrition plans while Zibrio a scale that assesses users’ balance to predict if they are at risk for a fall can also be incorporated into at-home routines.

Other startups from AARP Innovation Lab focus on helping caregivers too. For example FallCall Solutions’ creates Apple Watch apps that send alerts if a fall is detected and help family members check on users. Another app called Ianacare helps family members coordinate caregiving tasks and ask for support. End-of-life planning is one of the most emotionally difficult processes for families and Cake an “end-of-life platform” helps by providing tools for estate and health care planning as well as resources to help relatives cope with caregiving issues and grief.

Other startups center on medical care. For people with chronic conditions Folia Health helps monitor the progress of treatments. On the clinical side Embleema’s software allows clinical investigators to share data and design studies making pharmaceutical research more efficient.

Other noteworthy age-tech startups at CES included Nobi a smart lamp that automatically turns on when users stand up and sends alerts to family members if they fall. Nobi can also be used in residences and nursing homes.

Caregiver Smart Solutions is a multifaceted platform that makes it easier for seniors to stay at home with a machine-learning-based app for early detection of potential health issues fall sensors monitors and emergency buttons. For people with incontinence DFree a wearable device can reduce stress by monitoring how full their bladder is with an ultrasound sensor and keeping track of their average time between bathroom visits. It’s available for both consumers and healthcare facilities.

For elderly people living in nursing homes Rendever is a virtual reality platform that wants to help reduce isolation. It can be used with reminiscence therapy which guides individuals with dementia through experiences that remind them of their pasts and to allow virtual travel to landmarks. Cutii a companion robot also seeks to reduce loneliness. While companion robots have been a mainstay of CES for years Cutii sets itself apart with entertainment like music games and live events. It also has video call and night patrol features.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZWxmd2VhbHRoLmNvbS5hdS9ibG9nL21hcmtldHMtd2Vlay1haGVhZC1pcm9uLW9yZS1tYWpvcnMtdG8tcmVwb3J0LWFzLWNoaW5hLWdkcC1hbmQtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1qb2JzLWRhdGEtdGFrZS1mb2N1c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Markets Week Ahead: Iron ore majors to report as China GDP and Australian jobs data take focus,"The Australian share market is set for a dip at the open of today trading session after a weak close for the US stock market last week.

On Friday evening US banks were sold down heavily on the back of their most-recent quarterly reports despite posting earnings results that largely beat expectations. This week two of the big three iron ore miners will deliver their own results while US earnings season ramps up.

Economic calendar and news

The week ahead is headlined by a change in government administration in the US with President-elect Joe Biden set to be inaugurated. Last week he outlined his vision to support the economy announcing a US$1.9 trillion stimulus plan featuring a higher federal minimum wage as well as additional direct payments and unemployment benefits for Americans.In Australia economists will have their eyes trained on the latest consumer confidence data and more importantly employment data from December. Forecasts for the national unemployment rate have varied by some margin amid an expected uptick in the labour market participation rate however an overall increase in job numbers is anticipated according to the consensus estimate.Last but not least fourth-quarter GDP out of China is expected to all but confirm the country V-shaped recovery. Forecasts suggest that the quarter-on-quarter rate may come in at around 3% while the year-on-year result might nudge 6%.

Major movers

Having achieved a new all-time high last week and passing Telstra (ASX: TLS) by market cap in the process Afterpay (ASX: APT) will no doubt see plenty of media attention this week. While the Nasdaq could provide a weak lead for tech stocks heading into the new trading week Afterpay has continually silenced its critics and bounced off dips in its share price over the last nine months while also cementing itself as a leader in its industry.Similarly BHP (ASX: BHP) which also hit an all-time high last week will be discussed widely as it delivers its operational review for the half-year ended 31 December 2020. The report scheduled to be released on Wednesday morning will show the effects of an elevated iron ore price which has supported a rally in iron ore miners over recent months. First however Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO) will detail its fourth-quarter operations review on Tuesday morning.With Brazilian miner Vale recording yet another incident last week this time a shiploader at one of its ports catching on fire the supply dynamic within the industry is again set to be questioned amid potential export delays.Elsewhere Woodside Petroleum (ASX: WPL) and Santos (ASX: STO) will be among those handing down quarterly results with both companies lined up to publish their figures on Thursday.In other news payments terminals business Tyro (ASX: TYR) will be looking to fight back against a short seller report from last week that took aim at the company transparency in addressing its terminal outage problem. Merchants have been impacted for over a week with the slow progress in rectifying the outage seemingly weighing on the patience of shareholders last week. Despite the outage the company weekly trading update this morning showed that transaction values through its network of terminals have still increased against last year numbers.Overseas the rest of the US bank stocks will release quarterly earnings results. Among these are the big-name trio of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS).There will also be earnings reports from the likes of Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Unitedhealth Group (NYSE: UNH) as well as tech players such as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and IBM (NYSE: IBM).On this week calendar of new listings are two confirmed ipos. Chimeric Therapeutics (ASX: CHM) a biotechnology company developing a cancer cell therapy drug will list this morning after raising $35 million at $0.20 per share. It will be followed by Australian Gold and Copper (ASX: AGC) with the junior resources explorer pencilled in for a Wednesday debut on the ASX after securing $10 million in fresh capital.",,,,,,,,,
UHS,Universal Health Services,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9tZWRpY2FsLWRpc3BhdGNoL2ZpdmUtY291bnRyaWVzLWZpdmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZXMtb2YtdGhlLXBhbmRlbWlj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five Countries Five Experiences of the Coronavirus Pandemic,"Kirtiraj Rana grew up in Rajamunda a village of fewer than a thousand people in the northeastern Indian state of Odisha which faces the Bay of Bengal. A migrant worker he dropped out of school when he was in tenth grade to help support his family—his parents a brother who also dropped out and a sister who received only a fifth-grade education. Odisha’s farming revolves around its brief rainy season. Unable to find work in the off months Rana travelled with his brother to Mumbai in December of 2019. They were hired as construction workers. After buying food and clothes they managed to send half of their wages—about five hundred rupees a day or seven U.S. dollars each—back home.

Rana first heard that the coronavirus was spreading in India in early March. “We didn’t know what it was how it looked” he said. “We just knew that people were dying in Mumbai. We were very scared.” A few days later Narendra Modi the Indian Prime Minister announced one of the world’s largest and strictest lockdowns. Modi delivered his speech at 8 P.M. on March 24th; restrictions started at midnight. Millions of migrant workers were stranded without wages food or shelter. All forms of public transportation—by air rail and road—were suspended. Police arrested and sometimes beat people who remained out for nonessential activities. The lockdown initially scheduled to last three weeks was extended again and again and again through the end of May.

The contractor whom Rana worked for offered migrants a month of rations. After that Rana and his brother were on their own. They tried to wait it out. “We thought it had to end at some point” Rana said. They asked their father to send money but in early May after they’d exhausted their savings the brothers bought bicycles and along with several friends set out for Odisha—some fourteen hundred kilometres from Mumbai. They began their journey at 2 A.M. carrying rice utensils medications pots and pans; in ninety-degree weather they cycled to Nashik a town in northern Maharashtra the Indian state with the highest number of COVID cases where they were forced to spend twenty-four hours at a quarantine center along with some three hundred people. The next day petrified of catching the virus while detained Rana pleaded with the police to let them go.

It took Rana and his brother seven days and nights to get to Odisha on their bicycles. When they arrived they were quarantined near their village for a month before being allowed back home. Since then Rana has had trouble finding work both because of pandemic-related restrictions and because of the stigma attached to those returning from Maharashtra. When we spoke five months after his return home none of the men with whom he’d made his journey had managed to find work in the village.

Rana is one of roughly a hundred million migrant workers in India. The sudden lockdown by forcing their reverse migration from urban centers to rural areas almost certainly contributed to the spread of the coronavirus; it also created a humanitarian crisis reminiscent of Partition in 1947 when the subcontinent was divided into India and Pakistan and millions were forced to trek on foot from one to the other. Five weeks after Modi’s first announcement the Indian government began operating Shramik Specials—“labor trains”—to transport migrants to their home states. Crowds gathered in congested stations and packed trains ran with little regard for social distancing; still millions of migrants remain stranded and since March hundreds have died of starvation exhaustion suicide and accidents. In one video a toddler on a train platform tries to wake his dead mother tugging at the cloth covering her lifeless body.

Many migrant homecomings have been sullied by prejudice against those seen as carrying the virus from one place to another. At times this stigma has been applied to physicians; some doctors particularly women have suffered physical and verbal abuse. According to the World Health Organization India has only eight doctors for every ten thousand people. (The U.S. has twenty-six and Germany forty-two.) Even before the pandemic India had fewer than twenty per cent of the critical-care doctors required for its ordinary needs. The situation is worse in rural areas where sixty-five per cent of the population lives but only twenty per cent of the country’s doctors work. For much of September India recorded more than ninety thousand COVID-19 cases a day; while daily cases have since decreased the country still ranks third behind the U.S. and Brazil for most COVID deaths in the world. Many believe that because of its poor testing-and-reporting infrastructure the deaths are significantly undercounted. Tested or not the virus continues to spread: according to some reports more than half of those in Mumbai’s slums and a third of the people in Delhi have been infected.

It’s been a year since the novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan China. Since then it has reached every continent on the planet infecting more than ninety million people and causing two million deaths. The global economy has shrunk by more than four per cent—the largest contraction since the Second World War—as governments the world over have tried with varying degrees of success to contend with the pandemic’s staggering damage closing borders banning gatherings enforcing lockdowns and to varying degrees providing financial support and investing in testing and tracing programs. In every country people have criticized their governments. Even the best leaders have struggled to balance public-health imperatives against a host of country-specific factors: government rules political polarization economic stability health-system capacity public opinion institutional trust and the state’s history of the use and abuse of power. Government surveillance feels different in Rwanda than in Canada; individual freedom dominates Americans’ self-image but not that of South Koreans; Germany’s health-care system can withstand a deluge of COVID-19 patients in a way that India’s cannot.

Adam Oliver a professor at the London School of Economics is one of many researchers who have tracked how different countries have responded to the pandemic. Oliver thinks that our usual back-of-the-envelope way of comparing countries using a snapshot of COVID cases and deaths is of limited value. “We have to think about the non-health implications of pandemic response too” he told me. “Those are much more difficult to gauge at the moment. When you lock down businesses and citizens there are many downstream consequences. There’s an economic impact. There’s social damage. There’s loss of freedom—which especially in countries already bordering on authoritarianism could be hard to roll back. If you consider these broader implications I don’t think we’ll know the best path for years if ever.”

Oliver classifies pandemic responses into three broad sometimes overlapping categories: the quick approach the soft approach and the hard approach. Countries that took the quick approach used swift action to tamp down viral spread and were generally able to avoid prolonged lockdowns. Taiwan for example acted early and aggressively through closed borders universal mask wearing robust contact tracing and quarantines enforced with mobile-phone tracking. In a population of twenty-three million it has had fewer than nine hundred cases; for two hundred and fifty-three consecutive days between mid-April and the end of December it did not record a single locally transmitted infection. “Many Asian countries recognized very early that this was going to be much deadlier than the flu” Oliver said. “Some of their speed and effectiveness came from their experience with SARS. They had their public-health infrastructure—track-and-trace programs quarantine protocols communication strategies—pretty much ready to go.”

The second strategy—the soft approach—relies on recommendations instead of requirements. Many nations have taken this route after failing to act quickly or because they are unwilling or unable to pass mandates; instead they recommend but do not enforce mask usage closures and quarantines. Sweden is the most widely cited and widely criticized example of such a country; while its COVID-19 death toll is much higher than its Scandinavian neighbors’ it is on a par with that of many other Western democracies. Other countries have adopted the soft strategy. In Japan the constitution imposes some limits on the government’s ability to mandate behavior and so the country has relied on peer pressure and financial incentives with surprising success. Brazil because of its President’s cavalier attitude to the virus—“We need to stop being a country of sissies” he has said—has also de facto employed the soft approach.

Britain seemed to flirt with the soft option early on. Ultimately though it went with the third strategy—the hard approach—which is characterized by more aggressive government action. This approach has been adopted by most countries at one point or another and is familiar to most of us here in the United States. As cases increase and hospitals fill the government mandates masks imposes curfews prohibits large gatherings and orders lockdowns until numbers improve. In the U.S. individual states have experimented with the soft versus the hard approach and have often alternated between them. Most of Europe started hard went soft in the summer and then was forced to go hard again as infections surged in the fall. “Some countries have to take the hard approach because their health-care systems are stretched at baseline and they can’t afford a surge of cases” Oliver said. “Others have simply concluded that it’s the only way to prevent unnecessary death and suffering.” Such decisions are abstract made at a high level and yet they have human consequences. Around the world billions of people have been affected by the virus. There are more pandemic stories than we’ll ever know.

Michalis Kavadias was born and raised in Greece but moved to Germany in 2009. He works as a graphic designer but much of his time is spent managing a dive bar in Neukölln—a vibrant neighborhood in Berlin full of artists and young professionals. Kavadias’s bar Du Beast is cozy and low-key. It serves reasonably priced craft cocktails and locally brewed beers. Before the pandemic it regularly featured standup comics open-mike poetry nights and d.j. sets.

In March as the coronavirus spread across Europe and into Germany Kavadias closed the bar several days ahead of a government-mandated lockdown—the hard approach. “It was starting to get really scary” he said. For much of April—“the dark month” he called it—the bar remained shut. Kavadias learned that his aunt who lived in Italy and was previously healthy was ill with COVID-19. After weeks in the hospital she died. “The pandemic became very real for me” he said. “I really think the Italians saved our asses. They got hit so hard. It was a wake-up call for all of Europe.”

As the weather warmed and people ventured out of their homes Kavadias devised schemes to generate revenue so that he could keep his employees on the payroll. “I had to find a way to pay them” Kavadias told me. “These people are my friends.” He designed T-shirts—one which he was wearing when we spoke over Zoom read “Du Beast or Not Du Beast.” He sold two hundred to local residents which helped cover salaries at least for a time. He offered cocktails to go; people who used to frequent the bar would stop by mostly in an effort to keep it afloat. “The neighborhood was incredibly supportive” Kavadias said. “It really came together.” One day a man in his sixties who prior to the pandemic had dropped by for a beer almost every day after work—“For him it was like a cup of tea”—ordered a drink to go and left a two-hundred-euro tip.

As spring turned to summer the bar reopened with outdoor seating and patrons flooded back. “It might have been the best summer we’ve ever had” Kavadias said. “Everyone was so ready to socialize again. There’s a reason people live in Berlin: they want to have fun. This isn’t Munich or Frankfurt.” Upon entering the bar people were required to write down their names and e-mail addresses but many hesitated. “Privacy is a big issue in Germany” Kavadias said. “I said ‘Write Mickey Mouse as your name if you want. But I need a way to get in touch with you if someone ends up getting COVID here.’ ” Around that time surveys showed that nearly ninety per cent of Germans thought that their country was doing a good job of handling the pandemic; seven in ten said that the response had made them prouder of their country. Germany was seen rightfully as an exemplar of how to respond to the pandemic and its policies enjoyed high levels of public support.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9vcC1lZC8yMzU5OTYvb3AtZWQtYW4tZW5kbGVzcy10aHJlYXQtYWdhaW5zdC11bml2ZXJzYWwtaGVhbHRo0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGhha2F0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hbXAvb3Bpbmlvbi9vcC1lZC8yMzU5OTYvb3AtZWQtYW4tZW5kbGVzcy10aHJlYXQtYWdhaW5zdC11bml2ZXJzYWwtaGVhbHRo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OP-ED: An endless threat against universal health coverage,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/235996/op-ed-an-endless-threat-against-universal-health on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9vcC1lZC8yMzU5OTYvb3AtZWQtYW4tZW5kbGVzcy10aHJlYXQtYWdhaW5zdC11bml2ZXJzYWwtaGVhbHRo0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGhha2F0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hbXAvb3Bpbmlvbi9vcC1lZC8yMzU5OTYvb3AtZWQtYW4tZW5kbGVzcy10aHJlYXQtYWdhaW5zdC11bml2ZXJzYWwtaGVhbHRo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL2FwbmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLW5ld3MtaXNyYWVsLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXZhY2NpbmUtY29yb25hdmlydXMtcGFuZGVtaWMtYmVuamFtaW4tbmV0YW55YWh1LWIzMGY5YWYyMTM5ZTY0Nzk0Y2U2NmM2YzliMzY3Yjdi0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Israel trades Pfizer doses for medical data in vaccine blitz,"JERUSALEM (AP) — After sprinting ahead in the race to inoculate its population against the coronavirus Israel has struck a deal with Pfizer promising to share vast troves of medical data with the international drug giant in exchange for the continued flow of its hard-to-get vaccine.

Proponents say the deal could allow Israel to become the first country to vaccinate most of its population while providing valuable research that could help the rest of the world. But critics say the deal raises major ethical concerns including possible privacy violations and a deepening of the global divide that enables wealthy countries to stockpile vaccines as poorer populations including Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza have to wait longer to be inoculated.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who is stumping ahead of the country’s March elections as Israel’s vaccinator-in-chief — said earlier this month that he reached the deal with Pfizer’s chief executive to speed up vaccine deliveries to Israel.

“Israel will be a global model state” he said. “Israel will share with Pfizer and with the entire world the statistical data that will help develop strategies for defeating the coronavirus.”

Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told The Associated Press the government will turn over data to “see how it influences first of all the level of the disease in Israel the possibility to open the economy different aspects of social life and whether there are any effects of the vaccination.”

Pfizer’s vaccine developed with German partner BioNTech has received emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Union’s regulatory agency and is believed to provide up to 95% protection against COVID-19. But much remains unknown including its long-term protection and whether it can prevent transmission of the virus.

Israel home to some 9.3 million people is considered an ideal place for studying these questions. Its mandatory universal health care is provided by four publicly funded HMOs with meticulously digitized medical records. This centralized system has helped Israel administer more than 2 million doses of the vaccine in under a month. Israel has also purchased doses of the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines.

The inoculation blitz is a matter of national pride. It also is at the center of Netanyahu’s reelection campaign as he seeks to deflect attention from his ongoing corruption trial Israel’s deep economic crisis and the latest virus surge.

The Health Ministry has recorded over 551000 cases since the beginning of the pandemic and more than 4000 deaths. Israeli officials say they aim to have most of the country vaccinated by the end of March just around election day.

But the exact quid pro quo between Israel and Pfizer is unclear even after a redacted version of the agreement was released by the Israeli Health Ministry on Sunday.

Neither Israel nor Pfizer would say how much Israel has paid for the vaccines though Edelstein called it a “classical win-win” for both sides. Israeli media have reported that Israel paid at least 50% more than other countries. The data is reportedly being shared with the World Health Organization but the global body did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Earlier this month the head of the WHO appealed to drugmakers and wealthier countries to “stop making bilateral deals” saying they hurt a U.N.-backed effort to widen access. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus did not single out any countries or companies.

Last week Dr. Siddhartha Datta WHO Europe’s program manager for vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization said the agency is trying to collect “disaggregated” data — based on age gender local area employment and other factors — and reporting on any safety issues as the vaccines are deployed.

Israel had already announced the acquisition of millions of vaccine doses before the Pfizer deal was announced. It’s unclear how the quantity or pace of deliveries has changed or whether the vaccines have been diverted from other countries.

The arrangement has drawn attention to the unequal distribution of vaccines between rich and poor nations. A recent estimate from the International Rescue Committee said that the WHO’s global COVAX campaign is likely to vaccinate only 20% of the world’s lower-income countries by the end of 2021.

“This is a shady under-the-table deal that preferences certain countries over others without any transparency” said Lawrence Gostin a professor of global health law at Georgetown University in Washington. “In the end it’s going to be low- and middle-income countries that are going to be left behind.”

Dr. Nadav Davidovitch head of the school of public health at Israel’s Ben Gurion University and an adviser to the government on coronavirus policy said the deal has raised troubling concerns about the deepening disparity of vaccination efforts.

“In order to eradicate COVID-19 or at least control it in an efficient manner we need to see the global picture” Davidovitch said.

That disparity is particularly striking in the case of Israel and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who live under varying degrees of Israeli control and have yet to receive any vaccines.

While vaccinating its own Arab citizens and Palestinian residents of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem Israel says it is not responsible for inoculating the Palestinians. Edelstein said Israel will consider helping once it takes care of its own citizens.

But the Palestinians and major human rights groups say Israel remains an occupying power and is responsible for providing them vaccines. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh recently accused Israel of “racism” but has not publicly requested vaccines.

With tens of thousands of West Bank Palestinians working in Israel and its West Bank settlements experts say Israel should share vaccines on ethical and practical grounds.

“I truly think that we need to see how we get the vaccine for the Palestinian Authority” said Davidovitch acting chairman of Israel’s association of public health professionals. “We are talking about it with the minister of health and I really hope that soon this thing will be solved.”

It’s also uncertain exactly what information is being shared with Pfizer. According to the redacted agreement “no identifiable health information” shall be shared and the research is to be published in a recognized medical journal.

It said Israel will provide weekly data to Pfizer about various age and demographic groups. The objective it said is to “analyze epidemiological data arising from the product rollout to determine whether herd immunity is achieved after reaching a certain percentage of vaccination coverage in Israel.”

The data it added is “aimed at helping end the global COVID-19 pandemic for the benefit of all patients inside and outside of Israel.”

Privacy Israel an advocacy group that had petitioned the government to disclose the deal welcomed its release but said certain questions remained unanswered mostly about the handling and security of private information. It also blacked out certain details such as key dates and the names of officials involved. Still it said there is a “little more certainty” about sharing information with a global corporation.

Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler an expert in digital privacy at the Israel Democracy Institute questioned the ethics of a deal that could bring millions in profits to Pfizer. She also said sharing large quantities of information could still potentially put individuals’ privacy at risk even if it’s supposedly made anonymous.

“If God forbid the data set is going to be hacked then the risk is going to be yours” she said referring to Israeli citizens.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9yZWxpZ2lvbi8yMDIxLzAxLzExL2NhdGhvbGljLWdyaWVmLWpvZS1iaWRlbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Catholicism is personal not political for Joe Biden.

——–

INDIA’S healthcare remains an Achilles’ heel and continues to undermine economic progress. This is largely on account of the abysmal and chaotic healthcare system.

India ranks close to the bottom in international rankings in most health indices and performs poorly on multiple dimensions. India ranks 145th among 195 countries listed on the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ). India’s healthcare spending is at 3.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which is significantly lower than its peers such as China (5 percent) Vietnam (5.5 percent) South Africa (8.1 percent) and Japan (10.9 percent).

At least two-thirds of India’s 1.4 billion people depend on the public healthcare system but the country has only 8.5 hospital beds and 8 physicians per 10000 people. Compare this with Japan and South Korea which have 120 and 130 beds per 10000 people respectively.

While India has taken initiatives to improve access to healthcare through various public health schemes the quality of care remains low due to poor infrastructure unskilled staff and limited coordination among Healthcare Service Providers (HSPs). For example only 11 percent of sub-centers and 13 percent of Primary Health Centres meet the norms set by the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS).

COVID-19 has laid bare the realities of the weak health infrastructure in the country.

But beyond the crisis unleashed by the pandemic it is the critical solutions that were developed in its aftermath which can help reframe the future of health care for the better in our country.

Developmental Benefits of Good Healthcare

A sound health system enables countries to make the most of their strongest asset: human capital.

Physical and mental wellbeing is at the core of creating communities that thrive. Poor access to healthcare is the main impediment to poverty reduction and drives inequality. Health is a foundational investment in human capital and in economic growth.

The government’s development wisdom is now focused on identifying the strategic leverage points where successful actions will trigger many supportive reactions.

That health is a clear priority for present and future generations underpin the objective of achieving universal health coverage. It is a critical leverage point where government action can have maximum impact.

The government’s development wisdom is now focused on identifying the strategic leverage points where successful actions will trigger many supportive reactions.

The government needs to supplement curative services with preventive measures.

It must strengthen ancillary civic services like insect management water purification systems sewage systems and plants for treatment of industrial effluents and waste.

Poor hygiene and sanitation lead to pneumonia malnutrition malaria and tuberculosis across the country.

India must revitalise the public health system to ensure access outcome quality and affordability.

Making Healthcare Affordable

Poor families have long suffered the triple curse of sudden illness- the trauma associated with sickness the financial burden of intensive healthcare and the loss of wages.

Historically out-of-pocket expenditure has been a major source of financing healthcare in India. It still contributes to 70 per cent of all healthcare spending. It is no surprise then that 3-7 percent of the country’s population is pushed into poverty every year merely due to unexpected healthcare outlays. This results in less money for food education housing and long-term plans.

Community-based health insurance rather than market mediated or government-provided insurance is widely considered an appropriate way of reaching and protecting the poor.

A health event is a bigger risk to farmers than an unsuccessful crop. Once they sell their land or livestock they become indentured labourers and that takes a generation or more to fix.

Health insurance is emerging as an important financing tool in meeting the healthcare needs of the poor. In fact the poor prefer health insurance to life insurance. As they say “We die once but go to the doctor many times each year.”

By managing risks and avoiding debt those who have micro-insurance policies are in a position to protect the meagre wealth they accumulate. This helps them generate more income and even get a fair chance to rescue themselves and their families out of the mire of poverty. Community-based health insurance rather than market mediated or government-provided insurance is widely considered an appropriate way of reaching and protecting the poor.

The development of private health insurance has potential risks and benefits in terms of healthcare access for the poor. While it can result in substantial long-term welfare benefits it is also unaffordable for most low-income families.

Inaccessibility and Inefficiency of a Well Designed Healthcare System

The biggest disease burden sits on the bottom pyramid of 500 million people. They don’t have access to reliable diagnosis or proper treatment.

Another challenge for the health sector is the lack of provisions to deal with non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases cancer chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. Unlike the short-term effects of communicable diseases the dual health and economic impacts of non-communicable diseases on individuals families and households are both devastating and long-lasting. To change this requires providing a clean environment and potable water so that infectious diseases are contained to the minimum and a stress-free and healthy lifestyle is maintained to ward off the growing threat of non-communicable diseases..

However PHCs do not exist in many villages and wherever present they are so overstretched that the “access” system is broken at the first mile.

India has a mixed system of health care where most of the preventive and promotive care is provided by government health services whereas a majority of curative care is through private medical practitioners and institutions. It must be emphasized that in poor backward and traditionally bound communities it is not only a question of availability of health care facilities but the accessibility of available facilities as well.

The infrastructure for delivering primary health care has a three-tier system with sub-centers (SCs) Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and Community Health Centres (CHCs) spread across rural and semi urban areas. They are distributed based on population figures.

The sub-centers are the first point of contact. The system employs a committed cadre of Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) at SCs and PHCs along with Accredited Social Health Activists(ASHAs) – the frontline health workers.

PHCs serve as referral units for six SCs. Each must have a qualified doctor and four to six beds.

CHCs serve as referral units for four PHCs. Each CHC has four specialists — a physician a surgeon a gynecologist and a pediatrician — supported by 21 paramedical and other staff members. It has 30 indoor beds one operation theatre X-ray and labour rooms and laboratory facilities. It provides emergency obstetrics care and specialist consultation.

The system is well-designed and should normally deliver good services. However due to a shortage of resources they have less than adequate infrastructure and an overworked and ill incentivised staff.

All stakeholders now agree that increasing penetration in care delivery for chronic non-communicable diseases will require us to move away from the West’s physician-based models of healthcare delivery which favour the relatively privileged. The democratisation of this process requires us to identify resources in the community and co-opt them to improve efficiency.

Primary Health Centres (PHC) in villages are supposed to screen and feed medical cases to specialized hospitals in districts and further on to state-level specialized hospitals. However PHCs do not exist in many villages and wherever present they are so overstretched that the “access” system is broken at the first mile.

The system ought to be strengthened with public investment by supplementing their services from the private sector through a contractual mechanism that reviews the performance periodically.

The apathy of the government is reflected in a rather poor prognosis for the health system.

Improving Access to Health through Community Programmes

All stakeholders now agree that increasing penetration in care delivery for chronic non-communicable diseases will require us to move away from the West’s physician-based models of healthcare delivery which favour the relatively privileged. The democratisation of this process requires us to identify resources in the community and co-opt them to improve efficiency. To make health services more available and effective policies should remove user fees tackle discrimination foster innovations in service delivery and break down public expenditure by quintiles.

Universal health coverage will become a reality only if individuals families and communities are empowered to identify their own health needs. It is the government’s primary job to invest in a dependable state-run system and also devise regulation that keeps the players both public and private moving in a direction that serves the national interest.

Several innovative efforts in community-based health services in rural India have given people living in remote communities access to affordable preventive and primary healthcare.

Village health workers provide prenatal care monitor child immunisations and initiate self-help groups to fund cooperative business enterprises. Any visitor to a village where these community healthcare models are the primary drivers of health awareness will marvel at the ability of the health workers to connect with and explain things to women. Their lack of a degree is not a handicap it is an advantage. They know how people think because they are one of them.

Co-designing co-creating and co-owning health services are increasingly effective and scalable paths to achieving inclusive and sustainable health outcomes.

India also needs to reform the governance of public healthcare. There must be a transparent and seamless continuum of care across the spectrum from village to SC PHC sub-district hospital and finally the district hospitals.

There are around 734 district hospitals across the country which provide secondary healthcare. Additionally there are around 300 other women’s hospitals at the district level which are powerful nodes in India’s healthcare network and can be revitalized to boost the health infrastructure.

Co-designing co-creating and co-owning health services are increasingly effective and scalable paths to achieving inclusive and sustainable health outcomes. Putting people and communities in charge of their own healthcare also leads to better outcomes and increased effectiveness through the use of traditional knowledge and local healing flora and fauna.

Several laudable policies are already in place. Yet for reforms to be successful we need hardcoded timelines.

It is now for the policy doctors to collaborate with the real doctors to come up with radical solutions that can build a healthier world for everyone.

🔥

Al contrario que con otros de sus juegos exclusivos PlayStation no ha promocionado demasiado el éxito y los números de Death Stranding desde su lanzamiento a pesar de que tuvo muy buen arranque en diferentes mercados. Ahora un extrabajador de PlayStation Worldwide Studios ha revelado que como se esperaba ha rendido muy bien.

Es curioso ya que ha sido muna actualización del perfil de LinkedIn del exdirector de estudio y director senior de artes visuales de PlayStation Worlddide Studios Michael Mumbauer el que ha revelado los buenos datos de Death Stranding. En la descripción de su labor en Sony Mumbauer menciona a Death Stranding junto con God of War The Last of Us y Marvel's Spider-Man como juego con ""ventas récord y reconocimiento internacional para Sony"".

This was recently updated btw. — Timur222 (@bogorad222) January 17 2021

Sabemos que Death Stranding ha tenido reconocimiento internacional por la buena recepción de la crítica pero en cuanto a ""record de ventas"" es la primera vez que se menciona algo parecido además junto a pesos pesados de la compañía que han llegado a vender 10 millones de copias. A mediados del año pasado Hideo Kojima dijo que había sido un juego rentable pero en ningún momento se llegó a hablar de numero de copias vendidas.

En cualquiera de los casos aunque no haya vendido como The Last of Us Death Stranding ha sido todo un éxito para sony podría ser solo el comienzo de su relación con Kojima Productions. El creativo japonés anda trabajando en un nuevo proyecto aunque no parece relacionado con el juego protagonizado por Sam Porter Bridges.

De los grandes baluartes que ostenta orgullosamente Racing y en especial esta comisión directiva presidida por Víctor Blanco es la venta de jugadores al exterior por una elevado cifra. En esta nota repasaremos algunos de los nombres que más caja le dejaron al club.

Es costumbre que en cada mercado de pases vengan del exterior a buscar jugadores del primer equipo de La Academia este 2021 el apuntado a vender es Matías Rojas tazado en aproximadamente diez millones de dólares.

En la última década el club tuvo un ascenso futbolístico e institucional de la mano de Víctor Blanco y el predio Tita Mattiussi un escueto presidente y ventas que engrosan los balances anuales ordenaron a Racing para que compita contra los primeros puestos de River y Boca. Tanto es así que en los últimos diez años en lo que respecta a venta de jugadores La Academia vendió cuatro veces más que Independiente y más del doble que San Lorenzo. Se estima que en los últimos años el club recibió más de cien millones de dólares brutos en concepto de ventas de jugadores algunos 100% productos de las inferiores y otros adquiridos como apuestas a futuro y concretados en grandes ventas.

El caso más reciente es la joya que tiene el fútbol Europeo en la actualidad Lautaro Martínez que suena para reforzar las filas Barcelona o Paris Saint Germain es solo un caso. En 2010 Franco Zuculini fue transferido al Hoffeinheim de Alemania por 33 millones de euros en 2012 el Sporting de Lisboa vino a la carga por el delantero Valentín Viola y pago 4 millones de euros y al año siguiente el Benfica compro al enganche Luis Fariña por 23 millones de euros.

Luego de empezar a ser consultado por mercados futbolísticos con gran poder como lo son el portugués en el 2014 con la asunción de Luis Zubeldia como técnico Racing fue observado por equipos italianos y españoles que buscaban en las joyas académicas una futura estrella del fútbol.

El enganche Rodrigo De Paul fue vendido en el 2014 al Valencia por 48 millones de dólares y el delantero Luciano Vietto emigró al Villareal por 56 dólares brutos. Inglaterra fue el destino de Bruno Zuculini que después de un gran rendimiento fue comprado por el Manchester City por 25 millones de dólares.

Casos particulares fueron el de Ricardo Centurión que fue cedido a préstamo al Genoa de Italia por 600 mil euros pero entre idas y vueltas siempre le genero dinero al club es así que en el último año Vélez adquirió el 50% de su ficha por 25 millones de dólares. Otro que se quedó en el fútbol local fue el lateral José Luis Gómez cedido a préstamo a Lanús que no dudo en ejecutar la opción de compras de 2 millones de dólares.

Las últimas tres grandes ventas de Racing son las del ya mencionado Lautaro Martínez que según el balance 2019 le dejo 19 millones de euros netos en las cuentas del club y además un 10% de plusvalía para una futura venta el arquero Juan Musso fue vendido por 4 millones de euros al Udinese de Italia donde comparte equipo con Rodrigo De Paul y ambos están en la mira de grandes equipos por su alto rendimiento la última joya de la cantera en ser vendida fue Matías Zaracho al Atlético Mineiro por 7 millones de dólares brutos por el 50% del pase.

Estos nombres son los más resonantes y recordados por el hincha pero también aportaron lo suyo jugadores como Brian Mansilla Maxi Cuadra Alexis Cuello Augusto Lotti Gastón Campi Jonathán Cabral o Esteban Saveljich.

Otras figuras que no fueron surgidos de las inferiores racinguistas pero que vinieron como promesas cumplieron con el objetivo y fueron grandes ventas son el ejemplo de Giovanni Moreno que llego en el 2010 con 24 años de Atlético Nacional de Medellín y se va en el 2012 a China por 9 millones de dólares. El delantero Roger Martínez que hoy vuelve a sonar su nombre como una ilusión del hincha se fue a China por casi 10 millones de dólares y además le dejo a Racing un 15% del pase por una futura venta que luego se concretó cuando fue comprado en su totalidad por el Villareal de España.

Otro que tuvo destino asiático fue Óscar Romero el Shangai pago 9 millones de dólares por el pase del enganche; extraña fue la venta del lateral campeón en 2014 Leandro Grimi fue comprado por el Milán de Italia por 2 millones de euros. Después de una excelente temporada en el club y en la Selección Argentina el “Huevo” Acuña fue vendido al Sporting de Lisboa que desembolso los 10 millones de Euros que Racing pedía por el jugador el defensor Renzo Saravia también encontró destino en Portugal tras irse por casi 6 millones de euros brutos al Porto FC.

El poderoso mercado Mexicano aporto lo suyo a las arcas económicas del club Gustavo Bou que había llegado libre emigró al Xolos de Tijuana por 6 millones de dólares limpios. Guillermo Pol Fernández un jugador de 27 años y unas inferiores en Boca fue vendido de Racing a Cruz Azul por 5 millones de dólares. El último jugador en encontrar equipo en la Liga MX fue el delantero David Barbona que en 2019 fue vendido por 2 millones de dólares por el 70% de su ficha.

Estos números sumados a simple vista sorprenden pero fueron debidamente cuidados y administrados de forma pobre a la hora de incorporar jugadores de alta jerarquía. Requisito primordial para estar en el radar de Racing es que lleguen en condición de libres y así no sean un costo grande para el club. La política de compra de jugadores no es una prioridad cuando se mira el predio Tita Mattiussi y en la víspera de un nuevo mercado de pases los hinchas se vuelven a ilusionar con que Racing patee el tablero haga el esfuerzo e incorpore jerarquía para conquistar el sueño de una copa internacional.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJlbnNhZ3JhZmljYS5jb20vZWxzYWx2YWRvci9FbXByZW5kZS1jb24tbGEtdmVudGEtZGUtbWFyaXNjb3MtMjAyMTAxMTYtMDA1Ny5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGFwcmVuc2FncmFmaWNhLmNvbS9hbXAvZWxzYWx2YWRvci9FbXByZW5kZS1jb24tbGEtdmVudGEtZGUtbWFyaXNjb3MtMjAyMTAxMTYtMDA1Ny5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emprende con la venta de mariscos - La Prensa Gráfica,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.laprensagrafica.com/elsalvador/Emprende-con-la-venta-de-mariscos-20210116-0057.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJlbnNhZ3JhZmljYS5jb20vZWxzYWx2YWRvci9FbXByZW5kZS1jb24tbGEtdmVudGEtZGUtbWFyaXNjb3MtMjAyMTAxMTYtMDA1Ny5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGFwcmVuc2FncmFmaWNhLmNvbS9hbXAvZWxzYWx2YWRvci9FbXByZW5kZS1jb24tbGEtdmVudGEtZGUtbWFyaXNjb3MtMjAyMTAxMTYtMDA1Ny5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnBlcnNiYXphYXIuY29tL2VzL2ZhbW9zYXMvZWwtZXN0aWxvLWRlL2EzNTIzMjk3Ny9qZW5uaWZlci1sb3Blei1qbG8tYmVhdXR5LXBpZWwtYW1hem9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La línea de belleza de Jennifer Lopez ya está a la venta,"Jennifer Lopez canta actúa desfila posa ante las cámaras y además es dueña también de su propia firma de belleza JLo Beauty.

Antonieta García comerciante explico “estamos a la expectativa esta fecha siempre es muy buena para el comercio porque chicos y grandes compran algún detalle pero en esta ocasión no hay escuelas y este es un punto de venta muy importante así que esperamos que las ventas bajen por esta cuestión pero esperemos que no sean mucho”.

Señaló que para este año la mercancía que han surtido no es la misma que la de años anteriores pues existe el temor de invertir y que este dinero no se recupere por lo que muchos han optado por vender mercancía que tenían del año pasado.

Esperan además que la situación económica que ha traído la pandemia mejore y que no afecte como lo hizo durante el 2020 a todo el comercio y que las ventas comiencen a repuntar en los próximos meses."

Mayor Kurt Peluso said in an interview that a resident shared on social media that she found the noose in front of her house posting a photo of it and he reached out to her after seeing the post. To protect the resident's privacy he did not disclose the location.

Peluso said Fair Lawn police and the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office are investigating the matter. He said the noose has since been taken down.

""If you saw the photo on social media some are saying that it might have been a utility company"" Peluso said. ""I reached out to Verizon and they said it wasn't them and that they would not use that type of rope or do anything like that. Then PSEG reached out to me and said 'No that's not something we would ever do.' ""

Peluso who expressed outrage about the noose in a Facebook post Sunday said ""the majority"" of the people in town who found out about the noose were disturbed by it.

""They found it really upsetting and I just feel like too you find this in our nation as well. We're having almost like a last-ditch effort by racists"" Peluso said. ""The biggest comment I got was from people who said 'Thank you for speaking out.'

""Unfortunately we've seen situations like this in other towns where they keep it quiet and push it under the rug"" he said. ""That's something that I am not going to deal with here. If I see any kind of act that goes against any of our residents I will speak out about it.""

The discovery of the noose in Fair Lawn is a dark reminder that it is a symbol of hate in history recalling in particular the lynching of an estimated 4000 African-Americans from 1877 to 1950 according to research by the Equal Justice Initiative.

In recent years nooses were discovered in North Jersey in 2019 when the American Dream shopping center was under construction and in Bayonne Park.

And earlier this month a noose was seen on a makeshift gallows erected by pro-Trump rioters outside the U.S. Capitol during the storming of the building that left five people dead.

The three US wireless carriers really want to sell you a Galaxy S21—as long as you kick them some money.

The new Samsung Galaxy S21 lineup presents a big chance for wireless carriers to lock you in for the next few years. Fortunately with support for the new C-band spectrum they're relatively future-proofed so they'll be able to hop onto upcoming 5G networks as well as the ones currently out there.

The Galaxy S21 series will be available everywhere. Unlike last year there will be only one physical S21 S21+ and S21 Ultra model across all three US carriers so any phone you buy in the US should work with any US 4G or 5G carrier. (There will still be different models in different countries though.)

At AT&T AT&T you can get up to $800 off a new phone but there are some caveats. You have to trade in your previous phone buy it on a 30-month installment plan and have an eligible unlimited data plan.

T-Mobile T-Mobile has a few deals. If you buy a Galaxy S21 series phone and add a new line T-Mobile will rebate the price of a second phone dragged out over 24 months. Alternatively it'll also take trade-ins to reduce the price of a new phone with the highest-value trade-ins making the lowest-priced S21 free.

VerizonVerizon offers switchers a 128GB S21+ if they sign up for new Unlimited plans and trade in their phones; current customers can get up to $600 on a trade-in. Current customers who add new lines and buy an S21 series can get another phone valued up to $1000 for free.

AT&T and Verizon are also offering discounts on cases and accessories—AT&T in-store only but Verizon also online during the pre-order period.

There’s a big problem though as this native experience is only available to Galaxy S21 units outside of the US. WTF folks.

No specific reason is known why Samsung is keeping its own messaging app as the default in the US but the move was confirmed yesterday by Google’s Hiroshi Lockheimer. While it would have been nice to have a uniform messaging experience across Android devices an upside exists in the fact that Samsung’s messaging app also supports RCS and it is probable that most Galaxy owners are quite familiar with it by this point.

Alexander Richter 17 Jan 2021

Vulcan Energy Resources plans the development of up to 5 geothermal power plants in Germany that are to produce electricity and zero-emission lithium. Planned start of first plant is set for 2024.

Australia’s Vulcan Energy Resources plans the production of zero-emission lithium in Europe after obtaining positive results in its pre-feasibility studies for a facility powered by geothermal energy.

Vulcan Energy Resources has been investigating the possibility of producing emission-free lithium at a project in the German Upper Rhine Valley. The company plans to pair the lithium production facility with a geothermal power project powering the facility with zero-emission electricity.

The company said it would be possible to produce a quality lithium hydroxide chemical for batteries at the proposed facility and that it would seek to tap into the emerging European market for lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicles.

“We are very pleased to reach this important milestone for investors in Vulcan and the Lithium Zero Carbon Project. The PFS has demonstrated strong economics for the lithium and energy parts of the project both independently and in combination ”said Vulcan CEO Francis Wedin.

“This means that there is no need for a commitment on the ethical and environmental sourcing of battery raw materials for Europe’s current rapid transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.”

The feasibility study found that the planned EUR 1.74 billion facility could produce up to 40000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide each year a usable ingredient for battery production and would seek to tap into a 1.12 million tonnes carbonate equivalent reservoir from lithium in Germany the largest in Europe.

The company describes the lithium concentration in geothermal brine among the highest in the world or actually the highest together with the Salton Sea area in California/ U.S. another hot spot for lithium-geothermal extraction plants.

The production facility would be combined with 5 geothermal power plants with a combined 74 MW geothermal electricity generating capacity which would extract heat from the lithium deposit itself. The power plant would allow the project to take advantage of a reliable supply of electricity without emissions that will also benefit from attractive subsidies (power fees).

The feasibility study showed that the company could achieve an expected pre-tax internal rate of return of up to 26 percent a positive result that drove the value of the company’s shares up.

The company said next steps will include completing a “definitive” feasibility study obtaining the relevant permits conducting extraction tests and advancing negotiations with potential buyers.

“We have shown that the production of zero carbon lithium hydroxide with the co-production of renewable geothermal energy is highly profitable and environmentally friendly” Wedin added. 2021 should be a transformative year for Vulcan as we begin our DFS expand our lithium mining pilot test and advance discussions with European buyers for our carbon-free lithium product. ”

Lithium producers have benefited from the growing market for battery storage and electric vehicles. Europe is currently the fastest growing market for electric vehicles and the market will accelerate further with the plans of Tesla’s ‘gigafactory’ in Berlin as well as the push from major German automakers into the market for electric vehicles including Daimler and Volkswagen .

Vulcan’s European lithium production ambitions are likely to be well received by battery makers in the region with around 80 percent of the world market currently controlled by Chinese producers. Local production would help address supply chain and environmental concerns.

In a recent corporate presentation Vulcan points to a two-phased approach in its combined geothermal energy and lithium business. In the first phase the company plans to start two geothermal power plants with 8 MW and 14 MW capacity (planned start of operation in 2024) and the set up of two direct lithium extraction (DLE) plants and one central lithium plant. In a second phase with start given as 2025 the company plans with three geothermal power plants of 17 MW in capacity each three DLE plants and an additional central lithum plants.

The plans reflect a total of 5 geothermal plants with a combined power generation capacity of 74 MW to be built in Germany.

Yesterday VUL delivered on a major milestone in its quest to supply Europe’s rapidly expanding Li-battery and electric vehicle industries with a world-first Zero Carbon Lithium® product.

Vulcan’s Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) details its potential for highly profitable and environmentally friendly Zero Carbon Lithium® production plus the co-production of revenue-generating renewable geothermal energy.

You can read our initial thoughts in the article:Our Key Takeaways from VUL’s PFS - What will the VUL share price do next?

Highlights of the PFS make for an impressive list:

Project value of €2.25 billion (post-tax NPV) which equates to A$3.54 billion.

Lowest operating expenses (OPEX) of any lithium hydroxide (LHM) project globally at €2640/t LHM.

Combined renewable energy-lithium project pre-tax IRR of 26% and post-tax IRR of 21%. (Lithium as a separate entity from energy shows pre-tax IRR of 31% and post-tax IRR of 26%.)

Dual operation producing: 74 MW of renewable energy generation and approximately 40ktpa LHM production.

Starting capital cost of €226m for geothermal wells and plant and €474m for Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) plants and Central Lithium Plant (CLP).

The company has also confirmed a Maiden Probable Ore Reserve of 1.12 Mt Lithium Carbonate Equiv. (LCE) at 181 mg/l lithium.

The total JORC Resource of the project is 15.85 Mt LCE — a globally significant resource that is more than twice the size of the next largest lithium resource in Europe.

As our 2020 Pick of the Year VUL has already been a standout performer in the Next Investors investment portfolio.

With a significant amount of momentum generated in the past 12 months and a PFS now released we are looking forward to seeing what VUL can deliver in 2021.

VUL is the biggest holding in our portfolio and we continue to hold for the long term.

The release of the PFS has exceeded expectations hinting at the upside to come and clarified the company’s plans for 2021.

This year we can expect multiple potential share price catalysts as VUL conducts Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) work project permitting lithium extraction test-work scale up and advances discussions with European lithium off-takers.

On top of its own development plans and progression towards production and offtake agreements VUL’s ambitions are supported by European Union and German legislators who are getting serious about ensuring a greener future.

Before delving into details of the PFS let’s review Vulcan’s project — the Upper Rhine Valley project (URVP) and its Zero Carbon Lithium® and renewable geothermal energy products.

Vulcan Upper Rhine Valley Project

Vulcan Energy is working to decarbonise the currently high carbon production footprint of lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles by producing a world-first Zero Carbon Lithium® product at its Upper Rhine Valley Project (URVP).

The project is strategically located right in the heart of the European auto and lithium-ion battery manufacturing industry.

VUL is aiming to produce a battery-quality lithium hydroxide chemical product with net zero carbon footprint. Its unique Zero Carbon Lithium® process will also produce both renewable geothermal energy from the same deep brine source.

VUL’s project hosts Europe’s largest lithium resource that dwarfs all other EU lithium Resources.

It is more than twice the size of the next largest Resource and could satisfy Europe’s lithium needs for the electric vehicle transition from a zero-carbon source for many years to come.

Given the size of the Resource VUL will have options to scale up its operations. This would involve adding more wells and renewable energy plants in response to growth in the European lithium market.

Production process

The project’s production process involves hot brine being extracted from the ground generating steam that powers turbines and produces renewable electricity. This process is well demonstrated with standard geothermal production wells having been successfully implemented for decades.

The brine flow is then diverted and lithium is extracted from the solution with a Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) process. This DLE has also been commercially proven for decades on salars.

The resulting lithium chloride is then converted to LiCl to deliver battery-quality LiOH.

The water is recycled with no toxic wastes and no gases emitted. As the heat and power are from renewable resources no fossil fuels are burned and the process produces net zero carbon.

This is the only lithium project globally that is being developed to have a zero-carbon footprint and its trademark Zero Carbon Lithium® can be licenced to battery manufacturers and OEMs using the product.

Milestone Pre-Feasibility Study released

The Pre-Feasibility Study released today for its Zero Carbon Lithium® Project demonstrates strong potential to develop a cutting edge combined renewable energy and lithium hydroxide project all with net zero carbon footprint and located in the centre of Europe’s battery industry.

Conducted with world-leading experts in lithium extraction chemistry chemical engineering geothermal plant engineering and geology the study focused solely on Indicated Resources from the Ortenau and Taro licenses.

Hatch a leading lithium project engineering company led the lithium processing plant design engineering and cost estimates. It investigated multiple capacity scenarios as part of the PFS which defined the process and layout as well as evaluated the capital cost operating cost schedule and risk and opportunities.

The PFS demonstrated robust economics for both the lithium hydroxide and renewable energy parts of the project both independently and combined.

Project economics - It pays to be green

The PFS considered both the geothermal and lithium businesses and modelled the project under different possible structures:

The Full Project developed at the same time and involving no phasing or

Phase 1 developed first followed by Phase 2 — each as separate geothermal and DLE integrated businesses.

Under the scenario in which the full project is developed at once using a Net Present Value calculation the PFS indicates a project value of €2.25 billion (post-tax) which equates to A$3.54 billion.

Under the second scenario where the project is developed in two phases the project has post-tax NPV of €703 million (A$1.1B) in Phase 1 and a post-tax NPV of €1.4 billion (A$2.2B) in Phase 2.

As a combined renewable energy-lithium project the PFS indicated VUL’s pre-tax IRR of 26% and post-tax IRR of 21%. Lithium as a separate entity from energy shows pre-tax IRR of 31% and post-tax IRR of 26%.

Those impressive valuations and returns have much to do with the fact that VUL’s project has the lowest operating expenses (OPEX) of any lithium hydroxide (LHM) project globally at €2640/t LHM.

Vulcan’s “feedstock” is low cost and has dual purpose: lithium extraction and energy production in the form of renewable electricity. As VUL will be essentially treating a waste product from the geothermal plants to extract lithium its costs are significantly lower than that of any existing hard-rock or traditional brine processing operations.

VUL’s use of Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) to isolate lithium rather than using large volumes of chemicals to dissolve a rock feedstock or soda ash for brine also keeps costs low. Vulcan uses electrolysis to upgrade lithium chloride into a high purity lithium hydroxide using renewable energy so requires no heavy reagent usage such as sodium hydroxide or lime. Plus Vulcan uses low-cost energy from its geothermal operation.

As can be seen below the capital intensity of Vulcan’s project is higher than that of other lithium sources globally. The project will involve a starting capital cost of €226m for geothermal wells and plant and €474m for Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) plants and Central Lithium Plant (CLP).

But once up and running the project’s operating expenses per tonne LiOH will be the world’s lowest.

Also helping project economics is higher forecast lithium contract prices which have already started moving upward in the last month:

Dual revenue operation

Vulcan has shown the potential for highly profitable and environmentally friendly zero carbon production of lithium hydroxide with co-production of renewable geothermal energy. It will be essentially running two separate operations — a renewable energy operation and a lithium chemicals operation of 74 MW of renewable energy generation and approximately 40ktpa LHM production.

Here is the connection between geothermal and DLE processes.

As such the project is expected to generate dual revenue from a combination of lithium hydroxide and geothermal renewable energy sales — both of which are seeing heightened EU and German government support as the EU works towards net zero emissions by 2050.

European Li-ion battery market primed for growth

The EU is ramping up its commitment to the electric vehicle industry with legislative proposals aimed at sustainable battery production including better traceability of raw materials.

From 1 January 2026 lithium-ion batteries will have to bear a carbon intensity performance class label and from 1 July 2027 must comply with maximum carbon footprint thresholds. Batteries not meeting the new regulation will be banned and manufacturers will have to demonstrate that they are sourcing raw materials responsibly.

EU commissioner Thierry Breton highlighted that Europe is “100% dependent on lithium imports. ""The EU if finding the right environmental approach will be self-sufficient in a few years using its resources”.

This is a major endorsement of Vulcan’s Zero Carbon Lithium® strategy positioning it at the forefront of the lithium sector as decarbonisation responsibly sourced lithium and renewable energy are the foundation of the company. Other companies will have to adapt in order to incorporate decarbonisation in the production process and responsibly sourced materials.

Rising lithium demand

Europe is the fastest growing market in the world for lithium following strong investments in battery and cathode plants.

Now with more investment in electric vehicles in Europe than in China Europe’s lithium consumption is forecast to continue to grow sharply.

As you can see above a ramp up in demand is anticipated in 2024 — right as VUL anticipates its first production.

In the medium to long term fundamentals remain strong for electric vehicles and energy storage. Growth rates are expected to average 25% per year over the next 10 years while supply is growing at a slower rate leading to a deficit from 2024 onwards.

Furthermore thanks to changes in cathode technologies by the mid 2020s lithium hydroxide (LHM) is forecast to take over lithium carbonate as a battery material.

Geothermal: renewable energy business

In addition to its lithium sales VUL has geothermal energy as a second expected revenue generator. VUL intends to produce:

Zero Carbon Heat: Energy in the form of heat can be sold to a number of public and private customers via pipes proximity is a requirement.

Zero Carbon Electricity: Energy in the form of electricity is sold to the grid.

Many experts see geothermal power as an essential component of the world’s green-energy future.

Geothermal energy is always on it is scalable and can provide fully dispatchable power or heat. It is unique in that it could provide carbon-free heat and around-the-clock baseload power to compensate for the intermittency of wind and solar.

In Germany geothermal electricity has been embraced with the country setting the goal of producing 65% of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2030. Munich for example intends to switch the city entirely to district heating and experts anticipate Germany can go from 1.2 terawatt-hours (TWh) of heat from geothermal today to 100 TWh by 2050.

German geothermal energy generation currently benefits from a Feed-in Tariff guaranteed by the state for 20 years once the project starts at €25.2c/KWh — one of the most favourable in the world.

New legislation voted on in December provides further support. The €25.2c/KWh Feed-in Tariff was set to decline by 5% per year from 2021 onwards but will now be reduced by only 0.5% per year and the start date pushed back to 2024. Further once a geothermal project starts operating the Feed-in Tariff is fixed for 20 years at the level of the year it enters production.

This change demonstrates the German Government’s commitment to unlock more geothermal projects as it seeks to decarbonise energy and industry and is in line with the additional expected Federal support of geothermal energy to decarbonise heating in Germany.

In order to further incentivise the transition to climate-friendlier alternatives from January 2021 German households with oil or gas heating will be required to pay a carbon price for their consumption of heating fuels.

The government has made clear that geothermal energy is a vital and strongly supported part of the energy transition in Europe and this recent legislation provides further validation for Vulcan’s Zero Carbon Lithium® strategy and geothermal energy as the only heat source with no carbon cost.

As for VUL at the €25.2c/KWh Feed-in Tariff rate guaranteed for 20 years the PFS indicates that VUL will generate €157 million (A$248M) in revenue per year from its geothermal energy business.

Vulcan recognised for ESG commitments

Now essential in business and investment circles ESG (Environment Social Governance) is setting a new standard in measuring the sustainability and ethical impact made by a company.

A business can gain significant benefits if it can demonstrate real ESG commitments progress and credentials including access to ESG earmarked funding.

Positive impact and ESG is the core reason that VUL managing director Francis Wedin started the company and its Zero Carbon Lithium®️ project.

Reflecting that commitment Vulcan has now been recognised as one of just six ASX listed companies that are leading the way on ESG. The company’s ESG credentials were identified by impact monitoring technology Socialsuite whose recently launched global standard ESG framework is one of the first to start monitoring ESG reporting over and above the quarterly financial and operational update required by the ASX.

What’s ahead for Vulcan?

During 2021 offtake negotiations will be in the company’s focus. On the development front VUL will progress with piloting test work while proceeding towards a DFS this year.

This year will also see VUL secure permitting for Phase 1 of the project and for the Central Lithium Plant 1. While for Phase 2 seismic and analysis will be conducted with work to secure permitting beginning later in the year.

Wedin confirmed that “2021 should be a transformative year for Vulcan as we commence our DFS scale up our lithium extraction piloting and advance discussions with European off-takers for our Zero Carbon Lithium® product.”

Looking further ahead project financing will take place in 2022 as will Phase 1 drilling. By 2023 VUL anticipates that drilling and construction will have begun for both Phase 1 and 2 as well as construction on the Central Lithium Plant 1.

Production is targeted for Phase 1 and the Central Lithium Plant in 2024 — that’s just three years until VUL is supplying the European electric vehicle market with its world-first Zero Carbon Lithium.

All up that’s a lot to keep VUL busy and shareholders engaged with multiple potential share price catalysts throughout the year and through to 2025.

Of course as an early stage exploration company this is not without risks. But today’s PFS de-risks a lot of the uncertainty around the project economics and gives much more clarity about the potential of the project moving forward.",,,,,,,,,

In November 2018 DaBaby was arrested in connection with a fatal altercation at a Walmart in North Carolina. A man was shot and killed during the fight but DaBaby insisted he never pulled the trigger. He was later convicted of misdemeanour carrying a concealed weapon.

The rapper was handed a suspended 30-day jail sentence and 12 months of unsupervised probation.

On new single ‘Masterpiece’ DaBaby alludes to the incident while remaining ambiguous about how events unfolded. “I don’t know what went down at that Walmart / I don’t know what happened on that freeway / Okay there go DaBaby he back now / Run it back hey bitch turn that on replay” he raps on the track.

Charges against DaBaby – whose real name is Jonathan Lyndale Kirk – were later dismissed in March 2019 after a key witness was “unavailable.”

The rapper has faced a number of controversies over the years including an incident last week (January 7) when police reportedly found a loaded and concealed handgun in his possession.

The ‘Rockstar’ rapper 29 was carrying a 9mm inside his car a spokesperson for the Beverly Hills Police Department confirmed to CBSLA.

Police told the station that they were called to the area at around 4.30PM after receiving reports of a man on Rodeo Drive who was carrying a weapon in his waistband while walking with friends.

The incident occurred just days after the rapper faced criticism online over a forthcoming song with Tory Lanez who is currently facing charges in relation to the alleged shooting of Megan Thee Stallion last July.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjMzAuY29tL3dhbG1hcnQtdmlzYWxpYS1jbG9zZWQvOTcyMjI1NS_SATVodHRwczovL2FiYzMwLmNvbS9hbXAvd2FsbWFydC12aXNhbGlhLWNsb3NlZC85NzIyMjU1Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart in Visalia to close for the weekend for cleaning and sanitizing,"Walmart in Visalia to close for the weekend for cleaning and sanitizing

FRESNO Calif. (KFSN) -- One after another people looking to shop at the Visalia Walmart Supercenter on Mooney Boulevard are being turned away.

The store is closed and Walmart officials say it will stay that way all weekend long -- as cleaning crews work to sanitize the entire building.

""The Super Walmart on Mooney does a tremendous amount of business and it does impact people"" says Visalia Mayor Steve Nelson.

Officials would not confirm if the closure was related to a COVID outbreak but had this to say in a statement - ""Everything we're doing is for the well-being of our associates and customers and in consideration of guidance by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and health experts. We will continue working closely with elected and local health officials adjusting how we serve the community.""

Nelson says he's still waiting to find out the cause of the closure.

""I have read their press release"" he said. ""They talk about the pandemic but it has never been solidified that it is because of a COVID situation.""

Many shoppers were rerouted to the Walmart location on Nobel Avenue.

By late Saturday afternoon the parking lot was filled.

""If you are concerned there are different ways to shop"" Nelson said. ""You can do online shopping you can go to your locally owned businesses there are less people packed inside the store.""

The Walmart Supercenter on Mooney is expected to reopen on Monday at 7 am.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL2phbi8xNy93YWxtYXJ0LWZpbmFuY2lhbC10ZWNoLW1vdmUtZXhwbG9yZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart financial tech move explored,"Walmart Inc.’s recent creation of a financial technology firm is its latest move into the realm of banking and other monetary services.

The Bentonville-based retailer said Monday it is partnering in a startup with global investment company Ribbit Capital to offer “next-generation digital financial products” for employees and customers.

Walmart hasn’t revealed a name for the startup company where it will be based or any specifics about the kinds of products it will develop.

“The list of exact projects and timeline is still being developed” a Walmart spokeswoman said Thursday. She said Walmart had no additional details to share.

Wayne Miller executive director of The Venture Center in Little Rock said Walmart “is pretty close-lipped about the actions they’re taking especially when you’re looking at competing against a company like Amazon.com that’s also deeply into financial technology to support its client base.”

Drawing on his experience working with companies through The Venture Center Miller also said it’s not unusual for a company like Walmart to start such a partnership before it has entirely figured out what it’s going to pursue.

Still he added “I would suggest that Walmart and Ribbit have a shortlist of things that they’re already thinking about.”

“But the other question I would ask as well is are they looking to make some big bets where there’s really entirely new technology or approaches they want to test or prototype or are they trying to find existing technology” Miller said. “They may need to find their way together on the initiatives and specific problems that they want to develop or source solutions for.”

Financial technology often shortened to fintech “seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services” according to Investopedia.com. It does this through “specialized software and algorithms on computers and increasingly smartphones.”

Fintech has served to move financial products and services once handled by banks and salesmen toward mobile devices “or simply democratize them away from large entrenched institutions” according to Investopedia.com .

Jeff Amerine founder and managing director of Fayetteville-based Startup Junkie Consulting defined fintech as “primarily technology that automates some process in a way that’s different than the way they’ve done it up to that point.”

Amerine who also teaches entrepreneurship at the University of Arkansas’ Walton College of Business said any kind of advanced credit card debit card or payment systems including cryptocurrency blockchain technology related to finance and companies such as Pay-Pal Stripe and Square are all examples of well-established fintech companies.

“So you think about it in terms of how are payments taken how are investments done how you can apply artificial intelligence or machine learning to make better decisions on investments” Amerine said.

As for why Walmart is going in this direction Amerine said that with omnichannel sales which include any combination of in-store mobile and online services “the fact is that an awful lot of your sales are not in store. They need to make it as easy as possible to do online transactions mobile transactions and those transactions need to be safe and secure.”

W h i l e A m e r i n e wa s quick to say he has no idea what the new company is ultimately going to do he suggested it “could be new forms of highly secure prepaid cards; it could be new forms of layaway systems tied to a fintech model that’s secure; it could be a very hard-to-defraud alternative to things like Visa and Discover cards. It could be all of that kind of stuff within the fintech arena.”

Walmart’s financial services to date have mainly been aimed at customers without a bank account or other banking relationships. Existing services according to its Money Center website include the Walmart Credit Card and Walmart Money Card check cashing money transfers money orders installment financing check printing and Bill Pay.

Some of these existing services are offered through partnerships with a number of third parties.

And in October Walmart formed an insurance brokerage to sell Medicare insurance plans through the open enrollment period.

A m e r i n e s a i d w h a t Walmart and Ribbit are going to do “in all likelihood is going to be consumer-facing versus fintech for the benefit of enterprise or the banking side.”

But whatever they have in mind he said “when you see that kind of alignment between Walmart and another platform provider or accelerator what large companies typically try to do is take advantage of the agility and the speed to market of a smaller more agile group that might be able to more quickly innovate around things that are interesting.”

Though Walmart employs many thousands of innovation and information technology workers Amerine said it can be hard for such a large company to turn out anything quickly. So Walmart will often work with smaller companies with the agility to turn out a product much more quickly.

“I don’t have any direct knowledge that that’s the case [with Walmart and Rib-bit] but I suspect that’s what their thinking was here” Amerine said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMxMC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3dlc3Qtc2FjcmFtZW50by93ZXN0LXNhY3JhbWVudG8tcG9saWNlLXdhbG1hcnQtc3VzcGljaW91cy1pdGVtLzEwMy00YTc4MzhmZC0xZDgyLTQ2NmEtOGY3Yi1lZGE1NDRlNjI2YjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Sacramento police deploy bomb robot in Walmart parking lot,"A police bomb robot is on the scene looking at the device.

She opened up about how she felt about him.

Although Julie Andrews began her career on the stage she didn’t become a superstar until she appeared in Mary Poppins one of Disney’s most famous movies. She was able to work with Walt Disney himself. Here’s a look at what he said to her — and what she had to say about him.

What it was like when Julie Andrews transitioned to Hollywood to star in Walt Disney’s ‘Mary Poppins’

Firstly a little background. Mary Poppins was Andrews’ first movie. Prior to that she was primarily known for playing Eliza Doolittle in productions of My Fair Lady. According to Vanity Fair Andrews revealed going from the stage to Hollywood was a significant transition for her.

“Now here I was with three shows—The Boy Friend My Fair Lady and Camelot—and several thousand performances on Broadway and in London behind me beginning yet another journey into a new unknown: Hollywood” she recalled. “This time thankfully I was not alone. My husband Tony was with me. We were embarking on this new adventure together along with our baby daughter Emma.”

Andrews added “We were green as grass had no knowledge of the film industry and could not possibly envision what lay ahead—but we were industrious open-minded and we had each other. We were also blessed to have the great Walt Disney to guide us.”

Julie Andrews opens up about Walt Disney’s personality

In an interview on Live with Kelly and Ryan Andrews discussed Disney with Kelly Rippa. Disney “was lovely” she said. “He was exactly as you would imagine him. [Disney] was a kind of twinkling personality and very dear and very smart of course. He was the first one in the studio every morning; he was so proud of it! But honestly he spoiled me and when he asked me to come into Hollywood I said “Ug! Mr. Disney I’d love to come but I’m pregnant!’”

Julie Andrews on Live With Kelly and Ryan

Andrews recalled Disney told her they could wait until she had her baby. Andrews later realized pre-production on movies takes quite some time so there was no major issue for the production to wait to begin until her child was born.

How the world reacted to ‘Mary Poppins’

So how did Andrews’ collaboration with Disney work out? According to Box Office Mojo Mary Poppins earned over $103 million. It is one of the most famous and beloved films from the Walt Disney Company which is not primarily animated.

In addition the Walt Disney Company continued to capitalize on the success of the movie for years. For example Enchanted includes a number of references to the film including a musical number inspired by its aesthetic. In 2013 the studio released Saving Mr. Banks a fictionalization of the making of Mary Poppins. In 2018 the studio released a belated sequel called Mary Poppins Returns. Andrews enjoyed working with Disney and the public continued to enjoy the Mary Poppins franchise for years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY2VjaGF0LmNvbS8yNzk4NTgtaG9yc2luLWFyb3VuZC1hdC13YWx0LWRpc25leS13b3JsZHMtdHJpLWNpcmNsZS1kLXJhbmNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Horsin' Around at Walt Disney World's Tri-Circle-D Ranch,"The new Tri-Circle-D Ranch where the horses of Walt Disney World are boarded opened back in June 2020 at Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground with little attention in all the excitement of the reopening of the resorts and theme parks. I decided to take my son Johnny and check it out over his Winter Break he even got his first pony ride. The new ranch is absolutely beautiful!

The history of Tri-Circle-D Ranch and its horses

The Tri-Circle-D Ranch was a part of Walt Disney World even before the Magic Kingdom opened. The ranch’s main purpose is to house “The Happiest Horses on Earth”. The horses were originally at Magic Kingdom on Main Street. Currently you can see some in the Character Cavalcades.

The horses have also been used for Wagon Rides Horse-Drawn Carriage Rides and Holiday Sleigh rides. While these options are currently not available we look forward to their return.

Horseback riding has also long been offered at Tri-Circle-D Ranch. The trail rides remain at the original ranch location at the Outpost. Trail rides are available daily reservations are suggested but not required. You must be a minimum of 9 years old over 48 inches and under 250 pounds to ride. The rides last 45 minutes and go through wooded trails.

The New Tri-Circle-D Ranch

The new ranch has a beautiful modern rustic look. It is a working ranch where they care for the horses including feeding and bathing. Inside the barn there is much more than horses: there are some Disney treasures to be found.

Walt Disney and Horses

It’s pretty well known that Walt Disney loved animals. so it’s a nice touch that the ranch has a room dedicated to Walt Disney and his love of horses.

In addition to pictures of Walt with horses there are also pictures of horses in the parks.

Dragon Calliope

Once on display at Fort Wilderness the 1907 Dragon Calliope returns in all its splendor to the ranch. This wagon was originally used in the 1950s at Disneyland Park and was used for various parades until the 25th anniversary. It was even featured in the movie “Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks with a Circus” (a charming 1960s film). The Calliope then came to Walt Disney World where it was used for parades for some time. Now it has been restored and is available for viewing once again.

Wedding Harness Room

The Wedding Harness Room displays some of the beautiful harnesses used.

Up Close with the Horses

While you cannot get right up to the stalls you can get pretty close. And since it’s a working ranch the horses are moved throughout the day and you may get lucky enough to be there when it happens.

Not all of the stalls are accessible to guests allowing the horses to have private time as well.

Pony Rides

For the little ones pony rides are available daily. You have the option to do one or two loops around a fenced trail. A parent or guardian leads the pony. You must be at least 2 years old and be under both 80 pounds and 48 inches to ride. There are no reservations it is first come first ride.

We paid to go around the loop twice. It took about a little less than 15 minutes including being able to stop for photos.

Broadcaster Casey Stern has filed a discrimination complaint against WarnerMedia and Turner Sports for being removed from his anchoring roles for TBS’s MLB postseason coverage and NBA TV.

Last October Stern revealed to the New York Post‘s Andrew Marchand that his three children (ages six five and three) were allegedly being abused by his ex-wife and her boyfriend. Both were charged with felony counts of child cruelty.

Concern over his children’s welfare — in addition to trying to get law enforcement and the courts to intervene while spending significant money on forensic evaluators doctors guardians lawyers and therapists — prevented Stern from traveling to host coverage of events like Kobe Bryant’s death and Basketball Hall of Fame induction ceremonies and call play-by-play for U.S. National Basketball games.

This past October Ernie Johnson replaced Stern as studio host for TBS’ pre- and postgame shows during the MLB postseason. With that news reports of Stern’s difficulties and legal battles with his ex-wife and her boyfriend over child abuse came to light.

Stern is still under contract with Turner until August 2021. But according to the complaint the company will not be using him on the air and will hold him to his contract preventing him from seeking TV work elsewhere. (Stern still hosts Inside Pitch on SiriusXM’s MLB Network Radio.)

The complaint also alleges several instances in which Stern said Turner executives showed little sympathy for his circumstances and concern over his children diminishing them as making excuses for not working.

“In one particularly offensive incident John O’Connor NBA TV’s Executive Producer responded to an accommodation request by suggesting that Mr. Stern was using his children – who were being beaten by his ex-wife and her boyfriend – as an ‘excuse’ to avoid work assignments. Specifically Mr. O’Connor said ‘When are you going to stop using this’ family situation as an excuse?”

Courtesy of Deadline the entire complaint is available to read online.

Following going public with his children’s alleged abuse and his ordeal in addressing their plight Stern announced that he launched a foundation called Operation ExHale with the purpose of raising both awareness and money to assist families in desperate need of help protecting their children from the horrors of child abuse.”

In addition to accepting donations through its website Operation ExHale is also planning 24-hour telethons 5K runs and a charity softball game and auction involving former and current MLB players.

“Mr. Stern was a rising star within the company who had leapfrogged his way up the depth charts and earned increasingly important assignments” the complaint alleges (via TheWrap).

“All of that stopped and his career progression reversed when the company learned about his family troubles and began discriminating against Mr. Stern because he is a man. Indeed the company believed that as a man Mr. Stern should be obligated to subjugate his family and always put work first.”

In 1998 Deshpande started what might have been India’s first e-commerce website Malamall.com which was essentially an online marketplace for ethnic wear brands. With a dash of pride Deshpande told KrASIA the market was not ready for the site. Even though Malamall didn’t do well he learned a lot from running the business.

His next startup formed in 2007 was a software-as-a-service company called Martjack which he again claimed was one of the first homegrown SaaS companies in India. Deshpande said Martjack worked with companies like Pizza Hut Walmart and Future Group. Eight years later he sold it to Capillary Technologies.

Afterwards Deshpande got into venture capital investment. This was a time when tech startups were the talk of the town. VC firms from the United States and China were making investments in the country. However the entrepreneur-turned-investor was not comfortable in his role as a VC. Deshpande still had at least one startup in him and didn’t yet want to hang up his boots as someone who starts and runs a business.

Deshpande did some research and decided that waste management an industry estimated to be worth USD 14 billion in India by 2025 could be the next big thing for him.

Along with his former associates Abhishek Deshpande and Anirudha Jalan Deshpande started Recykal in 2017 a waste collection company that works with ragpickers who collect waste from residential houses and deposit refuse at recycling centers. To streamline the process Recykal launched an app called Uzed where individuals can schedule waste pickups.

However the unit economics for Uzed weren’t sound. “Households are not massive waste generators on a daily basis and the amount of waste we were collecting wasn’t enough for recyclers” said Deshpande founder and CEO of Recykal.

Recycling waste involves multiple parties—ragpickers waste collection centers municipalities recyclers and bulk waste generators that include schools hotels restaurants factories and shopping complexes.

Deshpande realized one product or app could not cover everyone’s needs and particularities. As Recykal rejigged its business Deshpande realized that he should approach bulk waste generators who can provide at least 10 kilos of trash per day. That way it would be economically viable for the company as well as maintain a steady supply for recyclers.

In 2019 Recykal pivoted to a B2B model where it built products for everyone involved in recycling.

Recykal created a new app for companies to send waste pickup requests that include details such as the quantities and types of garbage. The company then sends ragpickers who transport this waste to different collection centers where it is sorted.

Then Recykal created a marketplace to connect waste collection centers and recyclers. Deshpande said this channeled six to 20 tons of waste each month to recyclers giving them a steady stream of raw materials for their business. The company works with 160 recyclers across 25 states and claims to have facilitated the recycling of over 30000 metric tons of plastic waste.

What encouraged Recykal’s pivot was the Indian government’s rule on plastic waste management that introduced extended producer responsibility or EPR in 2016. This mandates all companies that generate plastic waste to ensure they collect and recycle a certain percentage of it.

“These brands didn’t know who to connect with to take care of EPR and since we already had a marketplace we created an EPR tool for brands. They create their target on the platform which we ensure is met within the stipulated time and once it’s done they can file the details with the government through our EPR tool” Deshpande said.

Recykal works with more than 75 brands such as Coke Pepsi Unilever LG and Panasonic.

In addition to marketplaces the company has also built a cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) tool for dry waste collection centers. It is used by more than 2000 clients.

Currently Recykal only collects paper plastic and electronic waste. This year it is looking to expand its operations in two new categories—rubber and batteries. “These are the two categories where the government is looking to bring EPR” Deshpande said.

In late 2020 the company raised an undisclosed amount of money from Circulate Capital a Singapore-based firm. Recykal is looking to raise USD 10–14 million in its Series A round.

“I started this company because since I had made good money from the last business I wanted to get into a space that could make me more money as well as create value for the society” Deshpande said.

Strange But True,"We may collect a share of sales from items linked to on this page. Learn more .

Could a chemical weapons manufacturing facility be the cause of a slew of earthquakes? According to historical records the answer is yes. Here’s the story.

Rocky Mountain Arsenal

In 1961 the U.S. Army’s Rocky Mountain Arsenal (located North and East of Denver Colorado) drilled a 12000-foot deep well for chemical weapon waste disposal the idea being that injecting poisonous chemicals deep underground was a “safe” way to get rid of them.

Before waste disposal began the Army began testing their idea by injecting approximately 568000 US gallons of city water into the deep well mostly to make sure their plan was safe. Shortly after these deep underground water injections began in 1961 the City of Denver began to experience a series of minor earthquakes. Considering that Denver does not sit upon any significant Earthquake fault lines this procedure of injecting water (and later chemicals) into a deep well was widely blamed for causing these earthquakes.

The well caused so much controversy that the Army stopped using it in February 1966 and it was then permanently sealed in 1985.

The Earthquakes

The Rocky Mountain area has had earthquakes over the years; however they are normally spread out over long periods of time. This all changed with the new deep well at Rocky Mountain Arsenal. The injection of chemicals began in March 1962 and by the end of the year 190 earthquakes had occurred. Most of these quakes were simply “felt” and did not cause much damage outside of some broken windows.

Unfortunately this trend of minor damage didn’t continue. From January 1963 to August 9 1967 more than 1300 earthquakes were recorded. Three 1965 shocks in particular were cause for alarm since they were rated at intensity level six. While a large earthquake in southeast Colorado in October 1966 temporarily drew some of the attention away from the Denver series a large Denver quake on April 10 1967 grabbed everyone’s attention.

The 1967 quake was the largest since 1962 and had a 5.0 magnitude. Hundreds of windows were broken cracks in the asphalt occurred around the metro area and Boulder area schools were found to have cracked walls. The shock was even felt at the capitol building where legislators ducked for cover for fear of chandeliers falling on them.

It’s generally believed that the water and chemicals injected deep underground “lubricated” existing fault lines and precipitated these Denver-area earthquakes. Seeing as how earthquakes tremors caused a lot of fear and anxiety among Denver residents the Army stopped injecting chemicals underground shortly after the April quake. However this didn’t stop the earthquakes.

One last major shock hit the Denver area on August 9 1967. The 5.3 magnitude tremor caused the most damage with homeowners across the region finding cracked walls and ceilings and floors separated from walls. Damage was widespread in this last quake.

The Arsenal Today

Thankfully the earthquakes associated with the Arsenal have stopped. Today the area is known as the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge and is home to all kinds of wildlife. The refuge has undergone massive cleanup efforts to restore the area. The area is also known for Dick’s Sporting Goods Park a soccer-stadium home to the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer.

While the arsenal has a storied past among most Denver residents the restoration of the land for the native wildlife has eased some of the criticisms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vbGlzdHMvMTItb2YtdGhlLW1vc3QtcmFkaW9hY3RpdmUtcGxhY2VzLW9uLWVhcnRo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Discover 12+ of the most radioactive places on Earth,"Radioactivity is a natural phenomenon that has existed since the birth of our planet.

However human activities such as nuclear weapons testing nuclear power generation and industrial accidents have created highly radioactive areas that are unsafe for human habitation.

Exposure to radiation is a part of everyday life. Going outside exposes you to low levels of ionizing radiation from the sun and you can’t even eat some foods without exposing yourself to radiation (albeit in tiny quantities).

The larvae of the black soldier fly are capable of digesting huge amounts of organic waste while making it possible to produce animal feed biofuels and fertilisers without consuming raw materials.

7 minutes

The start-up TicInsect based in southern Swiss Ticino canton is planning to set up the first bio-waste treatment plant in Switzerland in which a few hundred million of these voracious insects will be at work.

Most of us have probably wondered what flies are for especially when they buzz persistently in front of our noses and will not stop pestering us. Believe it or not these insects can carry out extremely useful tasks for us such as making a significant contribution to reducing resource wastage deforestation and climate change. They can become a valuable ally in creating a circular and sustainable economy.

Accelerated bio-conversion

The pesky flies are able to recycle cleanly and efficiently the enormous volume of food waste produced by industry households and agriculture.

“Nearly three million tonnes of organic waste is generated in Switzerland each year. For want of an appropriate separate collection system most of this ends up in incinerators. Throwing away material with such a high nutritional and energy value is not just a waste but an economic mistake” says Elisa Filippi founder and CEO of TicInsect.

Filippi who holds a degree in animal production science opened a laboratory in the Italian-speaking town of Tesserete last year with the aim of showing how organic waste can be managed and processed in a new way. The workers at this pilot plant are tens of thousands of larvae of the black soldier fly a variety that is highly resistant to disease cold and other environmental factors as well as being easy to handle and used to living in crowded conditions wherever they find organic matter. The larvae are highly voracious and can polish off a pizza in a matter of a few hours.

Inside the laboratory cages have been set up in which the soldier flies live out their rapid life-cycle: they are born mate lay their eggs and die within one to two weeks. After the eggs have been collected and incubated the larvae are born. Placed inside special boxes these great devourers of biomass grow from a microscopic size to several centimetres in length within around 20 days.

“During this period they do nothing but eat. In this way they carry out the bio-conversion of organic waste taking everything that is nutritious and transforming it into proteins and fats. They can even clean off and purify decomposing organic matter at the same time reducing the volume of the biomass by draining it of water” explains Filippi.

Animal feed

However the main purpose of the farm is not just to get rid of organic waste in a more intelligent way without using up energy. The larvae themselves and the matter they process can be recycled with added value in such a way as to reduce the consumption of raw materials on the planet.

“From 100 kilos of organic mass we can extract 10 kilos of protein for animal feed five kilos of fat to produce biofuels and 20 kilos of fertiliser. The rest is water which evaporates.”

The rapid growth in the world’s population and higher standards of living in many countries have led to a sharp increase in meat consumption. This trend is having a huge environmental impact particularly when it comes to the production of animal feed.

“The main sources of protein for meat-producing animals today are fishmeal and soybean meal. Fishmeal is a major cause of overfishing: we are depleting the oceans mainly in order to feed animals not people. The production of soybean meal requires large expanses of land and intensive monocultures which are often obtained through deforestation in tropical and sub-tropical areas” Filippi stresses.

Soy cultivation and overfishing disrupt ecosystems and exacerbates climate change. What is more both products have to be imported from far-off countries which has a negative impact in terms of transport

As an alternative to this the CEO of TicInsect therefore proposes using the larvae of the soldier fly to produce meal and fats for animal feed. It is a very nutritious feed with a protein profile and furthermore it is completely natural for many animal species. The animals are not being forced to consume things that they are not predisposed to eat: chickens other farmyard animals and pigs for instance have always eaten insects. Dogs and cats too.

“We are the ones who are forcing them to eat inappropriate foods which contain fish soybean and cereal meal” says Filippi.

Biofuels and fertilisers

For the production of animal feed it is forbidden by law to feed the larvae meat or fish in order to prevent any outbreaks similar to mad cow disease. TicInsect therefore makes use of vegetable waste stemming mainly from agri-food industries. Larvae fed with organic waste from households which contains a bit of everything could instead be used to produce fats to be transformed into biofuels and fertilisers for ornamental gardens or houseplants.

At the moment if it is not incinerated organic household waste is partially used to produce biogas or for composting. However both are inefficient solutions. Composting requires a lot of space and time precious commodities nowadays whereas larvae can carry out bio-conversion in just a few days and in small spaces. In the case of biogas only 30% of the organic mass can be recovered; the rest is sludge which must then be dealt with.

“Meanwhile with the larvae nothing is thrown away. Compared to other processes it is a virtuous circle as hardly any earth or water is consumed refuse matter is used and wastage is thus avoided production takes place locally and with the fat from the larvae clean energy can even be obtained to run the plant” says Filippi.

After receiving several awards and financial support for the pilot project the start-up hopes soon to find the necessary investments to build its first industrial plant from next year at an estimated cost of CHF3 million ($3.4 million) in which several hundreds of millions of flies will be bred.

Schemes of this kind have already sprung up or are under construction in several other European countries. The two largest ones are found in the Netherlands and France. In Switzerland there is still a lot of resistance says the founder of TicInsect.

“On the one hand flies and larvae elicit a certain revulsion even if breeding takes place in an enclosed area as required by law. On the other hand huge sums of money have been spent in Ticino and in many other cantons to build incinerators which have proved to be too big simply gigantic. So instead of increasingly promoting recycling and a circular economy the preferred solution today is just to burn everything.”

Photo by VnExpress/Thanh Nguyen.

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has asked HCMC to deal firmly with environmental pollution caused by two major waste treatment facilities.

The ministry's order was prompted by numerous residents complaining about the environmental pollution caused by the Tam Sinh Nghia Investment Development Joint Stock Company and the Vietstar Joint Stock Company in Cu Chi District.

Inspections by the ministry’s Vietnam Environment Administration found that the two companies have been polluting the environment since 2018 and that no measure has been taken to address the problem.

Vietstar’s waste treatment plant has a daily capacity of 1400 tons. However on December 16 last year it was found that the company collected up to 2000 tons a day. It has been slapped with a fine of VND296 million ($12800) but whether that has been enough to change its behavior is not known.

The company stored about 160000 tons of inert waste in two yards covering 32000 square meters. Many areas of the yards were not covered and the waste lay exposed. Leachate from the two yards was collected in a trench and the polluted water seeped into the soil.

Similarly in 2018 the Tam Sinh Nghia Company was found receiving 200 tons more than its daily capacity of handling 1000 tons of waste per day. It ignored warnings from the authorities and was found receiving 1300 tons on December 16 last year.

The company stored 240000 tons of waste in an outdoor area of more than 63000 square meters. Here too many areas were not well covered stinking up the neighborhood. Leachate that was not collected seeped into the soil and flowed into a lake on the company’s premises.

The ministry said the companies should be ordered to collect garbage in accordance with their designed capacity and other measures taken to deal with all the residual waste. It has advised that modern processing technology is used to treat the waste.

Ho Chi Minh City discharges around 9300 tons of domestic waste per day the municipal Environment Department said last year.

It has three waste treatment plants that have to handle 8700 tons of domestic waste discharged by a population of 13 million each day. The Da Phuoc Integrated Waste Management Facility of Vietnam Waste Solutions (VWS) receives 5700 tons and buries most of it.

The Tam Sinh Nghia Company and Vietstar handle the rest in Cu Chi District by burning and making compost.

Many landfills in Vietnam do not meet environmental requirements and upset people living nearby said Nguyen Thuong Hien head of the Vietnam Environment Administration’s waste management department.

There is no solid waste treatment model in the country that meets all technical economic social and environmental requirements he said adding that burying most of the waste not only pollutes the environment but also means the country cannot recycle its trash.

Vietnam produces 25.5 million tons of solid waste a year of which 75 percent is buried.

Major landfills in big cities like HCMC Da Nang and Hanoi have become overloaded and are affecting people's lives adversely.

Hanoi and HCMC spend VND1.2-1.5 trillion ($52-65 million) a year each or around 3.5 percent of their budget on collecting and treating garbage."

Residents had reported dozens of dead fishes and foul smells in a canal of the residential enclave’s South Cove last week. The area’s management was also alerted and moved to perform a major clean-up of the waterway.

But to the residents’ alarm the waters began turning pink on Wednesday and continued to stay pink on Thursday.

In a joint statement the National Environment Agency (NEA) and Sentosa Development Corporation said that along with the Sentosa Cove Resort Management they studied water samples from the canal between Jan 6 and 13 after fishes began dying.

The National University of Singapore’s Tropical Marine Science Institute also came on board to investigate why the waters turned pink.

Their findings suggested that the recent weeks’ rainfall had altered water conditions with tests on the water samples revealing low levels of salinity and dissolved oxygen. This could have caused the fishes’ deaths and a high level of nutrients they said.

“NEA has also assessed that the high nutrient level and organic content in the waters had in turn likely triggered the algae bloom which changed the colour of the waters” they added.

Algae bloom is a natural phenomenon where algae grow rapidly out of control which show up in many different colours such as green brown red or pink.

The authorities said that microscopic evaluation of the waters found the presence of “high amounts of pico-cyanobacteria” a form of algae.

The algae bloom could have begun before the waters began visibly changing colour and the colour can vary depending on the pico-cyanobacteria species and their pigment composition.

The authorities added: “The fish kills could thus also be due to the low level of oxygen caused by the cyanobacteria’s respiration or decomposition or suffocation due to gill clogging or irritation caused by the algal bloom. The unpleasant odour of the waters was likely due to decomposing dead fish.”

Marine experts previously told TODAY that while the bloom cannot be stopped clearing away the decomposing fishes and flushing the canals with fresh seawater would help it clear faster.

The NEA has tested the quality of seawater off Sentosa Cove and “found it to be within the usual variations”.

An NEA spokesman previously said that there was no indication of industrial or marine pollution that could have affected the waters in the surrounding area and it did not receive any reports of dead fishes at other public beaches over the last weekend.

The agency and the National Parks Board will continue to help the Sentosa Cove Resort Management in investigations and monitor the water quality in the South Cove waterway.

In the meantime residents are still advised to refrain from participating in water sport activities there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vc2luZ2Fwb3JlL3B1cnBsaXNoLXdhdGVycy1hdC1zZW50b3NhLXNvdXRoLWNvdmUtd2F0ZXJ3YXktZHVlLXRvLWhlYXZ5LXJhaW5mYWxsLWFsdGVyaW5nLXdhdGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pinkish-purple water dead fish in Sentosa South Cove waterway due to heavy rainfall altering water conditions,"In a letter sent to residents on Jan 11 seen by The Straits Times Knight Frank Property Asset Management on behalf of SCRM said the ""largest clean-up and haul of dead fish"" had been conducted.

Marine experts identified rabbitfish moonfish batfish and leatherjacket fish among the dead fish.

One resident drama educator Ms Thi Lien Margaillan who is in her forties said that while there are no dead fish sightings along the waterway the smell still lingers in the area.

Ms Thi Lien who runs the environmental-interest group The Heron of the Green Barrels on Facebook said that residents in the area were concerned about how the algae bloom affects the waterway.

""The water has yet to go back to normal and is now a muddy brown colour. As I live on a higher floor the smell was not so unbearable but I know residents living by the waterway will be affected if this happens again"" she said.

TMSI senior research fellow Dr Sandric Leong said that heavy and regular rainfall causes the salinity of sea-surface water to decrease and may also cause high-nutrient run off from land into the waterway. Rainwater he added was also a source of nutrients.

In response to queries a spokesman for SDC said that surface run-off from the Sentosa Golf Club did not drain into the waterway altering water conditions.

""As part of irrigation design surface run-off from the Sentosa Golf Club's courses does not drain into the South Cove waterway. The lakes and fishes at the courses have also remained unaffected"" she said.

Dr Leong said the algal bloom as a complex phenomenon caused by multiple factors such as light nutrients and water movements. The cyanoboacteria's adaptability to sudden changes in environmental conditions like the recent continuous rainfalls enables it to out-compete other phytoplankton or algae he added.

""Due to rainfalls the light condition was low cyanobacteria could grow better in low light level when compared to others"" he said.

Dr Leong noted that algal bloom is a natural phenomenon that cannot be stopped or cleared away.

""The seawater and algal species need to be monitored regularly in order to minimise impact. It could happen again when the right species is present with the optimal conditions for bloom formation"" he said.

The statement on Sunday added that NEA and the National Parks Board would continue to assist SCRM on investigations and monitoring of the quality of waters in the South Cove waterway. As a precautionary measure SCRM advised residents to continue to refrain from water sport activities in the waterway.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vbW90aGVyc2hpcC5zZy8yMDIxLzAxL2RlYWQtZmlzaC1zZW50b3NhLWNvdmUtcGluay13aHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dead fish & bad smell at Sentosa Cove possibly caused by algal bloom: NEA,"A few days ago (Jan. 12) Sentosa South Cove residents were greeted by strange-smelling waters in the canal that had turned pink.

The waters however has largely returned to normal — grey with a slight tinge of purple — when Mothership went down to check out the situation on the morning of Jan. 14.

According to a joint-statement by the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) and National Environment Agency (NEA) the fish kill could be due to the change in water conditions due to recent weeks' heavy and persistent rainfall.

The agency also added that the ""unpleasant odour of the waters was likely due to decomposing dead fish"".

Heavy & persistent rainfall altered water conditions in Sentosa’s South Cove

The SDC and NEA together with Sentosa Cove Resort Management (SCRM) studied water samples collected from the waterway of Sentosa’s South Cove between January 6 and 13 2021.

SDC and SCRM also collaborated with the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI) to further investigate the change in the colour of the waters.

The findings suggest that the recent weeks’ heavy and persistent rainfall had altered the water conditions in Sentosa’s South Cove.

Particularly tests on the water samples had found low levels of salinity and dissolved oxygen which may have caused the fish kill as well as a high level of nutrients.

NEA: High nutrient level & organic content in waters triggered algal bloom caused fish kill

NEA assessed that the high nutrient level and organic content in the waters had in turn likely triggered the algal bloom which changed the colour of the waters.

TMSI NUS’ microscopic evaluation of the waters had found the presence of high amounts of pico-cyanobacteria a form of algae.

The bloom could have begun prior to a visible change in colour of the waters.

The fish kill could thus also be due to the low level of oxygen caused by the cyanobacteria’s respiration or decomposition or suffocation due to gill clogging or irritation caused by the algal bloom.

The unpleasant odour of the waters was likely due to decomposing dead fish the statement notes.

NEA has also tested the seawater quality in the waters off Sentosa Cove and found it to be within the usual variations.

SCRM will continue to monitor the situation and explore preventive measures that could be undertaken in future.

As a precautionary measure SCRM advises residents to continue to refrain from water sport activities in the waterway.

With the rollout of vaccines underway and a new round of economic stimulus landing soon JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup each said on Friday that they had begun to pare back the enormous reserves they had socked away in case of an economic disaster.

Citigroup’s chief financial officer Mark Mason cited the vaccines the most recent round of stimulus and the election outcome — which is likely to result in a bigger stimulus package — as drivers of the bank’s decision to raise its economic forecast lower its expectations for the unemployment rate in 2021 and release some rainy-day funds.

“There are a lot of favorable indicators that support the direction of the variables and make for a more positive outlook in 2021” Mr. Mason said on a call with journalists to discuss the bank’s results adding that things had improved even more since Citi had closed its books after calculating its fourth-quarter performance and its economic forecast this month.

Some of the changes that banks are making to their forecasts could be temporary. New accounting rules force them to tweak their reserves and their forecasts more frequently to keep up with changes to conditions in the financial markets and the economy. But their brighter outlook was not just confined to the paper on which their quarterly results were printed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L2l0cy1oaWdoLXRpbWUtc2FsdC1sYWtlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More skyscrapers are coming to downtown Salt Lake City,"(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Salt Lake City's skyline will change in 2021 with several new skyscrapers and midsize towers going up across Utah's capital city.

“Small” Lake City keeps growing up.

Need proof? Check out the ever-rising skyline where 2021 and 2022 will bring three new skyscrapers to the heart of Utah’s capital:

• The 24-story Liberty Sky apartment tower climbing 250 feet.

• The 25-story 95 State at City Creek office complex soaring 393 feet.

• The 26-story Hyatt Regency convention center hotel climbing 375 feet.

None of these high-rises will displace the city’s top two skyscrapers in terms of height. Those are the 26-floor Wells Fargo Center on Main Street (at 422 feet) and the 28-story LDS Church Office Building (420 feet). (It’s a myth that Salt Lake City ever had a rule against building anything taller than the North Temple behemoth housing offices for the state’s predominant faith.)

The Wells Fargo building will lose its lofty status however when the planned 39-story 448-foot Kensington Tower peaks above all the others. Home to a vacated Carl’s Jr. restaurant the northwest corner of State Street and 200 South will at a date not yet set see luxury residences replace fast-food burgers.

(Renderings courtesy of Kensington Investment Co. via Salt Lake City) A wider view of Kensington Tower a new skyscraper proposed by a Boston real estate investment company at the northwest corner of 200 South and State Street in Salt Lake City. As designed the 380-apartment luxury residential tower would rise 448 feet with an open-air rooftop terrace and other top-flight features.

On Monday global developer Hines based in Houston unveiled its latest plans for a new 31-story skyscraper at 150 S. Main where the historic Utah Theater is to be demolished under a deal inked in late 2019 by former Mayor Jackie Biskupski.

If it rises as planned the 392-foot tower to be called Main Street Apartments will offer 400 new dwellings with 40 more affordable 355 at market rates and five penthouses. It will have a separate parking structure and a new wide-corridor plaza and park running east to west at ground level on Main even with Regent Street.

(Courtesy of Hines/Dwell Design Studios via Salt Lake City Planning Department) Global developer Hines has filed plans to build a 31-story apartment complex at the former site of Utah Theater on Salt Lake City’s Main Street. The tower at 150 S. Main to be called Main Street Apartments will include more 400 apartments and stand 392 feet tall initial plans show. (Jan. 12 2021)

Designs also call for a striking two-story open and columned sky lounge at the midrise 21st and 22nd floors and a private terrace on the rooftop near the tower’s luxury residences.

Little slowdown in 2020

Not even a global pandemic could knock Salt Lake City off this upward trajectory. With construction deemed essential under health edicts a multiyear downtown building boom kept rolling last year and will now reach well into 2021 and beyond — pushing the city upward and out as it adds new skyscrapers scads of office spaces and hundreds of apartments and hotel rooms.

Though they all shuddered with the coronavirus only a small fraction of nearly 50 major developments in the city center’s pipeline has faltered due to COVID-19. Volumes of new building permits and plan reviews even strained City Hall at times as a long-sought critical mass of downtown residents and housing units added since 2010 continues to mushroom.

The new skyscrapers will be unmistakable on the city’s mountain-framed horizons. They will bring additional height and density new standards of residential and office luxury and a distinct architectural feel.

Under city standards adopted just before this latest building spurt the new downtown landmarks are designed for lively ground floors to create a sense of vibrancy. Their facades and relationship to the street are shaped to make walking the city more interesting with engaging entrances big windows and street-side shops eateries and other eye-drawing features.

“All these kind of work together to create an ensemble effect that is much more visually lively” said Brenda Case Scheer University of Utah professor emeritus of architecture and planning.

If struggling downtown merchants can hold on Scheer and others insist the construction and new residents are likely to elevate foot traffic and commerce well past a vaccine while bumping up the city’s world profile in general.

“I’ve been waiting for Salt Lake to be a city for a long time” joked Scheer who heads the city’s Planning Commission. “Every city advertises its skyline” and especially with the Wasatch range as a backdrop “we have the potential for a really beautiful skyline.”

Dozens of other projects underway in 2021 will bring new midsize buildings including the Post District spanning more than a city block from 500 South to 600 South between 300 West and 400 West. And while these may not greatly alter the skyline their office retail and residential offerings will continue to change life downtown.

Here’s a look at the projects coming on line this year and soon afterward.

The skyscrapers

95 State at City Creek

(Rendering courtesy of Skidmore Owings & Merrill via Salt Lake City) 95 State at City Creek will rise 25 stories at the northeast corner of State Street and 100 South in Salt Lake City.

At 25 stories this top-end office tower at 100 South and State Street is set to open in fall 2021. It’s the work of City Creek Reserve a development arm of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which also built the 25-floor 380-foot 111 Main a little over a block away.

The building dubbed 95 State at City Creek aims to be a pinnacle in what’s called Class A office life with 515000 square feet of workspaces that backers say will “reinvent the 9-to-5” experience and promote the health and well-being of its occupants. It also will include a ground-level meetinghouse.

At 393 feet high it will edge out 111 Main as the city’s third tallest building in today’s lineup.

Designed by Chicago-based architects at Skidmore Owings & Merrill the tower also further solidifies the LDS Church among downtown’s top developers of office retail and residential properties a portfolio that includes the neighboring City Creek Center opened in 2012.

Hyatt Regency Salt Lake City

(Renderings courtesy of Portman Architects) Rendition of the new convention center hotel being built at the northwest corner of 200 South and West Temple in Salt Lake City above the Salt Palace Convention Center. The 26-story hotel to be called Hyatt Regency Salt Lake City will have 700 rooms and 60000 square feet of meeting space and will be built into the existing Salt Palace for “seamless access.”

Tourism boosters in Salt Lake County toiled for more than a decade to make this tower at West Temple and 200 South happen hoping its big room count and spacious meeting halls will help draw some the country’s largest national conventions.

The new $377 million 26-story Hyatt Regency Salt Lake City won’t open until fall 2022 but three levels of concrete construction above that southwest corner near the Salt Palace are already complete and vertical steel will start going up later this month according to Salt Lake County.

Work on the building’s exterior facade and additional stories will be notable in 2021. The long rectangular tower will boast a distinct curved exterior at its south end and extend north like a wall along a portion of that block on West Temple. Earlier plans for multistory LED screens facing onto 200 South have been discarded.

According to the county pandemic-related event cancellations at the Salt Palace are letting construction crews make unexpected headway on the hotel which is being built by Portman Holdings of Atlanta and southern Utah-based DDRM.

Liberty Sky

(Rendering courtesy of Cowboy Properties) Cowboy Properties and Boyer Co. plan to open the residential tower Liberty Sky in late 2021 part of a doubling of rental units downtown since 2010. The 24-story $90 million apartment building is rising on the east side of State Street between the Federal Building on 100 South and the Maverik headquarters building on 200 South.

This 24-story residential tower going up at at 151 S. State will be a stunner on several scores not least as the city’s first building of that height devoted to high-end apartments for rent.

Pushed by developers Cowboy Partners and The Boyer Co. the $90 million tower will offer up to 300 primarily one-bedroom dwellings with some studios and two-bedroom units all at market rates. Residents get access to a penthouse clubhouse pool game room fitness center and a ground-floor parking structure.

The building’s exterior is clad in glass and exposed concrete with a distinct industrial feel designed by Atlanta-based architects Smallwood Reynolds Stewart Stewart & Associates.

The tower is scheduled for completion in late 2021 according to its builder Utah-based Jacobsen Construction.

Most of the heavy lifting on this 10-story building of new offices to be named 650 Main located at Main Street and 600 South will happen this year with an opening planned in early 2022.

Developers with Houston-based Patrinely Group broke ground in July after securing EnerBank USA a consumer lending company as a tenant for the building’s top three floors.

The office and retail tower will have a new TRAX station nearby to be funded with contributions to the Utah Transit Authority by the city its Redevelopment Agency and several developers now chasing projects in the neighborhood.

The tower is designed by HOK a global firm based in St. Louis and plans call for a spacious lobby ground-floor shops a private courtyard and spaces for indoor and outdoor dining.

Assuming 650 Main succeeds Patrinely says it plans to construct a similar office tower on adjacent land at 645 W. Temple.

Mya The Shop and Avia (aka The Exchange)

(Rendering courtesy of KTGY Architecture + Planning via Salt Lake City) Rendering of The Exchange a cluster of new mixed-use structures called Mya The Shop and Avia going in the northeast corner of 300 East and 400 South in downtown Salt Lake City.

This $124 million residential and commercial project also called The Exchange is spread over the high-profile corner of 300 East and 400 South and is expected to wrap up in 2021.

Developers with New York-based Domain Cos. which is partnering with Salt Lake City’s Giv Group say Mya will have 126 units of mostly affordable apartments opening early in 2021 to be followed by The Shop a $14 million coworking community.

According to Giv Group most rents in the five-story Mya are to be kept within reach of those making as low as half the city’s median wages. Avia at nine stories will be more of a high-end complex with 286 one- two- and three-bedroom units to be finished in spring 2021.

The city which partnered with Giv and Domain to make the affordable piece possible says it needs housing of all types but especially at more moderate prices and rents even as planners approved nearly 3500 new units in 2020.

The Exchange complex will have ample room for street-level retailers as well as rooftop gardens and a solar-powered heating and cooling system.

The Exchange joins several apartment complexes built along that commercial corridor since 2012 when city officials gave 400 South and other arteries with mass transit special zoning rules meant to encourage higher-density development along TRAX lines.

Paperbox Lofts

Developers PEG Development and Clearwater Homes are putting up three mix-use buildings with a total of 195 residential units and about 2266 square feet of retail space on the two-acre strip of land formerly occupied by the Paper Box Company.

Built by ClearWater Homes in Salt Lake City and Provo-based PEG Cos. this residential complex with two six-floor structures and a three-floor building all at 340 W. 200 South will open its first units in spring 2021 just south of Vivint Smart Home Arena.

Paperbox Lofts has a total 195 new apartments built around an inner plaza on what was a thin two-acre former industrial site once used to make paper boxes. Like The Exchange drawing on financial backing from Salt Lake City Paperbox Lofts also will have affordable units with 39 of its apartments rented to residents making 60% of area median incomes.

The project will deploy a new multilevel automated parking system for the first time in Salt Lake City too. Made by Oakland-based CityLift the structure is akin to a vehicle vending machine that will stack and retrieve residents’ cars.

The West Quarter

(Rendering courtesy of The Ritchie Group/Architectural Nexus via Salt Lake City) An early rendering of The Ritchie Group's proposed Block 67 development in Salt Lake City also known as The West Quarter as though looking north along 300 West. Supporters of Japantown along 100 South fear the development could overwhelm the historic cultural enclave.

This huge development with its first stage rising 11 floors on the city’s Block 67 bounded by 100 South and 200 South from 200 West to 300 West will effectively push some of that new downtown height farther west and tie in downtown pedestrians with an emerging entertainment and office district being shaped out of former retail spaces at The Gateway.

Developers with The Ritchie Group in Salt Lake City and Garn Development Co. in Layton are constructing the commercial and residential pieces of The West Quarter in phases with rolling completion dates through 2022 and beyond.

Phase one will include an 11-story tower of 240 luxury apartments for rent to be called The Charles with more than 11655 square feet of ground-level retail space. That and a second 11-story building dubbed The Grid Hotel with 270 guest rooms are set for completion in June 2022.

Along the way The Ritchie Group has floated plans for as many as 650 dwellings over The West Quarter’s many phases along with two hotels an office tower retail shops a tree-lined street cutting through the block and an underground parking structure offering more than 1200 stalls.

Developers and the city are in talks with members of Utah’s Asian community on ways The West Quarter will acknowledge and celebrate adjacent Japantown a once-thriving neighborhood along 100 South possibly with a pocket park or other amenities.

255 S. State

(Rendering courtesy of Brinshore Development) A summer 2020 rendering of proposed 13-story and eight-story residential towers planned by Chicago-based Brinshore Development at 255 S. State Street in Salt Lake City.

Groundbreaking for this high-profile housing project at 255 S. State St. tentatively planned in early 2021 will bring immense sighs of relief at City Hall.

After more than eight years of delays engineering problems and financial struggles for other developers the site was empty and in disrepair when the city’s Redevelopment Agency hired Brinshore Development in 2018. The Chicago-based firm has since finalized plans and financing to build 190 studios and apartments and more than 20000 square feet of lower-floor commercial spaces in 13-story and eight-story glass and steel towers on the city-owned lot.

The two buildings will face onto a signature midblock “paseo” or walkway designed for special events. Construction is set to start in January 2021 and Brinshore says it’ll be done in two years.

All but 22 of the project’s apartments will be kept affordable including some accessible to residents making as low as 20% of average wages. By then what was once a large rusting and graffiti-pocked eyesore along State Street will be gone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tZXJjdXJ5bmV3cy9uYW1lL2thdGhyeW4teW91bmctb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzE2NzU5N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kathryn Young Obituary (1948 - 2020) - Resident Of Palo Alto CA - Mercury News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/mercurynews/name/kathryn-young-obituary?id=7167597 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tZXJjdXJ5bmV3cy9uYW1lL2thdGhyeW4teW91bmctb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzE2NzU5N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former bank robber has change of heart helps others as a peer support specialist,"Daily Sentinel file photo

JPMorgan Chase on Friday beat analysts’ estimates for fourth-quarter profit on record trading results and a boost from releasing money previously set aside for loan losses. The sell-off was part of a price slide in the banking sector led by weakness in Wells Fargo and Citigroup.

Shares of Exxon slipped more than 5% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation into the oil giant over how it valued a key asset in the oil-rich Permian Basin. The bad news quickly spread to other stocks in the energy sector including Chevron. Lower oil prices also weighed on the stock.

On Friday March E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures settled at 30720 down 189 or -0.62%.

Daily Swing Chart Technical Analysis

The main trend turned down on the daily swing chart on Friday when buyers took out 30638 breaking a higher-top higher-bottom chart pattern that had been intact since January 4. The main trend will change to up on a move through 31116. Taking out 31148 will reaffirm the uptrend. The downtrend will be reaffirmed on a trade through 29318.

The first minor range is 31148 to 30506. Its 50% level at 30827 is potential resistance.

The second minor range is 29760 to 31148. Its 50% level at 30454 is the first potential support level.

The short-term range is 29318 to 31148. Its 50% level at 30233 is the most important support level. It’s the last potential support level before the 23918 main bottom.

The main range is 25872 to 31148. Its retracement zone at 28510 to 27887 is controlling the near-term direction of the Dow.

Short-Term Outlook

Given the close at 30720 we’re looking for an upside bias to develop on a trade over 30827 and for the downside bias to resume on a trade through 30454.

Bullish Scenario

A sustained move over 30827 will indicate the presence of buyers. This could lead to a test of the pair of tops at 31116 and 31148. Taking out these levels will signal a resumption of the uptrend.

Bearish Scenario

A sustained move under 30454 will signal the presence of sellers. This could trigger a break into 30233. Buyers could come in on the first test of this zone but if it fails be prepared for an acceleration into a minor bottom at 29760.

The main bottom at 29318 is the last potential support before the 28510 – 27887 retracement zone. This area is controlling the near-term direction of the Dow.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Police say shots were fired into a West Philadelphia home Friday night and those inside returned fire ending with one person being taken to the hospital.

It happened around 11:30 p.m. on the 3800 block of Parrish Street.

Police said it appeared a party was taking place inside the home when multiple shots were fired into the first and second floors from outside.

Some inside the home then began shooting toward the outside police said.

A 34-year-old woman was struck once in the arm. She was taken to the hospital in stable condition.

Police found approximately 20 shell casings across the street from the home. Fifteen shell casings were found inside the home.

They also discovered two guns inside of a Toyota Corolla that was parked in front of the house. The Toyota which was unoccupied was hit with bullets several times.

Qualcomm's $1.4 billion startup buy takes aim at Apple,"Qualcomm has agreed to purchase Nuvia for approximately $1.4 billion. The news is music to the ears of Qualcomm’s various partners. Samsung Sony OnePlus LG and others with products spanning smartphones to smart car systems have issued supportive statements. This could be one of the most significant tech acquisitions of the year.

But why is Nuvia joining Qualcomm such a big deal? The short version is that the deal sees Qualcomm return to custom CPU designs based on the Arm architecture. This has wide-ranging implications for Qualcomm’s silicon portfolio from high-performance servers to energy-efficient smartphones. However there’s much more to the story than that.

What is Nuvia and what does it do?

Nuvia designs CPUs based on the Arm architecture. Ex-Apple CPU design chief Gerard Williams founded the company in early 2019. It was also co-founded by John Bruno who was a System Architect at Google before spending five years at Apple in a similar capacity. These two have decades of processor design experience between them alone.

It’s particularly noteworthy that Williams was Chief CPU Architect at Apple. He worked on the company’s Cyclone Typhoon Twister Hurricane Monsoon and Vortex CPU architectures for various Apple A series SoCs. Prior to his work at Cupertino Williams spent 12 years as an Arm Fellow working on the Cortex-A8 and Cortex-A15 architectures that powered early smartphones over a decade ago. The two are joined by Manu Gulati another ex-Google and Apple silicon employee and lead architect for Apple’s mobile SoCs.

Nuvia was founded by ex-Apple and Google CPU lead designers.

In December 2019 Apple sought to sue Gerard Williams for breach of contract. It asserted that Williams started work on Nuvia and recruited some of his fellow colleagues while still employed at Apple. Williams however claimed that Apple engaged in anticompetitive practices in an attempt to prevent him from co-founding with John Bruno. Apple wasn’t happy that some of its lead CPU designers took their expertise elsewhere.

Since its inception Nuvia has designed datacenter processors targeting industry-leading performance and energy efficiency. Its data center CPUs use a custom version of the Arm CPU architecture. It is not unlike the licensing agreement Apple uses for the CPUs powering its iPhone iPad and now Arm-based MacBook product ranges.

Why buy Nuvia now?

Gary Sims / Android Authority

In a nutshell Qualcomm is after Nuvia’s custom Arm design expertise. The logical starting place will be in the data center market where Nuvia is already designing chips. Arm-based CPUs are gaining steam in the cloud computing space with Amazon’s Graviton Arm Neoverse looking to shake up the market. This deal will therefore have caught the attention of Intel and AMD. Qualcomm has already made it clear that it plans to leverage Nuvia’s custom design approach to cover swathes of its chipset portfolio too.

5G the convergence of computing and mobile architectures and the expansion of mobile technologies into other industries are significant opportunities for Qualcomm. Cristiano Amon President and CEO-Elect Qualcomm Incorporated

Qualcomm’s press release makes heavy mention of combining Nuvia CPUs alongside its in-house GPU DSP AI and multimedia accelerators for comprehensive platforms for a variety of markets. Smartphones driver assistance systems extended reality networking and next-generation laptops are all on the list. It’s that latter option that could turn out to be the driving factor behind the whole deal. That’s because it would provide Qualcomm with the technology to compete with Intel AMD and now Apple in the consumer PC space.

Qualcomm’s more recent Kryo CPUs now use off-the-shelf Cortex-A CPUs designed by Arm. This approach has worked well for smartphone processors. Cortex-A performance has proven more than good enough leaving Qualcomm to focus on in-house GPU DSP ISP and other components that play a key part in its heterogeneous approach to mobile computing. Arm vs x86: Instruction sets architecture and all key differences explained

However Apple’s custom CPU approach has yielded superior performance for tablet and laptop products. The latest Apple M1 processor is overseeing a transition away from dependence on Intel’s x86 architecture to Arm for its MacBook products. It’s targeting performance well above what we’ve seen from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx rebranded Microsoft SQ2 chips. Qualcomm’s last in-house Arm CPU design on the other hand was its Krait series. It last appeared in 2016. However with ex-Apple engineers at the helm Qualcomm could soon get back into the custom-CPU game and change its approach to the Arm compute performance problem.

It’s exciting to see NUVIA join the Qualcomm team ... moving forward we have an incredible opportunity to empower our customers across the Windows ecosystem. Panos Panay Chief Product Officer Microsoft.

Qualcomm is assisting Microsoft with its own support for Arm-powered PCs providing Snapdragon platforms for the Windows on Arm initiative. Current-gen performance is fine for portable home and business laptops but is underwhelming for more demanding creative applications and enterprise solutions. If the two companies share the vision for a single Arm architecture spanning mobile PC and server products Qualcomm will require even more performance than Arm’s Cortex-A CPUs have offered thus far. The solution appears to be to take a leaf from Apple’s book and go down the custom architecture route.

Hedging against NVIDIA buying Arm

Nvidia

Another thought that may have influenced Qualcomm’s purchase is the looming prospect of NVIDIA purchasing Arm pending regulatory approval.

As noted Qualcomm is dependant on Arm for its CPU needs. NVIDIA’s purchase of Arm casts doubt over future business arrangements. Of course NVIDIA has gone to great efforts to ensure the industry that it will be business as usual for Arm if the acquisition goes ahead but prudent businesses hedge their risks. Remember NVIDIA and Qualcomm are direct competitors in a number of markets including automotive and data center segments.

Returning to at least some level of custom CPU design affords Qualcomm greater control over its destiny.

It’s possible that the direction of Arm’s Cortex-A roadmap may change under NVIDIA’s influence and may not align with Qualcomm’s ambitions or needs. Access to or pricing of Arm’s portfolio could also change with NVIDIA retaining the highest performing part for internal use only. Or the business model may stay the same.

Returning to at least some level of custom CPU design affords Qualcomm greater control over its destiny. Building up an in-house design team would also be an invaluable asset in the unlikely event that Qualcomm wants to transition from Arm to an entirely new instruction set in the future. This is a sensible plan when one of your biggest competitors is set to control an essential business partner. At the same time Arm may not be too happy at potentially losing out on-chip royalties from one of its biggest customers.

What to expect from future Qualcomm/Nuvia CPUs

The acquisition of Nuvia is a major move that could eventually shake up Qualcomm’s entire silicon portfolio. With ex-Apple CPU design leads at the helm it’s clear that Qualcomm will reintroduce custom Arm architecture CPUs back into its roadmap. These designs could span products for low power smartphones right through to cloud computing servers.

In the consumer space the link back to Apple cannot be overstated. Investment in its Apple A-series of CPU is helping the company unify mobile and PC products under a single architecture. Apple is carving out a unified approach to computing for the coming years thanks to its approach to CPUs with performance and battery life benefits in tow. No doubt Qualcomm shares a similar vision for its expansive chipset portfolio.

Ironically Qualcomm’s return to the custom CPU space arrives not long after Samsung ended the development of its custom Mongoose Arm CPU cores. Future Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets may drop Cortex-A CPUs for in-house designs. If Qualcomm can succeed where Samsung ran into difficulties Qualcomm smartphones may pull ahead of their Android rivals and close the single-core CPU gap with Apple. However smartphone performance is reasonably fine as is. It’s laptop and server chips that could use a new approach.

Transitions of this nature will take many years to play out. In the short-term Qualcomm’s roadmap likely won’t change much if at all. Nuvia’s first server products were already not expected to arrive until 2022 at the earliest. Reconfiguring its smartphone and other chipset roadmaps around this acquisition could take even longer. We’ll keep an eye out for announcements in the coming months and years.

Perceptions are fueled by partisan animus economic dislocation and increasing alienation. People are good or evil. You either hate or love. Nuances disappear. Simplicity substitutes for clarity.

Sheldon Adelson embodied this more than almost anyone beloved by those who admired his acts of boundless generosity unmatched entrepreneurship and visionary accomplishments and reviled by those who despised his Republican donations anti-union crusades and occasional vindictiveness.

There were very few people who were agnostic about Adelson who died last week at 87. But like so many human beings especially remarkably successful ones he was a complex man just as likely to quietly help a wounded warrior as he was to try to bankrupt a journalist who displeased him just as likely to donate significant sums of his fortune to Israel-related charities as he was to obsess over a dispute with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority for decades just as likely continue to pay his employees throughout a pandemic as he was to muse about nuking Iran.

Much has already been written about Adelson some of it hagiographic some of it hateful. He was as polarizing as almost any non-elected public figure alive.

While there were some notable praiseworthy columns I do not think I have ever seen the level of disgusting savagery in the social media sewer that the announcement of his death occasioned. And yet I also think all of us would like the person closest to us to write as touching a remembrance upon our deaths as Miriam Adelson did for her husband.

But I come not to bury or simply praise Adelson knowing full well that what many felt was evil about him will live on and that much of the good he unquestionably did will be interred in Jerusalem where he was laid to rest a few days ago and where he was able to after so many years persuade a president to move the Israeli embassy.

Adelson’s impact on the gaming industry and state and national politics (not to mention that of Israel’s) cannot be underestimated. He revolutionized the industry’s attitude toward conventions and proved the doubters wrong with his all-suite approach and investment in Macau. He more than anyone else was responsible for bringing the Raiders to Las Vegas — an idea he conceived and then devoted all of his company’s resources to pushing a (sweetheart and awful) financial deal through the Legislature for what would become Allegiant Stadium.

Adelson is a seminal figure in the history of Las Vegas deserving of a place in the pantheon that began with Bugsy Siegel and includes Howard Hughes Kirk Kerkorian and Steve Wynn. Indeed in many ways Adelson was the anti-Wynn.

Unlike the undeniably charismatic brilliantly articulate and preternaturally extroverted ex-chairman of Wynn Resorts who hobnobbed with celebrities and loved being in his own ads the more private Adelson was driven by his desire to succeed and prosper ever the poor kid from Dorchester ever the outsider.

The Mirage and the Bellagio were spectacular yes but The Venetian and the Palazzo were too in their own way.

“He was not afraid to go all-in and take his position based upon his opinion without looking over his shoulder or second-guessing himself” Wynn said after Adelson’s death in an almost perfect coda for the Las Vegas Sands chairman’s life a quote that is at once laudatory and somehow not. Adelson was indeed driven was hard to dissuade when he had an idee fixe about politics or business. One of those was that Macau was an untapped gold mine for the industry which occasioned much derision inside the industry but ultimately resulted in Wynn coming to Adelson for tips on entering the market.

“Steve liked to share his vision and so did Sheldon in a much more practical way with far less color and adjectives” said Andy Abboud who for 23 years was the chairman’s political right hand. “He had a very practical business sense would walk through the financial modeling of integrated resorts why you have so many square feet of convention space the mechanics of how you make money.”

Or as someone else who knew him well told me: “He was a finisher. He did what he said he was going to do. He was not all talk; he was all do.”

My sense was that some people were jealous of Steve Wynn but some people just hated Sheldon Adelson. He was the incarnation of the billionaire trying to buy elections and politicians simply to make or save himself more money.

“Anybody who is high-profile and has been a disruptor as he has been – in philanthropy in business and in politics – he is going to make enemies” said Matt Brooks the executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition that Adelson helped fund.

But those who really knew him said Adelson did not contribute hundreds of millions to politicians and PACs over the years because of his personal bottom line. For him especially after he became wealthy the money was just a way of keeping score – and by that metric no one in the business he had chosen came close.

Adelson’s politics were not as easy to pinpoint as his pre- and post-mortem cartoonists tried to do. Yes he was a zealous supporter of Israel an unabashed Zionist and a fiscal conservative.

But he was also pro-choice pro-gay marriage and pro-immigration reform. He strongly believed the GOP was wrong on immigration his immigrant parents always on his mind.

Adelson also diverged from many in his party – including some bleating daily in Nevada – about the pandemic and the government’s response.

“He never was going to diminish how horrific the pandemic would be and he never had a problem with any of the measures that came down (from the governor)” Abboud told me. “The pandemic scared the daylights out of him.”

Adelson’s decision to continue to pay his employees – even after COVID lasted much longer than a month or two – was widely and justifiably lauded. Sure he could afford to do it more than his counterparts but he also spared his workers from untold hardships.

It’s hard to believe the man he helped elect President Donald Trump would have done the same. And while Adelson surely had little regard for Trump’s lack of substance he also probably saw him as a winner and used him to pursue his political agenda. And Trump for his part if he respected anyone it was someone who had (a lot) more money than he did.

By contrast Adelson’s little-known backchannel relationship with the most powerful Nevadan ever to hold office – Democratic Sen. Harry Reid – was a testament to both Adelson’s practicality and his and Reid’s similar blunt styles. Reid knew that Adelson could marshal significant resources against him in campaigns and Adelson knew that Reid had ascended to the pinnacle of capital power. It was a symbiosis that served both men.

That’s not to say there wasn’t a darker side to Adelson’s involvement in politics.

His effort to discredit former employee Shelley Berkley by releasing internal company memos she wrote and going all out to beat her in a race for Congress was ruthless and nasty. He once hired a quite-inept Las Vegas consultant to try to defeat three Democratic Clark County commissioners and was dubbed the “billionaire bully” in mail pieces. And his team essentially created the phenomenon known as Adam Laxalt out of whole cloth and ran one of the nastiest campaigns in recent history against Steve Sisolak in the 2018 governor’s race.

All of which goes to show that Adelson…often wasn’t very good at politics.

Berkley won that race all three of his candidates for the Clark County Commission lost and of course Sisolak is now governor. And even when he had success it was nothing to boast about. Adelson now has the unique distinction of having spent a fortune to help elect arguably the worst governor in the state’s history (Jim Gibbons) and arguably the worst president in the country’s history (Trump).

Adelson also spent an inordinate amount of time in what seemed like petty feuds whether it was pitting one local temple against another or suing journalists near and far. I’m sure Adelson thought he was wronged. But the lengths he went to especially with The Indy’s John L. Smith as the columnist detailed in a piece for The Daily Beast were quite appalling and frightening.

Sometimes it seemed it wasn’t enough for Adelson to win. He sought to crush maim destroy. (His Javert-like pursuit of the convention authority and its leaders through a half-century after feeling he had been disrespected when he owned COMDEX fits this pattern too.)

Emphasizing the duality of the man Adelson’s many acts of generosity and kindness some known and many unknown show a much different side.

He gave tens of millions of dollars to groups such as Birthright Israel which offers free trips to the country for young adults and other organizations there. And he has long been a supporter of veterans including his work with the Wounded Warriors Project.

“When we would do the Wounded Warriors he would always go and chat with them at dinner” Abboud recalled. “He would quietly do these incredibly generous things help them financially provide medical assistance and long-term care. No one ever knew about it.”

I was particularly struck by a Facebook post from Ed Bernstein the well-known lawyer and onetime Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate about his daughter Dana who died three years ago after a long battle with Crohn’s disease.

“There wasn’t a time when Dana would call him for a medical emergency that he didn’t respond immediately and offer his help” Bernstein wrote. “He was always kind and loving to her and I will forever be grateful for that. His generosity and good deeds will be remembered by many.”

As for my relationship with Adelson I knew and observed him for more than 30 years from before he imploded The Sands to make way for The Venetian after which I referred to him as Gondolier Numero Uno. (I was told he chuckled.) I did not know him well but I interacted with him and his agents enough times to get more than a sense of the man.

We had cross words a few times but I always found him to be a fascinating and refreshingly candid interview whether he was on my TV show or in his office or if I ran into him at an event and managed to get by his security detail.

(One thing that has stuck with me is how protective Miriam was of her husband whether it was her standing a few feet away from the camera when he was on the show or wandering into his office when I was interviewing him and occasionally admonishing him “Say ‘off the record’ Sheldon!”)

There was a mutual respect but we were never friendly per se. Indeed I always believed he was behind a threatened lawsuit against The Indy when we considered publishing a negative story about the Review-Journal and I suspected (and I was hardly alone) that he might have been behind the abrupt cancellation of my television show by craven public television overlords. But in both cases I was Tessio talking to Tom Hagen; I knew it was only business.

Ironically Adelson became the best fundraiser The Indy could have hoped for as his purchase of the RJ induced many a donor to help contribute to an alternative news source. I was – and remain – disturbed by his purchase of the newspaper. He also owns one in Israel and it is known for having been a political billy club for Bibi Netanyahu.

Sure other billionaires own newspapers. But no billionaire so enmeshed in the political and economic fabric of the state and a small one at that. I thought it was dangerous and his initial effort to keep his ownership a secret and the newspaper’s subsequent kowtowing to him only confirmed my fears.

Don’t get me wrong; I don’t believe he constantly hectored editors and there were and are good reporters there impervious to such pressures.

But when you assemble an investigative team and its first project is to go after your bete noire (the convention authority) and Miriam is allowed front-page columns and mandatory-to-publish talking points are sent over on what to report about a trial involving the Sands and…well you get the picture.

So yes I acknowledge it bothers me deeply and I have pointed out when editors there either pre-emptively or after a call from a Sands minion bent to his will. All these last five years though Adelson never expressed any anger at what I was saying vis a vis the RJ mostly because I think he didn’t care that much.

I’m not sure where the RJ goes now that he is gone nor do I have much insight into the future of the empire he built — I’ll leave that to experts like Howard Stutz.

But love him or hate him Adelson’s passing is going to leave a huge vacuum in the worlds of politics and gaming. “A force of nature” as one associate called him and you always knew which way the wind was blowing with Adelson.

I often thought to myself during the last few years that rather than pressing forward into new markets or enmeshing himself in the political fray or getting into pointless scrapes that Adelson should just take his billions and go enjoy his remaining years. And you know what?

Maybe he did.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Nhc2lub3MtZ2FtaW5nL25ldmFkYS1jYXNpbm8tcmVzb3J0LXdvcmtlcnMtbWF5LWZhY2Utd2FpdC1iZWZvcmUtdmFjY2luYXRpb24tMjI1NjY0OS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY2FzaW5vcy1nYW1pbmcvbmV2YWRhLWNhc2luby1yZXNvcnQtd29ya2Vycy1tYXktZmFjZS13YWl0LWJlZm9yZS12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi0yMjU2NjQ5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nevada casino-resort workers may face wait before vaccination,"Nevada hospitality employees are in the fast lane to receive a COVID-19 vaccine but face a long line before it’s their turn.

Nevada hospitality employees are in the fast lane to receive a COVID-19 vaccine but face a long line before it’s their turn.

In the state’s latest COVID-19 playbook front-line casino and resort workers are in the fourth category of workers eligible for the vaccine through Nevada’s “frontline/essential workforce lane.” Workers in education and agriculture and certain state and local government employees are just a few of the groups ahead of them in line.

Leisure and hospitality employees make up a quarter of the state’s total private workforce. Thousands of these workers have been put face to face with visitors since June when casinos reopened. Gov. Steve Sisolak recently extended into February a 25 percent capacity limit on casinos which the state has previously identified as a source of spread.

“I think (getting hospitality workers vaccinated) is the first step to turning it all around” said one Strip dealer who was granted anonymity to protect her job at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

Vaccinating ‘critical’ workers

The latest vaccination guidelines from the state were announced Monday. Brian Labus an assistant professor of epidemiology at UNLV and a member of the medical team advising Sisolak said the updated playbook largely follows federal recommendations.

“There are local decisions we can make but the basic groups are decided at the federal level and rolled out similarly state to state” he said. But “we want to protect (hospitality workers) because they’re putting themselves in situations where they’re potentially at risk by being around tourists from all around the world.”

As of November there were roughly 301700 leisure and hospitality workers in the state according to data from the Department of Employment Training and Rehabilitation.

Labus said it’s not yet clear when hospitality workers will be eligible for the vaccine. He expects that priority groups will continue to shift as federal guidance is updated.

Virginia Valentine president of the Nevada Resort Association said Monday that Sisolak’s decision to expedite front-line hospitality workers is “welcome and encouraging news.”

“While Nevada’s resorts continue to take responsible actions to protect employees and guests … swift vaccine access will provide another layer of protection for resort employees their families and the public” she said in a statement. “Further protecting the frontline members of Nevada’s economic engine sends a clear message to visitors and meeting and convention organizers that Nevada is the world’s safest travel and tourism destination.”

Culinary Local 226 which represents about 60000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno has been working with Sisolak’s office and the resort association to ensure that hospitality workers have access to the COVID-19 vaccine said Geoconda Argüello-Kline the union’s secretary-treasurer.

“The hospitality industry is critical for the well-being of the entire state of Nevada and the Culinary union is supportive of the governor’s designation of hospitality workers as essential” she said in a statement.

MGM also provided a statement saying the company will make “the necessary resources available to achieve this critical objective” of immunizing workers.

Spokespeople for Las Vegas Sands Corp. Caesars Entertainment Inc. and Boyd Gaming Corp. did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Wynn Resorts Ltd. declined to comment and a spokesman for Red Rock Resorts Inc. referred to the resort association’s statement.

Waiting their turn

The state’s new vaccine rollout plan divides eligible populations into two concurrent lanes: one based on occupation the other based on age underlying health conditions and housing status.

Labus said some hospitality workers will have early access to the vaccine if they fall in a higher age bracket or have underlying health conditions.

“What you’re left with … are people who are younger and healthier to begin with” he said. “We’re not talking about leaving everyone in hospitality until the end. … There may be a large portion already vaccinated by the time we open it to the group of workers.”

Gladis Blanco a guest room attendant of eight years at Bellagio and a Culinary member said hospitality workers are on the front lines of the pandemic interacting with customers from across the world. She thanked Sisolak for “acknowledging that hospitality workers are essential” and said she would feel “peace of mind” that a vaccine could keep her and her family safe.

“I will be first in line for the vaccination when it is my turn” Blanco said through a Culinary spokeswoman statement.

Caesars Palace dealer Tony Pontecorvo said he doesn’t mind hospitality workers’ place in the state’s playbook.

“It’s easy to say we should be higher up but then you have to decide who to move down” he said. “It’s hard to say who I should jump in front of.”

A cook at an MGM property who is being granted anonymity to protect her job said she is comfortable waiting to receive the vaccine.

She acknowledged that vaccination could protect her and others from the coronavirus but she said she is concerned that current vaccine iterations wouldn’t prevent a newly identified more contagious strain. The cook said she already has been exposed to COVID-19; her mom contracted it and suffered “pretty bad” symptoms.

Last month President-elect Joe Biden’s surgeon general nominee Vivek Murthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that there’s “no reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed will not be effective against this virus as well.”

The cook said she was hoping for an “alternative to come into place” with higher efficacy by the time she was eligible though she would take the shot if her employer made vaccination a condition of her job.

“I don’t want to be exposed to something that’s stronger than what I witnessed my mom going through” she said. “It would just depend on the circumstance.”

The Southern Nevada Health District notes that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are after both doses more than 90 percent effective at protecting people from getting sick with COVID-19.

They are the only vaccines currently approved for COVID-19 and they were developed with the same level of U.S. Food and Drug Administration review as vaccines for polio smallpox meningitis and more according to the health district.

The Cosmopolitan dealer said she was ecstatic to learn that casino workers would be included in the prioritization lane.

“It’s going to be exciting to see what’s around the corner (once the vaccine is widely distributed)” she said. “I feel like the whole world is going to come to Vegas.”

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Xcel Energy is hoping a proposed upgrade to its wind towers near Grand Meadow will move the wind farm further into the future.

The company held a virtual open house Thursday night about the project that would extend the life of the farm to 2048 and produce at least 10 percent more energy.

“As a national leader in wind energy for more than a decade repowered wind projects like Grand Meadow will help us reduce carbon emissions keep bills affordable for our customers and help create good jobs that will help the economy recover” Xcel said in a statement to the Herald.

Xcel recently received the go-ahead from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to begin developing the repower project along with three other farms in the upper Midwest.

The towers in question near Grand Meadow include 67 towers on 10000 acres in Grand Meadow Clayton and Dexter townships.

“We’re thrilled” said County Administrator Trish Harren. “When you can create a more efficient (operation) with the same footprint with the least amount of disturbance of the environment or the neighborhood while increasing productivity — we really appreciate that.”

The wind farms have been a boon to Mower County. Thanks to the money generated from wind farms the county has been able to keep its levy down. This year alone the money was able to shave about 10 percent off the levy.

The company will now begin working with landowners in the area as well as local governments and state agencies. That work will include extending lease agreements and securing additional permits including a specific amendment to the project’s site permit that will approve the repowering effort.

On the county side the rest of the process will be fairly hands off.

“We work with the townships that are impacted” Harren said. “The key job is developing a development agreement over protection of the roads.”

The permits required will be on a state level.

“Typically the standards of the state are higher than the normal level” Harren said.

Xcel is hoping to receive permit approvals this year or 2022 with an aim of 2023 for construction.

The company has set its own goal of an 80 percent reduction of carbon emissions by 2030 with a hope of going carbon-free by 2050.

The wind farm was originally built in 2008 with an expected lifespan of 25 years. The turbines will have their blades replaced with longer blades and more efficient turbine operating systems that will boost the targeted efficiency and energy production goals.

The blades themselves will allow for the more efficient capture of winds at current operating speeds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMTcvd2lsZC1jYXJlZnVsbHktbmF2aWdhdGUtbGlmZS1vbi10aGUtcm9hZC1kdXJpbmctYS1wYW5kZW1pYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unbeaten Wild carefully navigating life on the road during a pandemic,"To place an obituary please include the information from the obituary checklist below in an email to obits@pioneerpress.com.

YUM,Yum! Brands,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzE2L2JldHRlci1idXktbWNkb25hbGRzLXZzLXl1bS1icmFuZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: McDonald's vs. Yum! Brands,"Only one of these fast food giants has mastered the art and science of the business.

With nothing more than a passing glance it would be easy to assume one is more or less the same as the other. McDonald's (MCD -0.38%) is the bigger chain but Yum! Brands (YUM 1.37%) -- the name behind KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell -- is certainly no slouch. Besides fast food is just fast food right?

Investors looking to make a bet on a restaurant before a full-blown recovery from the COVID-19 slump however would be far better served by McDonald's.

Every little detail

That's not a slight on Yum! Brands for the record. Taco Bell and its Yum! brethren have carved out a respectable piece of the world's $600 billion fast food market. All told the company operates more than 50000 locations in more than 150 countries. Technically speaking it's got more total restaurants under its umbrella than rival McDonald's -- they're just divvied up among three different banners.

McDonald's has something Yum! doesn't have though and isn't likely to have anytime soon. That's one of the world's best-known brand names. McDonald's is consistently found among the world's ten most recognized companies regardless of who's performing the poll.

That's not a coincidence either. In a relatively normal (read ""pre-COVID"") 2019 McDonald's spent almost $450 million on advertising and related expenses a figure that doesn't include franchisees' localized spending.

While the company is spending big it's also spending smart. Indeed the fact that the logo hasn't changed in decades is by design as everything else about the organization's look has adapted to its iconic memorable golden arches and their unique red and gold colors. Even the lettering font you'll see in its visual promotional material is the stuff of vigorous debate ultimately steered by a chief marketing officer.

McDonald's isn't just one of the few names to revise the role of chief marketing officer however. In an effort to ensure it's connecting with customers in the way customers most want the restaurant chain even employs a chief digital customer engagement officer. Lucy Brady was named to that role a year ago before the pandemic took hold. With someone in the driver's seat catering to how consumers spend their money in the age of COVID McDonald's estimates that 20% of 2020 revenue produced within its top six markets was digitally driven. That's a lot. For perspective less than 6% of Wendy's third-quarter company-wide revenue came from connected customers.

Marketing brilliance

It's admittedly difficult to attribute McDonald's sustained growth -- excluding the coronavirus shutdown slump -- to how seriously it takes its public presence. Rather the evidence of the chain's mastery of marketing lies in the sheer number of success stories it always seems able to point to.

The company's partnership with rap star Travis Scott is one example of this promotional brilliance. Although not quite the perfectly family-friendly affiliation one might normally expect from the fast food chain the company's executives' intuition was on target. Driven by the rapper's connection to a particular combo meal September's sales grew year over year at a double-digit pace. In fact it was one of the best single months McDonald's had mustered in years.

The restaurant chain is hardly reliant on expensive spokespeople though. It's also savvy when it comes to the creation of new attention-getting products at the right time.

Case(s) in point: In October it launched an apple fritter a blueberry muffin and a cinnamon roll largely in an effort to nab market share in a competitive quick breakfast market that exploded during the pandemic. Wendy's entry into this race earlier this year likely played a part in the decision as well. The items available all day are ideal additions to the menu because they're quick and easy to make.

The company also introduced a new crispy chicken sandwich just a few days ago quickly capitalizing on what's turned into a brutal chicken sandwich war that's involved KFC Popeye's Shake Shack Wendy's and Chick-Fil-A.

McDonald's already had a couple of chicken choices on the menu mind you. It just felt it needed more entrants in the race to plug into changes that were already under way. Telsey Advisory Group explained over a year ago that 2019's chicken sandwich market would grow to the tune of 14% that year jibing with numbers from NPD Group suggesting U.S. chicken sandwich orders grew 4% early that year while orders of burgers were flat.

To this end in an interview with Time magazine published in August of last year CEO Chris Kempczinski explained: ""We're certainly working on ways that we can update and upgrade our chicken offering in the U.S. Suffice to say we will continue to be competing and innovating in chicken"" adding ""I don't want to get too into revealing competitive secrets but I think we are feeling good about where we're at."" It sounds more like something a tech CEO would say illustrating exactly why McDonald's is the dominant name in the business.

Connect the dots. Clearly McDonald's takes the science (and math and business) of fast food very seriously.

Bottom line

None of this is to suggest Yum! Brands doesn't do comparable market research or marketing tie-ins. It does. Its Taco Bell KFC and Pizza Hut chains are going to hold their own for the foreseeable future.

It's not a stretch to say however that McDonald's is the industry's ""best of breed."" Every move it makes is either data-informed well-conceived adequately funded or a combination of all three. That's a key reason earnings growth has been so steady for years and is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future.

The revenue dropoff that started in 2014? That's by design. The restaurant chain began selling most of its company-owned stores to franchisees around that time which crimps the top line but clearly translates into more profits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtaW1taS1oZWFsdGh5LWluc3RhbnQtcmFtZW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This New Food Brand Is Making a Healthy Instant Ramen,"Ramen is one of those comfort foods that we love to turn to when we're short on time but want a light warm dinner in a hurry. However the sodium content in instant ramen is definitely cringe-worthy. Those instant noodles can have up to 1750mg of sodium in one pack which is nearly the entirety of the daily recommended sodium intake. It's for that reason that so many of us have decided to leave the instant ramen packets on the shelves at the grocery store and opt for something healthier.

Until now.

Immi is a brand-new startup that's shaking up the soup game with a healthy instant ramen. The high-protein low-carb instant ramen comes in three flavor varieties but if you can't decide you can also get a sampler pack. Your options are Tom Yum ""Shrimp"" Black Garlic ""Chicken"" and Spicy ""Beef"" and yes they're plant-based as well.

Each pack of Immi instant ramen has a total of 9g net carbs 31g protein and 850mg sodium. Compared to your standard packs of instant ramen these come in at a much healthier level.

Immi founders Kevin Lee and Kevin Chanthasiriphan grew up in Taiwan and Thailand and wrote on the company's website that they wanted to create a healthier version of ramen because they not only love ramen but wanted to give their families a healthy alternative to a staple comfort food. The healthy instant ramen is primarily made with pumpkin seed protein as well as a variety of other plant-based ingredients. Even better: This ramen is keto-friendly.

Right now these instant ramen packs are only available to shop online but perhaps as more people catch on to the possibility of enjoying lower-sodium ramen the packs may end up in your favorite grocery store. Six-packs of the instant ramen start at $39.05 on Immi's website and they even offer a subscribe-and-save option so you never run out.

Pizza Hut which has fallen in popularity since its heyday in the 80s and 90s has been buoyed by recent investor appetite for the burgeoning fast-food space. The chain's Australian operations were sold by US-based Yum! Brands in 2016 to Allegro which made major changes to the business including stripping down the menu and setting up much-needed tech systems to allow the brand to compete in the UberEats-driven delivery market.

Here's what you can learn from it.

If you've been wondering why so many companies have gone public in the past year via so-called ""blank check"" or special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) look no further than former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya.

The founder of venture capital firm Social Capital Palihapitiya sought to fix what he felt was broken with the traditional banker-led initial public offering system by taking power away from financiers and giving it to company founders. In so doing he turned SPACs into the IPO 2.0 for today's generation. Palihapitiya prefers technology and other ""big ideas"" companies. Through his Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings SPACs he's taken Virgin Galactic Opendoor Technologies and Clover Health public and more recently announced fintech SoFi would be the next company he'd take public through his preferred vehicle.

There's definitely more than one way to look at this approach. But you can see the wisdom of empowering executives with an owner mindset in a company that Palihapitiya will probably never take public as much as I wish he or someone else would: Chick-fil-A.

Ruffling the industry's feathers

Even if you haven't eaten at a Chick-fil-A restaurant you've undoubtedly heard the superlatives about its chicken sandwich from its base of loyal customers along with the unusual politeness of its employees.

The company instills certain basic tenets into how it operates many of which spring from the family owned restaurant's Christian beliefs. It's why you also won't find a Chick-fil-A open on a Sunday to the dismay of its many fans. Yet by having a fairly limited menu -- basically chicken fries and drinks (and the waffle fries are its most-ordered menu item) -- the restaurant can focus on doing what it knows and doing it well.

That's helped Chick-fil-A leapfrog over the competition like Yum! Brands' Taco Bell and Subway to become the third-largest restaurant chain in the country by sales even though it has fewer locations than many of its competitors. Its success helped launch the chicken sandwich wars that have taken over the fast food industry.

The popularity of Chick-fil-A's sandwich along with changing consumer preferences making chicken a healthy go-to protein encouraged Restaurant Brands International's Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen to introduce its own fried chicken sandwich which became an instant hit and something of a cultural phenomenon.

Others chains came out with their own versions though none has caught on like Chick-fil-A or Popeyes but McDonald's is the latest entrant into the field to try and ride the coattails of the chicken sandwich trend. It will be introducing three variants next month.

Ruling the roost

Chick-fil-A's sales have tripled over the past decade and data from Technomic estimates revenue hit $11.3 billion in 2019 up 13% from the year before. With some 2470 restaurants in operation that works out to average revenue per restaurant of almost $4.6 million.

In comparison McDonald's had $40 billion in annual sales that year from 13800 restaurants or an average revenue per restaurant of $2.9 million. Taco Bell had similar total sales as Chick-fil-A but with nearly three times the number of restaurants its revenue per restaurant average came in at $1.6 million.

In fact no other national fast food restaurant chain generates more revenue per restaurant than does Chick-fil-A.

Some analysts think it's entirely possible Chick-fil-A can grow its business to $30 billion annually which would rank it second on the list of top chains ahead of Starbucks and leaving only McDonald's with greater annual sales.

Rarer than hen's teeth

Unfortunately Palihapitiya likely won't be able to take Chick-fil-A public via a SPAC or through any other vehicle. The chain's founder S. Truett Cathy made his children sign a contract before he died in 2014 promising to keep Chick-fil-A a privately held company (he did say they could sell it).

That's a shame because investors don't have many good options for restaurant stocks in the current climate. The COVID-19 pandemic has limited eateries' ability to operate on a full-capacity basis and with few opportunities for outdoor dining during winter the malaise gripping the industry will continue to drag on performance far beyond the colder months as some may not survive the chill.

However restaurants with a built-in takeout business like Chick-fil-A has will offer better opportunity and returns and drilling down into their restaurant-level revenue and margins will provide valuable insight. Darden Restaurants (DRI -1.19%) has been a standout during the pandemic precisely because its Olive Garden chain had an established robust takeout business in place when the crisis struck. Cracker Barrel (CBRL -1.19%) also weathered the storm by leaning into its catering business modifying its Heat n' Serve Feasts that typically serve 10 people to instead feed a family of six. Off-premises sales have soared to account for 25% of total revenue up from 9% last year.

Unless Palihapitiya decides he wants to buy Chick-fil-A outright and then take it public investors will have to settle for simply enjoying its chicken sandwiches while dreaming about the next private business they'd like a chance to invest in."
