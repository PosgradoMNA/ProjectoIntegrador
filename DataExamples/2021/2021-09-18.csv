Haiti - UNICEF : Out of $733M emergency aid requested for Haiti less than 11% have been received





More than one month after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake jolted southwest Haiti an estimated 650000 people including 260000 children still need urgent humanitarian assistance UNICEF warned today.



""Children in Haiti are still struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of an earthquake that caused their homes schools health facilities and entire communities to crumble"" said Jean Gough UNICEF Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean.



""Health services remain largely disrupted in Southwestern Haiti. Many hospital buildings are either damaged or destroyed. Many families with children are fearful of seeking treatment at the few health facilities left standing. Limited access to safe water and basic health services is putting young lives at risk.""



Health systems are struggling to keep up with the needs with 12763 people injured https://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-34681-haiti-earthquake-latest-assessment-of-civil-protection.html and an estimated 82 health facilities in the most affected departments damaged or destroyed. Even a month on some rural communities remain unable to access functional health facilities due to infrastructure damage. Limited health care capacity presents elevated health risks —such as wound infection and risk of tetanus.



The lack of routine health care services has increased the risk of maternal and newborn deaths as many maternity and surgical wards do not meet the criteria for safe deliveries. The ability of health authorities to prevent identify and treat malnutrition has also been weakened by the earthquake.



In response to these increased needs UNICEF is working with partners to provide essential medicines medical supplies and equipment and nutritional commodities support the resumption of health care services for damaged or destroyed health centers and strengthen health supply chain management.



UNICEF has equipped 24 mobile clinic teams with essential medical equipment and medicines to provide integrated health and nutrition services – including the identification and treatment of acute malnutrition – in remote communes.



""If families with children cannot access health facilities after the earthquake it’s critical to bring lifesaving health services to them so we can prevent child deaths” said Gough. ""UNICEF is setting up more mobile clinics on the ground to keep children healthy. With thousands of families and children in urgent need of medical attention we cannot wait for the health facilities to be rebuilt.""



Other key health results to date include the following :

50000 people reached with essential medical supplies for a period of three months in 19 main hospitals involved in victims’ emergency care.

300000 people received Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for a period of three months.



In infant and maternal health UNICEF is prioritizing the continuation of primary health care for children and women in close coordination with the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO). Over the next six months UNICEF will support the provision of essential health and nutrition services targeting over 251000 children and women including the delivery of essential supplies to treat common childhood illnesses.



Other health interventions that will be scaled up include the expansion of routine immunization coverage for 35000 children the identification and treatment of acutely malnourished children programmes in support of infant and young child feeding and nutrition supplementation to prevent malnutrition and the provision of maternal newborn and childcare.



UNICEF will also support the reconstruction and reparation of 30 damaged hospitals and primary care centres as well as the training of 3000 healthcare facility staff and community health workers in infection prevention and control (IPC) including the continuation of COVID-19 prevention and the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE).



UNICEF is requesting US$73.3 million to respond to the humanitarian needs due to the earthquake focusing on providing urgent support in health education WASH nutrition and child protection including gender-based violence (GBV) over the next six months. To date less than 11 per cent has been received.

Operatives at the Kubwa Police Division in Abuja have demanded N180000 to help a female victim recover N1.3 million stolen from her account by a suspected internet fraudster.

THE WHISTLER had earlier reported Angel’s ordeal at the hands of one Frank a suspected fraudster who illegally withdrew N1.3 million from the victim’s bank account using a SIM card linked to the account.

They had met physically at Soul Lounge nightclub in Kubwa after exchanging contacts through a ‘hookup’ mobile application in August.

It was meant to be a one-night encounter but the duo ended up keeping each other’s company for eight days at the BChezz Hotel in Kubwa Abuja.

She narrated how Frank used a mobile point of sale (POS) operator near the hotel to wipe her entire savings from her account. READ HERE.

The victim planned on using the money to rent a shop and start hair and wig business.

Angel told THE WHISTLER that she approached the police division to help track down Frank and recover her money.

The victim who looked dejected when our correspondent met her at the Kubwa police division said the police had arrested the POS operator Michael but later released him.

“This guy (the POS operator) told me he had no idea about what Frank did saying that Frank told him that we were planning on getting married can you imagine?” said the victim.

According to Angel investigations showed that the POS operator was still communicating with Frank after the incident.

She said Michael was released by the police on bail on September 6 three days after he was arrested.

“My IPO (investigating police officer) said they released him to go print out his bank statement.

“But how can the police release Michael on bail without telling me? The only available suspect? Because my IPO is Igala and him too? they are doing a tribal thing. I don’t understand how the police are handling this case” Angel said.

Meanwhile a senior officer at the division told our correspondent that the POS operator was released because he was not culpable of any offence as he was only doing his business.

“There is no need to keep him when he was only doing his business. So all she can do is to allow the police to do their work by tracking him (Frank)” the officer said.

In a phone interview on August 10 Angel told THE WHISTLER that the IPO demanded N180000 to track Frank and had demanded upfront payment of N60000 while N120000 would be paid upon arrest of the suspect.

Besides that the victim said the IPO also pressured her to allow him visit her at home.

Asked if she would pay the N180000 demanded by the police she said: “There is nothing to talk about; they already let the immediate suspect go. I honestly can’t trust them.

“Somebody that is a suspect you released him to go before I came and you are telling me to come back. So what if at the end of the day they help me to find this guy will they still release him behind my back if he gives them money?

“The boy (Frank) has told me already that police cannot catch him and he is right”.

Subsequently the police told the victim that a Navy personnel was willing to help track Frank’s geolocation for N8500.

This came after they reduced the original amount to N50000 but noted that she might only recover N500000 if they helped to arrest the suspect.

“…maybe they are thinking I still have money and they want to help me to spend it when I don’t have any other money” she said adding that she had only given the police N8000 so far.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldHN1cnJleS5jby51ay9uZXdzL3Byb3BlcnR5LW5ld3MvZ2FsbGVyeS9odWdlLXN1cnJleS12aWN0b3JpYW4tcHJvcGVydHktcHJpdmF0ZS0yMTU5NTUxMtIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldHN1cnJleS5jby51ay9uZXdzL3Byb3BlcnR5LW5ld3MvZ2FsbGVyeS9odWdlLXN1cnJleS12aWN0b3JpYW4tcHJvcGVydHktcHJpdmF0ZS0yMTU5NTUxMi5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Huge Surrey Victorian property with private access to Guildford Castle grounds for sale at £3m,"The building formerly provided sheltered housing for the elderly

An enormous Victorian property with private access to the grounds of Guildford Castle has gone on the market for a cool £3m.

Up until the end of August Castle Gate was providing sheltered housing for the elderly but now the 5000 sq ft of accommodation is being sold to buyers who could convert it into a family home.

The property with an asking price of £2999950 sits in Castle Hill just a stone's throw from the castle and to the rear in its secluded garden is direct and private access to the castle grounds.

Beto O’Rourke challenging incumbent Republican Greg Abbott for governor.

The expectation that O’Rourke will run against Abbott is a turnabout from earlier this year when it seemed unlikely that the El Paso Democrat would embark on a third major campaign in four years. O’Rourke has been seeking input from Democrats and others about challenging Abbott said David Wysong an adviser to the former congressman.

Recent polls show Abbott with new vulnerabilities. The governor has been criticized for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic blamed in part for the February winter storm that crippled Texas with power outages and attacked by Democrats and some independents for promoting a controversial elections bill and a law that practically outlaws abortions in Texas. Republican voters in reliably red Texas however support Abbott’s policies.

A new poll by The Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas at Tyler reveals that 54% of Texas voters feel the state is headed in the wrong direction including 64 percent of folks who identify as independents. Abbott’s approval rating which before this year was always sterling is down to 45 percent.

O’Rourke’s numbers are nothing to brag about either. His approval rating is at 42%. The polls shows he trails Abbott in a hypothetical matchup for governor by a 42%-37% margin.

But Abbott’s five-point lead over O’Rourke is the closest a Democratic candidate for governor has been since Ann Richards won in 1990. And the governor’s reelection campaign is preparing as if O’Rourke is ready to rumble.

“With Beto O’Rourke preparing his run for Governor ALL EYES are going to be on Texas” Abbott’s campaign team wrote in a fundraiser email that warned GOP donors that O’Rourke is a fundraising juggernaut.

But O’Rourke is moved by more than poll numbers.

During his unsuccessful but close 2018 race against incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz as well as his brief 2020 bid for president O’Rourke told crowds that it was critical to do everything possible to resist the policies of then President Donald Trump.

He said Texans had the chance to lead the nation by developing sensible immigration and economic policies. He talked about Democrats and Republicans coming together for the good of Texas and the nation which would require setting aside petty politics and incorporation everyone in our democracy.

More poignantly O’Rourke wondered aloud what he would tell his children and grandchildren when they asked him what he did to help heal the nation during the era of Trump?

Those speeches are relevant today because O’Rourke and others believe Texas is at a tipping point.

Perhaps more than being a senator or even a president the job of governor provides more of an opportunity to impact the lives of Texans and shape how the state is perceived.

If O’Rourke really believes Abbott is driving the state into a ditch he has to challenge Abbott win or lose.

Advertisement

That’s good news for his fans because O’Rourke is the only known Texas Democrat who can raise the money craft the message and use the organization and oratory skills needed to threaten Abbott.

O’Rourke will have to come up with a second statewide act if he runs for governor. Challenging Abbott is far different than his tussle with Cruz the race that made him a household name in Texas.

But his fundraising ability alone makes him a threat and will take some pressure off down-ballot Democrats.

It’s Beto or bust for Texas Democrats.

By now O’Rourke haters have fired off emails or tweeted at me about how the former congressman doesn’t have a chance and that the media is preparing to hype him up.

It is true that O’Rourke has an uphill battle and will likely lose a statewide matchup against Abbott or somebody like Academy Award-winning actor Matthew McConaughey who hasn’t ruled out running for governor. The actor could run as a Republican.

Texas is a red state.

After the 2020 elections Republicans maintained firm control of the state by holding their majorities in the Texas House and Senate as well as the Lone Star delegation to Congress. That occurred after proclamations including in this column that Texas is a battleground state.

Additionally O’Rourke doesn’t have the same appeal to many residents that he had in his race against Cruz.

His crossover appeal and $80 million campaign fund propelled him to within 2.6 percentage points of beating Cruz. In the process he pushed Democrats to wins in numerous in-district races. They won 12 Texas House seats mostly in North Texas. And Colin Allred of Dallas and Lizzie Fletcher of Houston won congressional races that helped Democrats retake the U.S. House and reinstall Nancy Pelosi as Speaker.

But O’Rourke’s rising stardom peaked after his battle with Cruz. In 2020 he ran for president but had to suspend his campaign well before the Iowa caucuses. His presidential bid revealed progressive stances that could hurt him with some voters in Texas including his pledge to confiscate assault-style weapons like the AR-15 rifle if given the chance.

Most Republicans and likely some independents could find his immigration proposals and stands on social issues too liberal for Texas.

Then there’s President Joe Biden. The News’ poll shows his approval rating in Texas mired at 40% and only 29% approve of his management of the southern border with Mexico.

Running against Abbott also creates a personal political risk for O’Rourke. If he calls out Abbott and loses that would be three high-profile defeats in four years. Such a record could impact his ability to run for statewide offices in future years including 2024 when Cruz is up for reelection. Cruz may run for president in 2024 leaving the Senate seat open.

If O’Rourke has any thoughts about losing he has to put them aside.

The moment requires that he enters the political arena as a candidate for governor.

What happens after that is up to Texas voters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzE4L2V2YW5nZWxpY2FsLXRoZW9sb2d5LWlzLXdoYXQtbWFkZS10aGUtdGV4YXMtYWJvcnRpb24tb3V0cmFnZS1wb3NzaWJsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Evangelical theology is what made the Texas abortion outrage possible,"During my undergrad years at U Mass Dartmouth I had the great privilege of being mentored by Dr Juli Parker who was director of the Women's center now called the Center for Women Gender and Sexuality. It was there more than 20 years ago that I was shown a small piece of what so many women face in this country. As the only football player volunteer at the center I observed two very different worlds. The football locker room with men saying some pretty awful things and Dr Parker explaining the truth around sexual assault abortion rights and the regular fight for equality that women face every day.

I felt a strong calling to ministry and I attended seminary which oddly enough was an environment that sounded a little like the football locker room. I was hoping to change minds within the evangelical church. I failed and 20 years later the evangelical church is stronger and more committed to prohibiting women the most basic right to decide what happens to their own bodies.

Evangelicals won a great and terrible victory with the recent Texas abortion law but the plan was started more than 50 years ago. Millions if not billions of dollars have spent and hundreds if not thousands of Republican politicians have come along as supporters and the goal has been achieved: Tearing down Roe v. Wade. The plan was basic enough: Pack the Supreme court with enough judges who would be willing to ignore the rights of women. To do this the evangelical church needed to support any politician who was willing to condemn abortion as murder and willing to promise they would appoint anti-abortion judges.

And when I say evangelicals were willing to support anyone who said those things I mean anyone. That means Clarence Thomas a man credibly accused of sexual harassment. It means Brett Kavanaugh a man credibly accused of attempted rape as well as of being too unstable for a post on the Supreme Court. It means supporting Donald Trump a pig who has been accused of sexual assault by numerous women. Nothing could stop evangelical support for Republican politicians as long as they were willing to attack Roe v. Wade.

Defending things like the rights of the poor welcoming the foreigner healing the sick and promoting peace were all ignored for this one purpose. Now the evangelicals have won what I hope is a temporary victory but a terrible victory nonetheless. In the words of Christ ""You blind guides straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!"" These modern-day hypocrites have won a victory for themselves while ignoring everything it means to be a follower of Christ. I am disgusted. If Christ did return it would be these evangelicals who would hang him on the cross again. They are the evil that Christ warned his followers about long ago.

Their unhealthy teachings have hurt this country's progress towards equality and manipulated generations of Christians. Their influence has been harmful all along but this is different. The law has changed and I can promise you that in church after church congregations are gathering to celebrate this ""victory"" on abortion rights in Texas. And Texas is just the beginning. More states will follow this blueprint and the Supreme Court appears willing to turn a blind eye to the rights of women.

Evangelicals are celebrating with no concern for the lives this law will affect or the message it communicates. This isn't just Trump saying another stupid thing or an offensive proposal or another display of ignorance on display. This is an enacted law denying the rights of women to control their own bodies — and it was dreamed up and strategized by the evangelical church. Without evangelical theology this entire thing would be a non-issue.

Evangelical churches certainly aren't fighting to make their believers take the COVID vaccine. Pastors are adamant that this is a free country and we can all determine what happens to our own bodies. Unless of course you are a woman in which case the church stops talking about fundamental American rights.

Whether I watch Fox News or CNN everyone agrees that the Taliban's severe crackdown on the rights of women in Afghanistan is a terrible thing. The U.S. promotes itself as a democracy not a theocracy like the Taliban regime. I understand that evangelicals will see this comparison as unfair but it is still a matter of people of faith using that faith to limit the rights of a group of people using the strong arm of government.

I have no words of affirmation as I would normally when discussing other political and religious issues. These evangelicals have simply gone too far. I feel compelled to encourage those outside the evangelical church to stay away from it. If you are caught up in that mess get out. Leaders of the evangelical church are blind guides leading you into the devil's trap. I thank God for a guide like Dr. Parker and her years of commitment to the fights that need to fought. I try to honor the time she spent with me by doing what I can to change some minds and through them perhaps some. Politics is not my expertise but my advice to President Biden is simple: Pack the court! Never mind precedent and tradition or how it looks to your enemies. Just do the work to protect your nation's citizens.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcG9saWN5LWFuZC1wb2xpdGljcy8yMjY3OTQ0NC90ZXhhcy1oYWl0aWFuLW1pZ3JhbnRzLWRlbC1yaW8tYm9yZGVyLWFiYm90dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Texas GOP sees Haitian migrants in crisis as a political opportunity,"Amid an influx of Haitian migrants Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is trying to stir up fear about a crisis at the border yet again.

On Thursday he said that he had ordered state troopers and the Texas National Guard to “shut down six points of entry along the southern border” at the direction of federal immigration authorities as thousands of Haitian migrants await their turn to enter the US under an international bridge in the city of Del Rio in southwest Texas.

But Abbott backtracked just hours later claiming that the Biden administration had “flip-flopped” on its request for state assistance. The Department of Homeland Security has said that it isn’t asking Texas for help in shutting down ports of entry and that it would be a “violation of federal law for the Texas National Guard to unilaterally do so.”

The situation in Del Rio — where more than 12000 migrants are camping in increasingly squalid conditions without adequate access to water food and sanitation — is growing dire from a humanitarian perspective. Most of these migrants are from Haiti and plan to seek asylum in the US as is their right under federal and international law.

In just the last few months Haiti has suffered from a political crisis stemming from President Jovenel Moïse’s July assassination resultant gang violence and the one-two punch of a 7.2-magnitude earthquake and a tropical storm that left about 2200 dead and many thousands more injured or missing. Those conditions appear to have driven more Haitians to make the treacherous journey to the US border: Federal immigration authorities have encountered more than 30000 Haitians this fiscal year nearly six times the number encountered over the previous fiscal year.

But Abbott has sought to twist that humanitarian crisis into a security crisis designed to appeal to Republican voters in his state who have long identified immigration and border security as top priorities in public opinion polling. He told the Texas Tribune that he was trying to “stop these [migrant] caravans from overrunning our state” and described US Customs and Border Protection agents as “overwhelmed by the chaos.” That’s in line with his recent rhetoric trying to demonize migrants arriving on the southern border as lawbreakers and carriers of disease.

Other Texas Republicans have followed suit including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick who warned during a Fox News segment on Friday of an “invasion” of migrants who could “take over our country without firing a shot.”

It’s a political ploy to hit President Joe Biden on a perceived weak spot and pursue the kind of restrictive immigration policies that former President Donald Trump popularized and made a priority. But despite Texas Republicans’ efforts to portray Biden as an “open borders” Democrat the attack isn’t rooted in truth: The president has maintained Trump-era policies designed to keep migrants out regardless of whether they might have legitimate asylum claims.

If there is any crisis at the border it is a humanitarian one begun under the Trump administration and exacerbated by Biden.

The conditions at the migrant camp in Del Rio briefly explained

The conditions at the migrant camp in Del Rio are deteriorating quickly and the city’s mayor Bruno Lozano declared a local disaster as a means of procuring state and federal assistance.

Many of the migrants had to survive a dangerous journey just to get to the border traveling to Costa Rica before crossing a stretch of dense dangerous rainforest between Colombia and Panama known as the Darien Gap and evading Mexican immigration authorities.

They are waiting for a chance to be processed by US immigration officials who are stretched thin as they also have to process tens of thousands Afghan refugees waiting to come to the US. It could take up to two weeks for the migrants to get to the front of the line.

Migrants have been forced to remain under the shade of the bridge so as to mitigate the risk of heatstroke in temperatures reaching over 100 degrees on Friday. There are only 20 portable toilets to accommodate a growing population in the camp which is expected to increase by an additional 8000 in the coming days. They sleep on the dirt at night and are going back and forth across the Rio Grande to buy their own food in Mexico.

It’s reminiscent of other migrant camps on the Mexican side of the border in Matamoros and Reynosa but perhaps even more makeshift.

Abbott is continuing to engage in fearmongering about the border

This is not the first time Abbott has sought to falsely portray a group of migrants at the border as a public safety threat in order to rile up anti-immigrant attitudes among his base.

Just in the last few months he issued an executive order allowing public safety officers to stop and reroute vehicles suspected of transporting migrants with Covid-19 though the measure has been blocked in federal court for now.

He has told Texas child care regulators to revoke the licenses of facilities that house migrant children and state troopers to jail migrants for state crimes such as trespassing on private property when they cross the border.

And he is trying to finish the wall along the Texas border pledging a $250 million “down payment” drawn from state disaster relief funds — money that could have gone to the aid of those still recovering from last winter’s storms or struggling under the burden of the pandemic. And he’s crowdfunded almost another $500000 as of June 23. (Though that’s still a drop in the bucket of what he might need to finish the project which the federal government estimated could cost as much as $46 million per mile in some sectors of the border.)

He has also played no small part in creating the false perception that migrants crossing the border are the source of his state’s coronavirus surge which is spreading largely among the unvaccinated and leaving hospitals without enough ICU beds.

They’re “allowing free pass into the United States [for] people with a high probability of Covid and then spreading that Covid in our communities” he said in an interview earlier this year on Fox News.

There are some indications this sort of rhetoric is taking root. At a national level a recent Axios poll found that nearly 37 percent of unvaccinated Americans blame “foreign travelers in the US” for the rise in Covid-19 cases.

Available data hasn’t shown migrants on the border to be any more likely than US citizens to test positive for Covid-19. In March the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency told Congress that less than 6 percent of migrants at the border had tested positive for Covid-19 a lower percentage than the Texas positivity rate at that time.

But despite the fact that Abbott’s statements are untrue he faces no adverse political consequences for continuing to vilify immigrants. What his antics have done however is obscure the role the Biden administration has played in creating the current problems at the US/Mexico border.

Biden isn’t responsible for the kind of public safety and health crisis associated with an out-of-control border that Abbott has sought to manufacture. But by continuing to pursue policies designed to keep the vast majority of people arriving on the southern border out Biden is creating a humanitarian crisis.

Biden has already effectively closed the border to most migrants

Despite promises to institute a more humane immigration policy the Biden administration has clung to pandemic-related border restrictions known as the Title 42 policy implemented by the Trump administration last year. Since March 2020 that policy has been used to rapidly expel more than a million migrants without hearings before an immigration judge. (A federal judge partially blocked the policy effective September 30 and the Biden administration has appealed that decision.)

Biden is also restarting Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy under which tens of thousands of migrants were forced to wait in Mexico for their court hearings in the US and he has resumed rapidly deporting families at the US-Mexico border. All the while his message to migrants has been “don’t come” even though many of them are fleeing unlivable conditions not unlike those Afghan refugees are running from — problems ranging from gang violence to climate-related devastation.

Toward Haitians specifically Biden’s policies have appeared inconsistent. He has allowed more than 100000 Haitians already living in the US to apply for Temporary Protected Status. But at the same time he has continued to prevent Haitians waiting on the other side of the US-Mexico border from entering under Title 42 and to the shock of immigrant advocates resumed deportation flights to Haiti on Wednesday despite the country’s continuing turmoil.

Mexico has recently started refusing to take Haitians expelled under Title 42. That’s why Haitians stranded in Del Rio are slowly being processed by US immigration authorities and allowed to enter the US where most will likely be released with instructions to appear for an immigration court hearing at a later date.

But if Biden had it his way they wouldn’t be allowed to cross at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzE5L3Njb29wLWJldG8tcGxhbnMtdGV4YXMtY29tZWJhY2stZ292ZXJub3JzLXJhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beto O'Rourke plans Texas comeback in governor's race,"Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke speaks during the Georgetown to Austin March for Democracy rally on July 31 2021 in Austin Texas. Photo: Brandon Bell/Getty Images

Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke is preparing to run for governor of Texas in 2022 with an announcement expected later this year Texas political operatives tell Axios. Why it matters: O'Rourke's entry would give Democrats a high-profile candidate with a national fundraising network to challenge Republican Gov. Greg Abbott — and give O’Rourke a former three-term congressman from El Paso and 2020 presidential candidate and voting rights activist a path to a political comeback.

But he would be running in a complicated political environment. Immigration is surging at the southern border and Democrats at the national level are bracing for a brutal midterm election and potentially losing the House of Representatives in 2022.

A new poll for the Dallas Morning News shows that O'Rourke has narrowed the gap with Abbott in a hypothetical matchup down 37%-42%. In July O'Rourke faced a 12-point deficit 33%-45%.

Over the summer Abbot has seen his approval rating sink to 41% with 50% disapproving in a separate poll.

Driving the news: O’Rourke has been calling political allies to solicit their advice leaving them with the impression that he’s made his decision to run in the country’s second-largest state.

""No decision has been made"" said David Wysong O'Rourke's former House chief of staff and a longtime adviser. ""He has been making and receiving calls with people from all over the state.""

The big picture: In addition to deep cultural differences on how to respond to COVID-19 many of the contentious issues dividing the country seem to be bigger in Texas with raging debates on abortion rights and border security flaring across the state.

Abbott championed a law which the Supreme Court declined to strike down to criminalize abortions six weeks after conception enraging progressive activists and potentially suburban women.

He has also stoked cultural divides on COVID-19 and used executive action to try and prevent local jurisdictions from imposing mandates for masks or vaccines.

On the border Abbott has called for six points of entry in Texas to be closed and has blamed the Biden administration for the growing humanitarian crisis in Del Rio where thousands of migrants are seeking shelter underneath a bridge.

What they are saying: “We hope that he’s going to run” Gilberto Hinojosa the state chair of the Democratic Party told Axios. “We think he’ll be our strongest candidate. We think he can beat Abbott because he’s vulnerable.”

""His prohibition against mask and vaccination mandates have not gone over well with Texans"" Hinojosa said. ""And with the abortion law Republicans have raised the anger level of Texas women higher than anyone has ever seen before.”

By the numbers: While Democrats insisted that 2020 could be the year that Texas might turn blue and vote for its first Democrat for president since 1976 President Trump won that state with 52% the same as his 2016 margin."

Accenture has enlisted four new managing directors across its offices in Sydney and Melbourne with all four arriving from a Big Four and financial services background.

The freshly hired quartet – Galia Jenshel Figen Mizrak Mike Jones and Kylee Anastasi – all arrive from senior roles at Deloitte and PwC. Together they bring more than 65 years of management consulting experience to the firm covering in particular financial services and risk advisory.

Galia Jenshel

Joining Accenture in Melbourne as a managing director in July Jenshel has a consulting background dating back to 1998 when she joined EY on the completion of a psychology degree at the University of Western Australia. Since then she has spent time as a consultant at PwC IBM and NAB and most recently as a partner in Deloitte’s risk advisory division.

Figen Mizrak

Mizrak also joins the firm from Deloitte where she has served as director in the firm’s Financial Service Tech Strategy & Innovation wing for the past two and a half years. Previously she spent four years at PwC rising to senior manager before which she was a management consultant at German firm Consileon. Earlier in her career she spent close to a decade with Citi.

Mike Jones

Recruited to head up Accenture’s credit risk and collections service business Jones joins from Deloitte where he has been a partner since the firm’s purchase of Connected Analytics in 2018 a company he co-founded five years earlier. Previously Jones spent close to two decades with a number of banks and financial services organisations in the UK Asia and Australia including ANZ and HSBC.

Kylee Anastasi

Anastasi crosses after more than a decade with PwC in Washington and Sydney the latter office where she was made partner. Prior to PwC Anastasi served as a consultant with the World Bank before which she spent three years at Ernst & Young. A commerce graduate of the University of Melbourne she has also held roles at Goldman Sachs and as a senior analyst for the Victorian government.

“We are growing our financial services practice with distinctive smart energetic and courageous talent” said Accenture managing director Anthony James in a recent LinkedIn post with James joining from Strategy&’s partnership earlier this year. “Accenture boasts the world’s deepest technology and operations capability and it’s so exciting to see our contemporary consulting capability going so quickly from strength to strength.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NlbGVicmF0aW5nLWFpLWluZnVzZWQtdGFsZW50LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtYXQtdGhlLWVpZ2h0Zm9sZC1jb25mZXJlbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Celebrating AI-infused talent management at the Eightfold conference,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/business/celebrating-ai-infused-talent-management-at-the-eightfold-conference/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NlbGVicmF0aW5nLWFpLWluZnVzZWQtdGFsZW50LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtYXQtdGhlLWVpZ2h0Zm9sZC1jb25mZXJlbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZmFjZWJvb2stdHJvbGwtZmFybXMtcGVkZGxpbmctbWlzaW5mb3JtYXRpb24tcmVhY2hlZC1uZWFybHktaGFsZi1vZi1hbWVyaWNhbnMtMjAyMS050gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9mYWNlYm9vay10cm9sbC1mYXJtcy1wZWRkbGluZy1taXNpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1yZWFjaGVkLW5lYXJseS1oYWxmLW9mLWFtZXJpY2Fucy0yMDIxLTk_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Troll farm misinformation reached 140M Americans monthly report says,"Content moderators work at a Facebook office in Austin Texas.

Troll farms were building massive audiences and peddling propaganda ahead of the 2020 presidential election a report says.

Facebook's design and algorithms helped spread the troll farm content MIT Technology Review said.

The social media platform has struggled to squash disinformation campaigns since the 2016 presidential election.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Troll farms creating propaganda and misinformation on Facebook reached about 140 million Americans a month in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election according to an internal company report obtained by MIT Technology Review.

The report came out in 2019 as part of an almost two-year effort to understand troll farm activity on the platform and was recently given to MIT Technology by a former employee not involved in researching it.

The social media company failed to clamp down on misinformation and troll farm content after the 2016 election the report found.

The company ""pursued a whack-a-mole strategy that involved monitoring and quashing the activity of bad actors when they engaged in political discourse and adding some guardrails that prevented 'the worst of the worst' MIT Technology Review said.

By 2020 troll farms or groups that work together to create and disseminate false information online ""were still building massive audiences by running networks of Facebook pages"" the MIT report said.

15000 pages viewed by a US-majority audience were run out of Kosovo and Macedonia who engaged in disinformation campaigns during the 2016 election. Collectively the troll farm pages reached 140 million US users monthly and 360 million global users weekly in late 2019 as Americans prepared to vote in one of the most frought US presidential elections in history.

""This is not normal. This is not healthy"" wrote Jeff Allen a former senior-level data scientist at Facebook who authored the report. ""We have empowered inauthentic actors to accumulate huge followings for largely unknown purposes.""

The troll farm pages churned out content for the largest Christian American page on the site reaching 75 million US users a month the largest African-American page at 30 million users a month the second-largest Native American page at 400000 users a month and the fifth-largest women's page on the site at 60 million users a month.

A majority of the users who viewed this content had never followed these pages.

Facebook did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment about the report. Joe Osborne a Facebook spokesperson told MIT Technology Review the company has ""stood up teams developed new policies and collaborated with industry peers to address these networks. We've taken aggressive enforcement actions against these kinds of foreign and domestic inauthentic groups and have shared the results publicly on a quarterly basis.""

Since 2016 bad actors have successfully spread American election conspiracies and COVID-19 misinformation multiple times. Politicians and regulators have criticized Facebook and other platforms' inability to limit foreign interference. Researchers and technology rights advocates have provided their own resources to battle disinformation online but most companies have opted to use their in-house misinformation algorithms.

Facebook itself has tried to provide more transparency in their content moderation practices but their current approach – using algorithms to flag possible bad content and having human reviewers look at this content case-by-case – has been criticized as more of a band-aid solution than a permanent one.

Using records and figures from various sources we’ve put together a list of the single biggest employer in each state. To keep things more interesting and diverse we’ve kept the nebulous organizations of simply “state government” and “federal government” off the list because those are actually the biggest employers in nearly every state.

The short film celebrates Asian and Pacific Islander artists as part of Adobe’s Diverse Voices program and launched last week in partnership with Hypebeast a fashion and culture platform.

According to Adobe’s blog the film aims to “flip the script on the all-too-common question ‘where are you from?’ to lay claim to the myriad identities that inspire their creative work.”

Don Muña’s section of the short film features images including a map of Guam posters from their films and photos of him and Kel Muña on set as his voiceover narrates “Where the story of my people is the story of me as it unfolds and unfolds.”

For Don Muña that story is a profound and ongoing one. “I see a deep consciousness unfolding a realization of how important yet unheard we are as Guamanians and CHamorus” he said in an interview.

“The future we are writing is not just being written by creatives but by policymakers and community leaders to create a balance of authority and recognition of Guam in this global society.”

He described the experience of working on the film as “next level” and “very professional and very organized.”

The process required distanced collaboration with Los Angeles marketing and design company 72 and Sunny the visual storytelling and design firm Psyop and creatives Ryan Gerber and Sam Liu.

“Everything was produced through virtual platforms from the pre-visualization to the voice over recordings” Don Muña said. “It was a real eye opener as to how anything truly is possible in terms of creating art and entertainment for Guam.”

In a blog post about the short film on Adobe’s website the Adobe Communications Team said “Today we are proud to celebrate the beauty and richness of the Asian and Pacific Islander community by showcasing the immense diversity in the experiences backgrounds and influences that shape API creative expression.”

This sentiment goes hand in hand with the theme of “New Voices” for this year’s Guam International Film Festival which was founded by the Muna brothers. According to a statement from the festival the focus this year will be “centered around the emergence of new Pasifika artists and perspectives from within a rapidly changing global community.”

Speaking about his own background and experience Don Muña said “We as CHamorus are a collection of cultures that have been borrowed and borrowed back throughout centuries. All of which we can’t deny. So as we continue to push our culture forward try to be mindful that we’ve been blessed as a community with the history of storytelling which affords us the inheritance of authority to create new stories to free us from our past and literally write for ourselves a brand new dream big out of this world future.”

This is the 11th year for the festival which will be broadcast on PBS Guam and with simultaneous online streaming through the free PBS app for viewers in Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands this November.

“Just like every year I’m looking forward to laying eyes on the newest most passionate storyteller that has something to say. Something raw unfiltered and straight from the heart” Don Muña said.

Submissions for this year’s festival have closed. Filmmakers submitted either feature length or short films in a variety of categories including narrative documentary Made in the Marianas animation or music videos.

The Muña Brothers have been living out the ethos of the Diverse Voices campaign for years through their work with Guam International Film Festival. They know that stories and culture need to be actively valued to survive.

“Soon our language knowledge practices and beliefs will be lost if we’re not consciously taking action to preserve them” Don Muña said.

“To the beginner storytellers of Guam I say this — on a global scale no one knows who we are and no one really cares. We are from Guam use it to your advantage. There are no rules. Don’t hold back.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtsYXRpbmN1bHR1cmUuY29tL21leGljYW4tcGFyYWRlLW55Yy0yMDIxL9IBQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtsYXRpbmN1bHR1cmUuY29tL21leGljYW4tcGFyYWRlLW55Yy0yMDIxLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Mexican Parade NYC 2021 Brings Chinelos to Murray Hill!,"The Mexican Parade NYC 2021 marches down Madison Ave from 38th St to 27th St in Murray Hill Manhattan on Sun September 19 2021 starting at 10am.

Visitors from Mexico include representatives from Morelos state whose capital is Cuernavaca. The state has a very even climate. Because of this it’s been a wintering place for the Mexican elite since Aztec times.

The Club Migrante Chinelos de Morelos en Nueva York is being honored. Chinelos are traditional masked carnival dancers from Morelos. The dancers make fun of European colonizers including the Spanish French and Mexican President Porfirio Díaz who tried to Europeanize Mexico. Chinelos are often accompanied by bandas Mexican brass marching bands.

Celebrants are wearing black pants and white shirts in honor of essential workers. Mexican New Yorkers dominate NYC’s food industry. No matter the type of food it’s often prepared by Mexican chefs.

AMD,Advanced Micro Devices,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWQtY2hpcHNldC12dWxuZXJhYmlsaXR5LWxlYWtzLXBhc3N3b3Jkc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Chipset Vulnerability Leaks Passwords Patch Available,"AMD has divulged details about a chipset driver vulnerability that can allow non-privileged users to read and dump some types of memory pages in Windows. This technique allows an attacker to steal passwords or enable other types of attacks including circumventing standard KASLR exploitation (aka Spectre and Meltdown) mitigations (via TheRecord).



Word of the bug came as part of a coordinated disclosure with Kyriakos Economou a security researcher and co-founder of ZeroPeril who exploited the vulnerability to download several gigabytes of sensitive data from impacted AMD platforms — but as a non-admin user. AMD has prepared mitigations that can be downloaded either as part of its latest chipset drivers or by using Windows Update to update the AMD PSP driver (details of how to update are below).

AMD originally issued the patch several weeks ago but without disclosing which vulnerabilities were addressed. This new disclosure answers those questions.

The security researcher first discovered the flaw with Ryzen 2000- and 3000-series platforms but AMD initially listed only Ryzen 1000 and older chips in its advisory. The researcher noted the discrepancy in his report and we followed up with AMD about the issue. AMD has since updated the page with a full list of impacted platforms that spans its entire modern consumer processor lineup as well as many older models (list below).

Economou attacked two separate issues with AMD's amdsps.sys driver for its Platform Security Processor (PSP) an embedded chip that manages chip security. The vulnerability allowed the researcher to extract multiple gigabytes of uninitialized physical memory pages. The full report goes deeper into the details of the vulnerability (PDF alert) but this passage summarizes the end result:

""During our tests we managed to leak several gigabytes of uninitialized physical pages by allocating and freeing blocks of 100 allocations continuously until the system was not able to return a contiguous physical page buffer.



The contents of those physical pages varied from kernel objects and arbitrary pool addresses that can be used to circumvent exploitation mitigations such as KASLR and even registry key mappings of \Registry\Machine\SAM containing NTLM hashes of user authentication credentials that can be used in subsequent attack stages.



For example these can be used to steal credentials of a user with administrative privilege and/or be used in pass-the-hash style attacks to gain further access inside a network.""

AMD advises that impacted users update to AMD PSP driver 5.17.0.0 via Windows Update or to AMD Chipset Driver 3.08.17.735 (or newer in the future).

AMD's chipset driver vulnerability disclosure comes on the heels of news that all of its processors suffer from a Meltdown-like vulnerability that will require specific software optimizations to patch. However AMD leaves that to software vendors to implement meaning many types of software could simply go unpatched.

AMD's processors have gained a reputation for being more secure than Intel's chips due to far fewer discovered vulnerabilities. However as the smaller player with less overall x86 market share it has long been opined that AMD's processors simply haven't been subject to as much poking and prodding from researchers. Now that AMD has taken a more significant portion of the market and continues to grow it is inevitable that researchers and nefarious actors will target the processors more frequently.



Here's a guide on how to update your system and a comprehensive list of affected processors which includes all Ryzen CPUs and Threadrippers along with dozens of other models .

How to Tell If You Have the Latest Drivers

If you're wondering whether you already have the mitigations in place to protect your PC you need to check to see if your AMD PSP driver is version 5.17.0.0 or higher. To do that:

1. Open device manager. You can get there either by hitting Windows key + X and selecting it from the context menu.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

2. Open Security devices.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

3. Right click on AMD PSP Device and select properties.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

4. Click the Driver tab.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

5. Look at the Driver Version number. If it's under 5.17.0.0 you need an update.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

If you have one of the CPUS above you're running Windows and your AMD PSP driver is lower than 5.17.0.0 follow these instructions.

1. Navigate to AMD's Drivers and Support Page.

2. Select the chipset for your motherboard from the menu and click Submit. For Ryzen processors you'll want to start by picking Chipsets->AMD Socket AM4 and then the chipset (ex: B550).

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

3. Click the Download button beneath ""AMD Chipset Drivers."" A zip file will download.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

4. Open the zip file extract the installer and run it. Be patient because the software can take a few minutes to detect what you have and appear to be frozen. Don't click out of the window or as per our experience it may freeze.

5. Make sure AMD PSP Driver is checked and click Install.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Again you will need to be patient as the system will take several minutes downloading and installing updates.

6. Click Restart when the process is completed.

The picture showed Ms Petito beaming as she stood in front of a mural of colourful angel wings with a bag slung over her shoulder.

Joseph Petito captioned the post with a broken heart and the words: “#GABBYPETITO she touched the world”.

Condolences poured in in response as the news broke across the world that a body likely to be Ms Petito’s had been discovered in Grand Teton National Park.

In a press conference on Sunday the FBI sent condolences to Ms Petito’s family as they shared the news that the body matched the description of the missing van-life blogger who disappeared at the end of August.

Although they have not yet announced any forensic confirmation around the identity of the body the FBi said Ms Petito’s family had been informed.

Ms Petito had been blogging about her cross-country adventures in a campervan with her fiance Brian Laundrie. Mr Laundire returned home from their trip alone at the beginning of September and refused to speak with police.

He has been named a person of interest in the investigation and his family has since announced that he is missing. Police have launched a search for Mr Laundrie and on Saturday confirmed that it was a missing persons investigation and that he is not currently wanted in connection with a crime.",,,,,,,,,

If your childhood dream was to live like Winnie the Pooh this is your chance to make it come true by staying at a replica of the storied bear’s tree house.

Pooh illustrator Kim Raymond is hosting two one-night stays at the “Bearbnb” custom-built at the real site that inspired the fictional Hundred Acre Wood in England to celebrate the 95th anniversary of Pooh’s creation by writer A. A. Milne.

“The ‘Bearbnb’ is a unique experience that brings the charm of Pooh to life for fans whilst honoring the original adventures that have been so important to many people for 95 years” Raymond said in an Airbnb release.

Illustrator Kim Raymond said he was inspired by the original drawings of E.H. Shepard in designing the house. Henry Woide/Airbnb

The house is one room that looks like it is built into a tree complete with the Mr. Sanders sign above the door on the outside and “hunny pots” in the cupboard inside.

Guests will be taken on a tour of the area in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex that was the inspiration for books’ wood setting and the stay includes playing “poohsticks” on Poohsticks Bridge and “hunny-inspired meals” according to the Airbnb listing.

Guests will be served ""hunny-inspired meals"" Airbnb said. Henry Woide/Airbnb

Raymond who illustrated Winnie the Pooh for 30 years said he was inspired by the original depictions in the books by E. H. Shepard in designing the house and its interior.

The house sleeps four people with a double bed and two smaller loft beds above it according to the listing.

""Hands are to be kept out of the honey pots"" the house rules state. Henry Woide/Airbnb

House rules permit “multiple naps” and encourage snacks of “a little something” at 11 a.m. the time Pooh famously took his refreshment. “Poohsticks” are mandatory and “strictly no heffalumps” are allowed in the house.

The house will be for rent for September 24 and 25 for about $130 per night. Airbnb reviews will be used in considering the renters for each night according to the release.

Sadly enough for those outside the United Kingdom only UK residents will be eligible to book starting September 20 the release said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnRvd24uY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMTgvYWlyYm5iLXJ2LXBhcmstcmVjZWl2ZS1mYXZvcmFibGUtcmVjb21tZW5kYXRpb25zLWJ6YS10by1oYXZlLWZpbmFsLXZvdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb RV park receive favorable recommendations; BZA to have final vote,"Brooke Fleetwood shared this rendering of an Airbnb she would like to put in a building at 400 N. Chestnut St. Seymour.

[email protected]

Proposals to convert a former business into an Airbnb and add a recreational vehicle park with cabins to an existing business have moved forward.

During a recent meeting the Seymour Plan Commission gave favorable recommendations to land use variances requested by Brooke and Kim Fleetwood for the Airbnb at 400 N. Chestnut St. and Gregg Pardieck and Todd Storey with Parkland Inc. for the RV park and cabins on the Chateau de Pique Winery and Brewery property at 6361 N. County Road 760E.

The board voted 10-0 and 9-1 respectively with Dave Eggers casting the lone nay vote. Jeri Wells was absent.

The final votes will come from the Seymour Board of Zoning Appeals at its next meeting at 7 p.m. Sept. 28 in the training room upstairs at the Seymour Police Department 205 N. Ewing St.

Airbnb

Kim Fleetwood stepped up to the podium to address the plan commission and her daughter attended virtually via GoToMeeting to explain their plans for Pink Castle on the northeast corner of Chestnut and Fourth streets.

Kim said they want to “make it an experience for guests coming in.”

“There’s nothing in the area to do this” she said. “There are a lot of brides that come in the area and they are getting ready for weddings and several ladies could use this house.”

Answering questions from commission member Bret Cunningham Kim said the Airbnb would be rented to one party at a time and Brooke said capacity would be around 12 to 15 people.

No one attended the meeting to speak in favor of or against the proposal but four people submitted favorable correspondence via email.

“I would love for this to come to the area. I think it would be a great asset to the community and Brooke is a wonderful person that gives so much” Michelle Allison wrote.

“Brooke is super amazing for coming forward and willing to build something different for this town and I fully support it. Can’t wait to see what all she has to offer” Kara Rice said. “I hope you all are willing to give her a chance as well. Thank you for possibly giving her the opportunity.”

The Fleetwoods said the purchase of the building is contingent upon the city boards’ approval. If the BZA approves the zoning would change from C-2 (general commercial) to R-3 (multiple-family residential).

RV park with cabins

Pardieck asked for a land use variance since his property is currently zoned R-1 (single-family residential) R-S (single-family residential zoning district) and C-1 (neighborhood commercial) but the latter doesn’t allow for RV parks.

Speaking on behalf of Parkland Inc. attorney Jeff Lorenzo said Pardieck and his father Ralph talked about including an RV park years ago and it never came to fruition until now.

“It’s coming to fruition primarily because of a need driven by the coronavirus” Lorenzo said. “We have lots of people who are not vacationing at typical resorts. They are buying RVs and they are seeking out facilities like this. The whole process accelerated here in the last year or so.”

Chateau de Pique received requests to park RVs in its lot and has been allowing that for the past year and a half.

Pardieck is now requesting approval to have 45 stations for RVs to park and 20 cabins. Lorenzo said the full-service facility would have a bathhouse electricity two ponds a playground restrooms and shower facilities a walking path and a gatehouse. The onsite management office would be in an existing building.

The RV park and cabins would be located between the winery and railroad tracks and operate from March/April to October/November. According to city ordinance rental would have a maximum of 90 days.

“The ordinance does not allow people to park for more than 90 days so if you’re going to stay the summer you can stay the summer but you can’t live there. You’re going to have to pull out” Lorenzo said. “We don’t anticipate at any given moment they are going to have 65 RVs there. We’re building it to capacity that makes sense and we want to have room for as many people as we can have room for.”

Lorenzo said he has heard Seymour Mayor Matt Nicholson say there’s a need for more recreational facilities in the city.

“This fits I think with an overall plan for the city of Seymour to develop additional recreational facilities for the people that live here and the people that are coming into the community” he said. “To the extent that people stay more than overnight it’s an opportunity to sell the city sell the county. It’s an opportunity for all of the businesses in the area to do better.”

Three people who live near the winery said they weren’t for or against the proposal but they expressed some concerns.

George Mellencamp owns property north of the winery and said he can’t farm 2 acres of it because it’s wet. He asked if the RV park would make his property wetter.

“It’s just wet ground. It’s like quicksand back there” Mellencamp said. “The further you get south the drier the ground gets.”

Chad Leinart with Independent Land Surveying of Brownstown said they would dig the ponds out bigger to get more dirt and raise the ground up. If the proposal is approved by the BZA Leinart said he would move forward with the site plans and submit them to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and Jackson County Drainage Board.

Eric Jackson who lives west of the winery said the county road already has a lot of traffic and large potholes and he is concerned what large RVs traveling on it would do to the road. While the road is in the city’s 2-mile fringe Eggers said it’s the responsibility of the county to maintain it and he recommended Jackson contact his district’s county commissioner.

Lorenzo said if the BZA approves the land use variance he would talk to the county commissioners to ensure the roadway is properly maintained.

Jackson also asked if the property could ever be turned into a trailer park and Building Commissioner Jeremy Gray said that would require applying for a different zoning category. Lorenzo said the petitioners don’t have any intention of doing that.

Gray said his office has received inquiries about a campground or RV park in the area and he recommended Pardieck apply for a land use variance instead of a zoning change.

“I think it’s a really good fit” he said. “It’s a good recreational area. I think it would be an asset.”

Commission member Dan Robison agreed and made a motion to approve the request which was seconded to allow for a vote.

“I’ve been out there a couple times and met folks people come through in RVs visit with them. They are interested in our community” he said. “I think it is a great demographic of folks that we want to attract to our community and visit our attractions and stuff here so I think it’s an ambitious plan. I like it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3Mvd2hhdHMtdHJlbmRpbmcvaG93LXRvLXNwb3QtaGlkZGVuLWNhbWVyYXMtaW4teW91ci1haXJibmItb3ItaG90ZWwtcm9vbS11c2luZy15b3VyLXBob25lL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3Mvd2hhdHMtdHJlbmRpbmcvaG93LXRvLXNwb3QtaGlkZGVuLWNhbWVyYXMtaW4teW91ci1haXJibmItb3ItaG90ZWwtcm9vbS11c2luZy15b3VyLXBob25lL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to spot hidden cameras in your Airbnb or hotel room using your phone,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox59.com/news/whats-trending/how-to-spot-hidden-cameras-in-your-airbnb-or-hotel-room-using-your-phone/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3Mvd2hhdHMtdHJlbmRpbmcvaG93LXRvLXNwb3QtaGlkZGVuLWNhbWVyYXMtaW4teW91ci1haXJibmItb3ItaG90ZWwtcm9vbS11c2luZy15b3VyLXBob25lL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3Mvd2hhdHMtdHJlbmRpbmcvaG93LXRvLXNwb3QtaGlkZGVuLWNhbWVyYXMtaW4teW91ci1haXJibmItb3ItaG90ZWwtcm9vbS11c2luZy15b3VyLXBob25lL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYmFsbGVyYWxlcnQuY29tL3Byb2ZpbGVzL2Jsb2dzL3Rlbi1vZi10aGUtbW9zdC11bmlxdWUtYWlyYm5iLWxpc3RpbmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ten Of The Most Unique Airbnb Listings,"You can find all types of different and unique Airbnb listings including treehouses lighthouses and even a one-of-a-kind Grist Mill.

Generations of children have long wished that they could go to the Hundred Acre Wood and pay a visit to Pooh Corner. And now Disney and AirBNB BearBNB are making that dream a reality. A Winnie the Pooh-inspired tree house is now available to book as part of Disney’s 95th Anniversary celebrations of the iconic character. The tree house is located in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex England where Winnie the Pooh author A. A. Milne lived. Milne who lived on the northern edge of the forest would take his son Christopher Robin walking in the woods which inspired the classic childrens’ books. Artist E. H. Shepard then used Ashdown Forest as inspiration for the illustrations in Milne’s books.

That is why I was intrigued to talk to Tray Johnson VP of innovation at Quext which has introduced an IoT product for multifamily communities.

Unlike some of the other offerings Quext has selected LoRaWAN networks for the network coverage of its devices. So far the company offers a smart home hub situated in a thermostat and smart locks from Allegion/Schlage. But Johnson said Quext plans to add leak sensors next as well as additional devices to meet market demand. (For those that are interested I also liked this site covering its AWS architecture.)

Quext was formed in 2017 by former apartment community operators from Madera Residential with a focus on modernizing apartment communities. It offers connectivity services and website management and now will provide several smart home services for apartments. It also includes some notable players from the multifamily industry on both its advisory board and leadership team.

When thinking about adding connected devices to apartments one of the biggest challenges has to do with network connectivity and managing what might be hundreds of smart home hubs. When a rental unit is empty it doesn’t have broadband which means that any smart device reliant on connectivity won’t work. Unless the building or unit owner wants to pay for continuous broadband service the value that a collection of connected devices can provide to an empty unit is limited.

Each vendor handles this challenge differently. Stratis hooked up its communities with property-wide Wi-Fi networks that covered the units even when unoccupied and kept the smart home devices on that network. Other providers such as PointCentral use cellular to keep devices connected when a renter’s network isn’t operating. Quext has chosen LoRaWAN and worked with Semtech to get devices that can connect to LoRa and Wi-Fi networks. Quext designed its thermostat/hub to provide the link between the devices and LoRa network coverage that Quext sets up and manages for a property.

So far Quext has four properties beta testing its service. The property owners buy the devices for their units from Quext and then pay $4 a month for service. Today those services include smart locks and thermostat control since those are the easiest use cases to justify.

The ability to get rid of keys provide unguided tours and manage the heat and AC in vacant units provides a clear return on investment that has encouraged property owners to invest in these devices and services. Johnson expects leak detection to be the next offering that apartment managers will demand.

I’m a little bummed about that since I have been hearing about remote key management and controlling HVAC in multifamily dwellings for the last five years. I’m eager for apartment managers to embrace something new. I get that smart lights are probably not a huge money-saver (plus installation is pretty intense) yet I keep hoping to see something for noise detection in hallways or people-counting sensors in public areas that tell residents if the laundry room is free or the pool is crowded. But so far we’re still stuck with smart locks and thermostats.

As boring as those offerings are I suppose it’s good that we have another entrant in the market ready to try a new connectivity technology in the multifamily space. This could be a boost for LoRAWAN networks and maybe the beginning of new services for apartment dwellers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Prakash Singh | AFP | Getty Images

Google abused the dominant position of its Android operating system in India using its ""huge financial muscle"" to illegally hurt competitors the country's antitrust authority found in a report on its two-year probe seen by Reuters. Alphabet Inc's Google reduced ""the ability and incentive of device manufacturers to develop and sell devices operating on alternative versions of Android"" says the June report by the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) investigations unit. The U.S. tech giant told Reuters in a statement it looks forward to working with the CCI to ""demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation not less.""

Google has not received the investigation report a person with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters. The CCI did not respond to a request for comment on the report. Senior CCI members will review the report and give Google another chance to defend itself before issuing a final order which could include penalties said another person familiar with the case. Google would be able to appeal any order in India's courts. Its findings are the latest antitrust setback for Google in India where it faces several probes in the payments app and smart television markets. The company has been investigated in Europe the United States and elsewhere. This week South Korea's antitrust regulator fined Google $180 million for blocking customized versions of Android.

'Vague biased and arbitrary'

Google submitted at least 24 responses during the probe defending itself and arguing it was not hurting competition the report says. Microsoft  Amazon.com  Apple  as well as smartphone makers like Samsung and Xiaomi were among 62 entities that responded to CCI questions during its Google investigation the report says. Android powers 98% of India's 520 million smartphones according to Counterpoint Research. When the CCI ordered the probe in 2019 it said Google appeared to have leveraged its dominance to reduce device makers' ability to opt for alternate versions of its mobile operating system and force them to pre-install Google apps.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIxLzA5LzIyOTc4NDI1LzEwLWhpZ2hlc3QtcGFpZC15b3V0dWJlLWNvbnRlbnQtY3JlYXRvcnPSAS1odHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vYW1wL2NvbnRlbnQvMjI5Nzg0MjU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Highest Paid YouTube Content Creators - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG),"YouTube announced recently that it passed the two million creator monetization milestone.

A Palo Alto mansion linked to Google billionaire Larry Page has been partially destroyed by a blazing fire according to The Daily Beast.

Local firefighters responded to a fire at the 6-bedroom 5.5-bath home located on Bryant Street on Tuesday morning after a neighbor who was not home at the time spotted it on their security camera.

Nobody appeared to be inside the residence at the time and there were no injuries.

It is unclear how the fire started but firefighters say the blaze was primarily the rear of the home which is attached to a long driveway and has a basement.

""That structure is done. It's probably gonna need to be rebuilt"" said Battalion Chief Shane Yarbough according to Palo Alto Online.

The fire did not reach the main part of the house although flames also damaged a fence and a tree Yarbough added.

It is unclear who is currently living in the California mansion valued at more than $10 million according to county records cited in The Daily Beast.

But neighbors are now demanding answers on whether the property one of many homes in the area owned by Page is being used unlawfully as an office for Google workers.

One neighbor told Palo Alto Online that the home is only ever used in the daytime as what appears to be an office space for a small group of tech workers.

Another neighbor told The Daily Beast that the Google co-founder bought the home as a guest house.

Public records confirm that the property is owned by an LLC that has shared two addresses with Page's family foundation the Daily Beast reported.

Page owns multiple homes in the area and likes to guards his privacy. His current whereabouts are a mystery although Insider previously reported that he spent most of the coronavirus lockdown in a remote part of Fiji.

These Dividend Stocks Can Collectively Net You Almost $8700 in Annual Income,"With yields ranging from 7.4% to 10.2% these ultra-high-yield stocks can pad investors' pocketbooks.

Although there is no shortage of strategies that can prove profitable on Wall Street buying dividend stocks is arguably the surest way to ensure your wealth grows -- and the long-term data confirms it.

In 2013 a report from J.P. Morgan Asset Management compared the performance of companies initiating and growing their payouts between 1972 and 2012 to publicly traded companies that didn't pay a dividend over the same stretch. The result? Dividend-paying stocks averaged an annual return of 9.5% which if reinvested would have doubled investors' money every 7.6 years. By comparison non-dividend-paying stocks clawed their way to an annualized return of just 1.6%.

Dividend stocks are a smart way to grow your wealth and crush inflation in the process. If you've got $100000 ready to put to work which won't be needed for emergencies or bills the following quartet of ultra-high-yield dividend stocks could collectively net you close to $8700 in annual income (an aggregate 8.7% yield). Note this assumes equal investments (a $25000 purchase rounded down to the nearest whole share) in all four companies.

Enterprise Products Partners: 8.1% yield and $2023.20 in annual income

Energy stocks are usually a good bet to deliver market-topping income. However the return potential with midstream energy company Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.59%) is truly something special. A $25000 investment in Enterprise Products Partners could purchase 1124 shares as of Sept. 14. Based on the company's $1.80 base annual payout income investors can expect to collect about $2023 in 12 months. Keep in mind though that this company has increased its base payout for 22 consecutive years.

While oil stocks probably aren't at the top of investors' buy lists after the coronavirus pandemic led to a historic drawdown in crude oil demand in 2020 midstream companies are a different beast. Companies like Enterprise Products provide the means to transport and store oil natural gas and natural gas liquids. This company has more than 50000 miles of pipeline and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage in the U.S.

The great thing about Enterprise Products Partners is its contract arrangements. These contracts are designed in such a way that no matter how volatile oil and natural gas prices are the company can count on predictable cash flow each quarter. Having a good understanding of how much money is coming in makes it easy for management to outlay money for projects without adversely affecting profitability or the dividend.

What's more even during the worst of the pandemic Enterprise Products Partners' distribution coverage ratio didn't dip below 1.6. A figure below 1 would signify an unsustainable payout. There's an ample buffer here to support this robust 8.1% yield.

AGNC Investment Corp.: 9% yield and $2259.36 in annual income

Although it hasn't been a favorite Wall Street industry over the past decade mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs) look poised to shine. If investors were to put $25000 to work in AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC 0.21%) as of Sept. 14 they could gobble up 1569 shares and enjoy a base annual payout of $1.44 per share. This would lead to $2259 in annual income. As an added note AGNC pays its dividend monthly.

Mortgage REITs are companies that borrow money at short-term lending rates and use this capital to buy higher-yielding long-term assets such as mortgage-backed securities. The goal here is to maximize the difference between the average long-term yield and the average borrowing rate. This difference is known as net interest margin.

Here's the kicker: During the early stages of an economic recovery the yield curve usually steepens. This is a fancy way of saying that long-term bond yields rise while short-term bond yields flatten or even decline. If this yield curve steepening is accompanied by a clear plan by the Federal Reserve (i.e. the nation's central bank isn't rapidly changing interest rates) it's often great news for the profit potential of mortgage REITs like AGNC.

Should you need one more boost of confidence take note that AGNC Investment has averaged a double-digit percentage yield in 11 of the past 12 years.

Altria Group: 7.4% yield and $1857.60 in annual income

Though not the growth story it once was tobacco stock Altria Group (MO 0.43%) continues to rake in the dough for income investors with a yield north of 7%. A $25000 investment in Altria the company behind the popular Marlboro tobacco brand could purchase 516 shares as of Sept. 14. Based on its annual payout of $3.60 a share Altria's investors would rake in close to $1858 in annual dividend income.

Despite a relatively steady decline in the percentage of smoking adults in the U.S. Altria's tobacco sales have continued to rise. This has to do with the incredible pricing power behind nicotine-containing products. Controlling roughly half the premium cigarette market with Marlboro allows Altria to pass along price hikes and drive modest top-line growth.

But Altria isn't content simply raising prices to achieve better results. It's licensed the smokeless tobacco system IQOS from Philip Morris International and made a $1.8 billion investment into Canadian marijuana stock Cronos Group in 2019. The predictability of Altria's cash flow affords the company a number of ancillary opportunities that could offset volume weakness from cigarette sales.

The bottom line with Altria is that investors are getting a company committed to a juicy dividend and regular share buybacks. For patient income investors this is a wealth-building recipe.

Annaly Capital Management: 10.2% yield and $2545.84 in annual income

Last but certainly not least we have mortgage REIT Annaly Capital Management (NLY 0.66%). Yes another mortgage REIT. Among ultra-high-yield dividend stocks Annaly just might be the most attractive company you can invest in right now. With $25000 you could purchase 2893 shares of Annaly as of Sept. 14. Taking into account a base annual payout of $0.88 dividend investors would collect close to $2546 in 12 months.

As with AGNC Annaly is set to benefit from a likely expansion of the yield curve. Since mortgage REIT share prices often hover near their book value the combination of an economic recovery and a steepening yield curve usually leads to share price appreciation as well.

Something to take note of with Annaly -- as well as AGNC -- is that it invests almost exclusively in agency securities. Agency assets are backed by the federal government in the event of default. As you can imagine having this protection tends to weigh down the yield potential of agency securities. At the same time having this default protection allows Annaly to prudently use leverage to increase its profit potential.

Since its inception in 2000 Annaly has doled out more than $20 billion in dividends and has averaged a yield of roughly 10% over the past two decades. It may not be a Wall Street favorite but it's a serious income stock that can crush inflation over the long run.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pavlo Gonchar | LightRocket via Getty Images

Search for ""toothpaste"" on Amazon  and the top of the web page will show you a mix of popular brands like Colgate Crest and Sensodyne. Try a separate search for ""deodorant"" and you'll first see products from Secret Dove and Native. Look a little closer though and you'll notice that those listings are advertisements with the ""sponsored"" label affixed to them. Amazon is generating hefty revenue from the top consumer brands because getting valuable placement on the biggest e-commerce site comes with a rising price tag. ""There's fewer organic search results on the page so that increasingly means the only way to get on the page is to buy your way on there"" said Jason Goldberg chief commerce strategy officer at advertising firm Publicis. For consumers looking for toothpaste on Amazon getting to unpaid results requires two full swipes up on the mobile app.

An example of a mobile search for ""toothpaste"" on Amazon shows a sponsored brand ad at the top of results.

Until recently Amazon put two or three sponsored products at the top of search results. Now there may be as many as six sponsored products that appear ahead of any organic results with more promotions elsewhere on the page said Juozas Kaziukenas who runs e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse. The number of ads that appear differs depending on the exact search term and other factors such as whether users are shopping on desktop mobile or in the Amazon app Amazon says. While Amazon doesn't break out advertising revenue ads account for the majority of the company's ""other"" sales. That category was the fastest-growing part of Amazon's overall business in the second quarter with revenue soaring 87% from a year earlier to more than $7.9 billion.

In 2018 Amazon leapfrogged Microsoft to become the third-largest ad platform in the U.S. trailing only Google and Facebook . Amazon is capitalizing on its market control knowing that its website or app is where many consumers begin their online shopping journey. Kaziukenas said Amazon and founder Jeff Bezos have completely transformed from being anti-advertising. It's become such a lucrative business that ads ""have replaced most of the functionality on the site"" he said. An Amazon spokesperson said there are no dedicated ad slots within search results meaning that a user may see one ad multiple ads or none at all. The company said advertising is an optional service for brands and sellers but that using it can improve visibility of their products. ""Like all retailers we design our store to help customers easily find and discover the right brands and products and sponsored ads is one of the many ways we do this"" the spokesperson said in an email. ""In all cases we work back from the most useful customer experience and the relevance of the results surfaced regardless of how they're presented to the shopper."" Big consumer products makers aren't the only ones taking up the most valuable virtual real estate. Amazon is also populating search results with its own products. For example a search for ""shampoo"" pulls up a promotion for a bottle of Amazon brand Solimo before ads for products from Pantene Nexxus L'Oreal and others. Sponsored product ads accounted for roughly 73% of retailers' ad spend on Amazon in the second quarter according to digital marketing agency Merkle. Last year Amazon began replacing product recommendations in listings with product ads. Amazon has also added new ad formats like video ads and sponsored brands posts which feature a single brand and several product listings in a banner at the top of the page.

Ad prices going up

For brand owners the price of doing business on Amazon is surging as the company expands its dominance in online commerce. The cost per click for Amazon search advertising was $1.27 in August up from 86 cents a year ago according to a survey of more than 300 Amazon sellers conducted by Canopy Management an agency that helps manage businesses on Amazon. Companies that don't pay the toll are finding their listings buried in search results. At the same time sellers are paying more overall to Amazon for things like transaction fees and fulfillment services. ""It's not uncommon now for brands to be spending 50% or more of their product price on various fees to be selling on Amazon"" Kaziukenas said. Competition has also intensified as a result of the rise of Amazon aggregators venture-backed companies that are raising big money from outside investors to acquire independent sellers. Some smaller sellers are concerned they may not be able to compete against deep-pocketed aggregators which are bringing ""massive budgets to be spent on Amazon also in the form of advertising"" Kaziukenas said. ""They're going from competing against other smaller sellers to now competing against massive and well-funded sellers"" he said.

Amazon's rapid expansion means they have a chance to create a better economy for working-class Americans.

It plans to add 125000 more US jobs and to open 100 new facilities in September alone.

The firm's huge hiring plans higher wages and new hubs have the scale that could change the economy for countless Americans.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

While the US continues to grapple with COVID Amazon is busy molding the post-pandemic economy. Early signs and historical precedent suggest it could improve work for millions of Americans.

Amazon employed 950000 US workers as of late June or one in every 153 American workers. It plans to add more than 125000 more payrolls as well as open more than 100 more facilities in September alone. More significantly it plans to pay people more and to create jobs in areas where they are sorely needed.

Amazon's leadership on wages recalls that of Henry Ford's action to lift his minimum wage in 1914 as Insider's Hillary Hoffower and Allana Akhtar previously reported. It's a goal shared by the Biden administration which has repeatedly stressed it wants to build the economy ""from the bottom up and middle out.""

Amazon is his unlikely partner in this effort.

Setting the new wage floor

While the federal minimum wage remains $7.25 an hour the retail titan is setting its own higher minimum.

The company set a $15 minimum wage in 2018 and it quickly prompted other employers to either match this rate or lose workers.

One Miami chef told The Washington Post that higher pay in Amazon warehouses made hiring in a strenuous kitchen more difficult. Larger businesses including Levi's and Under Armour have said Amazon's rates forced them to rethink their own wages. It is borne out in academic studies. Amazon's hike raised average hourly wages by 4.7% at nearby employers according to researchers at the University of California Berkeley and Brandeis University.

That bounce is set to repeat itself with Amazon's latest hiring boom touting an average starting wage of $18. While Democrats failed earlier this year to lift the minimum wage for the first time in 20 years Amazon's expansion is shifting the de-facto floor above the party's $15 target.

""I don't think people appreciate the extent to which Amazon puts a wage floor in a community"" Tum Duy chief economist at SGH Macro Advisors wrote in a Tuesday tweet. ""It's the first thing employers think about when a new Amazon facility arrives in town.""

Building the next-generation 'factory town'

By dramatically expanding its footprint Amazon could form a new kind of ""factory town"" that would further lift the country's working class as Conor Sen an economics columnist at Bloomberg wrote Thursday. ""Maybe these highway warehouse communities with jobs that pay increasingly respectable wages are what the future of the working class looks like.""

The phrase ""factory town"" recalls those that dot Michigan connected to automotive giants Ford General Motors and Chrysler which molded the state in the early 1900s as their factories became economic hubs and birthed new cities. Where the industrial titans brought jobs workers and other businesses followed. Amazon's huge warehouse plans offer a 21st-century parallel.

Data shows Amazon hubs already powering stronger economic growth. In Amazon's top 10 metro areas job creation averaged -0.4% in the three years before the company's entry CNBC reported in 2018 citing Morgan Stanley research. In the three years after its first facilities opened local job growth averaged 1.9%.







Some cities saw even larger jumps. In the Phoenix area job creation rose to 2.5% from -6.3%. The Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario region of California saw growth of -0.8% surge by 8.5% after Amazon opened several warehouses and sorting facilities.

The booms also extended beyond Amazon's own employees. The cities' transportation warehousing and utilities sectors – the last of which includes no Amazon hires – saw job growth outperform by 3.6% according to Morgan Stanley.

To be sure Amazon jobs aren't without their well-publicized downsides. Stories of overworked employees harsh conditions and safety concerns abound. The company has also been accused of quashing a unionization effort.

Amazon has said it aims to improve its working conditions but by sheer force and scale it is putting its thumb on the scale of the blue-collar economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5L2FkZC1hbWF6b24td2FsbWFydC1kcnVnLWRpc2NvdW50cy10by15b3VyLWNvc3QtY29tcGFyaXNvbi5odG1s0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2xldmVsYW5kLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDkvYWRkLWFtYXpvbi13YWxtYXJ0LWRydWctZGlzY291bnRzLXRvLXlvdXItY29zdC1jb21wYXJpc29uLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Add Amazon Walmart drug discounts to your cost comparison,"The sticker shock on some medicines can be staggering especially without insurance. But Amazon and Walmart are engaging in a price war for prescriptions. And the drug discount card networks they are leveraging may be well worth your consideration.

Amazon Pharmacy offers six-month supplies of select prescription meds for as low as $6 to Prime members. Meanwhile Walmart+ the retailer’s membership program launched in September 2020 offers medications at zero cost.

How much money can you save? And how do you trigger the discounts? Here’s how to tell if it’s worth side-stepping your insurance plan and buying some meds directly.

How much can you save on prescriptions?

Prescription savings will require membership with either retailer. That’s an annual fee of $119 for Amazon Prime or $98 for Walmart+ plus applicable taxes.

“The Amazon Prime prescription savings benefit saves members up to 80% off generic and 40% off brand name medications when paying without insurance. It is included with the Prime membership at no additional cost” Jacquelyn Miller an Amazon spokesperson said in an email response.

Meanwhile Walmart+ members can get select medications at no cost and “thousands of additional prescription medications” have discounts of up to 85% the retailer said in a press release.

The Walmart program includes the “most commonly prescribed medications” the company said for numerous chronic ailments including heart and mental health conditions diabetes allergies and antibiotics for bacterial infections.

How the Amazon and Walmart drug discounts work

The nation’s two largest retailers aren’t totally disrupting the pharmaceutical industry — yet. The Amazon and Walmart programs are built on the foundation of existing discount card networks Express Scripts’ Inside Rx and MedImpact’s America’s Pharmacy respectively. You may have heard of other companies such as GoodRx and Blink Health which use similar models.

Any of these discount channels can offer savings on meds. However if you have a prescription plan through insurance you’ll also want to consider your deductible.

Do you need to order six-month supplies to get the best price?

Amazon Prime members will find some medications are available starting at $1 per month when ordering six-month supplies. Customers can compare the price per month for 30- or 90-day supplies as well and then compare that to their insurance copay cost.

Walmart+ hasn’t promoted six-month prescriptions and typically offers 30- and 60-day options. You share your digital pharmacy savings card information with a pharmacist who will work with you to compare savings options on varying supplies.

Can you combine the discounts with insurance coverage?

No. The prescription savings cards are not insurance and can’t be combined with insurance. However you can always opt to use the discount programs rather than your insurance if a drug price is less than your copay.

Once you enter the prescription and your insurance information the Amazon service offers an insurance copay lookup tool so you can compare that to the discount price on a particular prescription.

‘Zillow for health care’

Thanks to online services such as Zillow and Autotrader it seems easier to shop for a home or a car than prescriptions.

“We need that for health care” says Mark D. Peters II of Flemington New Jersey a Doctor of Pharmacy and vice president at nonprofit CancerCare.

The reason there is little transparency in the pricing for medications and health care as a whole is a tangled web of providers Peters says.

Pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs — such as Express Scripts OptumRx and CVS Health — are a part of the complicated prescription supply chain. PBMs a bridge between drug manufacturers wholesalers health insurers pharmacies and large employers build a list of approved drugs called a formulary.

“Sometimes not always but sometimes this list of medicines is based on the best deal that they can get from the pharmaceutical company. So the PBMs are making all this money and sometimes they pass it forward to the patient many times they’ve not” Peters says.

Typically drug wholesalers also take a portion of the profit. And a tiny sliver is usually taken by the retail pharmacist.

How to save on prescriptions: shop around

Peters believes the services provided by retailing mammoths Amazon and Walmart are worth exploring.

“When you look at the diseases most people have the chronic conditions like diabetes heart disease hypertension hypercholesterolemia depression — almost all of that can be managed by generics that the Amazons and the Walmarts of the world have.”

Though he offers a caveat: “You have to shop around. Check out the pricing on Amazon and check out the pricing on Walmart just like you would for any product.”

NerdWallet priced some of the most-prescribed drugs in the U.S. comparing the same strength and tablet quantity in 90-day refills on both Amazon and Walmart+. We found a meager difference of just cents on some prescriptions but a more substantial difference of dollars on others.

More proof that it pays to compare prices.

Are these prescription drug discounts better than insurance?

“Insurance and prescription benefit plans vary widely so it’s hard to make an overarching statement about how this compares to insurance” Amazon’s Miller said. “In some cases the price for a medication either before or after savings may be less than an insurance copay.”

In fact Peters has found that to be the case with a prescription of his own. He has a generic drug prescription that costs him a $5 copay through his insurance. But the price without using insurance is even less.

The latest indicator that industry is readying for IFC retrofits comes from Panasonic Avionics which recently announced it has tapped ThinKom Solutions to develop a new-design Ku-band VICTS antenna for Panasonic’s global IFC solution with plans to offer it for both linefit and retrofit installations in 2023.

“Our new antenna offering with ThinKom is an integral part of our network and will allow airlines to access both current and future satellite constellations” explained Panasonic Avionics vice president of inflight connectivity solutions Jeff Sare.

Earlier this year Sare hinted that the firm was gravitating towards a hybrid antenna design to accommodate GEO and LEO-powered transmissions telling RGN that in the context of talking to LEO satellites in the future “other current technologies that are mechanically steered but closer to the ESA design are probably very viable mid-term technologies…” ThinKom’s ThinAir-branded VICTS is a mechanically steered phased array antenna.

In announcing a formal arrangement with ThinKom Panasonic seems to be effectively conceding that its traditional gimballed antenna solution – which it assembles at its Lake Forest California facility – is yesterday’s news. The arrangement also underscores that low-latency LEO networks will play an increasingly important role in IFC (Panasonic even preserved some of its XTS capital for LEOs).

Asked by RGN if the newly designed antenna will follow the ARINC 792 standard for nextgen antenna installs on brand new aircraft – and if we’re right in assuming it will easily slot into the current ARINC 791 footprint on aircraft currently fitted with Panasonic’s antenna – ThinKom CTO Bill Milroy said:

Regarding the details of the Radome Fairing and Adapter Plate for our new ThinAir® design Panasonic chose to retain responsibility for those. However I can tell you that the integrated assembly will be 791-compliant ready for both retrofit and linefit.

Panasonic has spent many years — and plenty of money — to interface with airframers’ IP and obtain linefit offerability across most commercial types so its pipeline to Boeing and Airbus must be seen as a boon for ThinKom.

But on the retrofit front alone the opportunity could be substantial. According to Panasonic over 2300 aircraft are now connected to its global communications network.

Retrofit specialists prepare

Lufthansa Technik is among the firms readying for the retrofit wave. (Incidentally the MRO giant has through the years fitted a sizeable number of aircraft with Panasonic’s legacy antenna hardware including for Lufthansa and others. It remains to be seen if Lufthansa will adopt Panasonic’s new Ku antenna from ThinKom.)

“Rip & replace is a topic gaining more and more airlines and lessors’ attention (slightly slowed due to COVID)” Lufthansa Technik head of connectivity solutions Lukas Bucher told RGN broadly in reference to the anticipated trend.

“Once airlines have made it past the dark days have settled the fleet setup and are on a positive trend they will continue with upgrades. That requires enhanced STC solutions which respect the IP situation of a given constellation (former IFC STC provider new IFC STC provider airline). Some of the ongoing IAMA standardization activities will support the future ease of such transitions.”

Indeed IAMA — the Independent Aircraft Modifier Alliance which boasts Lufthansa Technik EAD Aerospace Etihad Airways Engineering Envoy Aerospace Collins Aerospace CarlisleIT and others as founding members – is a growing force in the industry. It recently welcomed Qantas to its list of subscribers which share a common desire to ensure an open and transparent retrofit market through STCs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vY2VudHJlZm9yYXZpYXRpb24uY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL3JlcG9ydHMvZXVyb3BlYW4tYXZpYXRpb24tbmVlZHMtYmlnZ2VyLW1lcmdlcnMtdGhhbi1lYXN5amV0LXdpenotYWlyLTU3NDg3NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,European aviation needs bigger mergers than easyJet-Wizz Air | CAPA,"The news of Wizz Air's rejected bid for easyJet has refocused attention on European airline consolidation and the structure of the European market.

Ryanair has taken over from Lufthansa Group as the intra-Europe leader by seats and made the biggest gain in seat share during the pandemic. Aeroflot Turkish Airlines Wizz Air and Pegasus have also gained seat share. Lufthansa Group and easyJet have lost share while Air France-KLM's share is flat.

Comparison with the structure of the North American market is informative. The intra-Europe market is similar in size to intra-North America's in terms of seat capacity but far more fragmented. The 87% share of North America's top seven equals Europe's top 25.

This report suggests a hypothetical series of combinations among Europe's top 25 that would roughly replicate the seat shares held by North America's top seven. A combined easyJet/Wizz Air were it ever to happen would be number two intra-Europe but its seat share would not be top four in North America.

Europe needs much bigger deals if its market structure is to match that of North America where consolidation has improved airline profitability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1zb3V0aHdlc3QtYXVzdGluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Battle For Austin: American And Southwest Take The Lead,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1zb3V0aHdlc3QtYXVzdGluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay01ODYxMjUzMNIBKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay01ODYxMjUzMC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boxer Amir Khan removed from US flight,

“My head started spinning real real bad” said Ms. Williams 71 who struggled to even wash dishes without starting to feel ill.

Just a few miles from Ms. Williams’s house in New Orleans East sits a new 128-megawatt gas power plant that she and tens of thousands of other New Orleans residents help fund each month when they pay their bills to Entergy the city’s sole electric utility. The plant went online last year with a promise that it would provide quick reliable start-up power to a city that has struggled to withstand the ever-more-powerful storms that blow in from the Gulf of Mexico.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndla3Uub3JnLzIwMjEtMDktMTgvY29hbC1rZWVwcy10aGUtbGlnaHRzLW9uLWZvci1ub3ctYXQtd2VzdC12aXJnaW5pYXMtbW91bnRhaW5lZXItcGxhbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coal Keeps The Lights On For Now At West Virginia's Mountaineer Plant,"The first thing that strikes you about the Mountaineer power plant is its sheer size.

Its stacks rise more than 1000 feet over the Ohio River floodplain almost as tall as the Empire State Building. Its massive cooling tower can hold 8.5 million gallons of water.

A 20-story building houses its 1330-megawatt generator. It produces enough electricity to power a city of a million people. Or more than half of West Virginia.

Mountaineer has been generating electric power since Jimmy Carter was president.

But due to changing environmental regulations and the competition from natural gas and renewable energy time could be running out.

The plant requires upgrades to its wastewater treatment system . Under federal rules it can operate until 2040 with the upgrades. Without them it has to close by the end of 2028.

Conflicting decisions between utility regulators in two states complicate the plan to extend the plant’s life. West Virginia’s Public Service Commission approved the plan.

Virginia’s Corporation Commission however rejected it.

The regulatory snag shows the limits of what supporters of West Virginia’s coal plants can do to keep them from shutting down as the country moves away from fossil fuels.

‘Closing of a Culture’

Shutting down the plant would deliver an economic blow to Mason County. It employs more than 150 workers and supports other jobs in the community. Local schools depend on tax revenue from the plant.

Upstream coal mines in northern West Virginia supply the plant with its fuel which is delivered by barge. Those jobs are at stake too.

“This is closing of a culture this is closing of a community” said Rick Altman of Wheeling who’s been a coal miner for 44 years. “This is closing of a generational lifestyle that has really fueled this country.”

When Mountaineer opened coal was the nation’s dominant source of electric power. Four decades later natural gas dominates and renewables are catching up.

Coal plants like Mountaineer are becoming more expensive to operate. American Electric Power the parent company of Appalachian Power has two other coal-fired plants in West Virginia: the John Amos plant in Putnam County and the Mitchell plant in Marshall County. They face the same pressures.

The company has set a goal of becoming 80% carbon-free by 2030. Reaching that goal will require more coal plants to shut down.

President Joe Biden wants the nation’s power supply to become carbon-neutral in 2035. That’s five years before the West Virginia plants are scheduled to shut down if they are upgraded.

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that drastic action is necessary to curb the most devastating impacts of global warming — which in the Ohio Valley would mean less predictable weather more flooding and second-hand impact from coastal displacement and global disruptions.

One path forward: Replacing the coal plants with carbon-free sources of energy.

Gypsum and Molasses

It isn’t only the jobs at the power plants the coal mines or the barge companies on the line. The plant produces and consumes other materials that contribute to the local economy.

Curtis Tate / Ohio Valley ReSource The Mountaineer plant’s stacks soar more than 1000 feet over the Ohio River floodplain. The plant requires upgrades to its wastewater system to keep it operating through 2040. Without them it will have to shut down in 2028.

Fly ash is collected and hauled off by the truckload. It gets recycled in concrete and asphalt.

The exhaust is filtered through a huge drum that spins with powdered limestone and steel balls.

“We mix limestone and water inside of that drum that’s got them rotating balls in it” said Brett Watt the plant’s senior maintenance superintendent. “And it crushes this limestone up to where it’s a slurry. It’s actually finer than the coal is.”

That removes sulfur dioxide and produces gypsum which is used to make the drywall.

Probably the strangest part of the process involves molasses. Yes molasses.

It’s used to grow bacteria that eat mercury and selenium.

“We bring in tanker trucks of molasses to feed the bacteria” said Brian Mabe the plant manager. “There’s you know a living organism that removes that.”

The plant’s closure would be bad news for the drywall plant and the molasses maker.

Fossil Fuel Allies

One thing the plant and most like it can’t remove from the exhaust stream is carbon dioxide.

For several years Mountaineer participated in a pilot program  funded by the U.S. Department of Energy that took some of the carbon and injected it deep underground.

Carbon-capture technology has not been adopted on a mass scale. It’s expensive.

Still West Virginia Sens. Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito have included more funding to develop carbon capture and storage in a big infrastructure bill that just passed the Senate.

West Virginia lawmakers have made an effort to bolster the state’s remaining coal-fired power plants. This past spring they passed a bill that makes it harder for coal plants to shut down.

Gov. Jim Justice has also taken steps to save the state’s coal plants. He reactivated the dormant West Virginia Public Energy Authority and appointed fossil fuel allies to serve on it and find ways to keep the plants from closing.

One of them was Chris Hamilton president of the West Virginia Coal Association .

“We know these plants won't run forever” Hamilton said. “You know we're looking for about a 20 year run. Maybe a couple of decades.”

Justice also appointed the former top coal lobbyist in West Virginia to the Public Service Commission which regulates coal plants . Justice himself owns companies that mine coal.

The federal government is poised to spend billions of dollars to reclaim abandoned mines in Appalachia and that could help communities that are losing jobs.

Altman started working in the mines when he was 19 and he said he’s heard the promises before. As more power plants and coal mines close he said the government needs to step up.

“Don't just have a plan and say ‘don't you worry.’ I'm 63 years old. I got laid off the first time in 1979. You know what I was told by the government? ‘Don't worry about this we got you covered. We're going to educate you we're gonna do this.’ I'm still waiting for that to happen. I'm truly waiting for that to happen.”

Andrew Tang is vice president of energy storage and optimization at Wärtsilä Energy  which provides solutions for renewable energy integration and EV charging infrastructure development.

As electric vehicles (EVs) become the new standard charging infrastructure will become a commonplace detail blending into the landscape available in a host of places from a range of providers: privately run charging stations the office parking lot home garages and government-provided locations to fill in the gaps. We need a new energy blueprint for the United States in order to maintain a stable grid to support this national move to EV charging.

The Biden administration announced 500000 charging stations to be installed nationally and additional energy storage to facilitate the shift to EVs. Integrating all of this new infrastructure and transitioning requires balancing the traffic on the grid and managing increased energy demand that stretches beyond power lines and storage itself.

The majority of EV infrastructure pulls its power from the grid which will add significant demand when it reaches scale. In an ideal situation EV charging stations will have their own renewable power generation co-located with storage but new programs and solutions are needed in order to make it available everywhere. A range of scenarios for how renewables can be used to power EV charging have been piloted in the U.S. in recent years. Eventually EVs will likely even provide power to the grid.

These technological advances will happen as we progress through the energy transition; regardless EV infrastructure will heavily rely on the U.S. grid. That makes coordination across a range of stakeholders and behavior change among the general public essential for keeping the grid stable while meeting energy demand.

The White House’s fact sheet for EV charging infrastructure points to a technical blueprint that the Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute will be working on together. It is critical that utilities energy management and storage stakeholders and the general public be included in planning — here’s why.

Stakeholder collaboration

Charging infrastructure is currently fragmented in the U.S. Much of it is privatized and there are complaints that unless you drive a Tesla it is hard to find charging while on the road. Some EV owners have even returned to driving gas-powered vehicles. There’s reason to be hopeful that this will rapidly change.

ChargePoint and EVgo are two companies that will likely become household names as their EV networks expand. A coalition made up of some of the largest U.S. utilities — including American Electric Power Dominion Energy Duke Energy Entergy Southern Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority — called the Electric Highway Coalition announced plans for a regional network of charging stations spanning their utility territories.

Networks that swap out private gas stations for EV charging is one piece of the puzzle. We also need to ensure that everyone has affordable access and that charging times are staggered — this is one of the core concerns on every stakeholder’s mind. Having charging available in a range of places spreads out demand helping keep power available and the grid balanced.

Varying consumer needs including location and housing work schedules and economic situations require considerations and new solutions that make EVs and charging accessible to everyone. What works in the suburbs won’t suit rural or urban areas and just imagine someone who works the night shift in a dense urban area.

Biden’s plan includes “$4 million to encourage strong partnerships and new programs to increase workplace charging regionally or nationally which will help increase the feasibility of [plug-in electric vehicle] ownership for consumers in underserved communities.” Partnerships and creative solutions will equally be needed.

An opportunity to fully engage technologies we already have

“Fifty percent of the reductions we have to make to get to net-zero by 2050 or 2045 are going to come from technologies that we don’t yet have” John Kerry said recently causing a stir. He later clarified that we also have technologies now that we need to put to work which received less air time. In reality we are just getting started in utilizing existing renewable and energy transition technologies; we have yet to realize their full potential.

Currently utility-scale and distributed energy storage are used for their most simplistic capabilities that is jumping in when energy demand reaches its peak and helping keep the grid stable through services referred to as balancing and frequency regulation. But as renewable energy penetration increases and loads such as EVs are electrified peak demand will be exacerbated.

The role that storage plays for EV charging stations seems well understood. On-site storage is used daily to provide power for charging cars at any given time. Utility-scale storage has the same capabilities and can be used to store and then supply renewable power to the grid in large quantities every day to help balance the demand of EVs.

A stable power system for EVs combines utilities and utility-scale storage with a network of subsystems where energy storage is co-located with EV charging. All of the systems are coordinated and synchronized to gather and dispatch energy at different times of the day based on all the factors that affect grid stability and the availability of renewable power. That synchronization is handled by intelligent energy management software that relies on sophisticated algorithms to forecast and respond to changes within fractions of a second.

This model also makes it possible to manage the cost of electricity and EV demand on the grid. Those subsystems could be municipal-owned locations in lower-income areas. Such a subsystem would collect power in its storage asset and set the price locally on its own terms. These systems could incentivize residents to power up there at certain times of the day in order to make charging more affordable by providing an alternative to the real-time cost of electricity during peak demand when using a home outlet for example.

Behavior change

The greatest challenge for utilities will be how to manage EV loads and motivate people to stagger charging their vehicles rather than everyone waiting until they are home in the evening during off-peak renewable generation periods. If everyone plugged in at the same time we’d end up cooking dinner in the dark.

While there’s been talk of incentivizing the public to charge at different times and spread out demand motivators vary among demographics. With the ability to charge at home and skip a trip to the “gas station” — or “power station” as it may be referred to in the future — many people will choose convenience over cost.

The way we currently operate individual energy usage seems like an independent isolated event to consumers and households. EVs will require everyone — from utilities and private charging stations to consumers — to be more aware of demand on the grid and act more as communities sharing energy.

Thus a diverse charging network alone won’t solve the issue of overtaxing the grid. A combination of a new blueprint for managing energy on the grid plus behavior change is needed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFscHJpb3JpdGllcy5vcmcvcHJlc3Nyb29tL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEvMDkvMTkvdXMtMjEtdHJpbGxpb24td2FyLXRlcnJvci1oYWxmLWRlY2FyYm9uaXplLWdyaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The US has blown over $21 trillion on the War on Terror.

1. Since the 9/11 attacks the U.S. has spent $21 trillion on wars and militarism which has eroded civil liberties and caused millions of deaths injuries and deportations.





2. For less than half that amount we could decarbonize the U.S. electric grid create 5 million jobs deeply reduce child poverty vaccinate the world and more.





3. With U.S. troops now out of Afghanistan it's time to reinvest in these 20 years of missed opportunities for our infrastructure jobs and planet.



As the US marked the end of the war in Afghanistan President Biden zeroed in on a critical question: “What have we lost as a consequence in terms of opportunities?”

The president noted that we have spent $300 million a day in Afghanistan for 20 years. It’s a shocking figure but it’s only part of the cost of the wide-ranging militarization the US has undertaken around the world and in our own country since 9/11.

Twenty years after 9/11 our thoroughly militarized foreign and domestic policies have come at a cost of $21 trillion over the last two decades according to new research my coauthors and I published at the Institute for Policy Studies.

Those costs have included the wars ballooning Pentagon budgets and our massive global military presence. They also include punitive immigration and border enforcement and the reorientation of the FBI DEA and other law enforcement agencies around counterterrorism with newly expanded powers.

This spending has done massive damage in its own right.

US militarized spending since 9/11 has caused 900000 deaths from the global war on terror and led to 5 million deportations from this country. It has put $1.8 billion worth of military equipment on city streets singled out Black and Latinx people to be put behind bars for primarily nonviolent crimes and fueled FBI programs that targeted people based on nothing more than their race ethnicity or religion. And that’s just for starters.

It’s also as the president suggested money that simply hasn’t been spent on other things.

We’re still in the middle of a pandemic that has cost more than 600000 lives in the US alone. Millions of Americans face homelessness now that most eviction moratoriums have ended. We have an ongoing opioid epidemic that costs almost 50000 lives a year. Thousands of people in every part of the country have lost their homes or lives to fires and floods that were previously unthinkable but have become common because of climate change.

Each of these crises is an emergency but we still hear from too many in Congress that real solutions are just too expensive. But what if we spent even a portion of the $21 trillion we’ve sunk into militarism on those things instead?

Crisis solutions cost less than war

It turns out that many of the ambitious plans we hear are “too expensive” would cost just a fraction of the $21 trillion we’ve spent on militarism. It would cost less than a quarter of that — $4.5 trillion — to build an entirely renewable energy grid decarbonizing electricity generation across the entire country.

It would cost just $1.7 trillion to forgive student debt.

For $2.3 trillion we could create 5 million jobs paying $15 an hour with benefits — for 10 years.

For $449 billion — just 2% of our militarized spending — we could keep putting money in the pockets of families with children by expanding the Child Tax Credit another 10 years helping people stay in their homes giving kids a fair start in life and tremendously reducing child poverty.

And it would cost just $25 billion — just one-tenth of 1% of $21 trillion — to vaccinate low-income countries against COVID saving lives and stopping the spread of new coronavirus variants.

Even if we did all of those things it still adds up to less than half what we’ve spent on militarism in the last 20 years.

Divest from militarization

We’re not saying we need to erase all of these expenses. We clearly need to take care of veterans who were put in harm’s way because of our policies for example. But we can minimize these and other costs in the future by ending our reliance on militarization and war — which as the ignominious end of our occupation of Afghanistan suggests has proven a massive failure.

The fact that we’ve spent $21 trillion on militarism in 20 years proves one thing: When the country prioritizes something we have both the money and the political will to make it happen.

But so far Congress isn’t shifting priorities. On September 1 the House Armed Services Committee voted to add $25 billion — coincidentally the same amount it would cost to vaccinate the rest of the planet against COVID-19 — to the already huge Pentagon budget for weapons military leaders didn’t even ask for. They’re out of step with Americans the majority of whom said in a poll last year that they would rather cut the Pentagon budget by 10% to pay for other priorities.

At the end of the Cold War the US cut back on Pentagon spending as part of a ""peace dividend."" The US has finally withdrawn the last troops from Afghanistan. The end of this war can give us a peace dividend to reinvest at home if Congress and President Biden are bold enough to claim it. After 20 years of missed opportunities for our infrastructure our jobs and our planet we can’t afford not to.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdXRvcy10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi9ob25kYS10YXJnZXRzLWFubnVhbC1zYWxlcy03MDAwMC1wcm9sb2d1ZS1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy11cy0yMDI0LTIwMjEtMDktMjAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honda targets annual sales of 70000 Prologue electric vehicles in U.S. from 2024,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/honda-targets-annual-sales-70000-prologue-electric-vehicles-us-2024-2021-09-20/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdXRvcy10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi9ob25kYS10YXJnZXRzLWFubnVhbC1zYWxlcy03MDAwMC1wcm9sb2d1ZS1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy11cy0yMDI0LTIwMjEtMDktMjAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

View the current offers here.

Delta is my favorite domestic airline and American Express Membership Rewards are my favorite transferable points.

Coincidentally Amex and Delta are 1:1 transfer partners. So I can transfer points from my favorite credit cards to my favorite airline. This transfer isn't usually recommended though — Delta SkyMiles have been continuously devalued and are worth just 1.1 cents each per TPG's valuations. This is 0.9 cents lower than Amex's 2-cents-per-point valuation. And in my experience it's hard to get a higher value from Delta SkyMiles.

That said there are some exceptions to this rule. I've personally achieved high redemption values from Delta SkyMiles that warrant transferring points from Amex. These opportunities are few and far between but are still possible if you know where to look.

So in this article I'll show you times that it makes sense to transfer Amex Membership Rewards points to Delta SkyMiles. Some of these redemptions are of niche use while others have a wider appeal. That said all have the potential to stretch the value you obtain from your Membership Rewards points.

Before we start though always compare pricing with other airlines and transfer partners. Membership Rewards has a slew of different airline partners so you may get a better deal depending on the flight you're booking and when you book it.

Generally you can book these flights for roughly 25000 SkyMiles one-way with minimal taxes and fees. Remember though SkyMiles awards are priced dynamically. So there's no guarantee that this price will be the same when you go to book. Prices change by day and route so some days are more expensive than others.

For example one-way flights from New York-JFK to Paris (CDG) consistently price at 25000 SkyMiles and just $5.60 in taxes throughout most of next year. Likewise round-trip flights price at just 50000 SkyMiles and $90.05 in taxes and fees.

Flights to Mexico are another solid SkyMiles redemption. Delta and Aeromexico are SkyTeam partners so you can use your SkyMiles to book flights operated by Mexico's largest airline. Between Aeromexico and Delta you can book flights on several different routes to Mexico.

For example you can book round-trip business-class flights from New York-JFK to Mexico City (MEX) for 89000 miles and $114 in early February. These same flights cost $1235 so while it's not the best redemption value at 1.26 cents per point you save some cash and have a comfortable nonstop flight.

(Screenshot courtesy of delta.com)

You can book economy flights to smaller Mexican cities for similar prices. This Delta itinerary from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Guadalajara (GDL) via Atlanta (ATL) costs 12000 SkyMiles and $115 round-trip. The same flights cost $397 so you're getting over 2.3 cents per point in value.

My favorite way to redeem SkyMiles is by booking last-minute low-cost domestic award tickets.

Booking expensive last-minute and holiday flights with SkyMiles can save you a considerable chunk of change — even if it doesn't yield the highest cent-per-point value.

Again Delta prices awards dynamically so pricing varies by day and route. That said the airline is known to discount its domestic award tickets between non-hub cities that connect in Delta hubs like Atlanta (ATL) Detroit (DTW) and New York-JFK.

Check out these flights from Moline Illinois (MLI) to Nashville (BNA) via Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) and Atlanta (ATL). A round-trip ticket in Main Cabin economy costs just 15000 SkyMiles and $11.20 in taxes and fees. The same ticket costs $249 so you're getting just under 1.6 cents per point in value.

(Screenshot courtesy of delta.com)

There are solid deals to be had on flights between major cities too. I fly from New York (LGA/JFK) to Chicago O'Hare (ORD) a few times a year to visit family and often book with SkyMiles. You can find tickets for as low as 5000 SkyMiles one-way in basic economy with the option to book standard economy for an extra 2000 SkyMiles.

(Screenshot courtesy of delta.com)

These may not be the most exciting redemptions but they're worth a look if you need to take an expensive domestic flight. Plus these redemptions can save you a nice chunk of change if you take domestic flights frequently.

If you're based in Europe or are taking a multistop tour of the region you may want to use SkyMiles to book your intra-Europe flights.

Intra-Europe flights price at 10000 SkyMiles one-way in economy or 25000 in business class — even at the last minute. For example this KLM flight from Amsterdam (AMS) to Paris (CDG) in less than two weeks costs 10000 SkyMiles and roughly $45 in taxes and fees. The same last-minute ticket costs $228 giving you 1.83 cents per point in value.

(Screenshot courtesy of delta.com)

Alternatively this one-way business-class flight from Paris (CDG) to Kyiv Ukraine (KBP) costs 25000 SkyMiles and $133 after currency conversion. You'll pay $796 for the same business-class flight giving you over 2.6 cents per point in value.

(Screenshot courtesy of delta.com)

Business-class pricing on flights from Europe to Israel is reasonable too. London Heathrow (LHR) to Tel Aviv (TLV) in Virgin Atlantic Upper Class prices out at just 42500 SkyMiles and $379. A paid ticket on this route costs $1085 at the time of writing this article for roughly 1.7 cents per point in value.

""It’s unsurprising that many people prefer to fly airlines like Southwest Delta and American as these are well-known reputable airlines with solid customer service"" says Mendel.

In addition 24% are members of a particular hotel or resort loyalty program while only 7% are loyal to a cruise line and 6% are to a rental car company.

Surprisingly 3 out of 4 consumers say the pandemic didn’t impact their loyalty to their favorite travel brands either way though 14% became more loyal and 11% less loyal.

""During the pandemic many travel loyalty programs made changes to adapt to the global situation and encourage travelers to maintain their membership"" says Mendel.

The credit card company last month froze donations to the Alliance for Global Justice (AFGJ) which provides funding to the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network a group that Israel labeled a terrorist organization earlier this year the Washington Free Beacon first reported.

Israeli officials declared in February that Samidoun a pro-Boycott Divestment Sanctions group that helps free Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons acts abroad on the behalf of the U.S.-designated terrorist group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).

Discover has not said why it severed ties with AFGJ but the decision came after the Zachor Legal Institute pressured the company to do so according to email correspondence shared with Fox News.

Zachor founder Marc Greendorfer praised the move by Discover but slammed other major credit card companies for not following suit.

Mastercard Visa and American Express began blocking donations to Samidoun in January 2020 but they currently still allow donations to AFGJ which lets people donate to Samidoun through its website the Free Beacon noted.

""There are a number of federal laws that prohibit funding for terror connected organizations and we reached out to the four credit card companies (AmEx Visa and MasterCard along with Discover) that had been used by the Alliance for Global Justice for the benefit of Samidoun"" Greendorfer told Fox News in a statement.

""What surprised us is that only Discover seemed to understand the law and the risks it faced for violating the law"" he continued. ""We appreciate that Discover has done the right thing to shut off terror funding in this case but we can’t believe that the other three companies didn’t respond and didn’t apparently shut down funding to Samidoun.""

The Advisory Board’s review was rushed. Its members had neither the time nor the inclination to re-examine evidence from the trials or carefully weigh it against the misleading information presented by the prisoners in their clemency petitions. Instead in a few hectic weeks from mid-July to mid-September 1950 the Board skimmed judgements perused petitions took a 30 minute meeting with defense counsel ruled and moved on to the next case. It had no investigative staff to interrogate the “new” (more often repackaged assertions already dismissed by the tribunals) exculpatory evidence presented by the prisoners heard from neither witnesses nor prosecutors and demanded no expressions of remorse or regret from the prisoners.

The Board did not have the authority to question findings of fact (that a given defendant had committed an act and that the act in question constituted a crime). Yet it frequently did so arguing that the tribunals failed to take mitigating circumstances into account even when the judgements clearly indicated that they had. The Board also systematically questioned the parameters of individual guilt or responsibility as established by the tribunals at times coming dangerously close to reviving the discredited “superior orders” defense deployed by most of the Nuremberg prisoners at trial.

In some cases the Board simply disagreed with the tribunals’ findings deeming the judgements insufficient to justify a conviction on one or more charges without consulting the evidence. Whatever the amorphous concept of “American Justice” meant to McCloy the Advisory Board’s case reports indicated that it had been absent at Nuremberg.

The political realities of the Cold War indirectly influenced McCloy’s decision to review the Nuremberg sentences but did not dictate his actions or approach. Heated Congressional debates in 1947 and 1948 vis-à-vis the best and most practical disposition of American power in Germany framed the growing interest among certain policymakers such as Senator Joseph McCarthy in accusations from defense counsel that the US Army had tortured or otherwise violated the due process rights of German war criminals. Even though the charges of American impropriety were nearly exclusively bound up in the US Army’s separate Malmedy Massacre Trial the Nuremberg defense attorneys were quick to publicly claim that the successor tribunals had also violated their clients’ rights through procedural irregularities the denial of appropriate counsel and improper handling of evidence.

The appointment of subsequent investigatory bodies by the House and Senate served to normalize the idea that an appellate body of some kind should review all the sentences passed by American-zone tribunals since 1945 an idea ultimately embraced by McCloy upon the assumption of his duties as High Commissioner in September 1949. In taking this decision McCloy wished to restore the integrity of “American justice” on the world stage conceived of as a rebuke of the Soviet Union’s use of political terror witness intimidation and evidence fabrication. It was McCloy’s conception of the United States as the embodiment of world freedom and home of due process under the law as opposed to his need to appease activist West German politicians or obtain a West German contribution to European defense during the Korean War that shaped McCloy’s decision to empanel an Advisory Board on Clemency for German War Criminals.

Once established it was primarily legal concerns that shaped the Advisory Board’s operating procedures. Their conceptions of “American justice” demanded that the Board and McCloy establish a parole system for war criminals commensurate with the norms of the American criminal justice system consider exculpatory evidence that might free “innocent” men from Landsberg and entertain criticisms of the Nuremberg tribunals’ conclusions without explicitly rejecting the facts upon which those conclusions were based.

The Board that emerged from this desire to ensure that justice was done by repudiating the Nuremberg tribunal findings as unjust was not quite a parole board nor was it an appellate court. Neither a parole board nor an appellate court would allow the prisoners and their attorneys an uncontested platform to challenge their sentences presenting alternative narratives of persecution victimhood and innocence that could not be readily rebutted by prosecutors judges or evidence. It was this procedural ambiguity couched in sincerely-held ideals of “American justice” that set the stage for the emptying of Landsberg prison by 1958.

The Land Rover U.S. Eventing Team of Will Coleman and Off The Record Sydney Elliott and QC Diamantaire Ariel Grald and Leamore Master Plan and Tamie Smith and Mai Baum took second place in the FEI Eventing Nations Cup—the highest result by a U.S. team at the prestigious event.

Additionally Coleman and Off The Record a 2009 Irish Sport Horse gelding owned by the Off the Record Syndicate took first place individually becoming the first American combination to top the eventing podium at Aachen.

Coleman and “Timmy” had a stellar Aachen experience across all three phases beginning with a 29.7 in the dressage. The pair had a smooth jumping round in the stadium posting one of only three double-clear rounds and moving up the leaderboard from 11th to 3rd place heading into the final phase. They closed out the week with the best cross-country ride of the day adding only 0.8 time penalties giving the pair a personal best score of 30.50 and putting them 2.2 penalty points ahead of second-place finisher Laura Collet and Dacapo of Great Britain.

“[The win] is a testament to all the people who are part of my team” said Coleman. “That includes my family my owners my wife my vet my farriers and all the people who helped me in training. This is a reward for all of them and it’s just very satisfying and humbling at the same time.”

As alternates for the U.S. Eventing Team for the Tokyo Olympics Coleman and Timmy had the opportunity to train in Aachen earlier this summer during the team’s pre-export quarantine.

“When I came here for PEQ I decided to try to make that experience as formative as I could for this horse and I think it was” said Coleman. “I do think it helped him the fact that he was here for 10 days without being under any major stress. I think it played a part in his ability to come here and perform.”

Reflecting on his win Coleman kept the result in perspective but had high praise for his teammates and the team experience at Aachen.

“Hopefully [this win] means something [to supporters of American eventing]” he said. “It’s just one event and if we’re trying to build something that’s sustainable and lasting and repeatable maybe this is a step in the right direction. I think everybody that was here this weekend representing the United States did a fantastic job. I’m very proud to be associated with this group of riders. I was really proud of all of them today how they rode and the way they supported one another. It was a really fun trip to be a part of. I think if there’s one thing to take away from it it’s the power of that and the value of a team being really there for one another.”

Tamie Smith and Mai Baum a 2006 German Sport Horse gelding owned by Alexandra Ahearn Ellen Ahearn and Eric Markell are known for their dominance in the dressage arena and they did not disappoint this week posting a 25.2 to stand in second place after the first phase. An expensive two rails in the jumping knocked them down the standings but with no jumping penalties and just 7.2 time penalties in cross-country the pair finished in tenth place on a score of 40.40.

Ariel Grald and Annie Eldridge’s 2009 Irish Sport Horse gelding Leamore Master plan fresh off a third-place finish in the CCI5*-L at Luhmühlen earlier this summer had one of the best jumping rounds of the event with only 0.4 time penalties added to their score. A clean cross-country jumping effort with 10.4 time penalties secured a 16th place finish overall with a total score of 45.6.

In her first overseas outing Sydney Elliott piloted Carol Stephens’ 2010 Oldenburg gelding QC Diamantaire through a solid effort with just one rail in the stadium and no cross-country jumping penalties to complete their European debut on a 55.40.

Lauren Nicholson and Vermiculus Jacqueline Mars’ 2007 Anglo-Arabian gelding competed as an individual combination for the U.S. at Aachen completing in 24th place on a score of 52.4.

With four good scores the U.S. team finished on a team total of 116.5 just 0.3 penalties behind the first-place finishers from Great Britain.

“I’m very pleased with the results as we brought a team to test them in a championship environment and see how they would rise to the occasion” said Chef d’Equipe Erik Duvander. “I’m very proud of Will Coleman for winning a class that is extremely difficult to win. It’s encouraging to see that the U.S. is competitive on the world stage and that the riders’ hard work is paying off.”

The Land Rover U.S. Eventing Team’s top result in Aachen comes just days after the NetJets U.S. Jumping Team took home first place in the Aachen Nations Cup CSIO5*.

Hudson Institute’s South and Central Asia Program assembled a group of South Asia experts to evaluate the fifty-five interlinked Kashmiri and Khalistani groups currently operating within the United States and the possibility that these groups receive funding support and military training from Pakistan have ties to militant and terrorist groups in India and could detrimentally impact US foreign policy in South Asia.

The activities of Khalistani groups located in North America should be investigated within the limits prescribed by law to prevent a reoccurrence of the violence orchestrated by the Khalistan movement in the 1980s. During that period along with numerous attacks on civilians the Khalistan movement was linked to the 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182 from Montreal to London that left 329 dead and the failed bombing of an Air India jet in Tokyo on the same day.

The US government has shown reluctance to act on intelligence from India concerning Pakistan-supported Khalistan militancy largely due to Pakistan’s role as the artery providing logistical support to the US military mission in Afghanistan following 9/11. Compounding the issue China has blocked the designation of Pakistan-based terrorists under the United States’ terrorist-designation process within the United Nations Security Council.

Introduction

For many years a few members of the Sikh diaspora located in North America have supported the creation of a separate state for Sikhs—to be called Khalistan—in the Indian state of Punjab bordering Pakistan and the volatile Jammu and Kashmir region. While demands for a separate Sikh state were voiced prior to the dissolution of British India in 1947 Sikh militants did not begin employing violence to advance their demands until the late 1970s and continued to do so through the early 1990s.

In 1984 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi dispatched the Indian army to oust militants and their leaders from the holiest of Sikh shrines the expansive Golden Temple which they had occupied and then fortified with weapons brought from Pakistan. Gandhi’s action served to galvanize Sikhs living abroad as did the anti-Sikh pogroms that occurred following Sikh militants’ 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Gandhi in retaliation for the Golden Temple military operation.

During the course of the fifteen-year campaign of violence that lasted until the early 1990s some 25000 were murdered mostly Sikhs. Despite the long period of dormancy that then followed Khalistani militancy has increased in recent years and so curtailment of diaspora-based efforts to re-invigorate it may prevent a return to the violence of the 1980s.

Such diaspora-based efforts are worrisome because Pakistan’s intelligence agency the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI) may be assisting pro-Khalistan groups financially and organizationally. Admittedly Pakistan and India frequently accuse one another of fomenting separatist insurgencies within each other’s territory. For instance following India’s documentation of Pakistan’s widely acknowledged support of terrorism and violence in India a Pakistani dossier circulated among the permanent members of the UN Security Council accused India of supporting militant resistance to Pakistani rule in Balochistan which borders Iran and Afghanistan. However unlike Pakistan’s tit-for-tat accusations of India its organized support of terrorist activities to pursue its claims on Jammu and Kashmir have attracted international attention since at least 1992.

For years the United States and most of the international community have condemned Pakistan’s tolerance of and support for terrorism. Moreover the US Department of State’s Country Report on Terrorism 2019: Pakistan states “Pakistan continued to serve as a safe haven for certain regionally focused terrorist groups. It allowed groups targeting Afghanistan including the Afghan Taliban and affiliated HQN [Haqqani Network] as well as groups targeting India including LeT [Lashkar-e-Tayyaba] and its affiliated front organizations and JeM [Jaish-e-Mohammed] to operate from its territory.”

In addition the report continues “Islamabad has yet to take decisive actions against Indian- and Afghanistan-focused militants who would undermine their operational capability.” The Indian government and several independent scholars believe that militancy in Jammu and Kashmir as well as the Khalistan movement are parts of Pakistan’s plan for “bleeding India with a thousand cuts.”

According to data collected by Gallup American public opinion regarding Pakistan has in general been strongly negative since 2000 with solid majorities expressing unfavorable views of it. After US Navy SEALs found and killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in May 2011 a short distance from Pakistan’s premier military academy a plurality of Americans believed Pakistan undermined rather than aided American efforts to locate him.

Despite the strength of public opposition to Pakistan the United States government subsequently failed to develop policy measures to coerce that country into abandoning jihad as a foreign policy tool and curiously viewed Pakistan’s support of terrorism as the problem of other countries in the region rather than of the United States. This stance however changed in the aftermath of the November 2008 Lashkar-e-Tayyaba attack on Indian port and megacity Mumbai in which ten Lashkar-e-Tayyaba gunmen murdered at least 174 people and injured several hundred more.

While the vast majority of the attack’s victims were Indian it also claimed the lives of twenty-six foreign nationals including several Americans. In the weeks and months following the attack the extent of the support provided the attack team by Pakistan’s ISI became increasingly obvious and US policymakers increased their level of attention on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism including holding somewhat regular Congressional hearings on these activities.

Unfortunately the United States government has shown no interest in violence committed by Khalistan activists even though the Khalistan campaign’s most ardent supporters are located in western countries such as the United Kingdom Canada and the United States. Despite urgent Indian requests to these countries to curb Khalistan separatist groups within their borders their governments have remained unresponsive to India’s appeals. Making these demurrals all the more puzzling is the increasing involvement over the last decade of Khalistani groups with Pakistan’s so-called Kashmiri groups who have also become the focus of American intelligence and policy communities.

Cooperation between Khalistani and Kashmiri groups has become increasingly apparent in North America the United Kingdom and Europe with Kashmiri and Khalistani activists often operating in tandem. For example in August 2020 Khalistani and Kashmiri activists staged a demonstration in New York against India and in September 2019 activists appropriated imagery and slogans from the Black Lives Matter movement whose aim is to redress systemic and structural white supremacy in the United States. Joint protests of Khalistani and Kashmiri separatists have occurred in Washington DC Houston Ottawa London Brussels Geneva and other European capitals.

Anticipation constitutes a crucial part of national security planning and therefore investigating within the limits prescribed by law the activities of Khalistani groups located in North America is important to preventing a reoccurrence of the violence orchestrated by the Khalistan movement in the 1980s. During that period along with numerous attacks on civilians the Khalistan movement was linked to the 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182 from Toronto to Mumbai that left 329 dead and the failed bombing of an Air India jet in Tokyo on the same day.

Importantly the recent increase in Khalistan-related anti-India activism within the US is occurring as the United States and India are collaborating to confront the rise of China especially in the Indo-Pacific. Pakistan is a critical Chinese ally and therefore has a vested interest in weakening this India-US collaboration. Campaigns such as the one for Khalistan could also serve to distract Washington and New Delhi from strengthening the Quad (Australia India Japan US) partnership. Acknowledging the strategic objective of mobilizing the peer rivals of the US and their primary South Asian ally against India one of the most active Khalistan separatist groups in the US recently published open letters to the leaders of Russia China and Pakistan requesting their support.

A report by Terry Milewski for the MacDonald Laurier Institute provides details of recent Khalistani group activities in Canada. To produce a similar report for the US Hudson Institute’s South and Central Asia Program assembled a group of South Asia experts to evaluate the fifty-five interlinked Kashmiri and Khalistani groups currently operating within the United States. Connecting several of these groups to one another are shared political interests and a common modus operandi. Some for instance organize joint events and share lawyers donors and accountants. Note however that none of these groups has been accused of a crime in the United States and implying or offering evidence of unlawful conduct does not fall within the purview of a research project such as this.

Rather the following report simply examines the conduct of Khalistan and Kashmir separatist groups within the United States to investigate their support by Pakistan their ties to militant and terrorist groups in India and the possible detrimental effects of their activities on US foreign policy in South Asia.

SUNSET HILLS Mo. — It's not every day you see a new water tower being proposed or built in your town. Most of the time it's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of event.

That's why some residents of Sunset Hills want their city leaders Missouri American Water and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources to get it right.

So far some of them feel like they've been left in the dark about the potential of a new water tower that could place a sizeable shadow over their backyards.

""We feel like the whole process really hasn't been transparent"" said Sunset Hills resident Angie Weigel. ""They passed a conditional use permit or the city of Sunset Hills did without doing what I consider their due diligence. They didn't look at the safety aspects. They didn't look at all the recommendations from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. We think these recommendations are really what should happen. This is a safety concern.""

Weigel said the proposed water tower would be 60 feet from her house where her children play and sleep at night. She's worried about the potential of a catastrophic event like a tornado seismic event or a sinkhole bringing down the tower onto their homes.

She's not alone. Weigel is also part of a Facebook group that is trying to stop the construction of the tower.

Jen Carlson also lives by the proposed site and says she is very concerned about safety.

""This is Missouri American Water's first attempt in St. Louis County at building a water tower of this capacity and height"" wrote Carlson in an email. ""It will set a precedent for what they will attempt in other replacements in St. Louis County. We are concerned for future MAWC neighbors throughout St. Louis County.""

No one is questioning the fact that the current 1930s water tower needs to be replaced but residents say they expected a comparable water tower to be proposed. Instead this one is much bigger and would continue to benefit homes across south county.

The new tower would be 117 feet tall 19 feet taller than the original. It would also have six times the capacity of the original. It would sit on a 1/2 acore lot--about the size of an average residential lot. The same water utility company is building a similar capacity tower in St. Peters on three acres.

Sunset Hills residents like Carlson and Weigel said they're mostly concerned that the tower is clearly within a fall zone meaning if there happened to be a catastrophic failure of the tower it would likely topple on homes.

Missouri American Water spokesperson Samantha Williams told 5 On Your Side plans on building the 1.5 million-gallon water tank would serve as the control point for pressure management and pump operation in South County similar to the existing tank it's replacing. A spokesperson wrote in an email that since the 1930s drinking water and fire flow needs for Sunset Hills and surrounding communities have changed dramatically as the population grew. Missouri American Water said repairs on the existing tower are no longer practical and the new tank's size was determined based on the needs of the area.

It's grown to be a complicated issue within the city of Sunset Hills too. The mayor Pat Fribis told 5 On Your Side the alderman later voted to not sign a zoning letter so it's now in the hands of the Department of Natural Resources.

From January to the current day there have been back and forth decisions to squabbles over anti-water tower signs disappearing from yards from vocal opponents of the water tower claiming the city is targeting them for leaving their trash bins out too long. Some say it seems to have taken a personal twist.

In January the mayor broke a tie between aldermen to give the utility a conditional use permit. In June the board of alderman passed a motion to direct city staff to not review the permit application from Missouri American Water or their consultants. By July the Missouri DNR received a construction permit application from Missouri American Water and by August the DNR requested more information. A DNR spokesperson tells 5 On Your Side the application is still under review and no decision has been made.

Those who support a new water tower believe it will increase water pressure but a report showed that at best residents may see an increase of 4 points -- or 4psi of static pressure at most times.

""A Missouri American Water representative advised one of our city staff that if the towers are built it might increase the pressure for some people by four points"" said Cathy Friedmann a Sunset Hills alderwoman. ""I don't know that a four-point increase in water pressure is going to satisfy what most people want.""

Opponents of the tower say safety is really their biggest concern.

Alderwoman Friedmann mentioned that a survey found the ground on the Sunset Hills proposed lot is limestone which can be prone to sinkholes.

Missouri American Water said the construction is safe is consistent with other tank sites across Missouri and the US.

The thought of having a bigger and taller tower will never sit well with Weigel though she is concerned she won't be able to move either.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvc2VwLzE4L3VzLXN0ZWVsLWxvb2tzLWF0LXN0YXRlLWZvci0zYi1taWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Steel looks at state for $3B mill | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"U.S. Steel Corp. is considering locations in Arkansas and Alabama for a new $3 billion steel mill the company said Friday.

The so-called mini-mill will combine two electric arc furnaces which primarily use steel scrap and are far more energy-efficient than traditional integrated plants that are fed by coal. The company expects to begin construction in the first half of 2022 and start producing in 2024.

The steel giant's board has authorized an exploratory site selection process for the location of the mini-mill according to the statement. Potential locations include Alabama and Arkansas where U.S. Steel has existing EAF operations as well as greenfield sites.

U.S. Steel Corp. Chief Executive Officer David Burritt told The Wall Street Journal that the site hasn't been selected but that Arkansas and Alabama are being considered.

U.S. Steel is the relatively new owner of Big River Steel which in 2013 helped sustain and grow the steel industry in Arkansas and more specifically in Mississippi County when it built a $1.3 billion ""flex mill"" near Osceola that employs more than 500. About 15 months later it announced plans for a $1.2 billion expansion.

""We welcome the opportunity to compete for business expansion projects statewide that will lead to more high-paying jobs for Arkansans"" Chelsea O'Kelley a spokeswoman for the Arkansas Economic Development Commission said Friday. ""However per agency protocol we do not comment on specific projects.""

Clif Chitwood director of the Mississippi County Economic Development Commission said ""Like my friends at the AEDC always say we can neither confirm nor deny. Mississippi County has proven to be a hospitable and profitable place for steel production for two decades and we want to continue doing that.""

About 3000 people in the county are directly employed by steel producers such as Nucor Corp. which began its Mississippi County operations in 1988 and U.S. Steel. At least 1200 more are employed by other steel-related businesses and suppliers.

Chitwood estimated that 40% of the workers directly employed by the mills are residents of Mississippi County. ""Almost 100% of the jobs that supply the mills and jobs with all the steel-affiliated companies and businesses are held by residents here"" Chitwood said.

U.S. Steel's announcement comes as domestic futures prices for steel have more than tripled in the past year. The plan to build a new mill is the latest sign that steelmakers are growing more comfortable that higher prices will persist.

While the production increase has produced a windfall for domestic suppliers it's driving up the cost of everything from automobiles to wind turbines to kitchen appliances as the world recovers from the pandemic.

The company also estimated that it would report record earnings for the third quarter on the back of the strong prices which will allow it to reduce debt.

The benefits of higher prices are being felt across the industry. Earlier Thursday Nucor Inc. the largest U.S. steelmaker said it expects record earnings through the end of the year and Steel Dynamics Inc. on Wednesday forecast fourth-quarter earnings to be stronger than its previous guidance.

U.S. Steel characterized the planned mill expected to produce 3 million tons of flat-rolled steel products as part of the efforts to achieve its 2030 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 20% according to the statement.

KFC Australia just launched a new Double menu item combining two of the USA's favorite comfort foods. Previously the Australian leg of the company offered a different ""Double"" namely The Zinger Tower Double (via Taste). This earlier creation answered the question: ""What would happen if you used two pieces of fried chicken as a bun instead of bread?""

Whether this was a long-asked question or what feels like what would come out of a college dorm room KFC Australia was happy to make it happen. The Zinger Tower Double featured Zinger fillets in place of a bun a crispy hash brown a slice of cheese and tomato sauce.

Now the fast food juggernaut has a new meaty cheesy member of the Double family: the Pizza Double (per Taste). Fortunately for Aussies who love fried chicken and pizza this comfort-food mashup will be available at KFC locations across the country. The bad news at least for American taste buds is that it's not currently available in the U.S.",,,,,,

Demand is booming for silicon chips which are embedded in everything from smartphones and televisions to wind turbines but it comes at a big cost: a huge carbon footprint.

The industry presents a paradox. Meeting global climate goals will in part rely on semiconductors. They’re integral to electric vehicles solar arrays and wind turbines. But chip manufacturing also contributes to the climate crisis. It requires huge amounts of energy and water – a chip fabrication plant or fab can use millions of gallons of water a day – and creates hazardous waste.

As the semiconductor industry finds itself increasingly under the spotlight it is starting to grapple with its climate impacts. Last week Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company the world’s largest chipmaker which supplies chips to Apple pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The company aims to “broaden our green influence and drive the industry towards low-carbon sustainability” said the TSMC chairman Mark Lui.

But decarbonizing the industry will be a big challenge.

TSMC alone uses almost 5% of all Taiwan’s electricity according to figures from Greenpeace predicted to rise to 7.2% in 2022 and it used about 63m tons of water in 2019. The company’s water use became a controversial topic during Taiwan’s drought this year the country’s worst in a half century which pitted chipmakers against farmers.

In the US a single fab Intel’s 700-acre campus in Ocotillo Arizona produced nearly 15000 tons of waste in the first three months of this year about 60% of it hazardous. It also consumed 927m gallons of fresh water enough to fill about 1400 Olympic swimming pools and used 561m kilowatt-hours of energy.

Chip manufacturing rather than energy consumption or hardware use “accounts for most of the carbon output” from electronics devices the Harvard researcher Udit Gupta and co-authors wrote in a 2020 paper.

A global shortage of high-end chips as the pandemic boosted demand for electronics and Covid outbreaks closed fabs has increased focus on the industry.

In a tight market automakers found themselves at the back of the chip queue far behind much bigger-scale semiconductor customers such as Apple who use the chips to give computing power to their smartphones laptops and other devices. GM halted production in several of its North American factories this month while Toyota said it would cut its carmaking by 40% in September.

In an attempt to increase production many countries are embarking on big programs to boost the industry.

The Chips for America Act proposes $52bn in funding over five years for the US semiconductor industry. The EU has forwarded its own legislation aimed at increasing its share of the global chips market to 20% by 2030. The European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen called it “a matter of tech sovereignty” in her State of the European Union address last week.

These ambitions line up a potential clash with international climate goals. Both the EU and US aim to get halfway to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. And as the semiconductor industry grows so too will its carbon footprint.

However amid pressure from investors and electronics makers keen to report greener supply chains to customers the semiconductor business has been ramping up action on tackling its climate footprint.

“Recently I started seeing our effects on the environment completely come to the forefront” said Sohini Dasgupta principal design engineer at ON Semiconductors.

Two years ago she said the industry “was sitting on the fence in the middle of the pack saying: ‘Yes sustainability is important but we don’t know what to do with it’”. But now she sees movement: “Every day it pops up in our emails what our company’s doing what other companies are doing” she said.

The rise of ethical investing has helped according to Mark Li a semiconductor analyst at the investment firm Bernstein. Fund managers increasingly market “green funds” and investors are asking more questions about companies’ environmental social and governance (ESG) impact. “Over the last three years the voice of ESG investment is much louder than before” Li said. Ultimately this changes how companies behave he added.

Greater availability of renewable energy is helping chipmakers reduce their carbon footprint. Intel made a commitment to source 100% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 as did TSMC but with a deadline of 2050.

Energy consumption accounts for 62% of TSMC’s emissions said a company spokesperson Nina Kao. The company signed a 20-year deal last year with the Danish energy firm Ørsted buying all the energy from a 920-megawatt offshore windfarm Ørsted is building in the Taiwan Strait.

The deal which has been described as the world’s largest corporate renewables purchase agreement has benefits for TSMC said Shashi Barla renewables analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. As well as guaranteeing a clean electricity supply it pays a wholesale cost and removes itself from price shocks “killing two birds with one stone” he said.

TSMC’s actions have the potential to influence the rest of the industry said Clifton Fonstad professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT “other manufacturers are likely to follow its lead”.

As well as switching to renewables chipmakers could also implement efficiencies in fabs said Peter Hanbury a semiconductor manufacturing expert at the management consultancy Bain & Company. A chip fab is basically “a gigantic warehouse with a clean room inside” he said and to cut emissions “the easy part is the facility itself”.

Fabs could be more efficient in regulating air and water temperature humidity and pressure. They could segment warehouses so one production line had high pressure and another lower using less energy than keeping the entire warehouse at a high pressure.

They could capture more data and use machine learning to turn tools off when they weren’t being used said Huili Grace Xing an engineering professor at Cornell University who works on semiconductor materials.

There is also innovation aimed at tackling the worst-polluting materials used in making semiconductors. The chip industry uses different gases during the production process many of which have a significant climate impact.

Chip companies make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost they can afford it Mark Li semiconductor analyst

TSMC said it had implemented scrubbers and other facilities to treat gas emissions. But another route is replacing “dirtier” cleaning gases that clean the delicate tools in semiconductor manufacturing said Michael Pittroff a chemical engineer working on semiconductor gases at Solvay Special Chemicals.

In industrial tests over the last six years with about a half dozen chipmaker clients Pittroff said he and his team had replaced more polluting gases with “cleaner” fluorine with a lower global warming impact.

Other companies target the gases that are used to etch patterns onto and clean the silicon surface of a wafer – the thin piece of material used to make semiconductors. Paris-based industrial gases company Air Liquide for example has come up with a line of alternative etching gases with lower global warming impacts.

But replacing gases will be a challenge: anything that touches the silicon wafer such as an etching gas is really hard to alter once a fab is operating said Hanbury. The process involves a huge amount of precision. Fabs have to place up to 100m transistors on a postage-stamp sized wafer and need to do it perfectly. It takes four to five years for fabs to develop a recipe for this and “once you set it you basically never want to change it” Hanbury said.

Some experts believe chipmakers will start to modify their processes to incorporate greener gases especially if the big players make a move. “If TSMC switches I am sure the others will” said Fonstad. “If TSMC doesn’t then other manufacturers may switch to show they are better than TSMC.”

To some observers of the chip business the determination to clean up the industry seems real. The vast demand for chips at the moment will only help the semiconductor industry embrace sustainability goals said Li.

“They have very good margins and make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost they can afford it. And increasingly customers are willing to pay more for a greener device” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

All in all the preponderance of the anecdotal evidence points to the fact that the lifetime experiences education and skills acquired in the Diaspora by these African Technical professionals have been a net benefit and gain for their native countries. Many have resettled back home. Most have maintained a habit of frequent productive and impactful engagement with their home countries even while they remain outside Africa. This article attempts to demonstrate that claim.

The paper is a brief extract from a small section of the author’s comprehensive and riveting “Book of Autobiographical Memoirs” which is to be released before the end of this year.

During the 1970s and 1980s in the Boston-Cambridge area in Massachusetts there was a group of us Africans all of us recent foreign student graduates in engineering especially electrical electronics and computer science programs from various American Universities. We saw our experience role benefit and future in the Boston electronics revolution and the “Massachusetts miracle” as something that would be of tremendous benefit to the future of our native countries. We would definitely “return home” to build technology in Africa and enhance economic growth.

Massachusetts and the U.S. were going through an unprecedented rapid economic growth. This was brought about by high technology and high finance. As newly-minted engineers from Africa we were building up skills knowhow and nurturing our talents in order to go back and build our individual African countries with Science Technology and Entrepreneurship.

There were only about 25 of us such close-nit African engineers working for High Technology Companies in the Boston-Cambridge metropolitan areas and within 50 miles radius mostly along the legendary Massachusetts Route 128 Electronics highway. We were working mostly in the electronics and computer industry.

Our numbers( at least the ones I knew personally) included about ten Ghanaians four Nigerians two Cameroonians one from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one from Kenya. These were a group of highly educated Engineers. Examples were Nigerians: O. Mobisson(MIT) M. Uzomaka(MIT) and A. Ozumba; Ghanaians: K. Acquah(Syracuse) R. Baafi(UConn LeHigh U) A. Kyei-Badu(UConn) N. Quaynor(Dartmouth SUNY Stony Brook) A. Ebo Richardson(Yale CWRU) Y. Sakyi(WPI) W. Taylor(Lowell Tech.) S. Agyepong K. Edzie M. Adam(CWRU Harvard) J.Cruickshank(U.C. Berkeley Iowa State U.) K. Keteku(Dartmouth) K. Otieku(Northeastern U) M. Yankson(Northeastern U.); Cameroonians: S.Y.Kwankam(CWRU Northeastern U.) B. Mbida(Princeton Harvard); Congolese: K. Pembamoto(SUNY Buffalo).

Most of us worked for the big High Tech Boston Companies as well as for the numerous small but dynamic and rapidly growing electronics and Computer Start-up companies. Among the companies we worked for were Polaroid Digital Equipment GTE Sylvania Labs Data General Raytheon Analogic Analog Devices General Electric Gillette Anderson Little IBM Equipment Instrumentation Laboratories. The twin Cities of Cambridge and Boston with their powerhouse universities MIT Harvard Boston Univ Northeaster Univ. were in the drivers’ seat of the high tech bullet train.

Our desire to eventually go back to build technology in Africa was extremely high. Some among us even developed their own High Tech Start-up companies. O. Mobisson M. Uzomaka and A. Ozumba from Nigeria started “Modatron Co.” initially to design and produce state of the art FM Radios incorporating modern digital components. With the arrival of and excitement over microprocessors( Intel 4004 8008 8080) ushering in the microcomputer revolution Modatron changed over to designing inexpensive microcomputer boards. A. Kyei-Badu worked closely with O. Mobisson at Modatron. Y. Sakyi started and successfully ran “Codatech Media Co” for Distribution and Training for Computer Equipment and peripherals. R. Baafi formed “Codatech Systems”. S. Agyepong(Hewlett Packard) and Kojo Edzie settled in the same office in Lexington and developed housing management software for housing agencies in Massachusetts New York New Jersey and Connecticut.

True to our aspirations and after decades of education and practical industrial experience in the U.S most of us made good on our goal of returning home to Africa to develop technology. O. Mobisson went back to Eastern Nigeria and had a successful career as an academician and an industrialist. He helped found Anambra State University of Science and Technology(ASUTECH). There he set up the Industrial Development Center(IDC) where they achieved the milestone of—the first commercially produced line of personal computers and servers in Nigeria( and possibly first in Africa). As a University Professor he developed and manufactured microcomputers in Nigeria. Ghanaian A. Kyei-Badu went back to Ghana and had many decades of fruitful professional and entrepreneurial life developing computer software in Ghana Nigeria and in East Africa. Subsequently he joined O. Mobisson in Enugu Nigeria to start the Computer Science Department at Anambra State and also to continue on the computer project. Prior to going to Enugu Kyei-Badu was recruited by famed Ghanaian Physicist and Mathematician Professor Francis Kofi Ampenyin Allotey to the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology(KNUST) where he taught Computer Science. Ghanaian S. Agyepong also later went to teach at KNUST.

Dr.S.Y. Kwankam having obtained a PhD from Northeastern University went back to Cameroon and had a brilliant career as Professor and Head of Electrical Engineering at the University of Yaounde. He built up a strong practical hands-on program at the University of Yaounde Cameroon. After serving his country Cameroon for twenty-three years he established a consulting career with World health Organization( WHO) as an eHealth expert. Serving within WHO in Geneva Switzerland he undertook many eHealth( telemedicine) projects to extend healthcare to remote areas in developing countries such as Zimbabwe Ghana and South Africa. He personally travelled to such countries to direct the projects.

Another Cameroonian B. Mbida having obtained an MBA from Harvard after Engineering from Princeton went back to Cameroon and became Managing Director of EssoCam Oil Company.

Dr. N. Quaynor went back to Ghana and built a successful start-up enterprise in Computer Networking. He founded Network Computer Systems. He is considered the Father of the Internet in Africa. He helped establish the Computer Science Department at Cape Coast University and is currently Professor of Computer Science there.

Dr. K. Pembamoto went back to the Congo and served many years as Professor of Computers and an Industrial Consultant. R. Baafi a Ghanaian went to Cameroon to develop his Software Development Company Codatech Systems. After coming back to the U.S. he still stayed engaged in supporting Science and Technology skills advancement in Ghana. He and his wife Bea have built a very fine K-12 Science-based School named “Novastar Academy” in Accra Ghana. For decades R. Baafi has been a tireless and an ardent supporter of Science and many other projects at his Ghanaian Secondary School Alma Mater Adisadel College. He helped found U.S.-based Adisadel Foundation which has raised funds to support many projects at Adisadel.

M. B. Adam after obtaining an MBA from Harvard(after his engineering degree from Case western Reserve University) returned to Ghana. He became Factory Manager for “Nestles Corporation”(Food Specialties Ghana Ltd). K. Keteku(Dartmouth) went to Ghana and built a successful Civil Engineering career.

And last but not least I ( yes yours truly) on my part have for decades been involved in several major initiatives having to do with technology transfer and technical skills development in Ghana and Nigeria. I settled in Benin City Nigeria from 1982 to 1985 to develop technology on the West African Coast. I took up an appointment as a University Lecturer in Electrical Engineering at the University of Benin. The extensive and breathtaking details of my professional and family activities and experiences in Nigeria have been fully chronicled in the upcoming book.

Another project of which I have been a part is the push by a group of Ghanaian Scientists Engineers Technologists Economists Academicians Management and Policy Professionals resident in the United States and in Ghana to form a strong Ghana-Diaspora network and a working group towards “bridging the technology gap between Ghana and the rest of the developed world”.

The project started when two Ghanaian Engineers Dr. Joe Cruickshank( lead author) and I co-wrote and published a paper entitled “ Ghana: Bridging the Technology Gap;

Why we are where we are and what we need to do “.(See “Mordern Ghana” Online News Magazine March 18 2018). The contents of the paper led to a major one week intensive Science and Technology Conference in Ghana at the Peduase Lodge(Aburi) at which the President of Ghana His Excellency Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo was the Keynote Speaker.

The idea of a full one week conference to explore further and in detail the ideas in the paper and to develop concrete actionable strategies for their implementation was the brainchild of Ghana’s Elder Statesman and renowned Economist Mr. Kwame Pianim. More importantly he was able to get Master Card Foundation to sponsor the conference. Full expenses were covered for certain designated key invited conference participants especially those of us who travelled from outside Ghana most from the United States. The conference was then organized by the Ghana Institution of Engineering(GhIE). Ing Dr. Kwame Boakye( former president of GhIE) and Ing Akwasi P. Osei both of them based in Ghana worked assiduously with GhIE to plan coordinate and execute the conference. It was flawless.

The “Peduase Conference” was a major success. It brought together about one hundred Ghanaian Science and Technology experts about one quarter of whom were invited from outside Ghana. For the first time in the history of Ghana and in Africa a strong network of Africa-Diaspora Scientists and Engineers was established. This network would champion the idea of creating manufacturing hubs for commercializing Ghana’s scientific and technological inventions prototyped gadgets and equipment from Ghana’s educational institutions. In furthering the long overdue concept of a strong global network of Ghanaian Technical professionals GhIE and MESTI(Ministry of Environment Science Technology and Innovation) under its Minister Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng planned to develop a global database of Ghanaian Technology experts and professionals.

Another positive outcome of the conference was the opportunity that the Conference offered Ghanaian High Educational Institutions and even some Secondary Schools to strengthen their bond with Diaspora-based experienced Ghanaian professionals and academicians. For example through targeted interactions at the conference all three of Ghana’s premier Universities namely Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology(KNUST) University of Ghana Legon and University of Cape Coast(UCC) were able to develop ways to collaborate more effectively with Diaspora Ghanaians.

For example KNUST College of Engineering has a World Bank-sponsored five-year “Engineering Education Program”( for improving postgraduate enrollment for Masters and PhD students and for upgrading research so as to more heavily impact the industrial technological and economic advancement of Ghana). The project is officially designated as “KEEP”(KNUST Engineering Education Program”). KEEP has established an Industrial Advisory Board(IAB) and an International Scientific Advisory Board(ISAB). Both Boards recruited some Ghanaians from abroad ( who happened to be at the Peduase Conference) to serve on the Boards. In the case of ISAB I was invited to be the Chair of that Board and two other Ghanaians on that Board are U.S.-based Ghanaians who attended the Peduase Conference! The two others are Dr. Joe Cruickshank ( the lead author on the “Ghana: Bridging the Technology Gap” paper) and Ing. Dr. Richard Okine. For the IAB at least one of the Board members was a U.S. resident Ghanaian who attended the Peduase Conference. That is Dr. Victor Atiemo-Obeng.

KEEP ISAB has accomplished a great deal guiding the project through ZOOM Virtual meetings with the official team members of KEEP on the ground in Kumasi Ghana. About eight Virtual Meetings have been held in two years in which ISAB members participated from California(ISAB Chair Prof. Richardson) Wisconsin( Dr. Cruickshank) Michigan( Prof. Asumadu) Delaware(Dr. Okine) Norway( two members Prof. Kleppe and Prof. Adaramola) and in Ghana( Prof. Nyarko Prof. Kponyo Provost Prof. Adom-Asamoah Mr. Marfo other Profs and Lecturers)

The Peduase Conference similarly provided a perfect opportunity for several of us attendees from the Unites States to reconnect and deepen our collaborative efforts with the School of Engineering Science University of Ghana Legon as well as with College of Sciences at the University of Cape Coast. The AYASPAU team of Atiemo-Obeng Koram Osseo-Asare and Richardson’s have Legon projects where they donated more than two hundred brand new engineering textbooks for a reference library and have fully sponsored a Masters Degree student in Biomedical Engineering.

The author’s upcoming book of ‘Autobiographical Memoirs” will include extensive narratives covering the topics in this paper  along with the personal and family life story of the author.

The helicopter-launched Nag Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) Helina being developed indigenously has completed all trials and the process for issuing of Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) by the Army has started said Dr. Sachin Sood Project Director of Helina and Dhruvastra at the Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) Hyderabad a laboratory of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).

“The launcher and missile are ready. There are some Human Machine Interface (HMI) to be realised which are going on now” Dr. Sood told The Hindu . While the cost estimate is yet to be done each missile is expected to cost under ₹1 crore and initially around 500 missiles and 40 launchers will be required he says.

Also Read: Helina Dhruvastra ATGMs successfully test fired

Once the AoN is issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued. Some firing trials will be done from the first production lot by the Army at a later stage.

Helina is a third generation fire and forget class ATGM mounted on an indigenous Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) and has a minimum range of 500 m and a maximum range of 7 km. All issues with the minimum range have been sorted out and the integration with other weapons on the platform is over according to Dr. Sood.

Stating that the Air Force had asked for feasibility of integrating the Helina on the soon-to-be inducted Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) Dr. Sood said this would be done and would bring in economies of scale in the production of the missile. “There is also very good export potential” he said.

For that the platforms on which it can be integrated have to be identified. The possibilities of exports were discussed with the Secretary Defence Production as well when he visited the India pavilion at the Army-2021 expo in Moscow last month.

Live firing

Talking of the trials in February during which live firing was carried out Dr. Sood said that for the first time firing from maximum forward speed from a moving target an ALH was demonstrated as also targeting from a top angle. “Final configuration with warhead demonstrated good penetration into the target. Other operational missions like minimum range were also demonstrated” he said on the trials.

All the capabilities of the seeker a critical part of the missile were checked and cleared. In one mission the target was acquired at a range of 7 km and was fired on at 6 km range he said. During these trails the stability of the platform and the separation of the missile from it had also been demonstrated.

On the difference between Nag ATGM of the Army and Helina which is air-launched Dr. Sood said they had different firing mechanisms as the latter had increased range. “It is a fire and forget missile. Once the Electro-Optic (EO) system of ALH identifies the target it automatically hands over target to the missile. It is lock-on before launch” he explained.

While the missile was developed by the DRDO the integration on ALH was done by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) is the production agency. During the last trial BDL teams were involved and their teams were now being trained Dr. Sood said.

Private industry

Majority of the missile is indigenous with significant sourcing from the private industry. For instance the launcher rocket motors and onboard power supply on the missile are manufactured by Hyderabad-based companies propulsion by the Ordnance Factory Bhandara control system by the Research Centre Imarat warhead jointly by the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) and the Ordnance Factory Board and seeker by the Bharat Electronics Limited Machilipatnam and BDL. “The supply chain has been established” Dr. Sood said.

Parallelly an Air Force version Dhruvastra was also under development for which some trials had already been conducted. It would have an Air to Ground role other than anti-tank role Dr. Sood added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This week’s interview was conducted by John Simons Executive Editor at TIME.

Can you imagine people were worried about this guy?

Prior to taking over officially as CEO of Apple from co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011 Tim Cook was known in tech circles as a quiet tactician skilled at driving operational efficiency. But at the time many pundits worried that Cook wouldn’t be able match his predecessor’s charisma and carnival-barker showmanship.

Those doubts have faded with every new height the company hit and Apple’s investors certainly have few complaints. Their shares have ballooned more than 1000% since Cook took over and the iPhone maker surpassed oil giant Saudi Aramco this year to become the world’s most valuable company.

Still Cook insists it’s not just about the numbers. In an interview with TIME he said that it’s important for Apple to lead not only in innovation but also in efforts to make the world a safer more equitable place.

The past year hasn’t been an easy one for the world’s most valuable company. In September alone critics knocked Apple’s recently revealed iPhone 13 for being too iterative a federal judge ordered the company to substantially change its App Store as part of an antitrust lawsuit brought by Fortnite maker Epic Games and it delayed software aimed at fighting child pornography after privacy experts raised concerns about the company’s plan to scan users’ iCloud accounts for illegal content.

Cook played a starring role in App Store courtroom proceedings defending the company on the witness stand in part by arguing that Apple excludes rival app stores from the iPhone not to garner additional revenue but to ensure user security. “We’re not thinking about the money at all we’re thinking about the user” he told the judge in an Oakland Calif. courtroom in May.

Those words—“…not thinking about the money”—would surely illicit groans and eye-rolls coming from any other millionaire CEO but uttered by Cook with a good dose of serene Southern charm they have potential to melt anyone’s icy skepticism. In our 2021 TIME100 issue Phil Knight co-founder and chairman emeritus of Nike confirms that the Cook we see in public is the same man behind boardroom doors. Knight praises Cook’s wisdom and good judgement writing: “What separates the good from the great are intangibles such as character compassion courage—adjectives that apply to Tim.”

Those qualities helped Cook earn the honor of being selected as a 2021 TIME100 honoree—and they were all on display when I spoke with Cook recently about his thoughts on leadership corporate values and the tech that really excites him.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

You just hit a big milestone recently a decade as chief executive. Have you changed the way you manage in that time? Have you learned anything new in your role as CEO?

Maybe the top thing I’ve learned is that I still have so much more to learn. I learned very quickly to remember that I had two ears and only one mouth and to listen very carefully to people that I’m surrounding myself with because I have some of the best and brightest people around me. And they’re smarter than I am. And we’re able to solve some really big issues and big problems by working together.

The pandemic itself in this last 18 months has taught me that we’re not always in control of our destiny. We have to adapt and be flexible and agile and move and learn very quickly. If you were to have told me 18 months ago that we would still be sitting here today I would never have guessed all the things we did accomplish over that course of time.

It’s become very popular among CEOs to talk about something called stakeholder capitalism–companies committing to doing better by their workers by their customers and by the environment. Apple has been talking about these issues for a long time. Do you think it’s important now for companies and for business leaders to be upfront about where they stand on political and social issues?

Our values are infused deeply into the company. And so as you point out we’ve been talking about the environment for decades. Our goals have changed and the activities have changed around those. They’ve gotten much bolder. But we’ve always cared deeply about the environment. We’ve always cared deeply about workers. We’ve set the highest standards for workers in our supply chain of anybody in the industry. We’ve always cared deeply about our employees. They’re my most important constituency.

We’re in a period of time where some of the biggest problems of the world like climate change as just one example this is not going to get solved solely by government. This needs other constituencies and other stakeholders to move in the same direction and have public/private partnerships. Diversity and inclusion racial equity and injustice these are all things that we need the whole of society moving forward on.

And so I think it’s more important than ever. I think more people expect it today as well and I applaud that. I’m glad that our customers are expecting it our employees are expecting it. And I see that happening across the industry and in many other industries. And I think it’s great for society in general.

How do you ensure that Apple is at the forefront of the latest ideas in those areas and stays part of the public conversation?

We pride ourselves in innovation. We’re always challenging ourselves to up our ante in environment as just one example. If you look at[…]our journey on environment we started with eliminating toxics. Years later we ran our company on 100% renewable energy being carbon neutral as a company. And now we’ve set a much bolder objective by 2030 to have our entire carbon footprint go away. This is not only the part within our company which we control today but also our supply chain and also our product usage at our customers. This is an incredibly bold objective. And we evolve and set these more bold and ambitious objectives as time goes on.

Why do you feel like it’s important for Apple to remain a part of the public conversation around issues of equity the environment and so on? Is it important for the business? Is it important for just the general image of the company?

It’s nothing to do with image and so forth. It’s about we’re a collection of people in Apple that want to change the world for the better. We want to leave the world better than we found it. And to do that you have to be a part of the conversation in areas where the policies of government intersect with your values. Racial equity and justice is a part of that. Diversity and inclusion is a part of that. Environment is a part of that. Supplier responsibility is a part of that.

All of these things are key in terms of the way that we present ourselves. And probably more importantly we can be a ripple in the pond on these things. So we can create a change that is much broader than any of us could individually do ourselves. If we stop changing the world or are stopped trying to put our ding in the universe so to speak I don’t think people would want to work here anymore.

Where do you think your personal comfort level with espousing these issues comes from? This is not something you learned in business school.

Yeah. You’re exactly right. There was no course on this at least at the time I was in business school. I’m not sure I can totally answer your question but I think it’s rooted in the way I was brought up. In what I saw going on at the time I was being brought up.

Martin Luther King was killed in 1968. I was 8 years old at the time. There were all kinds of racial equity and justice issues in the environment at that time. As I got older and understood the environmental issues you don’t have to look beyond yesterday or the day before to see the latest storms and the latest floods and the devastation that it’s causing. And it’s causing it disproportionately to people in need. So I think all of these things. And of course my background as a gay American as well has a lot to do with that. You learn to speak up about these things.

Let’s jump to a bit of technology talk. Apple recently made privacy a big part of the sales proposition for buying the company’s products. Why is this an important push—and should we expect to see more along these lines?

Well we believe privacy is a basic human right. It starts with that. And we believe that privacy is one of the most consequential issues of our time. I mean it’s right up there near the top of the list of things. And we see every day people’s privacy being taken for granted and them losing control. And we’re all about giving the user transparency and control.

We’ve come out with so many different features over time. This year we came out with application tracking transparency. Where if apps want to track you across apps they have to get your permission. It sounds really simple but it’s pretty profound in terms of how the internet actually works. We came out with a privacy “nutrition label” for the app store where an app has to describe what information they’re collecting and why they’re collecting it. Again it sounds simple but it’s a profound change. We’re working for the user. It’s not about a marketing slogan or a way to sell things. It’s a core value of ours.

Beyond Apple just looking out there on the technology landscape what excites you about innovations that you’re seeing today?

I get really jazzed about AI. AI today is in a number of products that you don’t really think about.

If you just take from us from the way that we’re recognizing your face to your fingerprint. The way that we’re grouping photos together the way that Siri works. I mean AI is everywhere. And I see that we’re at the very early stages of what it can do for people and how it can make people’s lives easier.

I am really stoked about [augmented reality] and what AR can bring. And the overlay of the virtual world with the real world. But in a way that is not distracting from the physical world and your physical relationships. But enhancing your relationships enhancing your collaboration.

Is that what some people are calling the metaverse?

There’s clearly different words out there; I’ll stay away from the buzzwords. We just call it augmented reality. But I am super excited about these things. I believe that technology can do so much good in the world. And of course it depends on the creator and whether they thought through the ways it can be used and misused.

But mainly I am so optimistic about all the things that can happen in our lives that free up time for more leisure activities and other things that we want to do in life.

Barriers To China Mobile Deal Disappearing,"Things are looking up for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s ability to cement a deal with China Mobile the world’s largest carrier. Many investors see a deal with the carrier as being an important step in Apple’s ability to gain ground in the rapidly growing market.

Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook met with the chief of China Mobile last month. The two were undoubtedly working toward the long-awaited deal that would give Apple access to 740 million more mobile subscribers.

Apple expected to release low cost iPhone

Lee Chyen Yee and Yimou Lee of Reuters report that one of the key ingredients in a deal between China Mobile and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the long-rumored low cost iPhone. The company is expected to unveil the handset next month.

According to Reuters Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s use of chips made by QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) also give it a leg up in China because those chips will work on China’s networks which are different than those found in other countries. So far the company has not signed a deal with China Mobile because it would have required that the iPhone be redesigned so that it could work on the carrier’s TD-SCDMA 3G technology.

The other big barrier to a deal between the two companies has been China Mobile’s hesitance to pay the large costs associated with subsidizing and marketing the iPhone.

4G licenses could help Apple

Chinese officials are expected to begin handing out 4G licenses by the end of this year and China Mobile could be first in line to receive one of those licenses because of its size. Those licenses are expected to be based on TD-LTE technology which by QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM)’s chips are compatible with. As such it would prevent Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from having to redesign the iPhone so that it would work on the carrier’s network.

Apple’s sales in China slumped by 43 percent in the June quarter compared to the March quarter as mid-range Chinese companies zeroed in on customers on their home turf. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s smartphone market share in the country has been almost cut in half since last year and is now under 5 percent according to research firm Canalys.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYXUuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHBsZS10ZWQtbGFzc28tc25hZ3MtdHdvLTAwMjUxNzc3Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple's 'Ted Lasso' Emmy Wins Give Boost to Streaming Strategy,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s “Ted Lasso” a show about a U.S. football coach who moves to England to lead a soccer team was crowned television’s best comedy a breakthrough for the giant tech company’s efforts to build its Apple TV+ service.

Many Hollywood figures have expressed skepticism about Apple’s foray into entertainment. It hasn’t acquired a catalog of shows to fill out its library for Apple TV+ and it has been wary of igniting controversy with its programs. Yet the company is dominating one category at the TV industry’s biggest annual gala less than two years after introducing the service.

Sudeikis plays a college football coach who takes over a Premier League soccer team. Waddingham portrays a scheming team owner and Goldstein a once-star player who is past his prime. Both Waddingham and Goldstein were relative unknowns in Hollywood before the show an uplifting comedy that struck a chord with viewers and critics during the dark days of the pandemic.

The 73rd Emmy Awards shaped up as a major battleground for a new generation of streaming services with shows produced by AT&T Inc.’s HBO Max Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video Apple and Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+ competing with Netflix Inc. the leader in streaming.

The awards handed out by the Television Academy are considered the highest honors in the TV business. The annual show isn’t watched by as many people as the Oscars or the Grammys and awards programs in general have been losing viewers in recent years. Still wins can provide a publicity boost particularly for new services looking to acquire subscribers and attract talent.

Comedian Cedric the Entertainer is hosting the show which is airing live on both CBS and Paramount+. The academy is putting on an in-person ceremony at the L.A. Live entertainment district in downtown Los Angeles. Last year the academy held a smaller ceremony delivering the statuettes to winners at their homes.

“They said this was outdoors; it’s not” actor Seth Rogen joked in presenting the first award. “Why is there a roof? It’s more important we have chandeliers than we make sure we don’t kill Eugene Levy.”

“Ted Lasso” was nominated for 20 Emmys the most ever for a first-year comedy and was the favorite to capture best comedy series. The show is Apple’s first big breakout hit in terms of critical plaudits social media conversation and industry prestige and the wins Sunday night should drive more customers to Apple TV+ the iPhone maker’s paid streaming service. Produced by Warner Bros.’ TV studio “Ted Lasso” just concluded its second season and has been renewed for at least one more.

Demand is booming for silicon chips which are embedded in everything from smartphones and televisions to wind turbines but it comes at a big cost: a huge carbon footprint.

The industry presents a paradox. Meeting global climate goals will in part rely on semiconductors. They’re integral to electric vehicles solar arrays and wind turbines. But chip manufacturing also contributes to the climate crisis. It requires huge amounts of energy and water – a chip fabrication plant or fab can use millions of gallons of water a day – and creates hazardous waste.

As the semiconductor industry finds itself increasingly under the spotlight it is starting to grapple with its climate impacts. Last week Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company the world’s largest chipmaker which supplies chips to Apple pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The company aims to “broaden our green influence and drive the industry towards low-carbon sustainability” said the TSMC chairman Mark Lui.

But decarbonizing the industry will be a big challenge.

TSMC alone uses almost 5% of all Taiwan’s electricity according to figures from Greenpeace predicted to rise to 7.2% in 2022 and it used about 63m tons of water in 2019. The company’s water use became a controversial topic during Taiwan’s drought this year the country’s worst in a half century which pitted chipmakers against farmers.

In the US a single fab Intel’s 700-acre campus in Ocotillo Arizona produced nearly 15000 tons of waste in the first three months of this year about 60% of it hazardous. It also consumed 927m gallons of fresh water enough to fill about 1400 Olympic swimming pools and used 561m kilowatt-hours of energy.

Chip manufacturing rather than energy consumption or hardware use “accounts for most of the carbon output” from electronics devices the Harvard researcher Udit Gupta and co-authors wrote in a 2020 paper.

A global shortage of high-end chips as the pandemic boosted demand for electronics and Covid outbreaks closed fabs has increased focus on the industry.

In a tight market automakers found themselves at the back of the chip queue far behind much bigger-scale semiconductor customers such as Apple who use the chips to give computing power to their smartphones laptops and other devices. GM halted production in several of its North American factories this month while Toyota said it would cut its carmaking by 40% in September.

In an attempt to increase production many countries are embarking on big programs to boost the industry.

The Chips for America Act proposes $52bn in funding over five years for the US semiconductor industry. The EU has forwarded its own legislation aimed at increasing its share of the global chips market to 20% by 2030. The European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen called it “a matter of tech sovereignty” in her State of the European Union address last week.

These ambitions line up a potential clash with international climate goals. Both the EU and US aim to get halfway to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. And as the semiconductor industry grows so too will its carbon footprint.

However amid pressure from investors and electronics makers keen to report greener supply chains to customers the semiconductor business has been ramping up action on tackling its climate footprint.

“Recently I started seeing our effects on the environment completely come to the forefront” said Sohini Dasgupta principal design engineer at ON Semiconductors.

Two years ago she said the industry “was sitting on the fence in the middle of the pack saying: ‘Yes sustainability is important but we don’t know what to do with it’”. But now she sees movement: “Every day it pops up in our emails what our company’s doing what other companies are doing” she said.

The rise of ethical investing has helped according to Mark Li a semiconductor analyst at the investment firm Bernstein. Fund managers increasingly market “green funds” and investors are asking more questions about companies’ environmental social and governance (ESG) impact. “Over the last three years the voice of ESG investment is much louder than before” Li said. Ultimately this changes how companies behave he added.

Greater availability of renewable energy is helping chipmakers reduce their carbon footprint. Intel made a commitment to source 100% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 as did TSMC but with a deadline of 2050.

Energy consumption accounts for 62% of TSMC’s emissions said a company spokesperson Nina Kao. The company signed a 20-year deal last year with the Danish energy firm Ørsted buying all the energy from a 920-megawatt offshore windfarm Ørsted is building in the Taiwan Strait.

The deal which has been described as the world’s largest corporate renewables purchase agreement has benefits for TSMC said Shashi Barla renewables analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. As well as guaranteeing a clean electricity supply it pays a wholesale cost and removes itself from price shocks “killing two birds with one stone” he said.

TSMC’s actions have the potential to influence the rest of the industry said Clifton Fonstad professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT “other manufacturers are likely to follow its lead”.

As well as switching to renewables chipmakers could also implement efficiencies in fabs said Peter Hanbury a semiconductor manufacturing expert at the management consultancy Bain & Company. A chip fab is basically “a gigantic warehouse with a clean room inside” he said and to cut emissions “the easy part is the facility itself”.

Fabs could be more efficient in regulating air and water temperature humidity and pressure. They could segment warehouses so one production line had high pressure and another lower using less energy than keeping the entire warehouse at a high pressure.

They could capture more data and use machine learning to turn tools off when they weren’t being used said Huili Grace Xing an engineering professor at Cornell University who works on semiconductor materials.

There is also innovation aimed at tackling the worst-polluting materials used in making semiconductors. The chip industry uses different gases during the production process many of which have a significant climate impact.

Chip companies make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost they can afford it Mark Li semiconductor analyst

TSMC said it had implemented scrubbers and other facilities to treat gas emissions. But another route is replacing “dirtier” cleaning gases that clean the delicate tools in semiconductor manufacturing said Michael Pittroff a chemical engineer working on semiconductor gases at Solvay Special Chemicals.

In industrial tests over the last six years with about a half dozen chipmaker clients Pittroff said he and his team had replaced more polluting gases with “cleaner” fluorine with a lower global warming impact.

Other companies target the gases that are used to etch patterns onto and clean the silicon surface of a wafer – the thin piece of material used to make semiconductors. Paris-based industrial gases company Air Liquide for example has come up with a line of alternative etching gases with lower global warming impacts.

But replacing gases will be a challenge: anything that touches the silicon wafer such as an etching gas is really hard to alter once a fab is operating said Hanbury. The process involves a huge amount of precision. Fabs have to place up to 100m transistors on a postage-stamp sized wafer and need to do it perfectly. It takes four to five years for fabs to develop a recipe for this and “once you set it you basically never want to change it” Hanbury said.

Some experts believe chipmakers will start to modify their processes to incorporate greener gases especially if the big players make a move. “If TSMC switches I am sure the others will” said Fonstad. “If TSMC doesn’t then other manufacturers may switch to show they are better than TSMC.”

To some observers of the chip business the determination to clean up the industry seems real. The vast demand for chips at the moment will only help the semiconductor industry embrace sustainability goals said Li.

“They have very good margins and make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost they can afford it. And increasingly customers are willing to pay more for a greener device” he said."

The infrared image was taken using a lidar camera. (Courtesy: Jacob Rada)

A structural colour technology that produces concentric rainbows could help autonomous vehicles read road signs scientists in the US and China claim. As well as exploring the physics of these novel reflective surfaces the researchers show that they can produce two different image signals at the same time. Autopilot systems that read both signals would be less likely to misinterpret altered road signs they suggest.

Car autopilot systems use infrared laser-based light detection and ranging (lidar) systems to scan their environment and recognize traffic situations. But these systems cannot recognise traffic signs. To read signs autonomous vehicles rely on visible cameras and pattern recognition algorithms.

In recent years researchers have demonstrated that these visual systems can be fooled by physically hacked or damaged road signs. Placing stickers on stop and speed limit signs resulted in some autopilot systems misidentifying them as faster speed limit signs. This could cause cars to accelerate when they should be slowing down.

“The challenge for those artificial intelligent systems is that the signal for them to identify the traffic sign is limited in a conventional traffic sign” explains optical engineer Qiaoqiang Gan from the University at Buffalo. “They only rely on the visible pattern.”

Structural colour: White light reflected by microscale concave interfaces produces concentric rainbows. (Courtesy: Jacob Rada)

Gan and his colleagues think they may have a solution. In 2019 they described a new reflective film that consists of a single layer of polymer microspheres on the sticky side of a transparent tape. These structures are known as microscale concave interfaces. When white light is shone on the film it produces multiple concentric rainbows.

“This phenomenon is very interesting and to our knowledge we cannot observe this type of multi rainbow from naturally existing materials” Gan tells Physics World.

The researchers initially thought that this material could be used to produce hyper-reflective road signs. These could be great at night as they would not need their own light source cutting energy consumption and light pollution. The colour of the reflection also changes when observed from different distances and angles. The team showed how this could be leveraged to create passive but smart road signs.

For example if someone was walking along a dark road towards a road sign and a fast-moving car with its headlights on approached from behind them the sign would change colour. This is because the distance and angle between the headlights and the sign changes relative to the pedestrian. For the driver however the colour of the sign stays the same as their position relative to the headlights is fixed. “This is an interesting optical phenomena to two different observers” Gan says. “One person will see a stable traffic sign; another will see colour changing. In a dark environment this might be helpful to alert this slowly moving pedestrian to pay attention.”

Alternatively if the sign has its own light source it appears to change colour to an approaching driver. This could be useful to alert them to particularly important signs.

Improved sign recognition

In their latest work published in Applied Materials Today Gan and his colleagues demonstrate how their earlier findings could be exploited to produce different visual and infrared signals. In a series of experiments they illuminated signs containing microscale concave interfaces with a fixed light source and scanned them with a moving visual camera and a lidar system. Echoing their earlier work the visual system saw a colour-changing sign as it shifted position relative to the light source. But as the lidar system moved with the infrared laser it saw a stable infrared image.

The researchers believe that if autopilot systems could use lidar to map these signs the simultaneous visible colour change and stable infrared image could significantly improve pattern recognition. Autonomous vehicles could then be less likely to misclassify damaged or altered road signs.

The researchers also probed the physics of the microscale concave interfaces. They found that depending on the angle at which the light enters the spheres it is reflected internally two or three times before exiting. This means that even a single light source produces beams of light that exit the spheres at a multitude of angles. These then interfere with each other creating the multiple rainbow ring pattern.

Gan tells Physics World that the team is now looking for collaborators to develop and test robotic systems to read the signs.",,,,,,,,,

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Une rentrée 100% masculine : seuls les collégiens et lycéens afghans étaient autorisés à reprendre le chemin de l’école samedi 18 septembre 2021. Une mesure déplorée par l’Unicef qui a exhorté le nouveau régime taliban à ne pas « laisser les filles de côté ».

Dix jours après la réouverture des universités privées du pays le ministère de l’Education a annoncé vendredi que « tous les professeurs hommes et les élèves » du secondaire allaient retrouver leur établissement sans faire aucune mention des enseignantes ou des collégiennes et lycéennes.

Crainte pour les droits des femmes

Ce flou risque d’alimenter un peu plus encore l’inquiétude d’une partie de la population afghane et de la communauté internationale qui redoutent de voir se reproduire le même scénario que lors du premier passage au pouvoir des fondamentalistes entre 1996 et 2001.

Le mouvement islamiste avait mené une politique particulièrement brutale à l’égard des femmes qui n’étaient pas autorisées à travailler étudier faire du sport ou encore sortir seules dans la rue.

Après le départ des talibans chassés par une coalition internationale emmenée par les Etats-Unis les femmes avaient progressivement pu récupérer leurs droits fondamentaux et accéder à des métiers qui leur avaient été interdits comme juge parlementaire ou encore pilote.

Près de 10 millions d’enfants scolarisés

« L’Unicef se félicite de la réouverture des écoles secondaires en Afghanistan mais souligne que les filles ne doivent pas être laissées de côté » a réagi vendredi la directrice exécutive de l’agence onusienne Henrietta Fore.

« Il est essentiel que toutes y compris les plus âgées puissent reprendre leur éducation sans plus de retard et que les enseignantes puissent elles aussi continuer à enseigner » a insisté l’Unicef dans un communiqué rappelant les « progrès considérables dans le pays au cours des deux dernières décennies ».

En l’espace de vingt ans le nombre d’écoles a triplé et le nombre d’enfants scolarisés est passé de 1 million à 95 millions selon l’agence onusienne.

Prévention du vice

Depuis leur retour au pouvoir les talibans ont tenté de rassurer la communauté internationale en assurant entre autres que les droits des femmes seraient respectés. Mais ces affirmations ont été fragilisées ces dernières semaines par plusieurs décisions prises par le nouvel exécutif afghan.

Les femmes conservent certes le droit d’étudier à l’université mais elles devront pour cela porter une abaya ainsi qu’un hijab et les cours se feront dans la mesure du possible en non-mixité. Aucune femme ne figure par ailleurs au sein du nouvel exécutif provisoire présenté début septembre.

Quant au ministère de la Promotion de la vertu et de la Prévention du vice craint pour son fondamentalisme durant le premier épisode taliban il semble désormais occuper les locaux de l’ancien ministère des Affaires féminines.

« Bavures » internationales

Un mois après la prise de Kaboul par les talibans les répliques des évacuations chaotiques qui avaient suivi l’arrivée du mouvement islamiste continuent de se faire sentir.

A Washington l’armée américaine a reconnu vendredi avoir tué dix civils afghans innocents dans une bavure « tragique » en frappant par erreur un véhicule qu’elle croyait rempli d’explosifs.

Le lendemain de cette frappe menée le 29 août la famille du conducteur du véhicule Ezmarai Ahmadi avait affirmé qu’il était employé par une ONG et que dix personnes dont une majorité d’enfants avaient été tuées.

Plus de 71 000 civils afghans et pakistanais ont été tués durant les 20 ans de la guerre en Afghanistan.

Démissions néerlandaises

Aux Pays-Bas c’est la ministre néerlandaise de la Défense Ank Bijleveld qui a annoncé sa démission après la gestion chaotique de l’évacuation d’Afghanistan emboîtant le pas à la cheffe de la diplomatie de son pays Sigrid Kaag.

Cette démission intervient au lendemain d’une motion déposée par des députés critiquant le gouvernement pour avoir entre autres échoué à évacuer certains Afghans.

Sur le plan diplomatique le président russe Vladimir Poutine a souhaité que l’Organisation de coopération de Shanghai (OCS) menée par Moscou et Pékin s’impose comme un partenaire des talibans afin qu’ils tiennent leurs promesses de lutte contre le « terrorisme ».

But because she was a stunt double galloping on horseback crashing cars and kicking down doors for the stars of films and television shows hers was not a household name.

In her heyday however Ms. Epper was ubiquitous. She hurtled through the air most weeks as Lynda Carter’s stunt double on the hit television series “Wonder Woman” and mimed Ms. Carter’s leggy lope. She tumbled through a scrum of mud and rocks as Kathleen Turner’s double in the 1984 comedy-adventure film “Romancing the Stone” which also starred Michael Douglas. She threw punches for Linda Evans in one of her many ballyhooed cat fights with Joan Collins on the frothy long-running 1980s nighttime soap opera “Dynasty.”

And in what she often said was her favorite stunt — or gag to use the industry term — Ms. Epper skidded a Corvette into a 180-degree turn as Shirley MacLaine’s character in “Terms of Endearment” (1983) neatly hurling Jack Nicholson’s double into the Gulf of Mexico.

Ms. Epper whose bruising career spanned 70 years died on Sunday at her home in Simi Valley Calif.

Burger chains chicken chains taco chains — all with their irresistible nobody-has-to-know drive-thru options.

And out of all those options the one we’re likely to be most frequently presented with is but of course McDonald’s.

Drive-thrus are a part of daily life and McDonald’s more than most — why avoid when you can make fast food work for you? Eric BVD – stock.adobe.com

And while the Golden Arches might seem like more of a hindrance than a help in the battle against excess pounds informed diners don’t have to be afraid to visit one of the world’s most ubiquitous restaurants — they just have to know how to order from the menu.

By using the same rules you’d use anywhere else — yes to lean proteins yes to veggies and don’t overeat — you’d be amazed how well you can do one expert explained.

Dietitian Kristen Carli owner of Camelback Nutrition & Wellness shared her go-to order with the fast food experts at Eat This Not That! — here are her picks for the best lunch order at McDonald’s for weight loss.

What to order at McDonald’s when you’re trying to lose weight

Keep it simple with a classic all-beef hamburger hold the high-calorie frills. McDonald's

“The best lunch order for weight loss is the McDonald’s Classic Burger with a side of apple slices and an unsweetened iced tea” Carli wrote.

“Opting for a basic burger such as a McDonald’s hamburger or cheeseburger provides protein and some carbohydrates without excess calories from cheese or mayo” she said.

“Choosing apple slices as a side adds fiber and natural sweetness without added sugars or fat. Selecting unsweetened tea keeps your drink calorie-free and helps you stay hydrated. This meal provides a great balance of protein carbohydrates and fiber which can help keep you satisfied while managing your calorie intake” the pro explained.

The meal tops off at just 250 calories believe it or not and packs a healthy 12 grams of protein — what Carli calls “your BFF for weight loss” and the “superhero of nutrients” for the way it fills you up helping you to avoid eating snacks between meals.

The apple slices instead of fries — and the unsweet tea instead of soda — makes this meal seem downright healthy.

Just make sure not to load the hamburger up with cheese and mayo and the like Carli warned — content yourself with onions pickle and ketchup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9ucy8yMDI0LzA1LzExL3VjbGEtcHJvdGVzdHMtcG9saWNlLWluYWN0aW9uLWZpZ2h0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Violence at UCLA protest raged for hours before police stepped in,"Faculty had raised alarms in the days before the attack on pro-Palestinian protesters. That night one witness called emergency services 11 times before police intervened.

Despite warnings of violence at UCLA police didn’t step in for over 3 hours

Late on April 30 Sean Tabibian called 911 to say police were needed urgently at the University of California at Los Angeles. “All hell had broken loose” Tabibian recalled in an interview. Masked agitators were attacking pro-Palestinian protesters on a campus quad video footage shows and a team of hired security guards had retreated.

The call at 11:09 p.m. was the first of 11 that Tabibian made to police that night as the violence escalated according to his cellphone’s call log. Other witnesses called 911 as well records show.

“They said they were responding” said Tabibian a local business executive and UCLA alumnus who was near campus around the time commotion erupted at the encampment and who said he was concerned that protesters had been discriminating against Jewish students. “They kept saying they’re responding they’re responding.”

While a small UCLA patrol could be seen in footage briefly early on law enforcement agencies did not move in to stop the violence until 3 hours and 34 minutes after Tabibian’s first 911 call a Washington Post examination has found — a delay that prolonged one of the most violent altercations since pro-Palestinian protesters began setting up encampments on college campuses across the country this spring.

The examination — based on evidence including more than 200 videos emergency radio transmissions text messages and interviews with more than a dozen witnesses — illuminates the stakes for university and local officials as they decide if and when to call police to deal with pro-Palestinian encampments. Elsewhere police have been accused of using heavy-handed tactics but at UCLA where university policy discourages calling police preemptively campus police as well as the Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol are facing scrutiny for their hands-off approach that night.

It’s not clear why police waited so long to respond. But in the hours before they took action at least 16 people were visibly injured the majority of them pro-Palestinian including two protesters who could be seen with blood streaking across their faces and soaking into their clothes videos and images show. The counterprotesters ignited at least six fireworks; struck protesters at least 20 times with wooden planks metal poles and other objects; and punched or kicked at least eight protesters.

The protesters occasionally fought back. People on both sides sprayed their opponents with chemical irritants at least 48 times — in some instances in the face at close range. Unconfirmed reports of a gunshot on campus and a man armed with a knife were relayed to officers over radio recordings show.

As the violence raged some police remained stationed at a hastily convened command post near the encampment while others assembled in formation closer to the violence but held back for an hour video shows. Authorities did not report making any arrests and a review by The Post of video footage found no indication attackers were detained.

Law enforcement’s tepid response on April 30 contrasts starkly with their aggressive maneuvers the following night when officers in riot gear some firing projectiles swiftly dismantled the UCLA camp and arrested 210 people for refusing to leave.

The Post’s examination also found that faculty had raised concerns for days about harassment of pro-Palestinian activists and physical violence directed at people in the protest encampment raising questions about whether the school should have had more police on hand to prevent an altercation.

Skip to end of carousel College protests over Gaza war Waves of antiwar protests are spreading across colleges campuses with growing police arrests as graduation season approaches. See the universities where protests are intensifying Are you a college student? Tell us about protests on your campus (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post) End of carousel The college is typically policed by its own small force and university officials must ask outside departments for extra help when they determine it’s needed. UCLA follows a systemwide University of California policy “not to request law enforcement involvement preemptively and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community” a spokeswoman said in a statement last month after protesters established their encampment. While LAPD would not answer questions about when they were summoned a senior UCLA official told a colleague that the college had asked LAPD for assistance by around 11:30 p.m. on the night of the attack according to text messages obtained by The Post. The California Highway Patrol has said UCLA requested its help an hour later at 12:30 a.m. UCLA police chief John Thomas told the Los Angeles Times that when he got to campus shortly before midnight he saw 19 officers from campus police the LAPD and three other local police departments but an LAPD lieutenant told him the force was too small to step in. It was not until about 1:30 a.m. that officers began staging with campus police in a parking lot near the encampment video shows. CHP confirmed the time UCLA requested its help but did not respond to further questions. In an unsigned email LAPD told The Post “The department is looking into its involvement on campus along with other law enforcement agencies and a detailed report is being completed.” Campus police referred questions to UCLA. A spokesperson for UCLA did not respond to requests for comment. UCLA and LAPD have said they are now jointly investigating perpetrators of the April 30 attack and that they have asked the FBI for help. Michael V. Drake the president of the University of California system has requested an external investigation of the university’s response that night. Mounting concerns On April 25 as protests emerged at universities nationwide over Israel’s war in Gaza students at UCLA’s Westwood campus began building a tent encampment on Dickson Plaza an open tree-lined quad in front of the college’s Royce Hall theater. Their demands to college leaders included calling for a cease-fire divesting from companies tied to Israel’s war effort and boycotting Israeli universities. Over the next several days videos show counterprotesters faced off with pro-Palestinian demonstrators. According to protesters they repeatedly tried to enter the encampment.

UCLA asked for assistance in policing the demonstrations from the wider University of California police system on April 25 and April 26 but then canceled those requests Wade Stern the president of the University of California’s police union told The Post. The cancellations first reported by the Los Angeles Times were frustrating Stern said. “Every cop wants to go and help” he said. “We all want to be there.”

Concerns about students’ safety mounted among some faculty ahead of a pro-Israeli counterprotest planned for April 28 and permitted by university officials. In a phone call on April 27 Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck assured Randall Kuhn a public health professor that counterprotesters did not want to “pick a fight” and that UCLA was stationing dozens of hired security guards around the encampment including 30 ready “to help address any provocations or potential attacks” according to an email Kuhn sent to colleagues summarizing Beck’s remarks. Beck referred questions to a UCLA spokesman.

On April 28 counterprotesters erected a massive TV screen to blast footage of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas at the protesters. UCLA’s police force was bolstered that day by additional officers from other University of California campuses. Still when an assault occurred they were outmanned and sought additional help from several local police departments according to a timeline compiled by police union officials.

By the next night tensions were rising again. Videos show a small group of agitators taunting people in the pro-Palestinian encampment. Police later separated fights between the two sides protesters said in interviews.

Hours later UCLA again asked for help from other UC police departments. But none was able to send reinforcements as they were monitoring protests on their own campuses according to the union timeline.

The attack

Agitators gathered outside the encampment the following day. Recordings posted on social media showed protesters refusing entry to a Jewish student who identified as a Zionist and a mother complaining to UCLA that Jewish students were being blocked from accessing a library.

At 2:35 p.m. Danielle Carr an assistant professor at UCLA’s Institute for Society and Genetics wrote an email seeking to sound an alarm about “truly unbelievable” aggression against protesters during the pro-Israeli counterprotest two days earlier. “I know that many faculty are wondering what the administration plans to do to protect our students” Carr wrote to an office responsible for handling complaints of sexual violence and harassment.

By the evening a large crowd had gathered outside the protest camp. One man was draped in an Israeli flag and others wore hoodies with slogans demanding the return of Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas. At 10:48 p.m. counterprotesters moved closer to the encampment’s southern barricades and blared “Harbu Darbu” — an Israeli wartime anthem calling for retribution for Oct. 7. Suddenly they rushed forward and started pulling metal fences away from security guards stationed at the perimeter of the encampment.

The guards were from Contemporary Services Corporation (CSC) which contracts with UCLA and specializes in crowd control at sporting events and concerts and a subsidiary. While some CSC guards attempted to push back attackers others stood aside.

“There are too many!” one of the security guards said recordings show. Another shouted “CSC pack it up!” as fellow guards walked away. CSC did not respond to questions from The Post.

The agitators pushed past the fencing and started ripping down plywood barriers on the perimeter of the camp’s south and north sides. Pro-Palestinian protesters attempted to hold their line.

Calls for help

When Tabibian the business executive placed his first 911 call at 11:09 p.m. he connected with a dispatcher and they spoke for 21 seconds. “I believe I told him that people were getting hurt — they needed to get over here and shut this down” Tabibian told The Post noting that it was difficult to differentiate between each of his 11 calls. Tabibian blamed pro-Palestinian protesters for provoking the chaos.

At 11:13 p.m. two UCLA patrol cars and an ambulance arrived near a UCLA campus police car that an observer said had been there all day. A third arrives shortly after. At least four officers stepped out of their cars and were soon surrounded by counterprotesters some shouting “Shut it down!” in an apparent reference to the encampment. One man was ushered to the ambulance and at 11:19 p.m. the three police cars and ambulance pulled away.

Reports of injuries rolled in. At 11:31 p.m. a fire department dispatcher asked an ambulance stationed nearby to respond to an injury at the college.

Violence continues

Moments later a counterprotester lit a firework and lobbed it over the encampment perimeter. It exploded inside the encampment to terrified screams.

The lack of police intervention frustrated witnesses. Jeremy López who supported the protest called 911 at 12:28 a.m. to report that students were being beaten. “The operator said ‘Yes we know already’ and hung up” López later told The Post.

Carr the assistant professor who had warned of potential violence arrived at the plaza a few minutes later and encountered what looked to her like a war zone. Students were sprawled on the ground some bleeding from their faces. Others were reeling from eye pain caused by irritants.

The violence continued “for hours and hours with nobody stepping in” said Bharat Venkat an associate professor. “I thought a student would be killed.”

A mob surrounded two pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had stepped outside of the encampment. While one was hit with a wooden stick the crowd rained punches on the other. He was later recorded receiving treatment from volunteer medics his face covered in blood.

At 12:32 a.m. a man on LAPD radio said they “might want to launch a UCLA unit” according to a review of radio communications archived by the platform Broadcastify. Seconds later an officer said he was at UCLA’s Murphy Hall — close to the violence — along with four other units. But no LAPD personnel were seen taking action in available video footage of the area.

After 1 a.m. police reported over radio that an “MFF” — mobile field force — and a helicopter had been requested at the college and officers were told that the incident was “code three” meaning they should use lights and sirens.

But over the subsequent hour the address of the temporary command post was misstated over radio confusing some officers.

People calling police continued to receive dismissive responses. “Didn’t you already call?” an operator said when a woman called UCLA police at 1:33 a.m. video shows. “I already told you we’re handling the situation. You can’t continue calling unless you have an emergency.”

Police emerge

Throughout the evening police vehicles had gathered on the outskirts of campus but the first mass of police visible in footage reviewed by The Post was a line of about 30 CHP officers that began to form at 1:43 a.m. Another row of officers in black lined up behind them. They did not advance.

At 2:17 a.m. counterprotesters rushed the encampment barricade physically assaulting protesters including slamming a plank of wood on someone’s head and spraying an irritant. Officers stood about 200 feet away. None moved to stop the violence the video shows.

Nearly an hour after they assembled in line and nearly four hours after the attack began officers from CHP and LAPD began slowly moving in formation toward Dickson Plaza at 2:43 a.m.

By 3:10 a.m. police had separated the majority of attackers from the pro-Palestinian protesters. But law enforcement did not arrest or appear to question the attackers instead granting them an exit route away from the camp according to video.

“There have only been a couple times in my life where I’ve had trouble understanding what’s real and what’s maybe a nightmare and this was definitely one of them” Nicholas Shapiro an assistant professor and a former EMT who helped treat injured students later told The Post.

Shapiro arrived home with dark stains on his fingers and palms.

“Surreal” he texted a group of professor friends at 3:47 a.m. “to be ending the night cleaning a student’s blood off my hands.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMS9idXNpbmVzcy9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC1sYXRlLWZlZXMtcmVndWxhdGlvbi1jZnBiL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA1LzExL2J1c2luZXNzL2NyZWRpdC1jYXJkLWxhdGUtZmVlcy1yZWd1bGF0aW9uLWNmcGI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge blocks Biden administration rule capping credit card late fees at $8,"New York CNN —

A federal judge in Fort Worth Texas on Friday blocked a new Biden administration rule that would prohibit credit card companies from charging customers late fees higher than $8.

US District Judge Mark T. Pittman an appointee of former President Donald Trump granted a preliminary injunction to several business and banking organizations that allege the new rule violates several federal statutes.

These organizations led by the right-leaning US Chamber of Commerce sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the rule was finalized in March. The rule which was set to go into effect Tuesday would save consumers about $10 billion per year by cutting fees from an average of $32 the CFPB estimated.

A preliminary injunction means the rule can’t go into effect until a hearing is held where the case can be adjudicated in greater detail.

“The credit card lobby’s lawsuit is an attempt to derail a rule that will save families $10 billion each year in order to continue making tens of billions of dollars in profits by charging borrowers late fees that far exceed their actual costs” a CFPB spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “Consumers will shoulder $800 million in late fees every month that the rule is delayed — money that pads the profit margins of the largest credit card issuers. We will continue to defend this rule so that working families can stop paying excessive late fees that Congress banned more than a decade ago.”

The US Chamber of Commerce has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.

“It is disappointing that the court has granted this last-ditch effort by the banks to prevent these critical limits on credit card late fees from going into effect next week” said Chuck Bell advocacy program director for non-profit Consumer Reports. “Credit card companies have been bilking consumers out of billions of dollars in excessive late fees for far too long.”

The rule first proposed in February 2023 is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to eliminate “junk fees” considered hidden or misleading charges to consumers.

The new rule would apply to large credit card issuers — those with more than 1 million accounts. These companies represent more than 95% of total outstanding credit card debt according to the CFPB.

The push to target credit card fees is part of the Biden administration’s efforts to ease financial burdens for many Americans. Some borrowers especially millennials and those with lower incomes have fallen behind on their credit card debt following more than two years of high inflation.

The new rule also intended to close a 2010 loophole the CFPB says has been “exploited” by credit card companies to hike fees on late payments.

According to a national Consumer Reports survey published in September one in five American adults said they had paid a credit card late fee in the previous 12 months. Eighty-two percent said they supported lowering the maximum late fee.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3RvcC5jb20vcHJpbmNlLWdlb3JnZXMtY291bnR5LzIwMjQvMDUvMS1raWxsZWQtaW4tc2hvb3RpbmctYXQtbWdtLXJlc29ydC1hbmQtY2FzaW5vLWluLXByaW5jZS1nZW9yZ2VzLWNvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1 killed in shooting at MGM Resort and Casino in Prince George’s Co.,"A man was killed in a shooting at MGM Resort and Casino in Oxon Hill in Prince George's County Maryland early Saturday morning.

A man was killed in a shooting at MGM Resort and Casino in Oxon Hill in Prince George’s County Maryland early Saturday morning.

Prince George’s County police responded to a shooting shortly before 5 a.m. on Saturday in the 100 block of MGM National Avenue.

They said they responded after getting reports of a shooting from MGM Special Police and security officers at the casino.

Police said when they arrived they found a man in the parking garage suffering from a gunshot wound. He died from his injuries on the scene according to police.

An initial investigation revealed that the man was shot during a dispute according to police.

A reward of up to $25000 is being offered for information leading to an arrest and indictment in this case police said.

Data

First I am going to describe the data we use for this article.

The World Bank Open Data is a great source of free and open access data on global development. One can find hundreds of datasets on topics related to global development ranging from economics demography climate change health infrastructure energy and so on from the databank of the World Bank. Analyzing the time series data of these indicators is crucial to formulate the policies institutional and regulatory framework which is apt for a country or a region.

The World Bank data could be downloaded directly from the database in the Excel or CSV format or it could also be accessed directly from Python using pandas_datareader as shown in the script below:

For this article I am going to use selective indicators for certain countries for a particular year. I select GDP GDP per capita access to electricity population and CO2 emissions data from the World Bank database by providing the code for the same indicators which can also be accessed from the website. Next I select 12 random countries by providing their ISO codes and download the data for 2018. I rename the columns with the indicator names instead of codes and select only countries in the index. The dataframe df looks as follows:

Development indicators selected from World Bank database for 2018

VLOOKUP implementation in Excel

In this section I am going to describe how the VLOOKUP function works in Excel to get a required subset of data from a data table or range. As shown in the Excel screenshot below columns A to F represents the same data as in df . In columns I to L I want to get the CO2 emissions and population data from the first table.

VLOOKUP function implemented in Excel in the table in right (I1:L6) to get the value from table in the left (A1:F13)

In the formula bar denoted by red rectangle in the Excel screenshot we can see the formula used for cell J2.

=VLOOKUP($I2 $A$1:$F$136FALSE) * 1000

wherein

$I2 represents the country Bhutan that we want to look up in the first table;

$A$1:$F$13 represents the entire first table where the lookup value and data to be returned are to be found

6 represents the column number (herein representing the kt CO2 column) from where the corresponding value is to be returned (for Bhutan) and

FALSE represents the exact match.

Three easy steps to implement it in Python

Herein I describe the implementation of the same function used in Excel above but in Python in three simple steps:

First we create a dataframe called df_target where we want to have the desired subset data. Initially the dataframe comprises the names of the five desired countries. And then we create empty columns for the indicators- CO2 emissions (tonnes) and Population that we want to return from df .

Step 1

The countries column in df_target is common with the country column of df . Therefore second we set the countries column in df_target as the index.

Step 2

Third this is the main step we map the index in df_target against df to get the data for required columns as output. For example the values in kt CO2 column of df multiplied by 1000 is returned for the CO2 emissions (tonnes) column of df_target . The map() function maps the value of Series according to input correspondence and is used for substituting each value in a Series with another value that could be extracted from a function a dictionary or a Series.

Step 3

In this article we learned an easy technique to implement the VLOOKUP function of Excel in three simple steps in Python. The functions and modules of different packages in Python have enabled to automate several steps that otherwise would have cost a lot of time and effort and in this sense thus have been a real blessing to optimize costs and resources.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2hvdy1haS13aWxsLXRyYW5zZm9ybS1zb2Z0d2FyZS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC8zODA3NjfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How AI Will Transform Software Development,"As AI is already helping human developers at every stage of the development process software development will only improve with AI.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

While artificial intelligence (AI) is already effectively assisting human developers at every level of the development process software development will only get better as it is about to undergo a huge change.

Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the way developers work resulting in significant productivity quality and speed increases. Everything — from project planning and estimation to quality testing and the user experience — can benefit from AI algorithms.

The impact of AI on software development

AI will undoubtedly impact how developers create applications and how users interact with them in the modern environment. As organizations become more interested in AI technologies artificial intelligence will certainly affect the future of software development.

Moreover it is predicted that roughly 80% of businesses are investing in AI with 47% of digitally advanced companies already defining AI strategies. Even more amazingly AI tools should provide $2.9 trillion in corporate value in the foreseeable future.

To implement an AI strategy companies must first comprehend the function of AI in software development by examining what may be changed.

AI: Reshaping the roles of software developers

The software developer's role is already changing and it may look very different in ten years than it does now. However it is important to remember that technology will not be able to replace developers anytime soon. The world is still a few years away from AI being able to write code on its own.

Instead software developers are more likely to execute different activities and establish skills to work effectively with AI on the job. As a result developers will be needed even more in the future implying that AI and software development will certainly rise in tandem.

As established AI has already been supporting and helping software developers address different software development challenges by doing the following:

Automated code quality through code review and code optimization

Artificial intelligence will become a tool that software developers use to obtain new knowledge optimize procedures and ultimately produce better code rather than replacing them.

One of the major developments in AI software development is AI-enabled coding apps that incorporate ""autocomplete"" into the software development process to boost speed and accuracy during the coding process.

Another solution includes an AI-driven mentorship feature that enables new developers to build apps in real-time.

In the end these technologies will democratize development allowing developers to devote more time to problem-solving design and other creative ideas that will maximize the value they can give to the company.

Automated DevOps

Machine learning AI technologies had some effects on software deployment especially in the software development paradigm where developers frequently upgrade programs or apps to newer versions such as increased efficiency in deployment control tasks.

There will be a huge danger in executing the software if developers fail to complete a process correctly during an upgrade.

AI can protect developers from such issues during upgrades and lessen the likelihood of deployment failure. Another benefit of artificial intelligence is that it allows machine learning algorithms to examine the deployment process.

Specifically machine learning algorithms will enable the software to learn how specific users behave. This learned behavior helps it respond to different actions by serving variable content and automatically adjusting font size buttons and on-page elements. Such response results in a dynamic software experience that pulls in real-time user interaction data and utilizes it to propel improvements as developers make code changes.

This improved functionality combined with ongoing user feedback can reduce friction points in crucial areas such as abandoned cart rates conversion rates and the design of more accessible software.

Automated security: Code security vulnerability assessment static and dynamic security review open-source code security

Software security is a critical feature that must get considered throughout development. In this regard data gets collected by the system from network sensors and software installed on the customer's end.

Companies can use AI to study data and use machine learning to discern anomalous behavior from typical behavior. Additionally software development companies that incorporate AI into their development process can avoid delayed warnings erroneous notifications and alarms.

Ultimately coding advances and improves when developers use AI tools. Developers and testers do not have to waste time reviewing executable files riddled with faults and mistakes. It is much easier for them to detect and fix flaws quickly.

Automated test cases for quality assessment

The function of AI in software testing is becoming increasingly important in the quality assurance procedure. Quality assurance testing has always been a time-consuming manual process with a wide margin of error.

One of the most significant advantages of artificial intelligence is that it allows for quick accurate testing which improves the process where bugs get found and addressed before a product is published shortening the development cycle and guaranteeing a higher-quality end product.

Software design

To propose a definite solution project planning and design require specialized knowledge and experience. Designers face a difficult problem in deciding on the best plan for each step.

AI technologies get used to automate some difficult tasks. Designers can for example employ an AI design assistant to understand the client's wants and preferences and then use that information to design a suitable project.

The benefits of AI in software development

Traditional software development will remain; but it is bound for a modern transformation thanks to artificial intelligence. Regular software can easily handle all key components such as front-end product interfaces security and data administration. The AI method can help the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) resulting in higher quality software by supporting the following functions:

Accurate estimates

Software development frequently exceeds the pre-determined budget and deadlines. Reliable estimations necessitate a high level of expertise a thorough awareness of the context and familiarity with the implementation team to deal with this. Machine learning helps facilitate the training of data from previous projects. These projects can include user stories feature descriptions and estimations to anticipate work and funds.

Code refactoring

For team cooperation and long-term maintenance a simple and clean code is crucial. Large-scale restructuring will become unavoidable as companies upgrade to the latest technologies and some less painful requirements emerge.

Error handling and automatic analytics

Machine learning aids in analyzing system logs enabling much faster and proactive flagging of issues once the technology is enabled. Moreover it is feasible to allow the software to dynamically change the error answer without any human interaction in the future.

Intelligent assistants

Programmers devote a significant amount of effort to reviewing documentation and troubleshooting code. Developers can save time using intelligent programming assistants to provide in-the-moment guidance and recommendations such as best practices code examples and relevant documents.

Strategic decision making

With so much time spent on different products and features it is easier for developers to evaluate which ones need to get prioritized and which ones may get eliminated. Companies can train such an artificial intelligence platform by accumulating experience from past development project errors to aid in reviewing the performance of existing apps.

Quick prototype

Considerable amounts of time and strategy are required to transform business requirements into technical solutions. As a result with the help of machine learning developers can shorten this process by allowing fewer technical domain professionals to design innovations using natural language visual interfaces.

3 ways to integrate AI into software development

AI is becoming a more enticing and practical alternative for enterprise software development as technology advances. Here are three approaches to using AI to boost developer productivity:

1. AI in coding

AI-based routines can forecast the next action or method call within a line of code in various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). While AI had a primitive effect on these processes in the past it has now gotten more complex.

IDEs only recommend a method. IDEs can now type ahead complete the method invocation and fill in all essential arguments and parameters thanks to advances in AI in software development.

Ultimately this feature can substantially speed up the development process while preventing syntax errors from breaking a continuous integration build.

2. AI in software generation

The next major AI trend in software development is the capacity for AI systems to look at a use case or system requirement and produce code that implements the functional condition and even constructs test cases.

Because computer-generated code still requires human monitoring and examination it is all still experimental and academic. However as IDEs weave AI into all parts of software development the world will eventually see even greater advancements in computer-generated code in the future.

3. AI in specified guidance

The third AI trend in software development is augmented coding. Ultimately it is about how AI gives tailored guidance for a developer's goals. Imagine it as something similar to Google Maps: Although one may know how to go somewhere Google Maps can advise a route that is either faster or more suitable due to current traffic conditions.

Today AI can assist developers in coding the next word or relevant code line. Still the biggest efficiency gains come from anticipating entire blocks of code that can solve a functional problem.

It’s been 897 days since the 1000+hp cars of the Formula DRIFT PRO Championship turned a wheel in anger on the Streets of Long Beach. On its return fans in the packed grandstands enjoyed perfect weather and watched the experienced drivers revive their muscle memory of the Long Beach street course that sits alongside the Pacific Ocean.

“It’s such an unforgiving track that I feel sorry for the new drivers who’ve not run here before” said Justin Pawlak (USA) after winning his first heat. “For veterans like me the muscle memory returns quickly and it gives us a big advantage over the new guys when running so close to the walls.”

Traditionally the opening round of the FD PRO Championship drivers with an eye on the 2021 title needed to avoid the punishing concrete if they wanted to be in the fight for the Final Round at Irwindale Speedway – the House of Drift – scheduled for October 22-23.

QUALIFYING

With a number of drivers hitting the walls during practice for Round 7: AutoZone Streets of Long Beach Presented By TYPE S there was a lot of activity in the pits to prepare the cars for qualifying. And Pawlak’s experience would pay dividends as he scored an almost perfect 97 points to take the top position.

Pawlak has produced some remarkable qualifying runs throughout the season in his Falken Tire Ford Mustang but he’s been unable to translate that into consistent competition results. His best finish to date was third at Round 2 in Orlando so the pressure is on him to perform in Long Beach.

Fredric Aasbo (Norway) qualified second in his Rockstar Energy Drink Toyota GR Supra. Despite the car being semi-assembled after a heavy practice crash he scored an identical 97 points. When this happens the judges look at the individual scores for style angle and line to separate the drivers. In this instance Pawlak scored an extra point for angle and demoted Aasbo to second.

With four podium finishes from six events including a win at the previous round in St Louis Aasbo arrived in California with tremendous momentum. Sitting in third place only 33 points from the lead the 2015 FD PRO Champion appears to be building to a climax at the Irwindale Final.

After choosing with considerable success to qualify in lower positions earlier in the season to manipulate the pairings in the competition heats Chelsea DeNofa (USA) was back in business at Round 7. Scoring 96 points he put his BC Racing / Nitto Tire Ford Mustang RTR Spec 5-D in third place signifying he intends to wrestle the Championship lead back from Matt Field (USA) with whom he’s battled all season.

Field scored 94 points in the Falken Tire / Drift Cave Chevrolet Corvette which was good enough for sixth position to keep the fight alive.

With 33 FD PRO drivers attempting to qualify for the Top 32 Competition Heats the axe fell on Josh Reynolds (USA) who was eliminated after two incomplete runs in his Drift Force / Nexen Tire F22 Eurofighter BMW. Meanwhile Jonathan Hurst (USA) was the top FD PRO rookie qualifying 14th in the Cash Racing Infiniti G37

COMPETITION HEATS

With the threat of carnage lurking at every turn the competition heats would be a testament to testicular fortitude particularly for the Championship protagonists. And yet even the most knowledgeable observer would be hard pressed to point out a driver who didn’t put everything on the line to secure a heat victory.

The “win or bin” mentality was perhaps epitomized by the RTR Motorsports teammates Vaughn Gittin Jr (USA) and DeNofa. Sitting second and sixth respectively in the points table the rational mind might expect team leader Gittin to push gently on the throttle of his 1200hp Monster Energy Ford Mustang RTR Spec 5-D. However that would be to utterly underestimate the desire of each to win. And perhaps predictably the two collided in Outside Zone 2 as DeNofa made a slight speed adjustment to negotiate the turn while Gittin kept his foot in.

With a split opinion among the Formula DRIFT judges as to how to apportion blame they returned for the second run with DeNofa at a slight disadvantage. He would subsequently spin in Touch & Go 2 as he attempted to put Gittin under pressure and keep his FD PRO Championship hopes alive.

The result? Gittin would eventually finish third while DeNofa placed fifth. Fortunately the damage wasn’t catastrophic: DeNofa remains second in the Championship chase 19 points behind the new leader Aasbo.

Jumping from third to first in the points table Aasbo appears to have perfectly timed his march to the 2021 title. He’s been insanely consistent throughout the season claiming his fifth podium in Long Beach which includes his first win at the previous St Louis round. But while he leads the Championship after Round 7: AutoZone Streets of Long Beach Presented By TYPE S the event win would go to Aurimas “Odi” Bakchis (Lithuania) driving the Falken Tire / Feal Suspension Nissan S15.

Having won the opening round at Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta Bakchis has been in the title chase all season. Some uncharacteristically poor performances at a number of rounds had maneuvered him to fifth in the Championship but nobody underestimates him and a good result on the Streets of Long Beach would keep his aspirations alive.

The weekend didn’t start particularly well when he qualifying 12th and the consequence was a series of challenging match ups beginning in the first round against the 2020 FD PRO Rookie of the Year Adam LZ (USA) in the LZ S15.

Both drivers are fan favorites because they always push their S15s to the limit. And on their first run Bakchis set a blistering pace that resulted in LZ being off-line at the final turn Inside Clip 1 as he fought to maintain proximity.

With LZ’s run judged incomplete Bakchis simply had to complete his chase run with enough style to take the win. However LZ had different plans. He rocketed from the lights and challenged the Lithuanian to stay close. In his attempt Bakchis surged into the same final turn colliding with LZ as they transitioned. With both drivers coming to a halt Bakchis was ruled at fault and his run was also incomplete.

With both chase runs scoring zero points the judges referred to each driver’s lead run and determined that Bakchis had drifted deeper awarding him the win.

With no easy runs in FD PRO the intensity ramped up as Bakchis faced 2011 Champion Daijiro Yoshihara (Japan) in the Top 16. The driver of the Turn 14 Distribution / Falken Tire / ENEOS Oil Subaru BRZ turned it up to 11 and set an exemplary lead run but Bakchis remained at his side like a clingy girlfriend. On his chase run Yoshihara drifted shallower lines to maintain proximity which was enough to send him on his short drive home.

In the Top 8 it was the turn of 2013 FD Champion Michael Essa (USA) to try to send the Nissan driver home. Essa had been on fire all weekend qualifying fourth at his home track and looking good for the win. However the driver of the FCP Euro / Liqui Moly / GT Radial BMW M3 made his only mistake of the event in the chase position. He slid into the wall in Outside Zone 1 forcing him to correct which handed the win to the more precise Bakchis.

In the Top 4 all bets were off as Bakchis faced three-time FD PRO Champion Chris Forsberg (USA) driving the NOS Energy / GT Radial Nissan 370Z. With a healthy dose of mutual respect between the drivers the packed grandstands leant forward.

As in his previous heats Bakchis left the start line fast. He set a pace that is difficult for anybody to follow including the massively experience Forsberg who made a small mistake at the end of his chase run making contact as the two drivers compressed into the final turn. It was enough to get the nod from the judges on a tight split decision and move Bakchis into the Final against another formidable foe.

This time it was 2015 FD Champion Aasbo fresh from his own Top 4 battle against double FD Champion Gittin who still his teammate’s blood on his hand when they met. Aasbo had taken the win by a tiny margin and would be a formidable adversary for Bakchis in the Final.

With Aasbo leading the first run he wore the Lithuanian like an corset barely able to breathe with the proximity. With the roles reversed and Bakchis in the lead he simply did a better job filling each drift zone more than the Norwegian.

As a reward for the hard-fought win Bakchis got to speak to us after the podium celebration. “I needed this win really badly and it’s a huge confidence boost. We won the first round and fought hard all season but had some bad luck in the middle so earning first place is a tremendous boost. But we had to earn it; we had to battle through some tough competitors most of whom were former Champions. But I was able to step it up as needed and the team did a phenomenal job keeping the car together. I’m stoked with this win and hope to keep the momentum going into the Irwindale Finals.”

The win moved Bakchis to fourth in the FD PRO Championship standings 43 points from the lead and with a chance of taking the 2021 title at Round 8: TYPE S Title Fight.

The only top title contender we haven’t mentioned is Matt Field (USA) who was the points leader prior to FD LB. He was another driver slain by Gittin as Field’s Falken Tire / Drift Cave Chevrolet Corvette was knocked out of the Top 16 in an intense battle that went to One More Time. Unfortunately the front suspension broke on the Corvette on the third run causing him to spin into the tire wall and resulting in the Gittin win.

Finishing 11th on the night Field dropped to third in the FD PRO Championship; 20 points behind Aasbo and a single point behind DeNofa. The Irwindale Finals will be a bloodbath!

Top Rookie at FD LB was Jonathan Hurst (USA) who both qualified and finished 14th in the Cash Racing Infiniti G37. He narrowly trails Branden Sorensen (USA) and Simen Olsen (Norway) in the 2021 Rookie of the Year title race.

At this point we’re contractually obligated to give the final word to Formula DRIFT President Jim Liaw who is on his farewell tour before heading to Performance Racing Industry in 2022 and handing the reins to co-founder Ryan Sage: “It’s great to return to Streets of Long Beach after two and a half years. The fans here are still among the strongest on the tour and it’s such a relief to finally return to our home track. We’re delighted they were able to witness such an incredible show by the world’s top drift drivers. We’re also grateful the weather was perfect but we look forward to returning to the April schedule for Streets of Long Beach in 2022.”

This yearlong program works to support and scale high-potential minority-owned firms by providing targeted training as well as access to business coaches and large corporations. Participants leave the program with a three-year strategic growth action plan to guide their development.

The Minority Business Accelerator will be led by the Greenville Charleston and Columbia chambers.

“Together with the Charleston Columbia and Greenville Chamber organizations we are working to do our part to support minority-owned businesses and we hope to encourage others as well” said Bank of America South Carolina president Kim Wilkerson. “Here in South Carolina Bank of America remains focused on creating opportunity in the areas of jobs training and workforce development as these areas are where systemic long-term gaps have existed and where significant change is required to achieve sustainable progress.”

The program has existed in the Upstate through the Greenville Chamber since 2012. It is open to socially or economically underrepresented businesses including those that are minority-owned woman-owned or veteran-owned. Participants must have at least one other full-time employee and must also be headquartered in South Carolina.

All three chambers will begin recruiting participants this fall and all three programs are set to launch in January 2022.

In addition the Greenville Chamber announced its annual award recipients at its 132nd Annual Meeting on Sept. 14 at Fluor Field.

CHARLOTTE N.C. — As the Carolina Panthers try to scratch out wins on the field Charlotte police and firefighters say neighborhoods across Charlotte are losing.

""There's no other way to put it. There's definitely going to be an impact to public safety"" Charlotte Firefighters Association President Tom Brewer said. ""It absolutely concerns me and it should concern the citizens as well.""

Brewer said the 2021 Panthers season kicked off with 16 on-duty firefighters plus supervisors. That's roughly 6% of that shift's staff pulled from three stations — in southeast north and Uptown Charlotte — to work the game leaving multiple trucks out of service Brewer said.

""They may just be coming from a little further away but they're still coming"" Brewer said of the impact on fire service in those areas.""

According to Brewer the approach is a major change from past years when CFD relied on off-duty firefighters to cover stadium events.

""We weren't given a reason. We were just told that it was going to be covered by all on-duty companies. We were just told 'This is how it's going to be"" he said. ""The whole reason the city used off-duty companies when this began was because they didn't want to put a strain and they didn't want to lessen fire service to the city.""

Those reassigned firefighters are on top of the 70 to 80 on-duty police officers CMPD moved during the two home preseason games and 54 on-duty officers reassigned to work the Jets game. As WCNC Charlotte previously uncovered the CMPD reassignments are the result of not enough off-duty officers willing to work security and traffic.

""If they're getting pulled for these events they're not in your community patrolling right now"" Fraternal Order of Police Public Information Officer Yolian Ortiz said.

Ortiz said during the Panthers' first game of the regular season just a handful of officers worked the Providence (4) and Freedom (5) divisions and only six covered Steele Creek. According to Ortiz those staffing numbers are well below minimum staffing standards of eight to nine officers.

""You're going to find yourself calling 911 and possibly waiting an hour or two for an officer to show up"" she said of the impact.

Initially CMPD told WCNC Charlotte the agency maintained its minimum staffing on game days but now that the FOP is saying three divisions were actually understaffed during the home opener CMPD won't address that question saying the information ""speaks to means and methods and will not be released as it is part of our Sensitive Public Security Information.""

CMPD cited newly released data that show average response times on Fridays and weekends have remained consistent for the highest priority calls regardless of whether there's a football game. It remains unclear however what impact the staffing decisions have had on lower priority police calls. WCNC Charlotte recently requested that data from CMPD and is waiting for the agency to provide it.

""The CMPD is the primary provider for both the internal security and exterior traffic direction as well as other safety and security measures surrounding and including the BOA Stadium during Panthers' home games and other large-scale events"" CMPD said in a statement. ""The CMPD's goal is to staff the security and traffic direction positions on a voluntary basis with sworn staff working in an off-duty capacity. For events that are not fully staffed by off-duty personnel the CMPD coordinates with division commanders to staff the events with on-duty personnel. The division commanders work to ensure they retain sufficient coverage for their respective divisions while allocating their staff to support the coverage at the BOA stadium.""

The agency reiterated during the two home preseason games where CMPD used 82 and 74 on-duty officers for traffic and security ""data indicates that there was no service impact involving delayed response times for emergency calls for service.""

After WCNC Charlotte's discovery City Council Member Dimple Ajmera started asking questions too.

""We have to ensure that public safety is our always our No. 1 priority there is no delay in response time"" the Safe Communities Committee Vice Chair said. ""I reached out to our fire department and police department.""

In a statement CFD suggested its current staffing woes preclude the department from using overtime firefighters to work special events.

""The Charlotte Fire Department has the responsibility to make sure all Charlotte residents spectators and visitors to the City are safe during special events at Bank of America Stadium and other venues based on crowd size"" CFD said. ""We make it a priority to have four firefighters on each company and maintain 268 personnel on duty both for effectiveness and safety. When staffing levels allow we will utilize personnel on overtime to staff special events. Just like many public safety departments our staffing is stressed due to COVID positive personnel quarantines stress and fatigue. There will be times when we must utilize on duty companies to ensure public safety at these events and still maintain safe and effective coverage throughout the City.""

Following WCNC Charlotte's questions Police Chief Johnny Jennings shared a video with officers. In the video he assured the department the City of Charlotte is looking for long-term solutions as to ""making sure that we are able to provide adequate staffing for these events as well as making sure that we don't compromise the staffing that we have and the resources needed out for every day regular patrol.""

""This is really important to me"" Chief Jennings said.

The chief added members of CMPD CFD the Charlotte Department of Transportation along with other city officials have spent the last year working on this issue to ensure ""we're doing this appropriately and that we're making sure that we're taking care of our citizens as well as taking care of those that are trying to enjoy an event.""

The chief said that management team is assessing how other cities provide security for large events in hopes of learning from them.

""There will be some changes made but it's gonna take time. This doesn't happen overnight"" Chief Jennings said.

WCNC Charlotte asked if City Manager Marcus Jones would be willing to talk with us about the issue on-camera. The city declined to make him available for an interview.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy83LXdheXMtbWVuLWxpdmUtd2l0aG91dC13b3JraW5nLWluLWFtZXJpY2EtMDkyMTQ3MDY4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 ways men live without working in America,"Almost one-third of all working-age men in America aren’t doing diddly-squat. They don’t have a job and they aren’t looking for one either. One-third of all working-age men. That’s almost 30 million people!

How do they live? What are they doing for money? To me this is one of the great mysteries of our time.

I’m certainly not the first person to make note of this shocking statistic. You’ve heard people bemoaning this ""labor participation rate"" which is simply the number of working-age men (usually counted as ages 16 to 64) who are working or are seeking work as a percentage of the overall labor force.

It’s true that the pandemic which of course produced a number of factors that made working more difficult never mind dangerous pushed the labor participation rate to a record low. But the fact that millions of American males have not been working precedes COVID-19 by decades. In fact the participation rate for men peaked at 87.4% in October 1949 and has been dropping steadily ever since. It now stands at 67.7%.

As a business journalist for a good portion of those 70-plus years I’ve looked at thousands of charts and graphs in my life and I have to say this one is as jaw dropping as it is vexing:

Chart of the U.S. labor force participation rate for men over time courtesy of the St. Louis Federal Reserve (St. Louis Federal Reserve)

Economists sociologists politicians and cable news pundits each have their pet factors to explain the groundswell of non-work. But after digging down here I’ve concluded there are many different forces at play. That’s what I want to explore today which is: how men can live in America without working.

I’m not talking about why men have lost their jobs — factories closing layoffs automation outsourcing jobs overseas even perhaps women entering the workforce (in fact the participation rate by women over the same time period is way up). What I want to get at is how they’re living without holding a ""real"" job and by that I mean doing work where one reports income to the IRS pays taxes and Social Security etc.

It’s important to note that every man in this group has his own story. They range from mentally ill homeless men who desperately need our help to the I’m-doing-just-fine-thank-you-very-much retired early and former Silicon Valley coder. And there are infinite scenarios in between those two extremes including for instance the many men who have chosen to be stay-at-home dads while their spouses work.

It’s also the case that some men in this group may be unemployed and not seeking work because they’ve given up looking just for now — perhaps waiting for COVID to abate — and will start the search again soon. Here too society needs to help.

Story continues

Still none of this explains decade after decade of falling male employment.

To that end here to my mind are seven ways men are living without working in America:

-Unemployment insurance

Let’s start with this one because it’s a hot button issue. Conservatives and some liberals too have made the claim that state unemployment aid coupled with $600 a week from the CARES Act which was rolled out in March 2020 have reduced men’s need to work. (There are actually a variety of social programs at play spelled out nicely here by think tank The Century Foundation which estimates that overall these programs have pumped $800 billion in the economy.) We’ll be getting a good read on whether all this relief did suppress employment now that CARES aid ended for some 7.5 million Americans earlier this month. But as Yahoo Finance’s Denitsa Tsekova reported here and here states that ended federal aid programs early didn’t see big increases in employment. That may mean these payments really weren’t enough to live off or not enough to live off by themselves which speaks to men looking to a combination of sources like under the table income or family support and possibly some savings (see below).

-Early retirement pensions disability and lawsuits

Admittedly this is a bit of a hodgepodge. And as is the case with many of these categories hard data is tough to come by but it is the case that millions of men under 64 are at least partly living off of pensions and 401(k)s. This would include everything from C-suite executives to union members. And don’t forget municipal workers who make up almost 14% of the U.S. workforce. According to the U.S. Census Bureau there are some 6000 public sector retirement systems in the U.S. Collectively these plans have $4.5 trillion in assets with 14.7 million working members and 11.2 million retirees. The plans distribute $323 billion in benefits annually and again some to men who are younger than 64. In fact in almost two-thirds of these plans if you started working at 25 you max out at 57 a real inducement to stop working — at least at that job of course.

There’s also disability insurance from the Social Security Administration that is being paid to some 9 million Americans who may receive payments many years before retirement age. That's why I am including disability here but not plain vanilla Social Security which you can’t receive until age 62. The maximum disability benefit amount you can receive each month is currently $3148. (However the average beneficiary receives about $1277 per month according to the law group Social Security Disability Advocates.) Overall it looks like the SSA pays out some $130 billion in disability annually. That’s not nothing. Then there’s money paid out in medical malpractice each year smaller true but still estimated to be in excess of $3 billion. And don't forget payments from legal settlements and class action lawsuits.

You argue all day about the right or wrong when it comes to these payouts but the fact is many of them didn’t exist or not at this magnitude decades ago.

-Savings trading stocks and bitcoin

Consider now men are living off savings or from money made in the market or maybe even selling NFTs. How many is it exactly? Who knows but quite a few for sure. First off Americans on average do have some money in the bank. Savings as a percentage of disposable income according to the Federal Reserve of Kansas City hit a record high of 33% in the spring of 2020 and is still at 14% or nearly twice as high as it was prior to the pandemic.

And according to a recent survey by Northwestern Mutual average personal savings are up over 10% compared to last year from $65900 last year to $73100. Average retirement savings increased 13% from $87500 last year to $98800 today. So there’s that.

Next let’s look at investing — first stocks. It is not irrelevant to this narrative that the S&P 500 has climbed from 2480 on March 12 2020 — the day after the World Health Organization declared COVID a pandemic— to 4441 today or almost 80%. That’s a huge gain. Much of the action of course has been retail investors and the meme stock boom as millions of American males stuck at home with nothing to do all day for the past 18 months passed the time trading stocks. Credit Suisse estimates that since the beginning of 2020 “retail trading as a share of overall market activity has nearly doubled from between 15% and 18% to over 30%” as CNBC reported. How many men were doing this and supporting themselves? Unclear but upstart trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) — the broker dealer of choice for many of these new investors — reported that it had 22.5 million funded user accounts last month up from 7.2 million in March of 2020. Let’s just say 15 million new accounts is quite a number.

Now crypto. You can laugh all you want but the simple fact is that the price of bitcoin is up from $4861 on March 12 2020 to $47763 today or basically up 10X (and remember it even hit $64888.99 this spring). Back to Robinhood which according to The New York Times also reported last month that “revenue from cryptocurrency trading fees totaled $233 million a nearly 50-fold jump from $5 million a year earlier.” (And those are just fees off the trades mind you.) Bottom line: Folks have made money here. (Of course these guys should be paying taxes on all those stock and crypto gains.)

-Working for cash aka the under-the-table economy

This one is very tough to measure too. A study by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis estimates that the average size of the “informal economy” in developed countries is 13% of GDP. Honestly that could be off by many percentage points but just to give you a ballpark GDP in the U.S. this year is about $22 trillion. So 13% of that is $2.86 trillion. As it turns out $2 trillion-plus is a number that has been thrown around quite a bit (here and here for instance) when it comes to estimating the size of the cash economy in the U.S. Even if half that money is paid out to women that still leaves say $1 trillion dollars being made by men in this country off the books. That’s a big chunk of change. Are more people than ever working for cash these days? Again another question that’s impossible to answer. I would bet it’s not fewer. For example my electrician Luis just told me he can’t get anyone to work for him anymore — they all want to get paid in cash.

-Living off family members

Just to take one facet the Pew Research Center reported last year that the pandemic “has pushed millions of Americans especially young adults to move in with family members. The share of 18- to 29-year-olds living with their parents has become a majority since U.S. coronavirus cases began spreading [in early 2020] surpassing the previous peak during the Great Depression era. In July 52% of young adults resided with one or both of their parents up from 47% in February.” How many of these individuals are males living rent free (and sharing food too) which maybe means they don’t have to work? Who knows but some. Ditto for males who have moved in with in-laws or siblings. And again many men are choosing to stay home and take care of kids while their spouses work.

-Illegal work

Front and center here is selling illegal drugs. Sadly business looks to be booming that is if overdoses are any sort of measure. According to the Washington Post overdose deaths hit 93000 last year up a stunning 30% from 2019. Most of the overdoses were attributed to opioids; heroin synthetic opioids like OxyContin and in particular Fentanyl. (This despite drug dealers facing supply chain issues during COVID.) How many Americans are in this business and who are they? A number is almost impossible to come by here but as for who they are a government report on drug trafficking arrests from five years ago notes that ​​”the majority of drug trafficking offenders were male (84.9%) the average age of these offenders at sentencing was 36 years 70% were United States citizens (although this rate varied substantially depending on the type of drug involved) and that almost half (49.4%) of drug traffickers had little or no prior criminal history.” How big a business is selling drugs in America? Could be as much as $100 billion. I think it’s fair to say that a market that size requires many thousands of employees.

What about other types of crime and criminals everything from robbers and thieves to prostitutes and pimps? To that point there are some 2 million people incarcerated in the U.S. right now. (We have the highest absolute number and the highest per capita on the planet and hold some 25% of the world's total prisoners according to the ACLU.) Being in prison is another way of living in America without working I guess. But not counting those locked up how many bad guys are out there on the street? Conservatively it has to be thousands and thousands and speaking to this story they're all doing their thing and not participating in the labor force.

-Living off the land

This would include gardening fishing hunting clamming berrying and just general foraging. The numbers here seem to be climbing. Here for instance from The Guardian:

“Fishing and hunting license sales increased 10% in California during the pandemic reversing years of decline. Clamming has grown in popularity for several reasons: people are looking for safe activities to do outdoors but also some are clamming for subsistence and trying to get money from selling the shellfish (which is illegal without a commercial license).”

Ditto for Washington state according to The Spokesman-Review:

“From the start of the 2020 licensing year in May through Dec. 31 WDFW [Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife] sold nearly 45000 more fishing licenses and 12000 more hunting licenses than 2019. The number of new license holders — defined as someone who hadn’t purchased one for the previous five years — went up 16% for fishing licenses and almost 40% for hunters.”

As for growing vegetables in home gardens yes it is up way up too. Even before the pandemic there were estimates that a third of American families grew vegetables. Now this NPR reported last year:

“‘We're being flooded with vegetable orders’ says George Ball executive chairman of the Burpee Seed Company based in Warminster Penn.

Ball says he has noticed spikes in seed sales during bad times: the stock market crash of 1987 the dot com bubble burst of 2000 and he remembers the two oil crises of the 1970s from his childhood. But he says he has not seen a spike this large and widespread.

So there you have it. It’s a whole range of ways and means behaviors and experiences. I’m sure I missed some too. Again some non-working men are in dire straits and need our help. Others are living non-working lives without burdening society or others such as a fireman on early retirement (though some argue municipal employee pensions are too high) or an investor who made a ton of money in the market and called it quits or maybe a wilderness guy living off the land in Alaska.

And some non-working men are not playing fair. Like getting paid under the table fudging insurance claims or social programs. Some freeload off relatives. And some engage in overtly illegal behavior like boosting branded goods from chain stores to sell online or dealing heroin.

I would imagine that more than a few of these men create a portfolio of sources though I’m not sure they really think of it that way. Take for example a hypothetical guy in a rural area who lives with his grandmother rent free (he does help her with the garden some). This guy also does some cash carpentry work hunts for game gets some food off his ex-wife’s WIC and helps his brother sell some weed. Can you get by this way? Some men probably are. Is this the new American way? For some men it probably is.

That example perhaps and to be sure of all of the above I think go a long way toward explaining that chart from the beginning of the story the one that shows the labor participation rate falling off a cliff over the past seven decades. And speaking of charts another striking one came to mind when I was writing this which I put here below. It shows U.S. GDP over the same time period as the labor participation rate.

Chart of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product over time courtesy of the St. Louis Federal Reserve (St. Louis Federal Reserve)

Of course the line on this GDP chart is inversely correlated with the line on the labor participation graph. And I think there is a relationship between the two. Which is to say the wealthier our nation has become over the decades the less men are working. Fact is there is just a ton of money sloshing around in our country. And men seem to be able to get their hands on it whether obtained legally borrowed leeched off of or stolen.

It seems like working legally to provide for yourself in America is really just one option these days.

This is more of a ""Did you know?"" sort of topic but it can save you potentially hundreds of dollars in a single transaction.

You've probably heard of foreign transaction fees. They're arbitrary fees (usually around 3% of the charged amount) your credit card issuer imposes for using your card internationally. Swipe your card at a taco truck in Tijuana Mexico and you could be charged 3% more than had you purchased the same taco 100 feet north in San Diego.

But did you know that you can be charged a foreign transaction fee even if your feet are planted in the middle of Kansas? It may have already happened to you and you simply didn't notice.

The secret: Credit cards with no foreign transaction fee

In truth your credit card isn't particular about your actual geographical location. It's more about the location where your credit card transaction is processed.

If you're buying products online reserving a hotel room purchasing a flight etc. you may be charged a foreign transaction fee. You can often sniff out the fee before making your purchase however. Here are a few telltale signs:

Your purchase is from a foreign country.

You make a purchase from a site whose default language is not English.

Your purchase is in a foreign currency.

When you prompt a transaction with a merchant outside the U.S. your purchase may be categorized as ""foreign"" despite the fact that you're sitting in your living room. You may even be purchasing from a U.S.-based website that deals with overseas vendors and still fall victim to the 3% fee (Amazon has been known for this).

Early in my credit card career I was burned by foreign transaction fees while sitting in front of my computer. I was booking travel on a foreign airline website using the native site and paying in the local currency (some airlines charge less if you use the native site instead of the ""U.S. version""). It doesn't happen anymore because I almost exclusively use cards that waive foreign transaction fees. Here are some of our favorites:

Chase Sapphire Preferred Card.

Chase Sapphire Reserve.

Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card.

The Platinum Card® from American Express (see rates and fees).

If you're using any sort of travel credit card your foreign transaction fees are almost certainly waived. If you're new to the credit card world there are also plenty of no-annual-fee credit cards that waive foreign transaction fees too:

Hilton Honors American Express Card (see rates and fees).

Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card.

Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card.

Bank of America® Travel Rewards credit card.

Bottom line

Just because you're in the U.S. doesn't mean you won't be charged foreign transaction fees. If you're making purchases on the internet there's a possibility you'll get dinged.

Whether you're buying products from an offshore company reserving hotels overseas or booking a flight on a foreign airline the safe bet is to use a credit card that waives foreign transaction fees because 3% in fees can add up in a hurry.

There are lots of things that go into Met Gala prep. Kim Kardashian had to learn the art of breathing in a corset for example. If you’re Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That’s five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal’s the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use “at least” two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have “water as hot as you can take it.” Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then “drink tons of water” and “off to bed early.” Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there’s no way you wouldn’t be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that’s like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don’t think it’s a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel’s method could have negative side effects. “Overuse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose” she told the website.

Long story short you don’t need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and — I’m just guessing on this one — so will your pipes. (That much salt can’t be good for them right?)

Viator drummed on Disincarnate's 1993 sole album Dreams Of The Carrion Kind (headed up by former Obituary Death and Testament guitarist James Murphy) and played keyboards on Acid Bath's 1996 record Paegan Terrorism Tactics.

News of Viator's death comes from a post by Murphy. We wish Viator's friends and family all the best at this time.

""RIP Disincarnate drummer Tommy Viator pictured here to the far left in 1993"" wrote Murphy. ""I have no idea what happened I just know that he is gone.

""Tommy was a key element to the band's sound with a drumming style all his own… he helped make the Dreams of the Carrion Kind album heavy as hell without a single blast beat at least not as that technique is known today. He was wearing my leather in this pic I don't really remember why.

""We just spoke back at the beginning of April and he seemed to be in good spirits and having some positive musical activities and plans with musicians local to him near his home in Louisiana. I'm glad we had that conversation and I'm very glad that I let him know that I appreciated him at the end of it. I would've said so much more if I had known but we never know."""

“Excited and a little bit terrified.” That’s how Dr Emma McCahon remembers feeling when she was tasked with opening and running the state’s biggest vaccination centre.

Dr Emma McCahon

Emma is the executive director of Qudos Bank Arena Vaccination Centre which has the capacity to vaccinate an incredible 30000 people per day or 1800 people per hour.

In its first month of operation over 210000 people were vaccinated – an especially impressive effort when you consider how quickly the team got moving.

“From when we were told to go to when we opened the doors it was 12 days” Emma said.

“It’s a huge project; much bigger than anything I’ve done before and really exciting. So it was quite terrifying to think oh this is big and we have to pull this off to keep Sydney safe.

“But at the same time it’s really exciting to actually see the whole team come together to make it work.”

It’s a departure from Emma’s usual role as director of medical services at Western Sydney Local Health District seeing her make calls about everything from infrastructure to ponchos.

She also no longer manages just doctors but a multidisciplinary team including nurse immunisers Qantas staff Baxter Healthcare pharmacists allied health Qudos Bank Arena staff and student vaccination workers from an array of disciplines.



In its first month of operation over 210000 people were vaccinated at Qudos Bank Arena Vaccination Centre.

“When you walk around the floor people are just really excited that they’re doing a good job and I’m so proud. We’re such an amazing team” Emma said.

“As a leader in health if you’re very clear on where you want to get to and why it is important the team will follow you. If you say this is what we need to do and it’s important and they can see that it’s going to make a huge difference they’ll just step up time and time and time again.”

Emma said she’s looking forward to getting back to travel – and actually had a moment while setting up Qudos Bank Arena sitting on the floor charging her laptop that reminded her of the light at the end of the tunnel.

“I think the last time I did that was at an airport! And that reminded me: that’s what we’re trying to do we’re trying to make things normal again” Emma said.

“I think this is probably the most important thing I’ll do in my entire career. It’ll probably have the most impact and be the thing that I remember and be really proud of.

“Sometimes change is scary and doing things differently is scary but I think the team here have stepped up to make a difference. Now the call out is to the public. Come and get vaccinated.”

This was Chiefs’ second successive defeat in a week. A week ago they were beaten 2-0 by champions Mamelodi Sundowns in Tshwane. Chiefs will be disappointed by the results given their championship aspirations.

That loss away from home saw some of their supporters complain over the selection of Baxter who had once again overlooked the Defender of the Season Njabulo Ngcobo. But the Bafana international was handed his debut at home. But Ngcobo had a debut to forget as he played a role in their first goal they conceded. But it won’t only be Ngcobo who’ll be disappointed with his debut given the fact that Brandon Petersen also had to pick up the ball from the back of his net four times. Meanwhile it was a happy day in camp for Royal AM and Victor Letsoalo who bagged a brace. This was Royal AM’s second win in a row after beating Chippa United. Credit should go to coach John Maduka for his player management.

Following that defeat to Sundowns Chiefs needed a response if they were going to reshape their campaign. Coach Stuart Baxter meanwhile made two changes with Petersen and Ngcobo replacing Bruce Bvuma and Austin Dube. The visitors were the first team to test the waters. Given Mashikinya sent a high weighted ball which found striker Victor Letsoalo. Letsoalo chest-trapped well before turning and putting his close-range against the upright of Petersen goals. Chiefs though responded with a baptism of fire against a Royal AM defence that was enduring a nervy start. Khama Billiat should have found the match opener but his side footed low effort rolled past the far post of Hugo Nyame.

With great interplay in the engine room between Cole Alexander and Phathutshedzo Nange there were more in roads to Royal AM’s final third. But Chiefs were lacklustre in front of goal with Samir Nurkovic not getting in the right channels. But it was Alexander who missed a shot that they’d go on to regret in the first half. Against the run of play Billiat set free the latter who was one-on-one with Nyame. But Alexander unceremoniously put his last effort wide of an open net. Royal AM though would find the lead after some poor defending from Chiefs. Levy Mashiane sent a curling effort which caught Ngcobo and Eric Mathoho napping. The loose ball found Letsoalo whose diving header sailed past Petersen.

Royal AM were unfortunate not to head to the interval with a two-goal cushion. On the edge of the penalty Mashiane laid the ball nicely for Tebogo Potsane but his high-flying shot was exceptionally parried over the crossbar by Petersen. Chiefs started the second half with vigour. As a result Keagan Dolly nearly found the equaliser after being put through by Billiat but the latter’s shot was saved by Nyame while Nurkovic’s shot from the resultant rebound was judged for an offside. Letsoalo though got their second with a trademark free-kick which left Petersen flat-footed. But while Chiefs appeared to respond with a Sifiso Hlanti set-piece Sibusiso Mabiliso came off the bench to concede a late own goal for Amakhosi.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkaXNraXRpbWVzLmNvLnphL2xvY2FsL2JpbGxpYXQtc2VuZHMtcm95YWwtYW0td2FybmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billiat Sends Royal AM Warning,"Kaizer Chiefs star Khama Billiat has sent a warning to his Amakhosi teammates ahead of their clash against Royal AM.

Billiat says they are working hard to improve their performances and results more especially in the scoring department and it could bring some positive results.

Chiefs have won one game drawn one and lost one game in the league so far after three games have been played in the DStv Premiership.

Nonetheless the Zimbabwean international star has admitted that the newcomers Royal AM could surprise them if they take them lightly.

“It’s always risky to play a team labelled as a small team there is no longer a small team in the league as every game we play is a tough game and a must-win game for us” he told the club’s media department.

“The results are not always the way people predict it’s tougher now but it can only make us better to find a way to overcome all of those tough opponents.

“With all the respect being new in the league does not mean you are new to winning games. They have been winning games from where they come from in the past.

“They are a good side and all we need to do is to be on top of our game on the day. We are looking at ourselves and trying to get as many good things as we can take to the game and make sure we convert the chances.”

Billiat also addressed his side’s start of the campaign saying their is a good energy around the team.

“We would have wanted to start very strong but it is not bad. We are still positive and are seeing good things in terms of movement and commitment the energy around the team is great” he added.

“We are looking good in training and we need to bring it to the game we need to take the chances that the team is creating.”

“It is amazing to be in a team that creates a lot of chances it gives you more opportunities to be on the score sheet and help the team in the best way that you can.”

“I think it’s a positive indication that we are getting there we are working on taking the chances we are creating which will help the team get the maximum points. We are working on it every day.

After a stellar debut season in top-flight football with Swallows FC Ngcobo scooped the PSL Defender of the Season award in June. But he made the switch from Dobsonville to Naturena when the transfer window opened about three months ago.

At Chiefs he was expected to fit in like a glove and become an instant regular. But that hasn't happened. He had to watch from the stands or the bench in their first four games. That shocked fans given that he was a Bafana Bafana player. He impressed during his cameo against Ghana in the 2022 World Cup qualifier while he was instrumental when they claimed the Cosafa Cup. Baxter though said he won't get an “automatic passport” to his team because of his selection at Bafana. However the Brit finally handed Ngcobo his full debut against Royal AM. But it was a day to forget for the 27-year-old at the office as Chiefs were hammered 4-1 by Royal AM at FNB Stadium. Ngcobo looked out of place for the better part of the game.

“He's going to make mistakes he's going to give us some strength. But the same as every player I think the screaming after ‘push him in push him in' doesn't help him. It doesn't help anybody” said Baxter. ALSO READ: WATCH: Embarrassed Chiefs' coach Baxter admits to poor decision making and costly mistakes “I gave him the game tonight because I thought it was the right game to go in. I wanted him to drive forward a little bit with the ball on his side and dominate a little bit because of the way they play. But it was his first game. He did okay but he could do a lot better.”

Ngcobo wasn't the only player who had a debut to forget given that goalkeeper Brandon Petersen conceded four goals. Prior to the game Petersen hadn't played an official match since he last featured for Wits in August last year. “I thought his distribution was good in the first half. His calmness was also quite good. But whenever he had to make a save it was the last big save. I don't think it was a very easy game for Brandon in that respect” said Baxter. It appears that Chiefs struggled all round at home as Baxter believes that marquee signing Keagan Dolly was not at his best on the day as well. Dolly has been Chiefs' livewire since the start of the season also contributing in the revival of Khama Billiat.

But against Royal AM he wasn't as sharp as he was against Mamelodi Sundowns TS Galaxy and Baroka FC. Baxter says it may be due to a lack of regular game time in the last four seasons at Ligue 1 side Montpellier. “Keagan had done better in his previous game than he did tonight. I thought he showed some flashes of his quality but he didn't show the consistency. “I thought when you've been out as he has you push and push but breathe out a little bit” Baxter said."

Warren Buffett had at least three chances to bail out Lehman Brothers before the investment bank collapsed in September 2008 fueling the global financial crisis. The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO rejected the first two invitations and a technology mix-up meant he didn't get the third one.

Buffett has repeatedly underscored the severity of the situation in the fall of 2008 when investors were pulling billions of dollars out of money-market funds and credit markets were frozen.

It was ""as close to a total meltdown throughout the financial system as you can imagine"" Buffett said at Berkshire's 2008 shareholder meeting. ""We really were looking into the abyss at that time.""

""I describe it as an economic Pearl Harbor"" he told Vice News in 2018 a decade after the financial crisis began.

Lehman CEO Richard Fuld first called Buffett in March 2008 to suggest Berkshire inject several billion dollars into the ailing bank the investor told CNBC in 2018.

Buffett was open to the idea and spent a night in his office scouring hundreds of pages of Lehman's latest financial reports. He jotted down every red flag he spotted and soon had a lengthy list.

""There was clearly a lot of trouble there"" Buffett told The Wall Street Journal in 2018.

""I just saw a lot of things that made me very worried about their financial condition and what would be happening to them under the circumstances that were happening on Wall Street"" the investor told CNBC.

Lehman executives tried their luck again in the weeks before the bank's collapse Reuters reported. However Buffett rejected the overture and dismissed the idea of an investment as ""unrealistic.""

Barclays' president at the time Bob Diamond called Buffett in September 2008. The British bank was looking to buy Lehman and he asked Buffett if Berkshire would insure Lehman's trades until Barclays shareholders could vote on the prospective deal.

Buffett was staying at a hotel at the time and asked Diamond to fax him the details he told CNBC. However the Barclays boss was operating out of the Federal Reserve and couldn't find a fax machine so he left Buffett a voicemail instead. The investor didn't notice and only heard it the following summer when his daughter spotted it and played it for him.

Regardless Buffett told CNBC that he couldn't have offered the sweeping guarantee that Diamond wanted.

""It would have been an unlimited exposure that wouldn't have made sense"" he said especially ""with the whole world falling apart.""

While Berkshire had the cash to swoop in and save Lehman Buffett dismissed the idea that doing so would have prevented the financial crisis. ""I really don't think the world would have changed"" he said.

While Buffett said no to Lehman he noted in his 2010 shareholder letter that Berkshire deployed about $16 billion in the 25 days after the bank filed for bankruptcy on September 15 2008. For example it made vital investments in Goldman Sachs General Electric and other struggling businesses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVld2Fsay5jb20vYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LXllbGxvdy1icmtlcnMtbWVldC1hbmQtZ3JlYXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Berkshire Hathaway Yellow BRK'ers Meet And Great,"If your planning to go to the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting the Yellow BRK’ers Meet and Greet is a great event for a first timer and anyone else:

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Art & Sciences in 2002 inducted into the Junior Achievement National Business Hall of Fame in 2003.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8xOC9ob3ctY2VsZWJyaXR5LXZhbGV0cy1wYXJrLW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLWNhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How celebrity valets park the world's most expensive cars,"Matt Farah is something of a parking expert. In his 10 years as an automotive authority and podcast host he has reviewed owned raced and filmed reviews of more than 1500 cars without a single parking mishap.

Last year in Culver City Calif. he opened Westside Collector Car Storage a kind of Soho House meets EZ Park that offers members everything from detailing and repair service to private airport chauffeurs and cocktail hours. Every procedure that happens in the $1500-a-year clubhouse garage has been intensely thought-out and itemized in a 26-page employee handbook including two full pages on how to properly park a car.

The first thing Farah tells anyone he employs to handle the cars owned by some of the world’s major collectors is simple: Do not rush anything.

“It is important to always be slow and methodical” Farah’s self-written parking tome states. “Give yourself plenty of time to move the needed cars so that you never have to rush while a member waits. Rushing is where vehicle damage happens.”

It’s an aspect of car ownership to which everyone can relate—more so with powerful autos wherein a gentle press on the gas pedal or slip of the clutch can send them surging forward. Some pay more dearly for parking mistakes than others.

Even the most benign maneuver in one of the supercars and classics stored at WCCS if executed poorly can cause thousands of dollars in damage.

Curb a rim on a McLaren? That’ll be $5000 to replace. Ding a door on a Ferrari Dino? The starting price for repairs exceeds $10000 at least in Southern California. Scratch the special factory-ordered paint job on a Porsche 911 Turbo? Count on $50000 just to try to match the color—plus the irreversible double-digit percentage loss in overall value from the once-pristine collectable.

For Eli Kogan the founder and owner of Otto Car Club in Scottsdale Ariz. which houses up to 225 cars in 49000 square feet of air-conditioned space the most important part of flawless parking is maintaining spatial awareness.

“Being able to judge the space judge the angle and have awareness of how big your car is how wide your car is and how wide the spot is—that solves everything” Kogan says. People who can park anything have it he says. Those who can’t don’t.

Excellent spatial awareness is an ongoing skill. Appraise a car’s length width and height while outside it and again evaluate how long wide and low it is once you’re seated—even with a vehicle you think you know well.

Take driving: Some people may zoom down the highway and have to look around four times to see who is near before they change lanes while a good driver already knows what is going on in the vicinity because he or she has maintained a mental catalogue of what is happening.

Parking similarly requires that you use your eyesight and the car’s mirrors. Don’t rely exclusively on parking cameras Kogan says. The technology offers a nice modern crutchbut the camera can distort distance and depth and never offers a full-view picture of what is happening around the car.

“Try to make it like if you had X-ray vision and you can actually see the wheels” says Tony Rackley who transports and parks multimillion-dollar investment-grade cars for a living as head of the Specialties Division at Classic Automotive Relocation Services in Gardena Calif.

“One should really—while sitting in the car” he continues “be able to know the points of the car look to their left and right to know: OK my left front is there my right front is there and then look over your shoulder and see where the C pillar is—that sort of thing.”

There’s no shame in using a spotter Rackley says. In fact having someone watch angles as one parks is mandatory at both WCCS and Otto.

“No matter how many times you’ve parked the car no matter how confident you are or how small the car is we do not park the car without a spotter” says Kogan. “Four eyes to the car is the rule.”

The other little trick pro drivers and enthusiasts know is that backing a car into a spot is far more amenable to managing a tight turn or a tricky angle thanks to a tighter turning circle. A head-in parking job also exposes you to the risk of scraping the underside of the car’s nose which in supercars is typically lower than the rear for improved aerodynamics and downforce.

“Always back the car in” Kogan says. “I do it with my EarthCruiser which is huge but still can park in any parking lot. Our semi-truck at work I always park this way too. In fact any car I park I always back in.”

Parallel parking of course is a distinct skill for which practice makes perfect. Use cones in an empty parking lot and practice 100 times Kogan recommends. Or try it in real life on a street with little cross traffic.

When you have a $300000 Ferrari under your control the imperative to do well is heightened because it’s likely that everyone on the street will be watching. This means no curbing the wheels which is expensive to fix time-consuming to replace and embarrassing in the first place or tapping the bumper of the car on either side; that light kiss may be virtually de rigueur in Manhattan but it’s extremely impolite elsewhere.

A final note that any valet worth his salt knows: Never park underneath trees.

Corrosive bird poop is one thing but with a precious paint job even petals are problematic. As an official Rolls-Royce instruction manual for chauffeurs puts it: “Don’t park the car under Lime trees when in blossom.”"

I’ve been holding back on this article for a while because I wanted to find some more out there in the wild before Speculators dig them out. Many collectors know about the mini-comics that used to come with DVDs. But like Funko Pops Walmart Best Buy Target or name your big brand store could have their own special version made and sometimes the special feature would be a mini-comic connected to the movie. I have collected a few of these in the past as a novelty but I did not know they came with a DVD. They always end up in dollar sales. My only copy of Amazing Spider-man 50 came Included in the Special Boxed Edition of Spider-Man 2 (2004) Movie. I know I am going to miss some and there are going to be some I can find mentioned but no pictures. I am just going to list a few and then share an unverified list I found.

I am only focusing on a few comics that came with DVDs. I know mini-comics came in many forms with mail-away promotions and cereal boxes but DVDs are my focus.

Spiderman

Amazing Fantasy #15 (Sony DVD Promo) Included in Special Boxed Edition of Spider-Man 1 (2002)

Amazing Spider-Man #50 (Sony DVD Mini-Comic) Included in Special Boxed Edition of Spider-Man 2 (2004) Movie

Amazing Spider-Man #6 (Walmart DVD Promo) Mini Comic Book + Sneak Peek Bonus DVD

Amazing Spider-man 300 Included Walmart DVD special pack I regularly open used copies of Spiderman 2 in hopes of finding this mini-comic. From the packaging I wonder if the comic was in the DVD or next to it.

There are probably more Spiderman mini-comics out there but I check every used animated Spiderman disc I come across and I haven’t seen one. The last few movies have been great but since most people buy their movies digitally there may not be the demand for gimmicks to sell fancy special DVDs in stores.

Other Random Marvel Minis

Fantastic Four 72 Included in a Walmart DVD for X-men Not sure why it came with an X-men DVD

X-men Last Stand Included in the Stan Lee Collectors edition

Fantastic Four 50 Another comic I found in a dollar bin years ago.

Incredible Hulk 181 Included in the Hulk vs. DVD This is the DVD I found with a comic that I didn’t know about. It sent me diving through hundreds of DVDs at my local used bookstore in hopes of finding another.

I’m going to pause here and mention of course Topher with True First mentioned a bunch of these a few years ago. I am going to mention a few more that I know of but as always use the search feature on the site whenever you have a crazy book you want to know about. Topher has probably done the research.

It seems that every few years people try and collect data on which DVD mini-comics are out there. Some become very popular to track down like The Good Morty (first appearance) a little mini pamphlet that only came with DVDs/Blue rays from a certain store. I’ve found two of these before. I check Rick and Morty Season 1 every time I’m at a used media store. Others get taken to used media stores to be bought and resold multiple times and the comics are either trashed or lost.

eBay is no help because many times you might find a mini-comic claiming to come from a DVD but the DVD is not listed. I want to find the DVDs in the wild with the book inside. This doesn’t increase the value but many times a forgotten DVD comic is cheaper as a DVD than as a comic.



I found a forum from 2010 trying to start a list.

The Appleseed Ex Machina 2-disc Steelbook (48-page Shirow Masamune Appleseed manga “Called Game”)

X-Men The Last Stand Limited Collector’s Set (bound new story- “Xavier Magneto & Stan”)

As you can see from this DVD forum list there are some comics I knew about and there are some that have ? marks because they had not been confirmed. In Topher’s list/article you get some pictures and information. The one I really want to see pictures of is the Iron man comic which came with Event Horizon. I just think that is such an odd pairing. Event Horizon really messed with my teenage head.

Since 2010 there have been a few more to come out with comics but I am not sure which stores carried the exclusives. Here’s some more to add to the list according to eBay listings

Wolverine 1 (Frank Miller) included with Wolverine movie (2013)

Flash DVD Special Issue (2005)

Spiderman 3 special edition had 3 mini-mini comics Marvel Adventures 6 Amazing Spiderman 252 and Web of Spiderman 1

Chuck Special Edition DVD Best Buy

Incredible Hulk 91 ?

X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST (REPRINTS 141/142 MINI COMIC (dvd promo)! 2014

Hitman 47 – Agent 47 mini comic(2010)

Wonder Woman Animated (2009)

wrap up

I probably missed a few. Like any article I research I spent time on eBay hoping to find some cheap copies of what I am writing about. No surprise the Marvel Mini-Comics of major keys are the most expensive. The Fantastic Four Silver Surfer and ASM 300 comics are the prizes. I guess Hulk 181 isn’t as big because they also did a mini-comic that came with a toy car. These might even be identical copies. There aren’t too many mini-comics graded so to have Silver Surfer 1 Mini-comic in high grade is awesome. After seeing some of these prices I will definitely pay closer attention to these books and I have added a few more DVDs to pick out at the store.

The Shawshank Redemption 4K Blu-ray Review

A stunning 4K steelbook edition of The Shawshank Redemption.

Reviewed by Neil Lumbard September 19 2021

The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest cinematic achievements in motion-picture history. Based on the short novel by Stephen King (It Carrie) The Shawshank Redemption is an epic tale featuring first-rate performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. A timeless classic.

Charged with murdering his wife and her other lover (despite his claims of innocence) Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) becomes close friends with fellow inmate Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman) while staying in the Shawshank State Penitentiary (while serving two consecutive life sentences). As the two prisoners bond with each other hope and redemption become possible through their own determination for good-will. An exploration of the human spirit told with superb vitality.

The performances are at the heart of The Shawshank Redemption. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are both exceptional in the film. The story required a great deal out of both actors  putting the cast to the test. Robbins performance is nuanced and layered. Freeman imbues his performance with a great sophistication that helps the storytelling come to life.

The production design by Terence Marsh (The Hunt for Red October The Green Mile) is stunning to behold: presenting the filmmaking with layers of creativity. The large scale production design has a impressive scope. There is superb artistry throughout the production design.



A timeless classic.

The costumes by Elizabeth McBride (Thelma & Louise Fried Green Tomatoes) make an impression as well. The designs are well-suited to each character in the film. The Shawshank Redemption is full of creative costumes establishing the time and mood of the piece. McBride did a superb job.

The lush cinematography by Roger Deakins (Blade Runner 2049 No Country for Old Men) is one of the greatest assets of the filmmaking. Deakins is one of the most gifted cinematographers in cinema: crafting so many compelling visuals that audiences are easily transported by the story. A visually sumptuous effort Deakins delivered one of his most creative efforts with The Shawshank Redemption.

The music score composed by Thomas Newman (1917 Skyfall) provides The Shawshank Redemption with a sense of poetic grace which carries throughout the filmmaking. Newman provides a score that never seems over-the-top. Instead Newman provides the film with a real sense of depth and pathos.

Written for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont (The Mist The Green Mile) The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece that ranks among the best films ever made. Darabont delivered one of his greatest efforts with the film (his first of several feature-films adapting the works of Stephen King: The Green Mile and The Mist would follow). There is magic in every frame  and Darabont proves himself a master craftsman.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vZmFjZS1vZmYvYW5kcm9pZC10di12cy1maXJlLXR2LXdoaWNoLXNtYXJ0LXR2LW9zLWlzLWJldHRlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Android TV vs. Fire TV: Which smart TV OS is better?,"It’s hard to find a TV today that isn’t smart — meaning it‘s connected to the Internet and able to run apps — and many of those are running Fire TV or Android TV. Having a smart TV means you don’t have to bother with a separate streaming stick and you can get to your streaming services a bit easier. Choosing one with Android TV or Fire TV also means you get a top-tier virtual assistant too.

Fire TV is available on TVs from Toshiba and Best Buy’s Insignia brand including the Toshiba C350 Fire TV and Insignia F30 Fire TV Edition (2020 model) . Android TV can be found on Sony Hisense and TCL TVs such as the Sony Bravia X800H and Hisense U8G Android TV (65U8G) .

Both Android TV and Fire TV can do a lot; the right one for you will likely come down to which experience you like better — and which virtual assistant you already use.

Android TV vs. Fire TV: Navigation and interface

Android TV and Fire TV each feature horizontal layouts with long screens that you scroll down to browse. Until recently the difference between the two was the number of menu options. But a big interface redesign for Fire TV has made the two very similar in approaches.

(Image credit: Future)

Android TV features a streamlined menu: Home Discover and Apps. The Home screen has advertised content at the top then gets to favorite apps (which you select). That’s followed by Play Next — shows and movies you’re in the middle of watching or the next episode of a series. What appears after that has a lot to do with the apps you download and can include recommendations from Netflix and YouTube as well as suggestions from the Google Play Store. At the bottom of the page is a link to customize the Home screen where you can choose which app recommendations appear.

The Discover tab is focused more on suggesting content for you based on your apps and viewing choices. You can also tell Android TV what you like to get more personalized recommendations. You have to opt in to personalization to see recommendations on the Discover tab. The Apps tab shows you everything you’ve downloaded and features a link to the Google Play Store to find more.

(Image credit: Future)

With the update Fire TV also has three menu items: Home Find and Live. Previously it had a long list of menu options: Home Live Your Videos Free Movies TV Shows Apps and Settings.

The Home screen starts with ads for shows and movies some related to apps and services you have some not. Below that you see the menu and to the right of the menu are your apps. You can change which apps appear there by going to Your Apps and Channels. The Home screen also shows Recently Watched a list of sponsored links and then Recently Used Apps. As you scroll down the screen you’ll see Prime Video recommendations mixed in with content from other apps such as Netflix.

Find is where you browse for movies and shows. You can search or delve into topics or categories. Live shows you what’s on now based on any live streaming apps you have and offers links to live streaming apps.

If Prime Video is your main service Fire TV works very well. If you don’t subscribe to Prime or aren’t a fan of its options the Amazon focus of Fire TV will likely get in your way.

Winner: Android TV. Both are very similar but Android TV offers more flexibility.

Android TV vs. Fire TV: App selection

Both Android TV and Fire TV have just about every app you could want available. Recent omissions such as Apple TV on Android TV and Peacock and HBOMax on Fire TV have been addressed.

(Image credit: Future)

The Google Play Store shows featured and recommended apps and games on its main screen and you can also search by voice or by typing. As you type suggestions appear below to speed your discovery. But the fastest way to find an app is to use Google Assistant.

(Image credit: Future)

The Appstore channel on Fire TV is where you get new apps and games. The App Library shows you the apps you’ve downloaded while Featured offered suggested downloads. If you don’t see what you’re looking for there the All Categories tab offers 27 themes to dig into. Unfortunately there’s no easy search option that’s focused on apps. But you can always ask Alexa — as with Android TV voice search is your fastest way if you already know what you’re looking for.

Winner: Tie

Android TV vs. Fire TV: Search

With so much content available search becomes a key part of a smart TV. You want to be able to find shows and movies as well as apps.

As mentioned using voice search is often the easiest way to find things. Both smart OSes also let you type your query and suggest terms as you type.

(Image credit: Future)

On Fire TV a search for “Paul Newman” brought up options from services I subscribe to and showed other movies and TV shows he’s featured in. It also suggested apps such as YouTube where I could also search for the name. When I searched for The Color of Money the TV showed a page with the movie similar results but also apps that had nothing to do with the movie.

(Image credit: Future)

On Android TV a search for “Paul Newman” produced a page with some info from Wikipedia YouTube videos that feature the actor and movies and shows that he’s in. The screen also features related searches. When I did the The Color of Money search I got a summary of the film including IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes scores. I also could see which of my services I could stream from along with the cost. The Android TV result was much more useful.

Winner: Android TV

Android TV vs. Fire TV: Voice recognition

This is a battle between Goliaths — Alexa on Fire TV and Google Assistant on Android TV — and you probably already have a voice assistant preference. Both work very well within a TV though the processor your TV includes plays a role in how fast voice recognition works and on some models the virtual assistant is hands free while on others you have to push a button on the remote.

In the smart TV setting voice recognition is becoming more important than ever. You can get your TV to do all sorts of things with just your voice. Both Android TV and Fire TV can adjust the volume launch apps and perform searches based on what you ask. You can also use the virtual assistants to tell you the weather play music and more — anything you can do with an Alexa speaker or Google Assistant speaker.

Winner: Tie

Android TV vs. Fire TV: Privacy and advertising

Let’s face it: both Amazon and Google want to know as much about you as possible and push its services. Fire TV and Android TV are just another platform for them to do so. But you can take some control of the information each gathers.

(Image credit: Future)

Fire TV opts you in to tracking by default but you can turn some off. Go to Settings > Preferences > Privacy. There you can switch off collecting of personal data for marketing collection of over-the-air TV content and use of interest-based ads. You can also reset your advertising ID.

(Image credit: Future)

Android TV makes it pretty hard to find how to adjust your privacy settings. Go to Settings > Device Preferences > About > Legal Information > Ads and you’ll find a way to turn off ad personalization. Android TV also makes you opt in to the Discover tab to receive personalized movie and show recommendations — which is good but once I opted in I couldn’t find a way to opt back out.

Winner: Fire TV but neither puts your privacy first.

Android TV vs. Fire TV: Smart home

With the virtual assistants baked into Android TV and Fire TV your TV can become the hub of your smart home. You can turn on your lights close the garage door and much more while you’re watching your favorite show.

The best one for you is the one that works with your existing smart home devices. If you favor Google Assistant Android TV will work seamlessly with what you have. Same thing for Alexa.

Winner: Tie

Android TV vs. Fire TV: Which one wins?

You can’t lose with either of these smart TV systems. Both have all the apps you want and great virtual assistants. The new update for Fire TV makes the interface almost the same as Android TV. Fire TV generally requires less tinkering than Android TV to get the most out of it but Android TV can deliver a better overall experience if you’re looking for robust smart TV features.

Strictly speaking Android TV wins by a nose thanks largely to its superior search and navigation though the two smart TV platforms are closely matched on every front.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Android TV Fire TV Navigation ✓ Row 0 - Cell 2 App selection ✓ ✓ Search ✓ Row 2 - Cell 2 Voice recognition ✓ ✓ Privacy and advertising Row 4 - Cell 1 ✓ Smart home ✓ ✓ Overall 5 4

In reality the right one for you is likely the one that matches the virtual assistant you prefer: Alexa or Google Assistant. The smart TV platform is just another medium for those tools. However if you don’t have Amazon Prime or any Alexa devices Android TV will be a better choice."

Yet its parent is among the industry’s leaders in investor ratings for environmental and social policies.

Golden Agri Resources Ltd. acknowledged in February that its Golden Veroleum Liberia (GVL) unit hadn’t done enough to compensate local residents for business practices that included razing part of one of the planet’s richest biodiversity regions. Among the company’s shareholders is BlackRock Inc. the world’s largest asset manager whose chairman Larry Fink has made combating climate change a focus for the $9.5 trillion of assets his firm manages.

Part of Golden Agri’s attraction for investors is that it tops a global list of more than two dozen agricultural producers and wholesalers for its environmental efforts and ranks fourth on social-related issues according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And while the industry’s performance as a whole isn’t good — Golden Agri rose to the top of the environment chart with a score of only 4 out of 10 — it makes the company the best of the pack for investors that need to keep a diverse portfolio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy92aWRlb3MvMjAyMS0wOS0yMC9iaWxsLWdhdGVzLWxhcnJ5LWZpbmstb24tY2xlYW4tZW5lcmd5LXB1c2gtdmlkZW_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bill Gates Larry Fink on Clean-Energy Push,"Why did this happen?

Griggs has made four changes in personnel to his starting XV from the Round 1 defeat to Spain at Stadio Sergio Lanfranchi with Laura Feely Sam Monaghan Edel McMahon and Eve Higgins coming into the side.

Ciara Griffin captains Ireland for the Round 2 clash against the host nation as Griggs’ side bid to bounce back and keep their hopes of automatic qualification for next year’s Rugby World Cup from this tournament alive.

Higgins’ return to the Ireland midfield alongside Sene Naoupu – restoring their partnership from the Women’s Six Nations – is the only change to the backline from last weekend with Eimear Considine Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe and Beibhinn Parsons continuing in an unchanged back three.

Kathryn Dane and Stacey Flood are named at scrum-half and out-half once again with Feely coming into the Ireland front row alongside Linda Djougang and Cliodhna Moloney for her 21st cap.

Having made her debut off the bench in Round 1 Monaghan is set for her first Test start in the second row alongside Nichola Fryday while McMahon’s inclusion in the back row sees Griffin revert back to number eight with Dorothy Wall continuing at blindside flanker.

Neve Jones Lindsay Peat Leah Lyons Brittany Hogan and Claire Molloy are named on the bench while Emily Lane Enya Breen and Lauren Delany once again provide Griggs with the backline cover.

Commenting ahead of the game the Ireland Head Coach said: “After a difficult result last weekend we have collectively put the head down this week conducted honest reviews and identified the areas we need to improve. We have implemented and executed those improvements in training and that gives us confidence going into Sunday.

“Italy will present a challenge particularly with a home crowd behind them but we are familiar with their threats and have left no stone unturned in our preparations for this game.”

Sunday’s game is live for supporters in the Republic of Ireland on the RTÉ Player while the action will also be streamed live across rugbyworldcup.com/2021 Rugby World Cup Facebook and Twitter channels and on World Rugby’s YouTube channel.

The couple got engaged at Inchydoney beach in December 2019 and more than a year and a half later headed for Ventry to exchange vows.

Hannah Glynn and Michael Grogan in Kerry

Hannah from Crecora in Co Limerick and Mallow Co Cork and Michael from Blackrock Road Cork City first met in March 2016 via dating app Tinder. “Michael always slags me over the 10 days I left him waiting for a reply but I was over in Abu Dhabi on holiday at the time visiting my friend who was working there” said Hannah.

“It was not all via Tinder as we had several friends in common so we were both able to conduct some 'background checks' before agreeing to a first date!”

Three years later Michael got down on one knee at Inchydoney to propose.

Noel and Mary Glynn Hannah and Michael Gwen and Jim Grogan

Fast-forward to July 2021 and they were married in St Caitlín’s Church Ventry by Canon Michael Moynihan.

The newlyweds celebrated with a reception in the Dingle Skellig Hotel where manager Rosarii Galvin proved the perfect wedding co-ordinator.

“We both have a grá for the sea and the ocean so chose a hotel on the coast. Hannah has been coming on holidays to Castlegregory all her life so is very familiar with Dingle” said Michael.

We are family: Hannah Sam and Michael

Having their 12-week-old baby Sam celebrate with them made the day extra magical for Hannah and Michael.

“Baby Sam arrived prematurely on Easter Monday April 5 2021 at 36 weeks’ gestation — this was the best surprise Easter present we could have ever dreamt of” said Hannah.

“The staff in CUMH were amazing in particular my consultant Dr Moya McMenamin. I am a doctor myself in CUMH so it was a great experience being taken care of by colleagues and friends. Michael was allowed in for the labour but only spent a few hours with our precious Sam before he had to leave. He didn’t see us again until we were discharged from the hospital 48 hours after the delivery — that was a long wait for him.”

Mary Hannah and Noel Glynn

Toasting to their future happiness were the bride’s parents Mary and Noel Glynn and the groom’s mother and father Gwen and Jim Grogan.

Alex O'Brien Aislinn Glynn Hannah Glynn Lisa McDonald and Noelle Glynn

Lisa McDonald Hannah’s sister was matron of honour while their sisters Aislinn Glynn Deirdre Glynn and Noelle Glynn were the bridesmaids along with Hannah’s friend Alex O’Brien. “Alex and I studied medicine together in UCC and lived together in college we have remained best friends ever since” said Hannah.

Patrick O'Donnell Denis Lucey Michael and Stephen Grogan David Daly

Joint best men were Michael’s brother Stephen Grogan and best friend Patrick O’Donnell.

His groomsmen were his cousin Denis Lucey and friend David Daly.

Hannah’s nephew and godson Oisín McDonald was the ringbearer while her nephew and Michael’s godson Ruairí Mc Donald was the pageboy.

Michael and Sam Grogan

Their honeymoon saw the newlyweds spend three nights in Trump Doonbeg Resort Co Clare followed by a few nights in Kilrush Co Clare.

Hannah is an obstetrics and gynaecology doctor in CUMH and Michael is a solicitor and has recently joined his father’s practice in Ballintemple Jim Grogan Solicitors.

The newlyweds live in Marina Park on Cork city’s Victoria Road.

Embassy Office Parks REIT is the country's first real estate investment trust (REIT) sponsored by realty firm Embassy group and Blackstone. Embassy REIT got listed on the stock exchanges in April 2019 after raising nearly Rs 5000 crore through a public issue. As per bulk deal data on BSE Blackstone group entities have sold nearly 2.73 crore units at Rs 355 apiece totalling around Rs 969 crore.

However Blackstone group overall sold around 5.7 crore units through multiple trades on stock exchanges to raise about Rs 2025 crore. Not all trades were counted among bulk deals as some were below the threshold limit for such classifications.

As many as 14 entities of Blackstone sold a total of 5.7 crore shares for Rs 2025 crore. Embassy REIT's unit price fell by 4.76 per cent on Wednesday to Rs 355.84 apiece on the BSE. Post this deal Blackstone's unitholding will come down by around 6 per cent to 32 per cent.

Embassy Group has around 12 per cent stake. In June last year as well Blackstone had raised around USD 300 million (about Rs 2270 crore) by selling its shares in Embassy Office Parks REIT. Blackstone has deployed over USD 12.5 billion in the Indian real estate space. Besides Embassy REIT Blackstone has sponsored the country's second REIT -- Mindspace Business Parks REIT. Earlier this year it acquired the office retail and hospitality portfolio of realty firm Prestige group. Blackstone group currently has over USD 50 billion of assets under management in India.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm92aWRlbmNlam91cm5hbC5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sLzIwMjEvMDkvMTgvYmVybmFyZG8tcGVkdXMtZ29hbHMtbGlmdC13ZXN0LXdhcndpY2stb3Zlci1jcmFuc3Rvbi1lYXN0LWZyaWRheS1yb3VuZHVwLzgzODU2ODIwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bernardo Pedus goals lift West Warwick over Cranston East; Friday roundup,"Cristian Bernardo and Nick Pedus scored consecutive goals as West Warwick rallied from a one-goal deficit posted a 3-2 victory over Cranston East in boys Division II soccer.

PE firms use debt in addition to equity capital to make large acquisitions reducing their overall cost of capital and improving their potential returns while also allowing them to make larger acquisitions.

Mint reported earlier this month that Carlyle is looking to raise as much as $1 billion in debt financing to fund its takeover bid of Hexaware Technologies while in June Blackstone raised a similar amount to fund its acquisition of Mphasis Ltd.

“Between November and March there was a lot of demand for acquisition financing in the unlisted space because while listed valuations had run up significantly valuation expectations on the unlisted side were still reasonable. But after March that changed and even on the unlisted side promoters started seeking valuation multiples comparable to listed peers"" said Shantanu Sahai managing director and head of debt at Nomura.

According to Sahai this trend has resulted in a significant shift in the debt market.

“While earlier acquisition financing was underwritten by banks like us and placed in the c in Taiwan EMEA Australian and Southeast Asian banks. Now these higher levels of leverage coupled with additional flexibilities sought by sponsors (PE funds) such as incremental covenant headroom’s cash flow deferrals higher operating leverage headroom’s and higher subordination render commercial banks unable or unwilling to subscribe to this paper per their own risk/investment policies. Hence the entire selling universe of such types of loans has shifted from commercial banks to credit funds and other institutional investor participants"" he said.

This is a new product on the block called “unitranche"" and currently very few banks are servicing this need of the market Sahai said.

“While on the face of it this looks like a product that is just a little bit different from the usual acquisition and leveraged finance product in the sense that maybe the leverage is a little more covenants are looser yields are higher the tenor is longer etc. but the consequence of that is a product that is not capable of being sold in the commercial bank space. So it needs a whole new investor base to sell it"" he said.

View Full Image Funding acquisition

This is an institutionalization of the acquisition and leveraged finance space that has happened in a widespread way in the past three to four months and has happened for the first time in India he added.

Nomura expects the need for acquisition financing to grow strongly in the next 12-18 months on account of both financial sponsors deploying more capital into the country as well as consolidation themes across sectors.

In line with the growing buyout activity in the Indian market the Japanese bank plans to aggressively grow its lending business in India.

“We have closed six deals in the last one quarter and we have a pipeline of close to 17 more deals for this year. We plan to double our balance sheet in the next 12-18 months"" Sahai said.

“Our balance sheet deployment and revenue CAGR over the last five years is more than 100%. And despite this aggressive growth the total aggregate cumulative delinquency which either delays or defaults over this entire period is nil"" he added.

FEC offloaded 21 Anderson a freehold apartment block in the city’s posh District 10 for S$213 million ($158.3 million) the developer said in a filing late Friday with the Hong Kong stock exchange. The buyer was Kheng Leong Co a local residential developer owned by the Wee family that controls SGX-listed builder UOL Group and United Overseas Bank (UOB).

FEC had paid S$196 million to purchase 21 Anderson from Blackstone in 2018 with the company controlled by Hong Kong’s Chiu family saying in its stock exchange announcement that the disposal would “(i) realise the value of the Property (ii) allow the gain from the Disposal to be crystalised and the capital to be recycled and (iii) increase liquidity and reduce net gearing”.

Kheng Leong which targets the luxury segment is betting on the 34-unit condo block opposite the Raffles Girls Secondary School near Stevens Road after S$1.4 billion in luxury condos changed hands in the first half of 2021. That amount nearly doubled the S$723 million volume recorded during the last six months of 2020 according to research by CBRE.

Going Upscale

Kheng Leong’s new prize comprises 34 residential units covering a total gross floor area of 87000 square feet (8083 square metres) meaning the developer paid roughly S$2448 ($1819) per square foot of GFA. The transaction is understood to have been brokered by Sakal Real Estate Partners founder Steven Ming but Sakal representatives declined to comment when contacted by Mingtiandi.

Occupying a 49048 square foot site the 2020-vintage building was under renovation when FEC purchased it and boasts a 30-metre-long swimming pool a tennis court and a gym.

Located just 650 metres (711 yards) north of the city-state’s Orchard Road shopping strip the strata-titled project is across the road from Nouvel 18 a joint venture of City Developments Ltd and Wing Tai Holdings where an upper floor unit sold last month for S$3441 per square foot according to an account in Singapore’s EdgeProp citing public records.

21 Anderson has now changed hands five times in the past 13 years with Blackstone having purchased the property from Richard Yue’s Arch Capital in 2014 for S$164 million.

Luxury on the Rise

Ultra-high-end home sales have been on the upswing this year in Singapore.

In April the Tsai family behind Taiwan’s Want Want China Holdings paid the equivalent of S$4827 per square foot to purchase Swire Properties’ Eden project just 10 minutes’ walk from 21 Anderson and during the first half of 2021 more than nine apartments in Singapore were sold for S$5000 per square foot or more according to CBRE.

Noting that the Singapore government reopened the nation’s borders this month CBRE said this could bring foreign buyers back to the high-end housing market. “As such prices in the luxury segment are expected to remain resilient or see further appreciation as demand remains strong” CBRE said in its report.

Ringing the Register

FEC helmed by second-generation tycoon David Chiu has moved to monetise some of its foreign property holdings in recent months.

In June the frequent buyer of UK real estate announced that it was selling the Dorsett City London Hotel to a company controlled by US-based Highgate Hotels and Cerberus Capital Management for £115 million ($160.4 million).

FEC said it expected to record a gain of about £50 million from the sale of the 267-room hotel near the iconic Gherkin tower with FEC’s wholly owned DHI Hotel Management UK to provide management services for the property after completion of the transaction.

The deal was intended to let the group realise the value of the hotel recycle capital increase liquidity reduce leverage and reap income from management fees as the hospitality sector stabilises post-pandemic.

“We look forward to exploring new opportunities to deploy capital at attractive rates of return” FEC managing director Chris Hoong said at the time."

(AP) — Chicago-based aerospace giant Boeing Co. will invest $200 million to begin manufacturing the U.S. Navy's latest unmanned aircraft at MidAmerica St. Louis Airport in a project that could add at least 150 jobs on the company's southwest Illinois campus officials said Friday.

Boeing will build the MQ-25 Stingray the Navy's first carrier-based unmanned aircraft in a state-of-the-art plant of about 300000 square feet. The company has been under contract developing and testing the craft since 2018.

Gathered at the airport in Mascoutah about 29 miles southeast of St. Louis company representatives and politicians celebrated not only Boeing's expansion of operations which currently employ 70.

With a promise of $57 million in state-funded improvements they say it also represents a milestone for MidAmerica which began civilian operations next to Scott Air Force Base in 1997 to critics' derision about its viability.

“This state-of-the art production facility further roots Boeing’s local presence here in Metro East and it extends Illinois' legacy of support for our national defense...” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. “Boeing employs hundreds of Illinoisans and supports thousands more jobs throughout our state. I’m very proud to have them as a partner in preparing our communities for 21st century manufacturing.”

According to Boeing the MQ-25 Stingray developed from a 2018 contract with the Navy is a refueling aircraft that will vastly increase the combat range of aircraft launched the Navy's nuclear-powered carriers. “What we’re talking about is taking the carrier’s influence area and doubling it” said Dave Bujold Boeing director of MQ-25 programs.

Boeing is receiving breaks worth about $8.7 million on its state income tax liability in exchange for the $200 million investment over 15 years and the addition of at least 150 jobs to the 70 already at MidAmerica where Boeing set up shop about a decade and produces components for the CH-47 Chinook helicopter the F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter aircraft and other defense equipment.

Construction on the MidAmerica facility is scheduled to start later this year and be completed in early 2024. Production would start by mid-2024.

Kristin Robertson vice president and general manager of Autonomous Systems Boeing Defense Space & Security called the Stingray’s technology “unprecedented.""

The facility will feature robotic automation and “advanced assembly techniques” aimed at improved quality of product and employee ergonomics and safety. Boeing's digital engineering of the MQ-25 and its systems actually promote product quality and efficiency officials said.

The state's outlay is coming from the ongoing $45 billion Rebuild Illinois capital construction plan approved in 2019. It has targeted $57 million for the airport. The Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity previously released $25 million in capital-fund cash for airplane taxiway improvements to support the Boeing facility.

There's another $25 million that the Illinois Department of Transportation is scheduled to put up for additional taxiway and airfield improvements and Pritzker's administration has pledged a $7 million DCEO grant to update the passenger terminal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld3N0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLW5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZTI1NDMyMjU3My5odG1s0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlbmV3c3RyaWJ1bmUuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlMjU0MzIyNTczLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing land deal was a whopper.

As the incident occurred during disembarkation the most likely cause of this tail tipping is an improper balance with many passengers still seated/standing in the rear of the aircraft.

Boston's infamous 'skinny house' built amid a Civil War-era family feud has sold after roughly a month on the market for $1.25million.

The single-family home is only ten feet wide and 30 feet long with 1165 square feet of space spanning four floors - not to mention a private roof deck with views of the Boston Harbor - all on a total of 0.03 acres.

It was listed on August 10 and had seen high demand going under agreement in less than a week real estate agency CL properties announced on Facebook Thursday.

Legend has it that the home - dubbed the 'Spite House' - was built in 1890 on a lot shared by feuding brothers who inherited the land from their father. One returned from fighting in the Civil War to find his brother had built a large house on the lot so in an act of revenge he squeezed his own property between two other homes to block the sunlight and harbor views.

'Shaquille O’Neal would definitely be able to touch wall to wall' Travis Sachs executive vice president for CL Properties told the Washington Post.

It was sold for $50000 over the original asking price to a family of four after the deal was finalized this week.

Boston's infamous 'skinny house' in the city's North End sold to a family of four this week for $1.25million after about a month on the market. The single-family home is only ten feet wide and 30 feet long

In the kitchen the original antique floorboards remain and from the window there's a view of Copp's Hill

There's a backyard garden (pictured) and a roof deck. Listing agent Carmella Laurella of CL Properties told Boston Magazine: 'The place lives much larger than the square footage states. It's all the windows and gardens and views.'

Square footage-wise Sachs said the sale price was roughly in line with the city's real estate market.

'In the North End waterfront area we basically average here about a thousand dollars a square foot' he said.

'We sold above that for about $1500 per square foot the reason being that the house is fully renovated has the outdoor space in the back and also the private roof deck.'

Demand for the house was such that when realtor Eric Shabshelowitz hosted an open house for the 44 Hull Street property when it was listed the line to get into the house was wider than the home itself.

Shabshelowitz told Boston Magazine that the place feels shockingly big inside despite the dimensions.

'Every nook and corner is used to maximize the space' he said pointing out an area near the front door that was turned into a coat closet.

'You find a way to make everything fit' he added.

The main entrance to the home is in a side alley that leads guests straight into the kitchen and dining room which may have been a space-saving design decision when it was built over a century ago.

Prospective buyers and curious tourists come to gawk at the pale green 'skinny house' not only for its unique design but also for it's quirky history.

The home - dubbed the 'Spite House' - was built in 1890 and local lore has it that it was on a lot shared by feuding brothers who inherited the land from their father.

Upon returning home from the Civil War one brother was annoyed that the other took over the inheritance while he was out on the front lines.

In spite of his brother's new-build home the man squeezed a house between two other properties just to block the sunlight and harbor views from his greedy sibling.

A wooden sign outside the home that reads 'The Skinny House (Spite House)' makes the property an unofficial Boston landmark. The house is located just steps from the Freedom Trail.

'Every tourist that comes to town wants to be in front of this house and take a picture' Laurella's business partner Travis Fachs said.

Now a lucky buyer will get to enjoy the views the bitter brother set out to block 131 years ago. From the kitchen window you can see Copp's Hill and the roof deck boasts views of the rest of the North End and Boston Harbor.

The original exposed brick and beams still remain but updates such as new kitchen appliances stone countertops and a second-floor laundry room give the modern homeowner everything they may need

To make things even better there are no condo association fees or regulations. You also make your own maintenance costs as reported by Boston Magazine.

'If you wanted to rent it out once a month you can do that' Fachs added.

The 'skinny house' was last on the market in 2017 for $895000. It sold for $900000 within three months.

Laurella said the current owner has rented out the home occasionally but is now selling it for good as she is moving out of the area. Over the past four years she updated the space even more with recessed lighting garden upgrades plus new heating and air conditioning systems.

The realtor said the owner 'got sad' when she saw the listing go up on the website.

'I had the best feeling being there. It's always so comfortable.'

The contractor had enough time to do some quick research and decided to wrap his mountain home with an aluminum protective covering. The material that can withstand intensive heat for short periods resembles tin foil from the kitchen drawer but is modeled after the tent-like shelters that wildland firefighters use as a last resort to protect themselves when trapped by flames.

RENO Nev. (AP) — Martin Diky said he panicked as a huge wildfire started racing down a slope toward his wooden house near Lake Tahoe.

“It’s pretty expensive and you’d feel stupid if they stopped the fire before it got close” he said. “But I’m really glad we did it. It was pretty nerve-wracking when the flames came down the slope.”

The flexible aluminum sheets that Diky affixed to his $700000 home are not widely used because they are pricey and difficult to install though they have saved some properties including historic cabins managed by the U.S. government.

Fire crews even wrapped the base of the world’s largest tree this week to protect it from wildfires burning near a famous grove of gigantic old-growth sequoias in California's Sequoia National Park. The colossal General Sherman Tree some of the other sequoias in the Giant Forest a museum and some other buildings also were wrapped amid the possibility of intense flames.

It comes after another aluminum-wrapped home near Lake Tahoe survived the Caldor Fire about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of Diky’s home while neighboring houses were destroyed.

The wrapping deflects heat away from buildings helping prevent flammable materials from combusting. It also keeps airborne embers — a major contributor to spreading wildfires — from slipping through vents and other openings in a home. With a fiberglass backing and acrylic adhesive the wraps can withstand heat of up to 1022 degrees Fahrenheit (550 Celsius).

Until about a decade ago most wildfire damage was blamed on homes catching fire as flames burned nearby vegetation. Recent studies suggest a bigger role is structure-to-structure fires that spread in a domino effect because of tremendous heat that causes manufactured materials to burst into flames.

The company where Diky bought his wraps gets about 95% of its sales from the U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service. Firezat Inc. founding president Dan Hirning estimates the Forest Service has wrapped 600 to 700 buildings bridges communication towers and other structures in national forests this year alone.

Firefighters on social media liken the wraps to a “big baked potato.” One who helped install some said he felt like he was “wrapping Christmas presents.”

Forest Service officials say they have been using the wraps for several years throughout the American West to protect sensitive structures. At Lake Tahoe they have wrapped the Angora Ridge Lookout a nationally registered historic fire lookout tower said Phil Heitzke an agency battalion chief.

“Many times Forest Service structures are wrapped well in advance of the fire"" he said in a statement. Crews often can then focus on protecting other buildings or other work.

Firezat sells fire shield rolls that are 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide by 200 feet (61 meters) long for about $700 each. Installation by a contractor typically costs thousands of dollars.

“People think we should be selling tons of these things but it’s not as much as everybody thinks” Hirning said. Despite the cost he said a building won't burn unless “fire falls right on it.""

A mechanical engineering professor at Ohio's Case Western Reserve University published 10 years of research about protective wraps in the Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering journal in 2019 saying they “demonstrated both remarkable performance and technical limitations.”

The aluminized surface blocked up to 92% of convective heat and up to 96% of radiation Fumiaki Takahashi said.

The wrapping is most effective if a wildfire burns past with exposure of less than 10 minutes he said. It's less effective in areas with high-density housing where spreading infernos can burn for hours without being stopped by firefighters.

The wraps “show promise in being effective but further research is needed to develop more efficient yet still lightweight” protection against severe fires Takahashi said in an email. He said he wouldn’t recommend them for everyone because they require proper installation.

“But once the installation methods are established (like a standard) I would” he wrote. “There have been multiple successful stories for saving historic cabins by the U.S. Forest Service.”

Hirning said most of individual buyers he’s had over the years are looking to protect “really expensive cabins really expensive homes resorts etc.” They include homeowners on $5 million lots in Malibu California who are asked to sign an agreement that the Forest Service isn’t responsible for protecting their property in some cases.

A Wyoming rancher once put Hirning on a conference call with a fire commander and insurance adjuster who was going to reduce his rates if he wrapped a cabin worth about $1.5 million.

“Often it’s people who can’t get fire insurance or their insurance has been dropped. They want to wrap it to protect their investments that way” he said.

Diky suggests getting extra help putting up the wrapping.

“They recommended three people could do it in 3.5 hours. I brought four contractors with me and worked all day into the night ... busted our butt for 12.5 hours” he said.

As far as sales taking off as a result of recent wildfires Hirning emphasized that it's “an extremely seasonable business.”

“The first five years new competitors were coming on each year. And at the end of each year I got a phone call: “Would you be interested in buying our inventory?’’’ he said.

Once it starts raining and snowing he says he often doesn’t sell anything for nine months straight. That could change however as climate change contributes to more intense weather and more destructive nearly year-round wildfire seasons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbmNvbG5zaGlyZWxpdmUuY28udWsvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL25ldy1lc3RhdGUtMjU2LW5ldy1ob21lcy01OTI5MzEz0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGluY29sbnNoaXJlbGl2ZS5jby51ay9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvbmV3LWVzdGF0ZS0yNTYtbmV3LWhvbWVzLTU5MjkzMTMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New estate of 256 new homes to be built in village near Boston,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Work on a new development of 256 homes in Sutterton is due to begin in December after housebuilder Gleeson won planning permission for its Heron Park scheme.

The first homes on the 29-acre site off Station Road are expected to go on sale next year with homeowners set to move in over the winter of 2022.

Gleeson is building a range of two three and four-bedroom semi and detached homes in three phases with prices starting at £147995 for a two bedroom home.

A total of 48 properties will be 'affordable' homes to rent or buy at below market value.

Of these 33 are to be set aside as rentals and 15 for shared equity.

There will also be an allocation of one bedroom affordable homes.

Allen Marshall operations director at Gleeson which is due to release new homes at Saxon Grange in Toot Lane Boston imminently said: “We are looking forward to bringing much needed new homes for first-time buyers and key workers to Sutterton.

""Our second development in the area this large site at Sutterton will further strengthen our delivery of homes in Lincolnshire and we are delighted to be supporting the local area by donating towards education and the NHS as well as supporting the community by employing a workforce on site that will be made up of local labour and contractors.”

Heron Park will have a lot of green space with landscaping plans in place to ensure the development looks attractive is accessible by new footpaths is in keeping with the countryside scenery and includes biodiversity plans.

Gleeson will also build two play areas on the development for local children to enjoy.

Additionally Gleeson is trialling air source heat pumps at Heron Park in place of gas heating.

Air source heat pumps are three times more efficient than a traditional gas boiler as well as being better for the environment lowering the home’s carbon footprint.

As part of its planning permission requirement to contribute to the local community Gleeson is pledging more than £1 million towards education travel and the NHS in Lincolnshire.

The company is also paying for the creation and installation of a new ‘Welcome to Sutterton’ sign in Station Road and a bus stop in Spalding Road.

Gleeson is seeking local labour and sub-contractors to work on the new development including applications from local young people who are interested in joining its apprenticeship scheme.

""VETS HAVE EACH OTHERS' BACKS"" the banner reads.

The three veterans embarked Friday on the 100-mile ruck to raise money for Project Got Your Back a nonprofit that connects Minnesota military veterans with other vets for yearlong mentorship relationships to help navigate the often arcane and complex world of veterans' benefits resources and networks.

They'll continue rucking along the Luce Line State Trail on Sunday carrying their stuffed rucksacks and pitching tents to sleep along the way before finishing Monday evening at Luce Line Brewing Co. in Plymouth.

""There's so many things out there for veterans"" said Paul Davis a 33-year-old Marine Corps veteran from St. Michael who organized the fundraiser. ""We connect the unconnected. There's this whole world of companies and organizations and programs and people who just want to help. At last count there were 380 just within Minnesota alone designed to help with vets: from PTSD and homelessness to things like free wakeboarding trips to Lake Tahoe for veterans or $500 checks from the Minnesota Military Appreciation Fund. There's so much out there that vets don't know about and it's gut-wrenching to see that gap.""

When Davis wanted to raise awareness and funds for the organization formerly known as the Veteran Small Business Foundation he figured a four-day ruck with two veteran friends Rick Stephas and Evan Workman would do the trick.

Exhausting hikes with 80-pound rucksacks are a fixture of basic training. It's not something they'd necessarily enjoy but it's something that brings vets together and tests their will.

""We all have felt the pain of a ruck before"" said Stephas who served in the same Marine unit as Davis and now lives outside Sioux City Iowa. ""I'm going to be a 36-year-old man with sore joints and backaches. Why would I do it? It's fulfilling. I joined the service because I wanted to do something. When you get out of the Marine Corps you kind of lose that. You don't get that in everyday civilian life. I go to work raise kids have a wife — life is good. But what in life actually challenges you? This does that and it benefits others.""

Davis works in Boston Scientific's materials management group where daily rucks aren't exactly part of the workday. He's put himself back in training the past few months. One of the ways he's prepared has been to put a big paver beneath his work desk. He's most worried about his feet — sores and blisters and the like — so he has been mashing them on the paver for eight hours a day strengthening his skin and building up calluses.

The vets are doing the ruck in true Marine Corps fashion. Davis put together an operation order. The Luce Line State Trail is 63 miles not 100 so they hiked from Spicer to Cosmos on the first day just to get to the trailhead. Davis added a few turns to lengthen the route — he mapped it to 101 miles on Google Earth — and picked stops along the way to pitch tents and hammocks.

If you do spot the veterans on their hike be sure to look down at Davis' feet.

The system’s great potential which started a revolution in intracranial navigation during operations immediately captivated many. Naturally all the excitement and wonder raised several eyebrows: when a senior Israeli brain researcher sent an exclamatory email to his colleague overseas sharing the news of the system the colleague asked where the company’s offices are based and thought the researcher was joking.

The address was Maayan Mariam Square in Nazareth a place that has long been considered a holy religious pilgrimage site for Christians and differs drastically from the high tech hub in central Israel. The company’s idea was born in the home of young Arab engineer Imad Younis in 1993. Over the past few years the company has become a leader in the field of surgical intracranial navigation and has also created lab equipment for conducting brain research. The company owes its success to its founders Imad (60) and his spouse Reem (57) who opened Nazareth’s gates turning the city into the capital of the Arab high tech industry in Israel which today houses no less than 70 companies.

Due to these impressive achievements Reem and Imad were awarded the 2018 Industry Leaders Medal at a special ceremony that took place at the Israeli President’s Residence in Jerusalem. But despite their breakthrough success Alpha Omega remains private and is owned by family preserving its intimate character. Currently it only employs 120 people - 48% of them women compared to the average of 33% in Israeli high tech. “We’re a small company that’s playing in the big leagues” Imad said during an interview with Calcalist. “Our customers are Medtronic Boston Scientific or Abbott Laboratories so people have high expectations from us. Surgeons who use our system don’t mind how many employees we have or whether we’re from Nazareth or New York.”

And the number of surgeons using Alpha Omega’s smart system is growing. It already operates in over 200 different hospitals around the world and has been used in a large number of life-changing brain surgeries.

What exactly does your system do?

“In most cases treating neurological and psychiatric diseases is based on trial and error: the doctor tries a certain medication and examines what effect it has on the patient” Imad explained. “It’s really difficult because you need to play around with the dosage which sometimes causes side effects.” In order to overcome this challenge researchers developed the Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) process a procedure that does not require medication in which a medical device - a neurostimulator complete with electrodes - is implanted in the brain and sends electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain. This stimulation could lessen worsening motor symptoms of neurological diseases like Parkinson’s disease or epilepsy.

Unlike a broken hand however which can be spotted from a mere X-ray brain issues are far harder for doctors to diagnose since they can’t see into the human brain. In order to do so they must implant an electrode which can navigate the brain’s pathways and that’s where Alpha Omega enters the picture. The company creates a separate electrode which is inserted into the brain via a nail into the skull and helps surgeons put together a “map” which helps point to the area that needs treatment. Alpha Omega’s technology is swift and precise which is critical during such operations. “We simplify surgeries” Imad specifies. “The surgeon can look at MRI images or CT scans but deciphering neuron activity is tricky. The algorithm we developed analyzes neurotransmitters once the electrode penetrates the point of treatment and our system builds a picture or an actual map. It enables the surgeon to find the best spot to implant the electrode.”

Once the system spots the problematic area the surgeon can add additional electrodes (which are created by Medtronic Boston Scientific Abbott and others) that remain inside the brain. A subcutaneous pacemaker implanted later activates the permanent electrode which transmits nerve impulses instead of damaged nerve cells to treat the disease. “After implantation our system gives neurologists and psychiatrists more options to treat patients: health professionals can try different medications or DBS - and send stronger or weaker pulses.”

The system starred in former Israeli government minister and Likud MK Michael (Miki) Eitan’s surgery who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Since his diagnosis four years ago the 77-year old politician had become a shadow of his former self - no longer lively slow-paced bent over and shaky. But the surgery brought him back to life and on a segment broadcast on Israeli television last month he was shown skipping at home playing ping pong on the beach and speaking with the same fluency and alertness which characterized his political career.

“My father didn’t live to receive our treatment”

While the Younis couple is goal-oriented they’re also a charismatic duo with a sparkle in their eyes. They’re also very loyal to their employees with nearly a third of their senior management having accompanied Alpha Omega since its founding 28 years ago. They’re also very connected to their Christian Arab community something that is hinted at from their company’s name. Alpha Omega denotes the first and last letter of the Greek alphabet and together serve as a godlike symbol in Christianity signifying the beginning and end of all. But when asked why they chose such a name Reem provides a far more prosaic explanation. “When we started the company we didn’t intend for it to be a startup rather just another subcontractor in the high tech industry. We thought that companies would order our equipment or services and we’d provide them everything from A to Z - from alpha to omega.”

When Reem is in the operating room next to a Parkinson’s patient one can only imagine she must wonder what may have been had they developed their technology earlier. Her father Wadia developed Parkinson’s when she was a child and was shuttled from place to place for treatment. In 1995 after three decades of coping with the disease he passed away which was “only two years after we founded the company” she says sadly at the beginning of our conversation. “He didn’t last long enough to receive our treatment. That is the irony of life.”

However her father did manage to raise a determined woman who loves challenges and who never desired to belong to the mainstream. At 18 Reem began pursuing a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering at the Technion Institute of Technology and there she met her husband another Christian Arab who was a senior college student and electrical engineering major.

The couple founded Alpha Omega when they were already parents to Dima their eldest daughter who today at 30 serves as Product Specialist and manages the company’s international marketing. Their other children also work for the company including son Jude 25 as Business Development Associate and their youngest daughter Nada 18. In parallel they also founded Alpha-Cad Ltd. a company that provides software solutions for engineering which was later sold. To make an initial investment they sold their family car and four gold coins that Imad received from his father in case of a “rainy day.”

At the beginning of their journey the Younises cooperated with two of the leading figures in the DBS arena - doctor and brain researcher Prof. Hagai Bergman from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and French-Algerian brain surgeon Prof. Alim Louis Benabid who is a fellow at the French Academy of Sciences.

“In Bergman’s post-doctorate which he wrote in the late 80s he found that Parkinson’s disease could be treated in monkeys if a small portion of their brain - termed the subthalamic nucleus - was lesioned” Imad says. “In 1994 Benabid conducted the first such operation on a human to treat essential tremors (the most common symptom in neurological tremor disorders) but his team faced a problem: their intracranial navigation was based on CT MRI scans and the like which weren’t precise enough. In 1997 we reached out to them and offered use of our navigation system which is based on neurotransmitters.” In 1999 they sold their first system in Europe and a year later entered the U.S. market. In 2002 the Younis couple relocated to the United States for two years with their three children to open the company’s American branch.

But the company’s real turning point came two years ago: in 2019 only a year after it received its first external investment of $7 million (from the Chinese Guangzhou Sino-Israel Biotech Investment Fund earmarked for expanding the company's operations in China) the American medical equipment company Medtronic dropped a bomb. It announced that it would be marketing Alpha Omega’s systems worldwide and in one swift move knocked out all of the company’s market competitors including its own. “Medtronic recognized our system’s technological and clinical advantages and decided to abandon their own system and instead sell ours” Imad revealed. “We are continuing to conduct our own marketing and sales but they opened the entire world to us. That allowed us to think like leaders.”

And that thought encouraged them to spread the news of DBS around the world. “This treatment is included and covered in the standard healthcare package in Israel the U.S. and Europe but it only reaches 10% of the potential population it could help” Imad says.

“Offers to sell? We didn’t get any”

The cost of Alpha Omega’s system is between $10000-$200000 but that is dependent on the precise configuration a hospital requires. In addition the company also sells its services - which also brings in money. Although the company is private and its financial information is not released it is believed to be valued at hundreds of millions of dollars.

What about acquisition offers? I’m sure you’ve had plenty of those over the years.

“You’d be surprised but we didn’t get any” Reem says. “During the company’s first 15 years we were constantly occupied with how to stay afloat and not go out of business. We were so immersed in that thought that we couldn't even fathom the fact that some people invest in companies. Now we’re in a completely different place: we want Alpha Omega to continue on after we’re no longer here and want it to be a beacon for other companies in the region.”

The year 2021 saw the high tech industry raise insane sums of money. While you were busy building a real company that was profitable with a product that has turned it into a world leader internet companies without sales have gone public at billion-dollar valuations. Doesn’t that drive you crazy?

“Everything has a price but what drives us isn't making an exit but the ability to influence the industry those in remote areas in Israel or around the world. We’re not driven by money; we choose to focus on making milestones: we are interested in having an impact.”

In order to do so you need to increase market shares and continue to develop and grow. That’s why companies need money.

“We’ll see what’s needed in the future we’re thinking about it. That will require us to go public on a stock exchange at some point. But even if we do so it’ll be to receive an investment to develop our products and bring them to market rapidly and to conquer other markets.”

“We built the company to stay in Nazareth and do its work where it was founded. The minute you sell or go public you don’t know where you’ll end up. Many Israeli companies that were acquired halted their Israeli operations. As owners you can dictate that during the first two years its operations will remain here but after that you don’t have much say.”

Learning Arabic is a good idea

Although it’s still early in the morning at the Alpha Omega offices their company’s large sophisticated coffee machine sits alone on the counter. Suddenly it becomes clear that dozens of the company’s employees - women and men Jews and Arabs - are gathered around a stove top chatting as it boils up freshly brewed coffee that is better than any machine can produce. The company’s cafeteria also features ping pong and foosball tables that are lined up against the wall and will be used as the day wears on.

The kitchenette filled with brimming employees is in a sense a microcosm of the Israeli society that the couple dreamed of. During the past decade they’ve dedicated time to holding extensive public activities. Imad also serves as a fellow on the Technion’s board and was recently appointed as a Member of the National Council for Development and Research. Reem meanwhile serves as a member of the Jewish National Fund’s board as part of a co-impact initiative to employ more Arabs and integrate them into the local economy as well as an initiative to promote Arab employment in the high tech industry.

According to recent data out of 160000 engineers in Israeli high tech only 9000 of them are Arab - less than 6% translating to less than a third of Arabs in the overall population (18%). But there is still room for hope: there are 6600 Arab college students who are currently pursuing high tech fields in academia a number that has tripled since 2017. The Younises have done plenty to help young Arab professionals find good jobs and hold routine interview simulations where they encourage students to put aside their cultural inclination to downplay their achievements and push them to emphasize their strengths. Despite that young Arabs still face many obstacles when finding a career often for objective reasons.

“The Arabic language’s status in Israel is still problematic on both sides” Reem says when asked about the language’s status which isn’t an official language but was granted a special status. “On one hand if the Arab community in Israel isn’t proud of its language and culture it will only become harder to feel connected to Israeli culture. If we aren’t proud of ourselves and recognize our history it will be harder for us to move on and we’ll remain stuck where we are. For instance young Arabs in Tel Aviv don’t even speak Arabic. And if you’re driving through the security checkpoint at Ben-Gurion International Airport and you’re listening to Arabic radio instinctively you’ll reach over to turn down the volume. Those things add up.”

“On the other hand Jews and Arabs coexist in Israel and have been doing so for over a century. I think that Jews should also learn how to speak Arabic. The language should be given special respect. I see all kinds of advertisements in Hebrew that were translated into Arabic using Google Translate without even taking a second glance to edit. If you look at street signs for example you’ll notice that names of cities or towns are spelled inconsistently. I think that’s embarrassing. Everyone should know how to speak read and write Arabic. I think it will bring both peoples closer.”",,,,,,,,,

Should Merck worry?,"In the increasingly crowded market for immunotherapy in newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer Regeneron and Sanofi hope to expand Libtayo into a broader population with a chemo combo regimen. And now they've turned up competitive data that could pressure entrenched players Merck & Co. and Bristol Myers Squibb.

Libtayo used on top of platinum doublet chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by 29% over chemo alone in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer according to data released at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2021 virtual congress.

The 29% improvement in patient survival may not seem so impressive especially after Keytruda put up a massive 51% risk reduction. But a closer look at the results as offered by Regeneron and Sanofi could give rivals Merck and Bristol Myers pause.

The phase 3 Empower-Lung 3 trial included both squamous (43%) and nonsquamous (57%) NSCLC patients all without actionable mutations. The Libtayo-chemo combo extended patient survival to a median 21.9 months versus 13 months for the solo chemo group.

Difficult comparison looks good for Libtayo

By contrast in Keytruda’s historic Keynote-189 trial where the Merck PD-1 posted the 51% death risk reduction at an interim analysis Keytruda and chemo prolonged survival for nonsquamous patients to about 22 months whereas the control group recorded 10.6 months at final analysis. Then in the Keynote-407 trial squamous patients who took Keytruda and chemo lived a median 15.9 months compared with 11.3 months for solo chemo leading to a death risk reduction of 36% at interim.

Notice the difference? Libtayo’s overall survival showing across disease subtypes looked very similar to Keytruda’s at its best in the nonsquamous group and the chemo arm appeared to have performed better in Empower-Lung 3 than in the Keytruda trials.

Regeneron entered the study expecting to see about 12 months of median overall survival for the chemo group Israel Lowy senior VP of translational and clinical sciences of oncology at Regeneron told Fierce Pharma in an interview.

Still one can't conclude that Libtayo is necessarily better than Keytruda because there's an important difference between the studies: Empower-Lung 3 enrolled both advanced (stage 3) and metastatic (stage 4) patients while the Keytruda trials only included stage 4 disease. In the Libtayo trial 15% of patients had inoperable locally advanced disease not eligible for definitive chemoradiation.

But Lowy argued that including those earlier-stage patients didn’t push up Libtayo’s survival performance. According to him advanced patients who aren’t eligible for surgery or chemoradiation have large tumor masses so they don’t necessarily do better than patients with small metastases. He did notice however that relative to the nonsquamous population the squamous group appeared to have done better for Libtayo compared with results seen in other trials.

A more straightforward comparison could be made with Opdivo whose use alongside Bristol’s CTLA-4 inhibitor Yervoy and chemo snagged their front-line NSCLC approval last May.

In the CheckMate 9LA trial the Opdivo-Yervoy-chemo cocktail cut patients’ risk of death by 31% over chemo. Patients with recurrent or stage 4 disease who took the Bristol regimen lived a median 14.1 months versus 10.7 months for chemo at an interim analysis. The trial also recruited both squamous (31%) and nonsquamous (69%) subtypes.

One weak point for Libtayo-chemo lies in the PD-L1-negative group. In a subgroup analysis patients with PD-L1 expression below 1% who make up about one-third of the total trial population performed similarly between the Libtayo regimen and solo chemo in terms of overall survival. Although the trial isn’t powered to statistically perform that analysis the number could spell trouble for Libtayo potentially for PD-L1 nonexpressers. (Graphic for subgroup analysis can be found at the bottom of the article)

The Libtayo trial used a different companion diagnostic (SP263) than in the Keynote trials Petra Rietschel M.D. Ph.D. Regeneron’s executive director of immuno-oncology clinical development wrote in a post on ESMO’s online platform during Libtayo’s presentation. “The difference in results might be due to SP263 being more sensitive and identifying a truly negative subset” she wrote.

Cross-trial comparisons can be difficult given different trial designs. But the new data at least showed Libtayo can be competitive in front-line NSCLC. With the 22-month overall survival data Regeneron’s “sales reps will have plenty of firepower when detailing Libtayo as a viable anti-PD-1 option in 1L NSCLC” Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond wrote in an August note to investors.

It takes more than data

But as Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer noted in an August report “it will take more than clinical data alone to gain a foothold in 1L NSCLC.” He didn’t yet see a niche market for Libtayo but said he would keep an eye on the companies’ commercialization plans including potential discounting.

Thanks to an FDA nod in February Libtayo monotherapy is already allowed for front-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high levels of PD-L1 expression—50% or more. That population according to Lowy makes up about 30% of the NSCLC pool.

“We’re under no illusion that we’re suddenly going to take over the market” Lowy said. “But we do believe that when one looks across different agents and you ask yourself the question of which one of these have delivered consistent results again and again with either monotherapy or chemo combination we’re one of only two agents that have done that.”

Keytruda is the other PD-1/L1 that also succeeded as a monotherapy in PD-L1-high NSCLC.

Libtayo’s launch in lung cancer is progressing well according to Regeneron. “Lung cancer thought leaders recognized Libtayo’s clinical differentiation highlighting the rapid response rates and efficacy in patients with clinically stable brain metastases or high PD-L1 expression” Regeneron’s commercial chief Marion McCourt said during a conference call in early August.

The Empower-Lung 3 trial also has a second part that pairs Libtayo with Yervoy and chemo in patients with PD-L1 expression at lower than 50%. Lowy said the company started the trial amid a general excitement over CTLA-4 inhibitors' potential boosting effect on PD-1 blockade.

But as data mature “if you have a good anti-PD1 plus standard chemotherapy it’s hard to convince yourself that combinations including CTLA-4 to date really do better than that and it sometimes comes with the cost of additional toxicities associated with CTLA-4” he said. So the company has stopped that cohort early pending readout and doesn’t plan to seek regulatory approvals with it he added.

More competitors are on the horizon. AstraZeneca recently reported that its combination of Imfinzi its investigational CTLA-4 agent tremelimumab and chemotherapy cut the risk of death by 23% over chemo alone in previously untreated stage 4 NSCLC.

Eli Lilly and its Chinese partner Innovent Biologics have an application under FDA review for China-approved PD-1 inhibitor Tyvyt in a combo with Lilly’s own Alimta and platinum chemo for newly diagnosed nonsquamous NSCLC.

Looming competition from potentially cheaper China-made drugs could shift the discussion around checkpoint inhibitors to choosing between “data-led” products like Keytruda and “fairly priced” newcomers Bernstein analyst Rony Gal recently observed. In a letter to Regeneron CEO Len Schleifer he called on the U.S. pharma to play the price card first to gain a firmer foothold for Libtayo.

No association was found between TNF inhibitors and other cancer sites. The study was published in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention.

The authors explained that TNF is highly expressed in the joint tissue of patients with RA making it an attractive target for drug developers. TNF inhibitors have been shown effective at controlling RA and preventing progressive joint damage but they also appear to have immunosuppressive effects that some fear might lead to a higher risk of certain cancers particularly those with infectious or immune-related etiologies they said.

“This issue is especially pertinent for lymphomas and lung cancer because RA patients already have an increased risk of these cancers compared to the general population likely related to RA disease activity and chronic immune stimulation” the authors wrote.

In hopes of better understanding and quantifying the potential for excess cancer risk among patients with RA who take TNF inhibitors the authors consulted the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Medicare database which links data from 18 central cancer registries to data from Medicare. They sought to identify patients with a first cancer diagnosis between the ages of 66 and 99 during 2007 to 2015. A control group was created by a random sample of 5% of cancer-free Medicare beneficiaries from matching years. Patients with RA were identified from within those groups.

A total of 10263 patients with a first cancer diagnosis were identified and compared with 30475 cancer-free controls.

An analysis of Medicare Part B and Part D claims showed that 16.2% of controls overall were exposed to TNF inhibitors. Among patients with cancer the percentage exposed to TNF inhibitors ranged from 12.8% to 33.7% depending on the cancer site.

Logistic regression showed TNF inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.32; 95% CI 1.06-1.63) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aOR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06-1.56). More specifically the data suggested follicular lymphoma risk was much higher among patients with a history of TNF inhibitor exposure (aOR 2.63; 95% CI 1.63-4.24).

No heightened risk was found for basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma or other non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes the investigators said.

They noted that the relationship between TNF inhibitors and cancer is complex and that the existing literature is mixed adding they believe this is the first sizable study to find a greater risk of follicular lymphoma among patients who had taken TNF inhibitors.

The authors said their study had positive findings in showing there does not appear to be a heightened risk of cancers linked with immunosuppression such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and human papillomavirus–associated cancers. Although the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer was relatively small the authors said patients on TNF inhibitors should receive regular skin cancer screenings and counseling on how to protect themselves from excess sun exposure.

Their conclusion bears out that their findings about follicular lymphoma may help explain the association between lymphoma and TNF inhibitors reported in this and other studies.

“Although these findings may have an immune explanation the lack of strong immunosuppression in RA patients treated with TNF [inhibitors] and the pattern of association with cancer suggests that other mechanisms could underlie this increased risk” they said.

Keytruda used in tandem with chemotherapy cut the risk of death by 27% over chemo alone in previously untreated patients whose tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker at a combined positive score (CPS) of at least 10.

Adding Keytruda helped those patients live an additional 6.9 months or a median of 23 months according to data unveiled at the European Society for Medical Oncology 20201 annual meeting.

Keytruda snagged an accelerated approval in front-line triple-negative breast cancer in November based on results showing it could stave off tumor progression. An FDA green light in July for its use around surgery for early-stage high-risk TNBC converted that conditional nod into a full one.

Just as it failed to move the needle on cancer progression among patients with PD-L1 scores of at least 1—a broader group of patients—Keytruda also failed to show a statistically significant survival benefit in that population. Adding Keytruda only pared down the risk of death by 14% in patients whose PD-L1 scores came in at 1 or above. The median survival time was 7.6 months for the Keytruda-chemo group and 5.6 months for the solo chemo group.

RELATED: Merck's Keytruda scores first-in-class nod in early triple-negative breast cancer despite FDA's prior reluctance

Keytruda’s latest win from the Keynote-355 trial came as Roche made the surprising move to pull Tecentriq’s front-line TNBC indication off its label—even after an FDA advisory committee voted in April to keep that conditional nod in place.

Tecentriq used in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb’s chemo drug Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) was the first immuno-oncology agent to pick up an FDA nod in TNBC. But Tecentriq flopped a later trial alongside the original paclitaxel formulation throwing doubt on that use and prompting a close inspection of that data during the FDA advisory panel meeting.

Keytruda likely played a part in forcing Tecentriq out of the TNBC field. In taking back Tecentriq’s indication in late August Roche said that “due to the recent changes in the treatment landscape the FDA no longer considers it appropriate to maintain the accelerated approval.”

In July Merck revealed that Keytruda used both before and after surgery reduced the risk of disease worsening cancer returning or death by 37% in patients with early-stage nonmetastatic TNBC. And just as Merck successfully convinced the FDA to reverse a previous rejection of that neoadjuvant and adjuvant indication the Keynote-355 trial also reported the now-detailed positive overall survival readout.

With Tecentriq out of the way Keytruda can have the TNBC immuno-oncology market all to itself for awhile. But as Roche’s chief medical officer Levi Garraway made clear in an earlier statement about the withdrawal the Swiss drugmaker will continue to study Tecentriq in metastatic TNBC. For example the ongoing IMpassion132 trial is testing the PD-L1 inhibitor alongside chemo for patients with early relapsing TNBC.

Merck is committed to continuing to evaluate promising novel therapies in TNBC Vicki Goodman vice president of oncology clinical research at Merck Research Laboratories said in an interview.

Goodman highlighted the New Jersey pharma’s recent tie-up with Seagen on the latter’s LIV-1 antibody-drug conjugate ladiratuzumab vedotin a potential rival to Gilead Sciences’ Trodelvy. Merck and its partner are testing the ADC both as a monotherapy and in combination with Keytruda in TNBC."

Kelly had presided over a massive expansion of stop-and-frisk police tactics during his tenure along with a host of other surveillance measures.

At the time I was a vociferous critic of America’s criminal-justice system and I was skeptical of stop-and-frisk. Under Kelly’s leadership black New Yorkers were being stopped on the street and searched under the thinnest of pretexts.

I had actually been detained by the NYPD in Harlem in 2010 while working as a visiting professor at Columbia for the pretextual offense of “riding a bicycle on the sidewalk.”

6 Loury explains in his book that conservative speakers on college campuses are now almost always met by rowdy protesters. Watson Institute

Regardless of my feelings about his policies I wanted to hear what Kelly had to say.

He was an extremely powerful figure at the forefront of a controversial development in policing and I wanted to hear his justification for these tactics.

There was plenty I wanted to say back to him too. And I had a prime spot near the front of the stage to ask questions during the Q&A.

Kelly took the stage but before he could get a word out students in the audience began shouting him down. “Racism is not up for debate!” “No Justice! No Peace! No Racist Police!” “We’re asking you to stop frisking people!” The interruptions were met with scattered cheers.

Marion Orr the political-science professor who’d invited Kelly asked the crowd to settle down and to wait for the Q&A but the disruptions continued.

After 15 minutes it was clear that Kelly wouldn’t be allowed to speak so he turned around and returned to New York.

6 Former NYPD chief Ray Kelly was met by irate Brown University protestors in 2013 opposed to the damage from his notorious “Stop-and-Frisk” policy. Robert Mecea

I was stunned.

I’d attended plenty of raucous contentious lectures where members of the audience were clearly unhappy with the speaker.

Hell I’d even been the guy they were mad at! But whoever the speaker was he needed to be heard out.

Then when the time came whoever had the microphone could tell him just how wrong he was — and why.

To shout down the speaker to prevent him from presenting his argument and to replace reasoned discourse with mob tactics was not what we did in the university.

6 Glenn C. Loury is a professor at Brown University.

I had always prized academia as a place where even unpopular thinking could be examined and debated without fear of repression.

Even abominable ideas needed to be analyzed and subjected to examination rather than passed over in silence or repressed entirely.

How else could we be sure that we could understand these ideas?

How could we know they were so bad unless we engaged with them ourselves?

The free exchange of ideas is one of the foundations of the modern university indeed of modern democratic society.

Without that exchange it seemed doubtful that we could have either.

6 Glenn C. Loury’s new book is called “Late Admissions.”

Brown’s president Christina Paxson immediately issued a statement condemning the protesters’ actions and reaffirming the university’s commitment to the free exchange of ideas.

But when the university investigated the protesters they were given a slap on the wrist and sent on their way.

And worse the university produced a navel-gazing report which concluded that while the protesters should not have disrupted Kelly’s lecture the university should have taken into consideration Kelly’s presence at Brown.

The commissioner it seems had the potential to “harm” students who had experienced trauma possibly triggered by ideas like stop-and-frisk.

In essence the university was apologizing for doing exactly what it was supposed to do: expose its students to ideas and teach them how to formulate ideas of their own in response!

A precedent was set.

At universities around the country when a controversial almost always conservative figure was invited to give a lecture they could find themselves met by protesters who saw it as their mission to make sure the event never took place.

Activists and some members of the media refer to these tactics with the rather genteel term deplatforming. A more honest term would be censorship.

6 Today’s college protesters including those at Columbia risk obscuring the noble causes for which they are fighting Loury writes. Getty Images

In one sense the students protesting Kelly’s appearance at Brown achieved their goal: he was silenced and he left.

But in another more important sense they missed the mark entirely: The reason for their protests — opposition to racially biased stop-and-frisk policing — was lost amid the controversy over their methods.

The same pattern repeats itself today in the pro-Palestine demonstrations on college campuses across the nation.

There are many reasons to oppose Israel’s ongoing siege of Gaza and its dealings with the Palestinians.

Yet the encampments and building occupations have once again turned the public’s attention to the protesters and their methods rather than the righteous cause the best of them represent.

6 Brown President Christina Paxson (here with Jeb Bush in 2018) has been vocal in condemning campus protestors who shut down free speech. AP

If these students like those who opposed stop-and-frisk in 2013 want to bring about change in the way America goes about its business they need to get out of their own way.

Otherwise 10 years hence the public may remember the tents and the arrests while struggling to recall what all that sound and fury signified.

That would be a shame.

Glenn C. Loury is the Merton P. Stoltz Professor of the Social Sciences and professor of economics at Brown University and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is the author of “Late Admissions: Confessions of a Black Conservative” published by Norton next week from which this essay is adapted."

L'Arc de Triomphe Wrapped the posthumous built environment artwork first conceptualized by the late artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude in the early 1960s will be on view in Paris from Sept. 18 to Oct. 3. Following Christo's plans his team wrapped the Paris monument in 25000 square meters (269000 square feet) of recyclable silvery blue polypropylene fabric held together with 3000 meters (9800 feet) of recyclable red polypropylene rope. In order to help viewers safely see the installation which was funded entirely by the posthumous sale of Christo and Jeanne-Claude's artworks the City of Paris will close the surrounding streets to pedestrian traffic only for three weekends and ensure that the monument's interior and terrace remains accessible.



""Sixty years after the genesis of the project and the first plans the wrapping of the Arc de Triomphe is a unique occasion to say 'Thank you' to the artists one last time"" said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo in a press release. ""This is an opportunity to see Paris differently the city that Christo loved so much since he had taken refuge in 1958 where his and Jeanne-Claude’s collaboration was born.""

Scientists and researchers from CSIRO's Marine Debris Research Ocean Conservancy and the PADI AWARE Foundation have identified global hot spots for debris and litter. The ""debris problem is global and heterogeneous pointing to the transboundary nature of the issue and necessitating sub-national approaches to implementing effective solutions"" according to their study published in ScienceDirect. The researchers analyzed debris data from 22508 land-based and 7290 seafloor clean-ups and surveys across 116 and 118 countries respectively finding that food and beverage packaging made up a large portion of the litter. Litter hot spots often were in ""high-infrastructure low-wealth"" areas including Athens Greece; Tunis Tunisia; and Lima Peru. In the U.S. Lake Michigan Charleston S.C. and Rhode Island were all hot spots for seafloor debris. [Phys.org]

RESULT – Carlo Biado 13-8 Aloysius Yapp

Biado started the final the strongest of the pair going into a quick 2-0 lead with back-to-back break and runs. The Filipino got the crowd going in the third after jumping the four to cut the one in but it was Yapp who took it to trail 2-1 early on.

Yapp broke in the fourth but struggled for any position off it leaving a simple 1 2 combo to allow Biado the chance to run the rack and have the break in the fifth. It was Biado’s turn to find himself stuck off the break and Yapp was soon back at the table where he executed the perfect table length bank on the 2 as he cut Biado’s lead to one rack.

As ever in the tournament so far Yapp never looked fazed by his opponent’s pedigree racing into a 5-3 lead to put some breathing space between the pair for the first time in the contest. In the ninth rack it was all about safety as they did battle early on before eventually Biado drew a foul from Yapp.

Yapp began to put daylight between the pair putting Biado in all sorts of trouble in the 10th rack where the two were tied up by the seven and with that Yapp lead 7-3. Yapp soon missed the nine which could’ve made it 9-3 and that’s when the contest turned entirely in Biado’s favour.

Biado ran the following two racks after the nine to only trail by two at 8-6. A pivotal moment coming in the following rack where Biado jumped the six effortlessly to pocket the one and soon pull it to 8-7. It was Biado’s fifth successive rack to make it eight all and soon Yapp was staring down the barrel of defeat.

Perhaps left cold after being sat at his corner for a while Yapp had his chance when tied but he drew the cue ball the length of the table on the two scratching and allowing Biado to the table to take the lead for the first time since being 3-2 up.

At 10-8 up Biado once again broke out the jump cue to pocket the one expertly and the bags of experience showed as he closed out the contest.

Everything was relatively plain sailing for Biado from there on getting onto the hill before missing what could’ve been a costly 1 9 combo in what was ultimately the last rack as Biado became the first Filipino to win the US Open Pool Championship since Efren Reyes.

Yapp said: “I am lost for words. I feel grateful to be in the final and all the fans have been awesome so thank you. I know I can do it; I am coming back stronger next year.”

Biado was elated with his win and struggled to hold back the tears: “I am very happy because this event is one of my dreams. I dedicate this to my family and to my baby. Thank you to all of you even during the pandemic you’re still here watching around the world. Thank you to Matchroom my sponsors and all of the Filipinos who support me always everywhere.”

His show headlined in Vegas for many years. He hasn’t performed in Vegas In quite a while. Did he retire? What’s the backstory LVA?

A:

Sixty-one-year-old ""master magician"" Lance Burton is enjoying semi-retirement these days.

According to Las Vegas Review-Journal entertainment columnist John Katsilometes he sold his Las Vegas mansion last November for $4 million and moved back to Columbia Kentucky. However he’s keeping his hand in “performing occasional shows across the country” and in England under the guise of Lance Burton & Friends.

Reached at his 100-acre Bluegrass State spread by Katsilometes Burton explained background noise on the call by saying “I’m cleaning the doves’ cages.” (Anyone who can fly a car can multi-task while on the phone.) “Yes they came with me and I never trained them to clean up after themselves.” In addition to doves Burton keeps cows and chickens.

Burton was as good as his word that he would cease playing the Strip after MGM Resorts International closed his eponymous theater in the Monte Carlo (now Park MGM) in September 2010.

At the time Burton said “To me there's something poetic and satisfying about completing a circle. You start out you do your thing and eventually come back.” That “eventual” comeback included making a long-cherished movie project Billy Topit in which a Las Vegas magician who performs at children's birthday parties convinces the woman of his dreams to be his assistant while the local Mob guys try to make him disappear permanently. Burton directed and starred in the 2015 film.

He also did some oft-postponed world traveling for sightseeing purposes. As he explained to Katsilometes “Most entertainers travel the world before they get to Vegas. I did my career backwards. I came to Vegas at 22 and got to go around the world to see new places after my time on the Strip.”

So finished is Burton with Sin City that he even turned down an offer from Caesars Entertainment to headline the Colosseum.

He’s certainly earned the rest having played the Strip nonstop since a 1982 debut in Folies Bergere at the Tropicana. A 28-year run on the Strip is nothing at which to scoff. Burton calculates his tenures at the Trop (nine years) Hacienda (five years) and Monte Carlo (14 years) as adding up to somewhere between 15000 and 16000 shows.

Styling himself a “gentleman farmer” Burton wrote to fans “I never made it a secret that my plan was to retire back to my ancestral home my grandfather’s farm in Kentucky. There is plenty of room for all my animals and maybe a few more. It is quiet and peaceful there. I am looking forward to planting a small garden in the spring and maybe getting a few chickens so I will have fresh eggs for breakfast.” It sounds like he got his wish.

As for the Burton castle in the Black Mountains of Henderson it went from a house of magic to a home of pot. It was bought by Tarek Tabsh co-founder of Oxford Cannabinoid Technologies. Burton came down 10% on the sale initially asking $4.4 million for the custom-built house inspired by classic horror movies. Tabsh acquired a three-story six-bedroom manse and 10 acres of land. Of his Black Mountain aerie Burton told Katsilometes “I wanted this horror-film look. [Architect Colin Summer] loved that idea ran with it and came up with the design on his own. He needed very little direction. It was a beautiful interesting place to look at from the outside very comfortable on the inside. I loved living there.”

And now he loves living the quiet life in Kentucky.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vTm9ydGgtQW1lcmljYS1UcmF2ZWwvTkZMLWdhbWVkYXktdGhpbmdzLXRvLWRvLUxhcy1WZWdhcy1SYWlkZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Things to do in Las Vegas on NFL gameday,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/North-America-Travel/NFL-gameday-things-to-do-Las-Vegas-Raiders on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vTm9ydGgtQW1lcmljYS1UcmF2ZWwvTkZMLWdhbWVkYXktdGhpbmdzLXRvLWRvLUxhcy1WZWdhcy1SYWlkZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Florida dropped two spots in the USA TODAY Sports AFCA football coaches poll Sunday following the two-point loss to top-ranked Alabama on Saturday.

The top five teams remain the same all at 3-0: Alabama Georgia Oklahoma Oregon and Texas A&M.

Iowa (3-0) moved up to No. 6 followed by Clemson (2-1) Penn State (3-0) Cincinnati (3-0) and No. 10 Notre Dame (3-0).

The Gators (2-1) were at No. 9 before the 31-29 loss to Alabama their eighth consecutive to the Tide. The Gators have dropped to 0-5 against No. 1-ranked teams at Florida Field. This one was closer than oddsmakers and just about everyone else expected with 14 1/2-point underdog Florida having a chance to tie the game in the closing minutes despite playing without dynamic backup quarterback Anthony Richardson.

Florida remains at No. 11 in The Associated Press rankings released this afternoon.

The rankings that count the College Football Playoff Selection Committee one will be first released Tuesday Nov. 2 at 7 p.m. on ESPN. Selection Day is Dec. 5 when the committee will also announce the matchups for the Playoff Semifinals at the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic and Capital One Orange Bowl as well as the PlayStation Fiesta and Chick-fil-A Peach bowl pairings.

The 44-year-old became an unrestricted free agent on July 28.

Chara recorded two goals 10 points a +5 rating a 49.5% five-on-five Corsi-for percentage a 52.33% five-on-five expected goals-for percentage and a 51.63% five-on-five scoring chances-for percentage in 55 games last season. Chara averaged 18:19 per game including a team-high 2:41 on the penalty kill. He added a +1 rating in the Capitals’ five-game first-round Stanley Cup Playoff series loss to the Boston Bruins his former team.

In 1608 career regular-season games with the Islanders Capitals Bruins and Ottawa Senators Chara has earned 207 goals 666 points and a +293 rating.

With the addition of Chara the Islanders fill a hole on the left-side of their second-pairing after trading Nick Leddy to the Detroit Red Wings in July. The team averaged 2.23 goals-against per game (second in the NHL) and earned an 83.7% penalty-killing rate (sixth) last season.

In 200 career Stanley Cup Playoff games Chara has earned 18 goals 70 points and a +49 rating. He led the Bruins to three Stanley Cup Final appearances as captain including a title in 2011.

With Chara no longer an option the Capitals now have one less option to replace Brenden Dillon after trading him to the Winnipeg Jets for two second-round picks in July. They have yet to replace him and the best internal options appear to be Martin Fehervary who has played in six career regular-season games and Michal Kempny who missed the entire 2020-21 season after his second major surgery in a span of 17 months.

The Islanders also signed left-handed defenseman Erik Gustafsson to a PTO earlier this week.

Training camps across the NHL are slated to open on Thursday and preseason is set to begin on Saturday.

Chara and the Islanders’ first visit to Capital One Arena this season will be on Tuesday March 15. The two teams will face off for the first time on Thursday December 23 at UBS Arena.

If Chara plays 44 games this season he will become the NHL’s all-time games played leader among defensemen passing Chris Chelios (1651) Scott Stevens Larry Murphy and Ray Borque. Stevens and Murphy also suited up for the Capitals during their respective careers.

On Saturday night at the Capital One Arena a capacity crowd broke its 18-month fast and returned to the collective communion of a live concert thanks to Harry Styles.

In a statement CBCP President Archbishop Romulo Valles asked for prayers so that Advincula “can resume his important ministry” in the Church.

“We extend our prayers of fast recovery complete healing and good health to Cardinal Advincula” Valles said. “We assure him of our closeness with him with our love support and prayers.”

The CBCP head also asked his fellow bishops to offer Masses for the fast healing of the 69-year old Manila archbishop.

“I ask my brother bishops to please include in all our daily Mass intentions the full recovery of our dear Cardinal” Valles said.

“We bring all our prayer to the Lord and to our Blessed Mother for an end to this pandemic for all those who are sick and those who care for them” he added.

After an 18-month layoff for the New Orleans cruise industry those who boarded the Glory say it had the feel of a maiden voyage.

“This is our third rescheduling. So third time’s the charm” said Rhonda McCabe.

Martin Guidry was invited to be the first passenger on board and was asked to cut the ribbon during a ceremony in honor of the occasion.

“This is my 14th cruise. I just love Carnival. I don’t know why anyone would do anything other than this” said Guidry.

For most of the 1400 passengers Sunday’s departure was a long time coming as their cruise was postponed and rescheduled again and again over the past year and a half because of Covid-19 concerns.

And for the City of New Orleans the resumption of the cruise industry means the return of badly needed tourism dollars to help boost the economy.

“Ninety percent of the guests that travel in are out-of-town guests and they usually spend one or two days here in New Orleans” said Brady D. Christian President and CEO of The Port of New Orleans.

Carnival officials said returning to New Orleans is a great feeling but they know the pandemic is ongoing.

All passengers are required to be both vaccinated and test negative for the virus two days before their trip.

A lot has changed since the last cruise ship set sail with passengers on board but vacationers say they have no reservations.

“We’re even more happy that they required us to do the testing and the vaccines” said Guidry.

“Well the way I see it we’re safer on the boat than at Wal-Mart” McCabe said. “Because at least on the boat we know everybody is cleared.”

You may find yourself debating between Royal Caribbean and Carnival. Both are incredibly popular cruise lines but both are very different.

While Carnival Cruise Line is more affordable and known for its family-friendly amenities Royal Caribbean offers family-friendly amenities but with more of a luxurious feel and a “wow” factor.

Itineraries differ as well with Carnival offering more U.S.-based sailings and Royal Caribbean sailing to more destinations outside of the United States.

To help you pick the best cruise line for your next vacation we’re breaking down everything you need to know about Royal Caribbean vs. Carnival.

Fleet Size

When it comes to fleet size both of the major cruise lines are pretty well matched but in recent years Royal Caribbean has pushed ahead with more new ships joining the fleet. Carnival Cruise Line has 25 ships and Royal Caribbean International has 26.

Carnival has a few older ships with its oldest being the Carnival Elation built in 1998 but it also offers a few newer ships too with its newest ships such as the Excel class of Mardi Gras Carnival Celebration and Carnival Jubilee.

Royal Caribbean on the other hand has a slightly younger fleet with its oldest ship Grandeur of the Seas being built in 1996.

In terms of ship sizes the two cruise lines are well-matched there too. Carnival’s smallest ships are its Fantasy-class vessels which hold just over 2000 passengers while its largest ship is the Mardi Gras which holds just over 5000 passengers.

Similarly Royal Caribbean offers smaller ships in its Vision class with capacities hovering around 2000 people. Royal Caribbean’s largest ship as of July 2023 is Wonder of the Seas which has a gross tonnage of 236600 and a passenger capacity of 5734 at double occupancy.

However in January 2024 Royal Caribbean’s new class Icon of the Seas will become the new world’s largest cruise ship at 250000 gross otns a guest capacity of 5610 at double occupancy.

So who wins? Both cruise lines offer a range of ships of varying ages and varying sizes. Carnival has led for a long time but Royal Caribbean is becoming the leader in terms of passenger numbers and ships.

Deployment

When cruising with Carnival you’ll find that there are more than a dozen home ports in North America with a ton of cruises available out of Florida and New England. There are lots of itineraries that travel around the Caribbean and along the Mexican Riviera and to Cancun. On rarer occasions Carnival offers longer sailings and sailings to and around Europe but it’s not the norm.

Royal Caribbean on the other hand has fewer North American home ports but it still offers a lot of the same itineraries to the Caribbean and Mexico in addition to cruises to Hawaii and Alaska. There are European cruises available more regularly with Royal Caribbean than with Carnival and there are even some cruises that travel around Asia and Australia.

Who wins? It depends on what you’re looking for. If you want a more affordable cruise headed out of a popular North American port and you primarily have your sights set on Caribbean destinations you’ll do fine with Carnival.

If you want to travel to Alaska Hawaii or anywhere off the East Coast or around Europe or Asia you’ll do best to pick Royal Caribbean.

Cabins

Carnival offers large cabins in general and the newer the ship you book the better and more modern your cabin. There are specialty cabins available too such as the Cloud 9 Spa rooms that provide extra spa-related amenities and the Havana cabins on newer ships which include access to a private Havana-class pool and deck.

There are some family cabins though not as many as you might think that they would have based off of how much the cruise line markets itself to families. Family suites are available on select ships.

In general Carnival’s cabins (as well as the entirety of the line’s ships) feel more colorful bold and cheerful. Everything is very festive and fun.

On Royal Caribbean you can find a wide array of cabin styles with some pretty cool features that you might not see with other cruise lines. These include the cruise line’s virtual balcony interior cabins that project real-time exterior views onto your interior wall for the illusion of a floor-to-ceiling window. Large suites are also available as are family cabins.

Royal Caribbean’s vibe and decor style is a little more elegant and upscale than what you’ll see on Carnival. The bright colors have been swapped out for sleeker color palettes more similar to what you might see in an upscale modern hotel.

Who wins when it comes to cabins? Royal Caribbean takes top points for its upscale feel and hotel-like designs.

Entertainment and Activities

As you could probably guess Carnival Cruise Line offers loads of family-friendly kid-geared activities. Activities include pools waterparks (including the WaterWorks water park) outdoor sports centers (with mini golf basketball volleyball and more) and for the new Mardi Gras ship a roller coaster. Other entertainment options on newer ships include ropes courses and SkyRide a recumbent bike ride on the top decks.

When it’s time to head indoors Carnival offers your standard comedy sets Broadway-style performances and live music. Nightlife options include poolside movies nightclub-esque parties and DJ sets.

However Royal Caribbean takes the fun up a notch. While the line may not be as renowned for its family-friendly atmosphere as Carnival is it still manages to “wow” with all things entertainment-related.

Royal Caribbean boasts multiple pools on each ship FlowRider surfing simulators water parks zippiness indoor skydiving and rock climbing walls among other entertainment options. About half of Royal Caribbean’s ships offer indoor ice skating rinks.

Newer ships in the Quantum-class offer the SeaPlex an indoor entertainment center with activities such as roller skating and trapeze classes. Of course Broadway-style shows are on tap as are aerial shows acrobatic stunts at the AquaTheater and DJ sets.

Who wins? Royal Caribbean is your place to go for truly “wow”-worthy entertainment and activities. No matter which ship you sail on you’re sure to find near-endless ways to stay busy and have fun.

Dining and Bars & Lounges

Carnival offers both fixed and flexible dining options. There are fewer specialty dining options on Carnival cruise ships and the included basic dining options are firm fan favorites. These include long-standing options such as the BlueIguana Cantina Guy’s Burger Joint and Guy’s Pig & Anchor Bar-b-Que.

Carnival is no stranger to celebrity restaurant concepts either as is obvious with the line’s partnerships with celebrity chef Guy Fieri Shaq and Emeril Lagasse.

Royal Caribbean offers similarly fixed and flexible dining options. There are many more specialty dining options on Royal Caribbean ships as compared to Carnival cruise ships. The basic restaurants included in your fare are pretty standard though and pretty much just include a few casual and cafe options as well as ships’ main dining rooms.

Royal Caribbean doesn’t have as many celebrity endorsements though it does offer a restaurant concept from celebrity chef Jamie Oliver.

Both cruise lines offer drink packages to help you cover the cost of your bar tab versus paying for drinks one at a time. The packages allow you to pay one price for your drinks.

Royal Caribbean’s drink package is more expensive than Carnival’s; however Royal Caribbean’s drink package doesn’t limit the number of alcoholic drinks you can consume in one day whereas Carnival’s drink package limits you to 15 drinks.

When it comes to dining who takes the top prize? It’s a tie here because as with sailings and deployment which cruise line has the best dining and drinking option for you will all depend on what you’re after.

If you want flexibility and lots of free dining options go with Carnival. If you want lots of specialty dining options and free-flowing drinks — and don’t mind paying for them — go with Royal Caribbean.

Other Onboard Features

Other onboard features that the two cruise lines offer?

Carnival’s family focus is pretty solid as you might expect. Kids clubs include separate clubs for elementary-age kids preteens and teenagers. The Seuss at Sea program is pretty popular and includes several events throughout each cruise including costume parades and breakfasts with characters. Babysitting is available as are spa treatments for teens.

Royal Caribbean also boasts plenty of family fun with programming for elementary-age kids preteens and teenagers as well. Babysitting is also available.

Beyond the family stuff other amenities abound and each cruise line offers its own special twist on the cruising experience.

Royal Caribbean for example is known for some high-tech amenities such as its robotic bartenders fast WiFi app luggage tracking and online check-in. Royal Caribbean also boasts its own private island with a water park which is an included stop on many Caribbean siblings.

For other onboard features Royal Caribbean wins for its plenteous amenities even if its children’s programming isn’t as robust as what Carnival offers its passengers.

Private Islands

The Perfect Day Island at Cococay in the Bahamas has been recently redesigned and features tons of ways to play and have well a perfect day — all without battling the crowds you might find at a normal cruise port.

Carnival’s private island on the other hand is Half Moon Cay also in the Bahamas. While it certainly offers its own perks and benefits it’s not nearly as hype-worthy as Perfect Day Island.

The Guests

When you’re on a cruise you end up sailing with the same few thousand people for a week or more and while that might seem like a ton of people and you probably would think that wouldn’t run into the same folks twice… You’d be surprised how much and how often you see the same individuals.

For that reason it’s nice to cruise with people you like and people that are similar in things such as taste and preferences.

On Carnival you’ll find a lot of families children singles and budget-traveling couples. Most passengers are middle-aged adults. On Royal Caribbean you’ll find more couples and singles than families with most travelers being middle-aged or older adults.

There’s no clear winner when it comes to cruisers as each line caters to different types of travelers though some cruisers may find things to love about both lines.

Cost

When it comes to cost there’s no argument that Carnival offers the more affordable cruise fares. The cruise line’s entire reputation has been built on affordable cruises for the entire family. Pricing includes most of your dining venues and entertainment and you can often find sales and promotions that allow you to cruise at an even lower cost.

Royal Caribbean on the other hand certainly doesn’t break the bank when it comes to cruising. It’s still entirely possible to cruise on a budget with the line. However Royal Caribbean is slightly more expensive than Carnival and this is especially the case when it comes to its newer ritzier ships.

Worth Reading: How Much Does a Cruise Cost?

Additionally Royal Caribbean’s basic cruise fares don’t offer all the same inclusions that Carnival bundles into its basic cruise fares; you might find yourself paying extra for things like dining and entertainment.

The clear winner is Carnival when it comes to cost for sure. You just can’t beat the line’s prices.

Carnival Glory is sailing a seven-day cruise this week that will stop in three destinations in The Bahamas: Bimini Freeport and Nassau.

“Carnival Cruise Line has been a part of the New Orleans community for more than 25 years and we’re absolutely thrilled to provide our guests an opportunity to get Back to Fun while supporting the local economy in one of our most popular homeports” said Christine Duffy president of Carnival Cruise Line. “Carnival is the number one cruise operator from New Orleans with the greatest variety of cruise choices and itineraries and we are so happy to bring our unique brand of fun back to this fantastic city.”

Carnival first launched year-round cruises out of New Orleans in 1994.

On Nov. 1 another Carnival ship Carnival Valor will relaunch in New Orleans with a series of four and five-day Mexico cruises.

“Carnival Cruise Line is a valued longtime partner and we are proud to welcome Carnival Glory back for the first oceangoing cruise from New Orleans since March 2020” said Brandy D. Christian Port of New Orleans President and CEO. “We applaud Carnival’s commitment to the New Orleans market and for exceeding health and safety requirements to protect guests crew and the community. The return of Carnival cruises from Port NOLA will be a boost to our local economy as guests are once again able to experience our famous New Orleans hospitality when they sail from our vibrant city.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5L2Nhcm5pdmFsLWRyZWFtLXJlc3VtZXMtc2VydmljZS1pbi1nYWx2ZXN0b24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Dream Resumes Service in Galveston,"Another Carnival Cruise Line vessel is resuming service today as the Carnival Dream welcomes guests back in Texas. The 2009-built Galveston-based ship is kicking off a series of six-and eight-night cruises to the Eastern Caribbean and The Bahamas.

On its first cruise the Carnival Dream is sailing on a six-night Western Caribbean itinerary that features visits to three ports in Mexico and Belize. The first stop is Costa Maya followed by Belize City and Cozumel.

Cozumel – an island in Mexico’s Quintana Roo region surrounded by coral reefs – is one of the highlights of the cruise.

Carnival Dream’s itineraries through December will include other popular ports in the region such as Half Moon Cay Roatán and Key West. Two other Carnival ships are currently homeporting in Galveston: the Carnival Breeze and the Carnival Vista.

First of a series of three ships known as the Dream Class the Carnival Dream entered service in 2009. At the time the vessel ushered a new era in “Fun Ship” cruising offering a unique host of innovations and features.

Among the ship’s highlights is an expanded Carnival WaterWorks aqua park with one of the longest waterslides at sea. The 3650-guest vessel also introduced entertainment options such as a comedy club and a half-mile wrap-around outdoor promenade complete with whirlpools that extend over the ship’s sides.

Other features include 19000 square feet of space dedicated to children and families in addition to a wide variety of formal and casual dining options – a made-to-order pasta venue a 24-hour pizzeria a sushi bar and a burrito station.

The Carnival Dream was upgraded with Carnival’s new hull colors when it went into drydock in July. According to the company the livery is inspired by the design that debuted on the new Mardi Gras while serving as an homage to maritime tradition with patriotic red white and blue hues – also the colors of Carnival Cruise Line.

The Carnival Dream is the 10th ship to resume service for Carnival Cruise Line after the COVID-19 operational pause.

It also became one of the three ships to resume service for the company this month. On Sept. 12 the Carnival Pride reentered service in Baltimore kicking off a series of cruises to The Bahamas and Eastern Caribbean.

Also resuming service today the Carnival Glory is currently embarking on its first cruise from New Orleans after an 18-month pause."

According to the global market researcher Clarkson Research Service on Sept. 18 the average price for a 174000-cubic-meter LNG carrier recently touched around $200 million for the first time since 2015 when it logged a record-high price of $275 million.



Since 2017 LNG tanker prices have not moved much. However the growing demand for LNG as an eco-friendly fuel has led to steady growth in LNG carrier prices. This year alone the price of LNG carriers increased by 9.9% compared to the beginning of the year.

While the increase rate may be on the lower end compared to the 13% growth rate of the Clarkson Newbuilding Price Index  it’s still considered high given that the decline rate of LNG carrier price has been low compared to other vessel types such as container ships and bulk carriers.As LNG carrier price increases domestic shipbuilders are looking forward to their earnings outlook. According to Clarkson Research Korean shipbuilders have won orders for 37 large LNG carriers out of the 38 orders placed globally.Moreover additional orders for large LNG carriers are expected from Qatar and Russia in the second half of the year.The contracts were mostly secured by Korea's ""Big Three"" -- Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering Co. (KSOE) Samsung Heavy Industries Co. and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co.“Korea’s major shipbuilders have already secured two years' worth of order backlogs” said a shipbuilding industry official adding that the ship price uptrend is likely to carry over to improved earnings.Jung-hwan Hwang at jung@hankyung.com Danbee Lee edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlybGluZXMtYXJlLWJhbm5pbmctY2xvdGgtbWFza3Mtb24tZmxpZ2h0cy1mb3ItbWVkaWNhbC1tYXNrcy0yMDIxLTnSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFyZS1iYW5uaW5nLWNsb3RoLW1hc2tzLW9uLWZsaWdodHMtZm9yLW1lZGljYWwtbWFza3MtMjAyMS05P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global airlines are banning cloth masks on flights for medical masks,"Frenchbee flight attendant wearing a surgical mask onboard

Taylor Rains/Insider



International airlines are starting to require passengers to wear surgical masks over cloth masks onboard.

According to one study surgical masks ""offer substantially higher filtration efficiencies"".

See more stories on Insider's business page.

More international airlines are starting to require surgical masks over cloth masks.

In August Finland national carrier Finnair became the latest airline to require passengers to wear surgical masks on board joining Lufthansa Frenchbee Air France LATAM Swiss and Croatia Airlines.

Finnair said on its website: ""Please note that we do not accept masks made of fabric face shields masks with a valve or scarves used as a mask as they allow air to escape and do not provide comparable protection.""

Acceptable masks are surgical valveless FFP2 or FFP3 N95 or equivalent according to the airline.

A study conducted by the University of Waterloo in Canada and published in the Physics of Fluids journal determined medical-grade N95 and equivalent masks better protect against COVID-19.

While some international carriers are mandating surgical masks no US airline has implemented the policy and the CDC has not banned cloth masks in its mask guidance. According to the agency cloth masks are acceptable as long as they are double-layered tightly woven without punctures or holes and fit snugly around the face.

However some carriers do ban certain types of face coverings like scarves or masks with vents or valves. For example Delta Spirit Hawaiian Frontier United and American do not allow bandanas to be used in lieu of a double-layered face covering or surgical mask according to each company's policy.

Getting passengers to comply with face mask requirements has been a challenge for airlines since the start of the pandemic which has led some carriers to ban customers who do not comply. Last week two JetBlue passengers caused chaos on a flight when they refused to mask up forcing the airline to ban them from flying the carrier again.

In the US the choice between wearing a medical-grade surgical or cloth mask is ultimately up to the traveler though research suggests transmission on aircraft is rare. Last Wednesday a published peer-reviewed study conducted by Delta Air Lines revealed the risk of COVID-19 transmission on aircraft where all passengers test negative within 72 hours is less than 0.1%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLnRveW90YS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9jb3Jwb3JhdGUvMzYwNzQwNTUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hydrogen-powered Engine Corolla Takes on the Challenge of Transporting Imported Hydrogen at Super Taikyu Series ...,"In order to achieve a carbon-neutral hydrogen society through racing hydrogen-powered engine vehicles a group of people with the will and passion to work together have gathered from across industries and are taking on various challenges together.

Its struggling travel industry hopes it just got easier,"In a summer full of depressing travel news Canada finally delivered Stewart Wingate the CEO of London's Gatwick Airport something he could celebrate.

For the first time in almost a year the blue star of Canada's third-largest carrier Air Transat was back at Gatwick as the airline resumed flights to the United Kingdom this week after a break during the pandemic.

""To have the Air Transat planes back in the sky it's incredibly important to us"" Wingate told CBC in an interview from the rooftop of Gatwick's nearly deserted South Terminal.

Air Transat's return came just a few days before Britain revamped its international travel rules on Friday in a bid to restore consumer confidence in taking an overseas holiday. Westjet which also flies into Gatwick had resumed flights from Calgary and Toronto in July.

Once the busiest single-runway airport in the world with a plane taking off or landing roughly once a minute Gatwick 50 kilometers south of London is operating at only one-third of its usual capacity. Pre-pandemic Gatwick claims it was Europe's 16th-busiest airport in terms of passenger volume whereas now it has fallen to 64th place.

Gatwick's focus is largely on leisure traffic and it's the hub for discount carrier EasyJet.

Likewise London's No. 1 airport — Heathrow — has also seen its passenger numbers fall off a cliff dropping by more than 80 per cent since the start of the pandemic.

From the Gatwick terminal rooftop the sight of many vacant departure gates illustrates the struggles Britain's diminished travel sector has faced.

The country's travel industry association ABTA the Association of British Travel Agents estimates the downturn has cost the country more than 100000 direct travel-related jobs.

Missed rebound

European airports such as Frankfurt and Amsterdam on the other hand have rebounded much faster than those in the U.K. largely because their host countries have simplified their travel restrictions said Wingate.

""We're only running at about half the level of the European airports.""

All summer and now into the fall Britain's airlines tour operators and passenger rights groups have been engaged in an acrimonious fight with the government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they pushed for changes to Britain's international travel regulations.

The prime target has been the UK's ""traffic light system"" which gave every country a classification — green amber or red — depending on their level of vaccinations and the incidence of COVID-19.

The industry complained the ratings often changed without notice and by mid-summer ABTA claims 58 per cent of travellers ended up cancelling holiday plans because of the uncertainty.

Travel both outbound and return to the U.K. has also required a series of pricey COVID-19 tests for passengers — as many as four or five per return trip — costing up to $130 Cdn each which added another disincentive for taking a trip.

Visitors to red list countries are also required to hotel quarantine upon their return for 14 days at a cost of up to $4000 Cdn for an adult.

""The global economy's been incredibly damaged by COVID-19 and we need to get things moving"" ABTA spokesperson Sean Tipton said in an interview.

New rules

Finally Johnson's government gave the industry much of what it was hoping for on Friday with a ""simpler more straightforward system"" according Transportation Minister Grant Shapps.

The traffic light system will be replaced by two lists a red list of countries where travel is banned for all but essential reasons and a green list for everywhere else. Canada has been on the U.K.'s green list since the last review three weeks ago.

Crucially fully vaccinated travellers also won't have to pay for COVID-19 PCR tests after they enter the U.K. which should eliminate cumbersome paperwork and reduce the cost of flying.

Instead passengers will have to take a much cheaper and easier lateral flow test. Full hotel quarantines after returning from red list countries will still apply.

WATCH | Mishmash of regulations hinders international travel: Mishmash of rules hampers international travel recovery during pandemic Duration 2:01 AirTransat has resumed its flights from Canada to the U.K. which some hope points to a recovery for international travel that has been hampered by a mishmash of rules and low consumer confidence.

In terms of regulations the new British rules will bring the country closer to Canada which earlier this month opened up for international travel to fully vaccinated visitors.

A key difference is that Canada still requires passengers to have a PCR test within 72 hours of boarding their flight into the country.

Passengers flying back to Canada from Gatwick this week had already taken off before the new rules were publicized. But Wendy Day who was on her way to Toronto said the simplified rules system was long overdue.

""If it wasn't for the fact that we were going to see our son we probably wouldn't have taken a holiday.""

Prof. Kelley Lee of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby B.C. has been part of a multinational research effort studying the impact of travel restrictions during the COVID pandemic.

She said the U.K.'s ""traffic light system"" was never an effective way of dealing with the coronavirus because decisions over which countries to put on which list were inherently political and not based on science.

""That leaves open a lot of lobbying and a lot of undermining of public health"" Lee told CBC in an interview.

She said the broad conclusions of her research to date are that it's still too soon to ditch travel restrictions altogether as coronavirus variants are continuing to evolve.

While border controls can't keep the virus out she said they have been effective at slowing its spread.

""What you can do is slow the virus down. You can buy yourself a few days even a few weeks.""

However Lee said there needs to be far better co-ordination and agreement among countries on what the rules for travel should be.

""It's very unco-ordinated. For the traveller it's a nightmare. For the airlines it's a nightmare.""

Wingate the Gatwick CEO said with the new rule changes passenger traffic in the U.K. should slowly ramp up again over the fall and into Christmas.

""We're a catalyst for the local economy"" said Wingate ""but we also know we are a catalyst for routes at the other end. So when we are flying into Vancouver Toronto or Calgary we know what we are enabling is for global business to take place at both ends of that route.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vdW5pdGVkLWFpcmxpbmVzLWpvaW5zLWRlbHRhLW9uLW5pZ2VyaWEtdXMtcm91dGVzL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vdW5pdGVkLWFpcmxpbmVzLWpvaW5zLWRlbHRhLW9uLW5pZ2VyaWEtdXMtcm91dGVzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Airlines joins Delta on Nigeria-US routes,"United States carrier United Airlines says it will operate the first-ever nonstop flight between Washington D.C and Lagos Nigeria and offer more flights between the US capital and Africa than any other carrier.

United is joining another American carrier Delta Airlines which has been flying the Nigeria-US routes in the last 14 years.

The Houston-based United had stopped flights to Lagos about five years ago following exchange rate crisis in Nigeria and a global downturn in the oil market.

According to United the new service between Washington DC and Lagos Nigeria will begin November 29 2021 subject to government approval.

The airline said it would operate three weekly flights connecting the US capital to Nigeria’s largest city which is also the top western African destination for US-based travellers.

The carrier said tickets would be available for sale on its website app this weekend.

The statement quoted the United Airlines Vice President International Network and Alliances Patrick Quayle “This new flight to Lagos has been highly anticipated by our customers and offers the first ever nonstop service between Washington DC and Nigeria as well as convenient one-stop connections to over 80 destinations throughout the Americas including Houston and Chicago” said

“On behalf of all of United we’d like to offer our sincere thanks to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority and U.S. Department of Transportation for supporting our plans to provide this service.”

“We are honored to work with our partners at United Airlines to welcome their second nonstop connection from Dulles International to the African continent” said Carl Schultz acting vice president of airline business development at the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. “Lagos joins nearly 50 other nonstop international destinations currently served by the National Capital Region’s gateway to the world.”

A SHOPPER was left horrified after finding a bright green caterpillar alive in his Tesco sandwich.

Grant Robinson was about to take a bite of his BLT when he spotted the green insect ""wiggling"" on the bread.

The 31-year-old recoiled in disgust as the hungry caterpillar munched its way through the snack.

He had already eaten the other half of the sandwich and fears he may have ""chomped on caterpillar eggs"".

""I was just about to eat a BLT when in the corner of my eye I saw this caterpillar crawling out of the side. I completely froze and said 'no way'"" he said.

""My colleagues gathered around and found it absolutely disgusting.

""The fact I ate the first sandwich freaked me out as there was the possibility that I'd just eaten caterpillar eggs or something.""

Grant put the caterpillar that was about half an inch long into a bush outside the Tesco Express store in Westbourne Bournemouth before throwing the £2.50 sandwich away.

He had gone back into the shop to complain and said staff were apologetic.

And when he raised the issue with Tesco online the supermarket giant apologised and gave him a £5 voucher.

But Grant said their response ""lacked sincerity"".

""They apologised and gave me a £5 voucher as a goodwill gesture but that's not the point"" he said.

""I think Tesco need to really watch their food processing as that could make someone very ill.

""On Twitter I saw a lady who found a large moth in a fruit salad so this isn't something out of the ordinary.

""It's a really bizarre situation and Tesco need to be more aware and pay attention to detail.""

Grant posted a picture of the caterpillar on social media and users were quick to comment.

One person wrote: ""£5 compensation what a joke.""

Another who looked on the bright side said: ""Better than finding half a caterpillar!""

A Tesco spokesperson said: ""We're sorry this happened and take every effort to minimise the risk of insects in our lettuce.

""We offered this customer a full refund for the item and a gesture of good will as an apology.""

They die out in our area and rely on their southern relatives to migrate back north in the spring to repopulate the territory. These beauties can travel up to 100 miles per day and they are one of the earliest spring butterflies to arrive in Cambridge. You still might be able to see some of these butterflies in September if the weather is warm enough.

American lady butterflies have two large eyespots on each hindwing. Animals often evolve patterns to help camouflage themselves from predators but eyespots make butterflies stand out. Why would American ladies want to stand out?

Scientists have three hypotheses about why eyespots might help butterflies. Some think butterfly eyespots scare away predators because the predator thinks there is a large dangerous animal behind the eyes (the intimidation hypothesis). A second idea (the deflection hypothesis) is that the eyespots deflect predators: The predator attacks the eyespots on the edge of the wings rather than the butterfly’s head giving the butterfly a better chance at survival. A third hypothesis is that the eyespots make the butterfly stand out and standing out is often a signal that a creature is poisonous.

While it is not known which hypothesis is correct having eyespots clearly aids butterfly survival. In one study researchers compared butterflies with intact eyespots with ones that had the eyespots painted over. The butterflies with the intact eyespots survived much better; in fact only one of 34 butterflies with intact eyespots was killed whereas 13 of 20 butterflies with painted-over eyespots were killed. Additional studies have shown similar results.

How did this butterfly come to be called the American lady? The painted lady (found on every continent except Antarctica and South America) is a well-known European butterfly. Early naturalists saw a two-spotted version of the European butterfly in North America which they called the American painted lady subsequently shortened to American lady. American ladies resemble and are related to painted lady butterflies but they are easily distinguished because they have on their hindwings two large eyespots rather than four small ones. American lady butterflies are more cold tolerant than painted ladies so you will see more American ladies than painted ladies as the weather cools. Early season ladies are larger and more brightly colored than late-season ones.

Although adult American ladies prefer nectar from flowers they will also feed on sap or rotting fruit as they are not specialists like monarch butterflies. Male American ladies – is that an oxymoron? – sometimes sip water from damp soil or mud. Females fly low in search of ground-hugging plants that make good hosts for their caterpillars such as pearly everlasting and pussytoes.

American lady females lay single green pinhead-sized eggs on the upper leaves of host plants. The eggs are very small and blend in well with the green leaves making them hard to see. The eggs hatch into caterpillars in three to five days. The caterpillars sew together bits of seed fluff or leaves to make nests on their host plants that they rest in when not eating. The nests are best seen in the early morning when sunlight reflects off the morning dew they collect.

These caterpillars form chrysalises that are different colors (and shiny or dark) depending on their surroundings. When an American lady caterpillar pupates near green leaves it forms a greenish shiny iridescent chrysalis. When it pupates near something dark it forms a dark dull chrysalis.

American ladies like all butterflies do not have lungs. They breathe through tiny holes on the sides of their bodies (spiracles). The holes open into a system of tubes (trachea) which carry the oxygen throughout their bodies. Butterflies are cold-blooded and require warmth to activate their flight muscles. Generally butterflies will not fly when temperatures are below 55 or 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

How does climate change affect these butterflies? This subject has not been well studied but it is known that as temperatures increase some butterflies reproduce earlier. Unfortunately their caterpillar host plants often do not mature earlier so there may be a mismatch between when caterpillars hatch needing to eat and when host plants are available for munching. This mismatched timing can upset the entire food web – from caterpillars to birds to even larger predators.

While the rest of the phone may not live up to its flagship price tag the top-tier thermal sensor provides enough value to justify a purchase for those who need to see more than meets the eye.

With the Cat S62 Pro the company best known for its huge construction vehicles and machines has set out to construct the ultimate work phone. Compared to the previous generation S61 the S62 Pro features a host of spec upgrades alongside an integrated FLIR 3.5 professional-grade thermal sensor. The S62 Pro is also starting off at a much lower retail price than the S61 but is it enough to stand out among the best rugged phones you can buy? Find out in Android Authority‘s Cat S62 Pro review.

What you need to know about the Cat S62 Pro

Chase Bernath / Android Authority

Cat S62 Pro (6GB/128GB): $649 / £499 / €549 The standout feature of the Cat S62 Pro is the built-in FLIR Lepton 3.5 professional-grade sensor for thermal imaging. It’s the highest resolution sensor you’ll find in any consumer smartphone with a 4x increase in the number of thermal pixels compared to previous-gen devices. Thermal imagery can be overlayed on top of images from the device’s 12MP dual pixel Sony camera or used in combination with FLIR’s variable intensity MSX (Multi-Spectral Dynamic Imaging) technology that overlays linear detail from the scene. It should be noted that the thermal imaging system replaces the laser-assisted distance measurement feature found on the Cat S61.

With a stiff thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) back and aluminum frame the Cat S62 Pro is built to survive the most grueling of tasks. The 5.7-inch FHD+ display is protected with Gorilla Glass 6 which comes with a protective film pre-installed. IP68 and IP69 ratings (with no port covers needed) alongside a MIL-STD-810H durability rating mean this phone can survive dust water drops (to 1.8 meters) pressure and a wide range of climates. A non-slip pad on the back of the phone helps with grip especially when wearing gloves. See also: The best Cat smartphones

Other noteworthy specs include a 4000mAh battery that can last up to two days on a single charge 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage which is expandable if you sacrifice one of the dual-SIM slots. The phone ships with Android 10 though Bullitt Group (the OEM behind Cat phones) states that an Android 11 update is incoming and is promising three years of security updates.

Android Enterprise is supported for custom business profiles. The phone ships with OfficeSuite to read edit and create Word Excel or Powerpoint documents. There is also a toolbox app that includes a library of productivity tools created by Cat and its partner companies that features everything from a bubble level to a VR learning platform.

Available only in black the Cat S62 Pro is available to buy from Cat directly Amazon and other major retailers globally.

What’s good?

The headline thermal imager is much more than a toy or gimmick. The sensor provides enough detail to accurately locate objects on screen whether you are attempting to diagnose a leak hotspot electrical short blockage or elevated temperature. In our testing the phone was able to accurately identify the temperature of objects within a single degree. Check out the photo samples later in this review for some examples.

The included MyFLIR app includes a host of productivity features for accurate thermal detection. MSX mode showcases a clear outline of the scene on top of the heat map while the overlay mode seamlessly switches between the thermal sensor and the main camera on the device. You can use pinpoints to identify temperatures in a specific spot or draw out boxes and circles on the display to identify minimum maximum or average temperatures within an area.

The Cat S62 Pro's thermal imager performs exceptionally well.

The grip panel on the back of the phone helps with better handling with gloves. Within the Settings there is also an option to activate a glove mode for increased display sensitivity. The orange button on the side of the phone can be used in PTT (push-to-talk) mode with voice communication apps or you can program specific apps to launch with a press of the button. It’s also got a notification LED which could be useful for those working in darker environments.

The 5.7-inch 1080 x 2160 LCD display isn’t as vivid as an OLED panel but it does get bright enough to use even in direct sunlight. The rear camera can shoot video in 4K at 30fps and is able to take decent photos in good lighting. Both the rear and front cameras also have a portrait mode for a blurred background effect though it’s not nearly as good as the portraits taken on flagship smartphones as you might expect.

The Cat S62 Pro also offers some of the best protection ratings of any smartphone with IP68/69 and MIL-STD-810H ratings and the Gorilla Glass 6 display with a protective film. Combine this with the durable build — metal frame rubber rear — and you’ve got a phone that is built to take damage while still not being too heavy for everyday use. Likewise for those that prefer their phones to not stand out the muted yet industrial aesthetic compares favorably to some of the more gaudy rugged phones on the market.

While the Cat S62 Pro is running the year-old Android 10 Bullitt Group’s promise of security support for three years — plus comprehensive aftersales support — exceeds almost all other rugged phones and rivals Samsung’s Galaxy XCover Pro.

What’s not so good?

Chase Bernath / Android Authority

For a phone with a premium price tag some of the specifications on the Cat S62 Pro are underwhelming. The mid-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor can handle everyday tasks and even some light gaming but does fall behind performance on other rugged phones with comparable MediaTek and Exynos processors. There is even some noticeable lag when switching between apps and taking multiple photos.

The lack of any face detection software is strange considering this phone has a dedicated glove mode — good luck trying to unlock the phone using the fingerprint sensor with a glove on. Wireless charging is also a noticeable absence so you can’t plug the phone in to charge if the USB-C port is wet. Speaking of which there isn’t a flap to prevent water and dust from getting stuck inside the charging port though this may be considered a positive by those who don’t want to mess around with port covers.

The Cat S62 Pro also can’t escape the typical downsides of a rugged phone — a chunky design and a not inconsiderable weight of 248g (not the heaviest but it’s not exactly light). For such a large phone it’s a shame Cat couldn’t fit any more than a 4000mAh battery inside. The battery life is still more than enough to make it through a full day of use but there are lots of thinner and lighter phones that manage to pack larger batteries inside their chassis.

There’s no support for 5G on this phone so you’ll be stuck on 4G networks. Unlike some rugged phones there also isn’t a headphone jack so you have to turn to USB-C dongles or Bluetooth to playback audio.

Cat S62 Pro review: Should I buy it?

Chase Bernath / Android Authority

A large portion of the Cat S62 Pro’s $649 price went towards having the best thermal sensor and an ultra-durable design which means sacrifices were made pretty much everywhere else. At best this phone performs as well as mid-range phones that cost hundreds of dollars less.

If you’re in the market for this phone though chances are you don’t care about the latest specs or most powerful performance. You likely just want a rugged phone that can take a beating and capture some thermal imagery in the process. If that sounds like you then the Cat S62 Pro won’t disappoint. It’s also one of the few rugged phones that are promised to be supported for years into the future with Android Enterprise security updates guaranteed until late 2023. The sleek look and capable cameras also add to the phone’s appeal.

If you want a truly rugged phone that can take a beating and capture some thermal imagery in the process the Cat S62 Pro won't disappoint.

FLIR sells thermal camera attachments for both iOS and Android devices so you could theoretically turn almost any phone into a thermal imaging device. However the FLIR One Gen 3 attachment costs $229.99 and carrying around a separate camera module is a lot less convenient than an all-in-one device like the Cat S62 Pro.

Alternatives with thermal sensors include the Blackview BV9900 Pro ($519) and Ulefone Armor 9 ($629) but they both feature weaker FLIR Lepton 2.5 sensors. If you want the best thermal imaging experience in a smartphone the Cat S62 Pro can’t be beat. Otherwise the DOOGEE S96 Pro ($389) is a solid handset at a reasonable price and the Galaxy XCover Pro ($499) brings a similarly sleek design and a removable battery. However neither have the thermal sensors and can’t match the Cat S62 Pro on protection ratings.

Cat S62 Pro With a FLIR 3.5 thermal camera and MIL-STD-810H rating the Cat S62 Pro can detect heat in any environment. See price at Amazon Save $106.60

Top Cat S62 Pro questions and answers Q: Is the battery removeable?

A: No the battery in the Cat S62 Pro cannot be easily swapped out.

Q: Does the phone support Pogo pin connection?

A: No unlike some other rugged devices the Cat S62 Pro does not have Pogo pins for charging or connecting to other devices.

Or do you know where common milkweed is growing in the wild?

It’s almost time to harvest the seedpods.

The Summit Soil & Water Conservation District is encouraging local residents to participate in the Ohio Pollinator Habitat Initiative’s milkweed pod collection which runs through Nov. 1.

The Ohio State University Extension office has set up an outdoor collection bin for milkweed pods at its Summit County office at the Akron Urban League at 440 Vernon Odom Blvd. The green bin is located outside Door 19.

But don’t clip those pods until they’re ready (and dry).

Milkweed is the only host plant for monarchs. After the butterflies lay their eggs on it the caterpillars hatch and feed on the leaves.

The leaves also help protect monarchs from predators. Natural chemicals in the plant make the caterpillars taste yucky to many of its enemies.

The more milkweed the more monarchs. The more seeds the more milkweed.

The Ohio Pollinator Habitat Initiative which is made up of nearly 80 Ohio agencies nonprofit groups and businesses is on a mission to improve and create pollinator habitat in Ohio and to raise awareness about the importance of pollinators.

So why are they important? It’s only the planet that’s at stake.

Pollinators are responsible for about one-third of the world’s food supply according to the state group. They move pollen from plant to plant resulting in pollination which is necessary to bear fruit.

Meanwhile bee and butterfly populations have plummeted over the past decade because of a loss of habitat. Milkweed plants can help turn that around.

Before you clip those pods the Ohio Pollinator Habitat Initiative offers some important advice. Find the right plant and don’t collect seeds too early.

People should become familiar with the common milkweed to avoid harvesting pods from similar plants such as swamp milkweed and hemp dogbane. The collection is only for common milkweed.

It is best to check the pods when they are dry gray or brown. September is the time to locate milkweed plants to keep an eye on the pods while they ripen.

Here are other tips from the initiative:

• Find areas where there are a good amount of milkweed plants with harvestable pods.

• Keep tabs on those areas to check on the pods throughout September.

• Once the pods start to look more brown or gray they are likely ready to be harvested.

• If the center seam pops with gentle pressure the pod can be harvested.

• Leave a couple of pods per plant to ensure natural regeneration occurs.

• Use paper bags or cardboard boxes and wear gloves while harvesting pods.

• Store the pods in paper bags. Plastic bags collect unwanted moisture.

• Keep the pods in a cool dry area until they can be delivered to a collection site.

• Write the date and county collected on the bags when you turn them in.

FEC offloaded 21 Anderson a freehold apartment block in the city’s posh District 10 for S$213 million ($158.3 million) the developer said in a filing late Friday with the Hong Kong stock exchange. The buyer was Kheng Leong Co a local residential developer owned by the Wee family that controls SGX-listed builder UOL Group and United Overseas Bank (UOB).

FEC had paid S$196 million to purchase 21 Anderson from Blackstone in 2018 with the company controlled by Hong Kong’s Chiu family saying in its stock exchange announcement that the disposal would “(i) realise the value of the Property (ii) allow the gain from the Disposal to be crystalised and the capital to be recycled and (iii) increase liquidity and reduce net gearing”.

Kheng Leong which targets the luxury segment is betting on the 34-unit condo block opposite the Raffles Girls Secondary School near Stevens Road after S$1.4 billion in luxury condos changed hands in the first half of 2021. That amount nearly doubled the S$723 million volume recorded during the last six months of 2020 according to research by CBRE.

Going Upscale

Kheng Leong’s new prize comprises 34 residential units covering a total gross floor area of 87000 square feet (8083 square metres) meaning the developer paid roughly S$2448 ($1819) per square foot of GFA. The transaction is understood to have been brokered by Sakal Real Estate Partners founder Steven Ming but Sakal representatives declined to comment when contacted by Mingtiandi.

Occupying a 49048 square foot site the 2020-vintage building was under renovation when FEC purchased it and boasts a 30-metre-long swimming pool a tennis court and a gym.

Located just 650 metres (711 yards) north of the city-state’s Orchard Road shopping strip the strata-titled project is across the road from Nouvel 18 a joint venture of City Developments Ltd and Wing Tai Holdings where an upper floor unit sold last month for S$3441 per square foot according to an account in Singapore’s EdgeProp citing public records.

21 Anderson has now changed hands five times in the past 13 years with Blackstone having purchased the property from Richard Yue’s Arch Capital in 2014 for S$164 million.

Luxury on the Rise

Ultra-high-end home sales have been on the upswing this year in Singapore.

In April the Tsai family behind Taiwan’s Want Want China Holdings paid the equivalent of S$4827 per square foot to purchase Swire Properties’ Eden project just 10 minutes’ walk from 21 Anderson and during the first half of 2021 more than nine apartments in Singapore were sold for S$5000 per square foot or more according to CBRE.

Noting that the Singapore government reopened the nation’s borders this month CBRE said this could bring foreign buyers back to the high-end housing market. “As such prices in the luxury segment are expected to remain resilient or see further appreciation as demand remains strong” CBRE said in its report.

Ringing the Register

FEC helmed by second-generation tycoon David Chiu has moved to monetise some of its foreign property holdings in recent months.

In June the frequent buyer of UK real estate announced that it was selling the Dorsett City London Hotel to a company controlled by US-based Highgate Hotels and Cerberus Capital Management for £115 million ($160.4 million).

FEC said it expected to record a gain of about £50 million from the sale of the 267-room hotel near the iconic Gherkin tower with FEC’s wholly owned DHI Hotel Management UK to provide management services for the property after completion of the transaction.

The deal was intended to let the group realise the value of the hotel recycle capital increase liquidity reduce leverage and reap income from management fees as the hospitality sector stabilises post-pandemic.

“We look forward to exploring new opportunities to deploy capital at attractive rates of return” FEC managing director Chris Hoong said at the time.",,,,,,

In disbelief the 27-year-old from Edinburgh rang 50 dental practices but without any luck. He had no choice but to go private. Having lost his job during the pandemic he was on universal credit and had to borrow the £600 from his family.

Fabien is one of a growing number of people without health insurance who are paying for medical treatments out of their own pocket. NHS hospital waiting lists in England have reached record levels hitting 5.6 million this summer as doctors struggle to clear a growing backlog caused by Covid-19. People on modest incomes and even those claiming benefits are turning to private providers for knee or hip replacements cataract removal or even expensive cancer treatment.

This week a survey of 4000 adults commissioned by charity Engage Britain showed more than a fifth had gone private because they could not get the treatment they needed. While support for the NHS remains high a quarter said the wait for treatment for themselves or a loved one had had a serious impact on their mental health.

Roughly 13% of the UK population has some kind of health insurance mostly through their employers. The rest are faced with a stark choice – wait months and even years for badly needed treatment or dig into savings to jump the queue.

“The pandemic will have a long-lasting impact on the self-pay market” says Vernon Baxter managing director of the magazine HealthInvestor UK. “With the NHS under pressure for the foreseeable future the concept of paying out of pocket to expedite treatment will be increasingly commonplace – for those who can afford it.”

Health data firm LaingBuisson has put the value of the annual self-pay market at £1.1bn including cosmetic surgery and says it has grown by 7.1% between 2010 and 2019. That year private hospital groups derived just over 20% of their revenues from self-paying patients. With private hospitals closed to non-NHS patients during the pandemic the statistics were not collected last year but there is every indication they will have jumped dramatically this year.

Last week Spire Healthcare revealed a 47% surge in half-year revenues from self-paying patients to a record £130m which lifted its overall revenues nearly 40% from pre-pandemic levels to £558m.

The second largest private hospital group in the UK with 39 hospitals and eight clinics Spire says the majority of self-paying patients are aged 35 or over and most have a combined household income of more than £50000. As Justin Ash the chief executive says: “It’s by no means the super well-off.” David Hare the chief executive of Independent Healthcare Providers Network the industry body says many people have built up savings over the past 18 months having been unable to travel or dine out and “some want to spend that money to get back full mobility” by having knee or hip surgery. “People are paying for oncology treatment as well” he says.

A similar picture is emerging at Spire’s rivals. The UK arm of US-listed HCA Healthcare which dominates the London market has seen a 25% increase in self-pay hip and knee replacements and other orthopaedic procedures a 20% increase in cardiothoracic ops such as aortic valve replacement and repair and a 30% rise in neuroscience treatments such as injections into joints to treat back head neck shoulder groin or leg pain. People are coming to HCA’s six London hospitals from farther afield than usual particularly from the south and southwest of England where it has recorded between 25% and 35% more self-paying patients.

Britain’s biggest private hospital chain BMI Healthcare declined a request to share numbers for its own hospitals. It is part of the Circle BMI group which now runs 53 hospitals in the UK and is owned by Centene Corporation a publicly listed US healthcare giant.

Company filings show that at BMI the highest-paid director thought to be Karen Prins the chief executive was paid nearly £1.6m for the year to 31 March 2020. The firm did not pay a dividend but the previous year it paid £1.1bn to its then parent GHG.

Baxter says the private health sector in the UK is “really at a fork in the road”. Operators are deciding whether to position themselves as a partner to the NHS or as a competitor.

David Rowland director of the thinktank Centre for Health and the Public Interest says: “There is a big risk that unless government provides adequate funding for the NHS more and more people will be forced to pay privately which in turn will undermine middle-class support for a tax-funded NHS.

“It’s not likely that we will end up with a US-style insurance system. But a two-tier system where the NHS is a residual service for those without the means to pay is a possibility – ultimately these are political choices.”

Rowland says private operators were already trying to “create a new type of health consumer” who pays for their own treatment before the pandemic through TV and social media campaigns. They have sought to make self-pay more attractive by offering fixed-price packages and some hospital groups such as Nuffield Health are offering zero-interest finance. They have also pushed into lucrative cancer treatments which became the biggest single earner for private hospitals in London in 2019 as the Cleveland Clinic and other US brands entered the UK.

After the pandemic public support for the NHS remains high. But the government has imposed a hike in national insurance to bring down waiting lists. With many now paying twice for care – first through their taxes and then from their own pockets – that goodwill cannot be taken for granted.

“I’m not sure if I’m angry or annoyed” says Fabien who is still in debt to his family. “I feel like it’s really unfair that I had to pay for treatment.”

The announcement of 2021 Active Laureates Harold Calloway and Susan Hardwick and 2021 Historical Laureates Willard Carpenter and Walter Koch was made this week by Junior Achievement of Southwestern Indiana and Old National Bank.

Induction ceremonies will be during a breakfast at 8 a.m. Dec. 2 at Old National Events Plaza.

Individuals are nominated for outstanding civic and business contributions to Southwestern Indiana as well as business excellence vision innovations inspiring leadership courageous thinking and community service.

“One thing that struck me during the selection process is the amount of trailblazers and hugely impactful individuals both recent and historical that have sprung from Evansville” said Daniela Vidal chancellor of Ivy Tech Evansville. “In many cases most people are not aware of the size of their impact which is why the JA Evansville Regional Business Hall of Fame is important to do.

“It really helps to highlight and bring forward these incredible stories that really build pride and inspire our up-and-coming leaders of what is possible” Vidal said.

Harold Calloway

Born in Philadelphia Mississippi Calloway was raised on a family farm during the height of the civil rights movement.

""When (white children's) school bus broke down they got a new one and we didn't"" Calloway told the Courier & Press in 2005. ""They had a gymnasium to play basketball; we played outside even in the winter. They had indoor toilets and we had outdoor toilets. But what are you going to do? You keep on until things get better. We weren't going to be discouraged.""

Things did get better for Calloway who relocated to Evansville with his wife Frankye after attending college in Tennessee and after Army service in Vietnam.

He worked as director of financial aid for the University of Southern Indiana (he was USI's first Black administrator) and then as a State Farm agent in Evansville for 34 years before retiring in 2019.

Calloway also was involved in local politics in various roles including a brief time on the Evansville City Council where he finished an unexpired term. He's a former member of the Evansville Water and Sewer Utility Board and chaired former Mayor Russ Lloyd Jr.'s transition team after Lloyd's 1999 election.

He's a member of the USI Board of Trustees.

After becoming a State Farm agent Calloway said he had concerns a Black person couldn't sell insurance to white people. But he became one of the state's top agents and the top Black agent in the state for several years.

""Part of my mission has been to let people know that if you got your stuff together if you hold yourself like you're supposed to and if you back up the product with the company you recommend people don't care what color you are when it comes down to that"" he said.

""The good thing I found out in this business is we have a good town"" Calloway said of Evansville.

Susan Hardwick

Hardwick is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Water the largest publicly traded U.S. water and wastewater utility company.

She joined the company in 2019 after a lengthy career with Vectren Corp. prior to its acquisition by CenterPoint Energy.

While at Vectren Hardwick was a member of the executive leadership team responsible for development and execution of business and financial strategy for both the regulated utility businesses as well as the market-based subsidiaries.

She led the development and execution of the company’s regulatory strategy and investor relations and was responsible for numerous financing transactions including a total of over $2 billion in long-term debt financing.

And Hardwick led the execution of the agreement with CenterPoint Energy for the sale of Vectren for $8.5 billion.

Hardwick served in leadership positions on a variety of community boards including St. Mary’s Medical Center Fifth Third Bank (Southern Indiana) Evansville Museum Evansville Celebration of Diversity Distinguished Lecture Series Gilda’s Club of Evansville and Richard G. Lugar Excellence in Public Service Series among many others.

Appointed by the governor Hardwick also served two terms as an Arts Commissioner for the State of Indiana. She received the Athena Award in 2009 from the Chamber of Commerce of Southwestern Indiana the Sara B. Davies Leadership Award in 2016 presented by Leadership Evansville and the Torchbearer Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016 presented by the Indiana Commission on Women.

Hardwick grew up intending to become an accountant but about five years after graduating from Indiana University and taking a position at a large accounting firm in Indianapolis she noticed how few women were in management roles.

She was determined to move up the ranks and she did.

""My view is I think there is too much emphasis on goal-setting"" Hardwick told the Courier & Press in 2014. ""Whatever I'm doing right now I'm going to do the best I can do.""

Willard Carpenter

A titan in local real estate Carpenter received little formal education but was gifted with natural intelligence especially when it came to money.

He made the bulk of his fortune through real estate and partnering with others in non-real estate ventures. Real estate remained Carpenter’s lifelong passion and at his death the Evansville Courier called him “the born king of real estate speculators.”

Carpenter first came to Evansville as a dry goods merchant with Carpenter Bros. and owned interest in multiple real estate and business ventures.

He was best known for his building and real estate business Willard Carpenter and Son Builders and Real Estate.

Carpenter also was an Evansville City Council member a Vanderburgh County commissioner and an Indiana state representative.

In 1846 he was elected to the board of the Evansville Branch of the State Bank of Indiana (later to become Old National Bank). He gave both money and property to charitable causes. A gift of land from Mr. Carpenter precipitated the construction of the Vanderburgh County Christian Home that served as a shelter for women and children particularly as a refuge for unwed mothers during their pregnancies until 1985.

But his crowning civic achievement would be the establishment of a public library. Willard Library was opened to the public on March 28 1885 and is today the oldest public library building in the state.

While Carpenter would not live to see his dream come to fruition he left instructions for how his library was to be and it fit his staunch abolitionist views — it was to be open to all people “regardless of age race class or gender.”

Walter Koch

Born in Evansville in 1904 Koch worked part-time as an office boy at International Steel while attending Central High School. Staying with the company after graduating he worked his way up to chairman of the board.

Due in large part to his efforts International Steel moved up to seventh place among the nation’s steel fabricators. In 1922 Koch met with the late Mayor William Dress with a plan to plunge millions of dollars into a shipyard to build ocean vessels in Evansville.

The U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships had already approved the project and contractors were ready to accept Evansville as the site. Because of Koch's tenacity the shipyard became Evansville’s biggest wartime employer providing nearly 20000 jobs around the clock.

Koch was engaged in the Evansville community and beyond through service on boards including Evansville Air Board Community Fund Campaign Rotary Club of Evansville Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company Early American Life Insurance Company Indiana Toll Bridge Commission and National Association of Manufacturers.

Koch won the Rotary Civic Award for community achievement in 1947. He persuaded an Indianapolis philanthropist to give nearly $500000 to the University of Evansville to help fund a building campaign and was instrumental in convincing Herman Krannert to make a donation to UE for which Krannert's name is on the university's fine arts building.

Koch was on the UE Board of Trustees for many years and perhaps his greatest accomplishment was serving as the leader called on to attract the War Industries to Evansville. It became the largest economic boom in the history of the area at that time bringing the city out of the Great Depression with 20000 new jobs.

The products produced include the newly designed LST vessels credited with being instrumental in the allies' victory on D-Day.

In a literal twist on the phrase 'it's Christmas come early' shoppers have spotted a surprising number of shelves stocked with festive products.

Tesco Sainsbury's Marks and Spencer and Co-Op have already started putting out Christmas items in their stores.

Typically Christmas items begin appearing after supermarkets have shifted their Halloween stock.

But with Halloween still more than a month away shoppers have questioned why supermarkets are now selling Christmas items.

Some shoppers have even suggested it is being used as a creative way to cover-up empty shelves.

It comes as today the owner of the UK's biggest poultry supplier said Christmas dinners could be 'cancelled' this year due to a shortage of CO2 used in the supply chain.

However Alok Sharma this morning attempted to calm fears of food shortages caused by a fuel crisis insisting there was no 'immediate concern' and that the public could be 'confident' there was no threat to Christmas dinners.

How CO2 gas prices are affecting meat industry The problems facing meat producers are a by-product of rising natural gas prices even though the substance is not even used by the industry directly. Their problem is carbon dioxide. This gas is used both in abattoirs as part of the stunning process and as 'dry ice' to keep food chilled/frozen and fresh on its way to consumers. But the industry sources its CO2 from two fertiliser plants in in Teesside and Cheshire where it is created as a by-product of manufacturing soil food and sold off. As well as the meat industry it is also used to make fizzy drinks fizzy - including beer. These two plants use natural gas in their main fertiliser business. What the price spike has done is made this business uneconomical - the fertiliser is too expensive to produce. So their owner  US firm CF Industries closed them down last week. But they between them produce around 60 per cent of Britain's industrial CO2. What this means is that as supplies dwindle in the coming weeks producers could be unable to get their produce to supermarkets in a condition fit to sell because it cannot be refrigerated.

Meanwhile Sainsbury's and Coop stores have been pictured with shelves full to the brim with mince pies advent calendars and festive chocolates.

Tesco's South Queensferry branch in Edinburgh was today pictured displaying a sign that read: 'Stock up early.'

Some shoppers have taken to social media highlighting the early arrival of Christmas puddings and mince pies.

Posting a picture of Christmas puddings one said: 'Penzance Tesco last Sunday.

'I reckon they've put out the Christmas stock early to cover the gaps on the shelves from other short deliveries.'

A second said: 'Our local Tesco started selling Christmas stuff already. Stack up early they say. Maybe a clever way of hiding the empty shelves?

'Can't remember seeing it before Halloween. Personally I'm not quite ready for this.'

A third said: 'Stock up early says Tesco.

'Has anyone got the willpower to buy lots of Christmas goodies and leave them untouched until late December?'

A Tesco spokesperson said: 'It's a few weeks until customers are able to choose from our full range of Christmas products.

'However we know some of our customers like to start their shopping well in advance so as we do every year we have started selling a small selection of festively-themed products in some of our stores.'

A Sainsbury's spokesperson said: 'Each year we stock some festive products in advance of the main Christmas period.

'This is because some customers like to buy gifts and longer life items in plenty of time or treat themselves early.'

A spokesperson for the Co-op said: 'We know that many customers like to buy Christmas products early so to satisfy demand and taste buds we've started to stock our shelves now.'

The Cop26 president said ministers 'don't see any risks going into the winter' from a spike in global gas prices that prompted the closure of two industrial sites vital to the food and drink industry.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will tomorrow hold an emergency summit with energy bosses after the closure of fertiliser plants in Teesside and Cheshire.

A by-product of the fertiliser production process is the creation of carbon dioxide.

It is used in fizzy soft drinks and beer as well as by the meat industry to stun animals before slaughter in food packaging to extend shelf life and to keep deliveries chilled.

If supplies of CO2 run short it raises the prospect of meat disappearing from supermarket shelves within weeks.

The British Meat Processors Association says it only has two weeks' capacity.

'The clear message that is coming out of this is that there is no immediate concern in terms of supply we don't see any risks going into the winter' Mr Sharma told Sky News's Trevor Phillips on Sunday programme.

'People should be confident that the supplies will be there and that we will be protecting them in terms of price rises. But of course we are not complacent about this.'

The Cop26 president said ministers 'don't see any risks going into the winter' from a spike in global gas prices that prompted the closure of two industrial sites vital to the food and drink industry.

The two fertiliser plants closed last week are run by the US firm CF Industries and produce around 60 per cent of Britain's CO2.

They were shut when a spike in energy costs – caused by low supplies and storage levels of gas – caused its operating costs to rocket.

British Meat Processors Association boss Nick Allen told the Sun: 'Everyone is outraged these fertiliser plants can shut down without warning and take something so essential to the supply chain off-stream just like that.'

Four more small energy firms could go bust amid the UK's rocketing energy prices One million customers could be set for a new energy supplier as four small firms could go bust as early as next week amid skyrocketing energy prices. The rising cost of supplying energy has left the four firms unable to power their customer's homes. The four suppliers have requested larger businesses to prepare for a takeover of their supply reports the BBC. Earlier this week People's Energy based in Edinburgh and Utility Point from Dorset announced they had ceased trading. More than 570000 customers and 1000 businesses will have been affected by the change. At the start of 2021 there were 70 suppliers providing energy to homes across the UK - although experts anticipate this number dropping to 10 by 2022. Industry group Oil & Gas UK warned wholesale prices for gas have risen 250 per cent since January - with a 70pc boom since August. Advertisement

Ranjit Singh Boparan the owner of Bernard Matthews and 2 Sisters Food Group warned the supply of Christmas turkeys was at risk adding: 'The CO2 issue is a massive body blow and puts us at breaking point.' Ocado the online grocer told customers this weekend that it had a 'limited stock' of frozen items due to a national shortage of dry ice – solid CO2.

Shadow economic secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: 'This really must act as a spur to avoid situations like this where suddenly we're very exposed when there's an international price spike.'

He told Sky News's Trevor Phillips on Sunday programme: 'In the short term what the Business Secretary must do is ensure continuity of supply that's a basic duty of Government for both domestic consumers and for businesses.

'We've seen other ramifications of this over the last 24/48 hours for example on food supplies with CO2 being a necessary by-product and in the long-term what this has shown is the need to get on with the transition to net-zero and the vulnerability of the reliance on fossil fuel markets especially international ones.

'This should act as a spur to get on with the transition to net-zero more renewable and sustainable supplies because the effect of all this will be rising prices for consumers just when they're being hit with other things too.'

As well as the food and drink industries CO2 from the plants is used by hospitals and the nuclear power industry.

A by-product of the fertiliser production process is carbon dioxide (CO2) which is used in fizzy drinks and beer as well as by the meat industry to stun animals before slaughter in food packaging to extend shelf life and keep deliveries chilled. If supplies of CO2 run short it raises the prospect of meat disappearing from supermarket shelves within weeks.

Ocado the online grocer told customers this weekend that it had a 'limited stock' of frozen items due to a national shortage of dry ice – solid CO2.

Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium yesterday said: 'This could not come at a worse time with the shortfall of 90000 HGV drivers already putting severe pressure on food production and distribution.'

Ahead of tomorrow's summit Mr Kwarteng spent yesterday calling energy firms individually.

Last night in a bid to ease anxieties he said: 'I was reassured that security of supply was not a cause for immediate concern within the industry. The UK benefits from having a diverse range of gas supply sources with sufficient capacity to more than meet demand.'

Mr Kwarteng and Greg Hands the new Energy Minister will tomorrow ask 20 of Britain's biggest energy companies to help stop bills soaring over the winter. Firms invited to the 90-minute roundtable include National Grid energy suppliers Centrica Ovo and Bulb and regulator Ofgem.

One energy boss said Ministers could cut bills by around £150 per year if they axed the 'green taxes' on electricity which make up around 23 per cent of their total.

Another industry source said the energy price cap could be reviewed more frequently up from twice a year currently. The cap is announced two months in advance potentially leaving smaller suppliers unable to cover the cost of energy they have committed to supply. Five small suppliers have gone bust since August.

The cap is announced two months in advance potentially leaving smaller suppliers unable to cover the cost of energy they have committed to supply. Five small suppliers have gone bust since August.

The spike in gas prices has been caused by factors including low reserves after last year's cold winter reduced supply from Russia rising EU carbon prices and low solar and wind energy output this month.

Last Friday more than 40 MEPs accused Russian energy giant Gazprom of hiking gas prices to undermine Britain and the EU's recovery from the pandemic.

But Mr Kwarteng said Britain is not dependent on Russian oil and gas adding: 'Our largest source of energy is from domestic production and the majority of imports come from reliable suppliers such as Norway. We do not expect supply emergencies this winter.'

OGUK representing the offshore oil and gas industry reported wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January – with a 70% rise since August alone.

The rise in gas prices has been blamed on a number of factors including a cold winter which left stocks depleted high demand for liquefied natural gas from Asia and a reduction in supplies from Russia.

Speaking to broadcasters on the tarmac of New York’s JFK airport Mr Johnson said: “I think people should be reassured in the sense that yes there are a lot of short-term problems not just in our country the UK but around the world caused by gas supplies and shortages of all kinds.

“This is really a function of the world economy waking up after Covid.

“But this will get better as the market starts to sort itself out as the world economy gets back on its feet.”

It comes with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng due to hold a fresh round of crisis talks with the energy industry.

Following a meeting on Sunday with the regulator Ofgem Mr Kwarteng said “well-rehearsed plans” were in place to ensure consumers were not cut off in the event of further failures.

However he is expected on Monday to come under pressure from the big suppliers for a major Government support package to help them through the crisis.

The Financial Tines reported the industry wants the creation of a so-called “bad bank” to absorb unprofitable customers from firms that fail.

“It’s like everybody going back to put the kettle on at the end of a TV programme you’re seeing huge stresses on the world supply systems” he told reporters travelling with him to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

Following a weekend locked in emergency talks Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was a “worrying time” for customers but said he was confident supplies could be maintained.

He said consumers would be protected from sudden price hikes through the Government’s energy price cap.

However that puts pressure on the suppliers – particularly smaller companies – who are unable to pass on the increases in wholesale gas prices to their customers.

Four firms have already folded and there are fears that more could follow.

Some analysts have reportedly predicted that the UK’s energy companies could be reduced to three-quarters over the coming months leaving as few as 10.

After meeting Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley on Sunday Mr Kwarteng indicated that in the event of further failures he could appointment a “special administrator” – effectively a form of temporary nationalisation.

“Our priority is to protect consumers. If a supplier of last resort is not possible a special administrator would be appointed by Ofgem and the Government” he said.

“The objective is to continue supply to customers until the company can be rescued or customers moved to new suppliers.”

At the same time ministers are grappling with warnings of potential shortages on the shelves as the knock-on effect of the gas price rise ripples through the economy.

Producers have warned that supplies of meat poultry and fizzy drinks could all be hit due to a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2).

It follows the shutting down of two large fertiliser plants in Teesside and Cheshire – which produce CO2 as a by-product – with the owners citing the increase in gas prices.

The Food and Drink Federation chief executive Ian Wright said CO2 was essential to many production processes and warned there could be “serious consequences” for supplies within a matter of days.

On Sunday Mr Kwarteng met with Tony Will the global chief executive of CF Industries the UK’s biggest supplier of CO2 and the owner of the two fertiliser plants.

He said they had discussed the pressures the business was facing and “explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies including to our food and energy industries”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLTU4NjE5NDE40gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtNTg2MTk0MTguYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK energy company seeks funds to stay afloat,"""We do that at a level beyond our European neighbours but also for our power sector and other uses in the economy so when we get an unprecedentedly high price there are unprecedented impacts on the market."""

Rates for all modes of transportation rose quickly over the past year pushing up 3PLs’ earnings power and making them more attractive targets. But buyers — especially private equity firms — are also paying more for those earnings especially for larger brokerages Smith said and lenders are waiving some covenants that require companies to keep their leverage ratios at lower levels.

“Once you get above $10 million in [earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization] you’re considered by the lender community to have scale and durability and that’s where you start to see very attractive lending packages” Smith said. “There’s an inflection point there in EBITDA multiples as well. We’re seeing 7-10x for small companies … and 12-3x for companies with $20 million in EBITDA.”

The higher prices paid for 3PL earnings and the increasing amount of debt or leverage put on companies are being driven by a confluence of factors. More institutional investors including universities insurance companies and pension funds have funneled their capital into private equity firms raising the PE industry’s stores of uncalled capital or “dry powder.” The more money private equity general partners have at their disposal the greater the pressure to put the capital to work by buying businesses.

(Chart: Bain Capital’s 2021 Global Private Equity Report.)

Even as PE general partners were raising record amounts of capital COVID-19 disrupted dealmaking which traditionally relied on intensive business travel and in-person meetings. The economic disruptions and uncertainty that COVID introduced also constrained M&A. Target companies’ financial performance started to look anomalous and no one really knew what the future held. It was hard to close investments all through the middle of 2020.

But the result of those delays was pent-up demand for acquisitions: Capital that wasn’t deployed still needed to be invested and deals that were not closed in 2020 had to get signed in 2021.

Finally the behavior of freight markets themselves — especially the run-up in spot and contract trucking rates — has made 3PLs and brokerages more attractive. Higher contract and spot rates mean that brokers generate higher net revenue dollars per load even if gross margins stay flat. The faster a target’s EBITDA grows the easier it is to justify a higher multiple paid for last year’s EBITDA.

(Chart: FreightWaves SONAR. Truckload contract rates per mile in white; truckload spot rates per mile in green).

Last week Echo Global Logistics (NASDAQ: ECHO) sold to private equity firm The Jordan Company for $48.25 per share approximately $1.3 billion or roughly 11.4x Echo’s trailing 12 months of EBITDA. Historically non-asset domestic transportation management companies like freight brokers have sold for about 10x EBITDA according to documents prepared by 3PL M&A advisory firm Armstrong & Associates. Jordan’s bid represented a 54% premium to where Echo’s shares were trading prior to the announcement.





“The Echo deal is further confirmation that private equity competition for logistics assets is white hot” Smith said. “There is a pretty severe disconnect between how public company shareholders value brokerage earnings and where private equity investors see value. The Jordan Company is a smart and experienced logistics investor – they reportedly made a quick double on their 2018 investment in GlobalTranz after just eight months. Their willingness to place a premium value on ECHO at this late stage in the freight bull market is encouraging. It suggests that they see continued healthy markets in the near-to-medium term.”

Smith and Feldman advised freight brokerage Everest Transportation Systems on its sale to Cambridge Capital last week. Everest is notable because the large majority of its operational staff are in Kiev though the company is headquartered in Evanston Illinois. Everest’s model leverages an inexpensive workforce that has language skills helpful for communicating with Eastern European small carriers and owner-operators in the Midwest. Everest’s strategy of offshoring talent but managing it in-house rather than through a staffing firm has an even more pronounced impact on operating expenses Smith said.

“The Everest deal was fascinating to work on right now” Feldman said. “I’ve never seen a stronger seller’s market for M&A before. It was great to see the interest in Everest too — those guys have built a great mousetrap.”

Everest’s unique operating model was key to catching the attention of buyers who need help justifying high entry points. Smith said that technology trends like digital freight brokerage and transportation management hybrid models in which 3PLs own some assets and 3PLs that aggressively implement offshoring or nearshoring strategies have attracted attention from buyers who know they will have to pay up for a 3PL in the current M&A market.

“What we see in the market broadly speaking is that 3PLs are trying to figure out how to move forward year by year and stay competitive” Smith said.

Continued innovation in the 3PL industry has stabilized some of the more violent cyclicality that historically plagued transportation companies’ earnings Smith said and savvy private buyers know how to identify resilient brokerages. One strategy used by private equity firms to lower their entry points in expensive ‘platform quality’ freight brokerages is to “buy and build” or tack-on smaller subsequent acquisitions at a lower multiple.

“Distinguishing between revenue growth and volume growth for example is part of every conversation and part of every process” Smith explained. “We are steeped enough in brokerage at this point that we’re good at explaining the dynamic. If you look at the history of C.H. Robinson and Echo how those companies performed long term through cycles has been pretty compelling. Cash flows don’t crater in down markets. Things get tighter but people find ways to cut costs and survive and thrive through up and down markets.”

Smith said that persistently low inventory levels in the United States suggest that demand for transportation services will stay hot for the foreseeable future. The only thing he could see that would materially slow the pace of M&A he said would be a hypothetical dislocation on the lender side of the market that drove interest rates up and made leveraged buyouts more difficult. As long as transportation companies are doing well prices for them should stay strong.





“I see at least a year of really strong transportation supply and demand dynamics for service providers” Smith said underscoring his belief that underlying freight markets will remain favorable for transportation providers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was initially published in 1896 and since then a significant quantity of important information has continued to be provided about inventories from various firms. This guide explores all about this robust index.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) is one of many indexes used as a gauge for how well an entire market performs at any given time. The index can be helpful because it shows where and how much specific markets have fluctuated in value for days weeks or months. It also allows investors to track their investment performance and compare themselves against others with different portfolios.

History of DJIA

The DJIA is one of the oldest and most well-known stock market indexes in America. Charles Dow the co-founder of the Wall Street Journal created the index back in 1884. Charles Dow composed his first stock average of nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the Customer’s Afternoon Letter a daily two-page financial news bulletin that preceded The Wall Street Journal. By 1900 the index was renamed Dow Jones Industrial Average and included 30 equities divided into two groups: the industrials (comprising 19 members) and the railroads (11).

DJIA expanded beyond transportation stocks with the addition of General Electric (NYSE: GE) in 1901. It joined as one of 11 industrial sector companies added that year due to perceived growth prospects based on earnings per share multiples at a time resulting from significant expansion following consolidation/merger wave among USUS manufacturing businesses during the 1890s – 1910s.

Many significant adjustments occurred throughout the 20th century as many former components combined departed or were relocated.

Using historical data from the DJIA you could get a good idea about what factors affect stocks in general. For example if you saw that oil prices tend to go up when there’s terrible weather somewhere – maybe your portfolio has some exposure to alternative energy research?

DJIA history is a significant indicator of the overall direction of top-level economic activity as measured by leading US industrial corporations whose performance is indicative of changes in business conditions and investment prospects for stock market investors. DJIA value has been included in significant decisions regarding monetary policy that affect global markets such as Federal Reserve rate decision announcements published in advance so financial professionals can monitor new information before public release.

Understanding the Dow Jones Industrial Average

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) sometimes called the “Dow” is a stock market index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States are trading during a standard trading session in the stock market.

The components of DJIA are chosen from leading US companies across different industry groups to reflect their significance within those specific industries and national markets overall.

For a company’s stocks to be added onto or removed from this average they must meet specific requirements including management integrity and liquidity along with shareholder equity over time which helps ensure only established corporations remain included.

Dow Jones Industrial Average Components

The DJIA comprises numerous components that are crucial to the information it provides about how well or poorly the stock market as a whole has performed on any given day.

As of 2021 the Dow Jones Average Index includes the following companies: Apple Inc (NYSE: AAPL) Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE: CRM) Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) Visa Inc (NYSE: V) The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) The American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: HON) Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) The Travelers Companies (NYSE: TRV) Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) Merck & Co. Inc (NYSE: MRK) UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) IBM (NYSE: IBM) 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) The Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) Amgen Inc (NASDAQ: AMGN) Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT) Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA).

DJIA vs the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite

While the basic mission of DJIA S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite is similar the way they go about the task is very different.

Their selection methodology varies. The Dow tracks the value of 30 large companies which tend to be blue-chip firms that are household names. The S&P 500 tends to be broader hoping to have a bigger representation of companies from various sectors and industry groups. And the Nasdaq composite includes only stocks that are trading on the Nasdaq market.

Conclusion

The DJIA has been a historical benchmark for investors to keep in mind when evaluating their stock performance compared to other top companies on the market. However there are many different indices these days and each investor needs to conduct thorough research before placing any investments with a financial adviser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZm9zc2lsLWZ1ZWwtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNwZW5kLW1pbGxpb25zLXRvLXByb21vdGUtaW5kaXZpZHVhbC1yZXNwb25zaWJpbGl0eS0yMDIxLTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fossil-Fuel Companies Spent Millions to Play up Your Carbon Footprint,"Marianne Ayala/Insider



Plastics companies spent millions to kickstart recycling programs and it helped them avoid bans.

Decades later fossil-fuel interests spend millions to promote carpooling and reducing energy use.

Activists and researchers say this individual-action narrative distracts from the biggest polluters.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Ben Franta is trying to collect every climate-related ad the oil and gas industry has ever produced.

Franta who is pursuing a law degree and PhD at Stanford is among a small cohort of researchers who track fossil-fuel industry propaganda. These historians social scientists and activists have documented the extent to which major oil companies knew their products were changing the climate as early as the 1960s and how they poured tens of millions of dollars into sowing doubt about the science through the 1990s.

""Not to get too tin-hat-y but once you start to see these ads over and over again you see the common elements arise"" Franta told Insider.

So it was clear to him that around the year 2000 fossil-fuel companies changed marketing tactics. After decades of denial they pivoted to blaming the climate crisis on you and me.

Franta pointed to a 2007 Chevron ad campaign called ""Will you join us?"" Each poster featured a person's face and a pledge – promises like ""I will leave the car at home more"" and ""I will finally get a programmable thermostat."" In small print Chevron describes its own initiatives to be energy-efficient.

On the campaign's now-defunct website users could even make pledges like carpooling to work a few days per week and a calculator would tell them how many DVDs they could watch with the energy saved.

""The framing is: 'No we the companies are the good ones. We're working on the problem and we want you the consumer to join us in our positive efforts'"" Franta said.

This approach – telling people to solve a crisis by changing their own habits – is a tried and true corporate tactic pioneered by the tobacco and plastics industries. Now fossil-fuel giants like Chevron BP and ExxonMobil have spent millions to convince the public that consumer choices and lifestyle changes will solve the problem.

""It's almost become natural when people think about the climate crisis to think of individual action"" Denali Nalamalapu a communications specialist for the climate organization 350.org told Insider. ""Which is super convenient for fossil-fuel corporations.""

But at this point personal lifestyle changes will not turn the climate crisis around. A report from the International Energy Agency which lays out a path to a net-zero-emissions energy system by 2050 estimates that individual behavioral changes would only account for about 4% of the necessary reductions.

To have even a 50% chance of stopping the world's temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius according to a study published this month 90% of coal and 60% of oil and gas reserves must stay in the ground.

A blame campaign: litterbugs and recyclers

In 1971 TVs across the US blasted a heart-wrenching PSA. In it an actor in ambiguous American-Indian garb his hair in two long braids climbs into a canoe and paddles across a river full of discarded newspapers. He passes an industrial barge. Smokestacks puff in the background. He pulls his canoe onto a garbage-strewn shoreline and climbs to a busy highway. A passing motorist chucks a bag of fast food at his moccasined feet.







""People start pollution. People can stop it"" a narrator says as the actor looks into the camera a tear rolling down his cheek.

This ""Crying Indian PSA"" as it's now known came from a nonprofit called Keep America Beautiful – a group funded by companies like Coca-Cola PepsiCo and Dixie Cups. It debuted at a time when single-use packaging lined streets beaches and parks and environmental activists had begun to rail against plastic pollution.

""That was an intentional well-funded effort to convince us all that the responsibility for pollution was on us on individuals on litterbugs rather than the companies that were flooding the world with single-use packaging"" John Hocevar a marine biologist who leads Greenpeace's oceans campaigns told Insider.

The tobacco industry did something similar in the 1950s hiring PR firms to create campaigns blaming smoking-related illness on smokers. But the plastics industry took the strategy further.

As local governments considered banning single-use plastics a council of plastic-producing companies – including Chevron Exxon Dow and DuPont – spent millions to implement recycling programs across the US. Their own scientists however had told them that recycling wouldn't work on a large scale according to an investigation by PBS and NPR.

""Making recycling work was a way to keep their products in the marketplace"" Ron Liesemer a former Du Pont manager who led the effort told PBS and NPR. ""It improves the image of the material.""

A resident wheels a recycling container to the curb for pickup in San Francisco November 4 2009.

By 2015 the quantity of plastic produced each year had increased 10-fold from 1971. Less than 10% of that material has ever been recycled. Each square kilometer of ocean contains an average of about 13000 pieces of plastic.

Microplastics – fragments smaller than a fingernail that never fully break down – have been found in the Mariana Trench and at the top of Mount Everest. The average American ingests about 50000 microplastic particles each year and inhales about the same amount.

Plastic production is expected to double by 2040 and triple by 2050 according to the World Economic Forum.

""Just about everybody understands that we need to do something about plastic"" Hocevar said. ""The challenge is that many companies – well most companies – and many politicians are still thinking in this personal-responsibility frame and putting the emphasis on individual consumers. And so that really keeps the conversation focused on solutions that can't solve the problem.""

Exxon was on the council that led the charge for recycling and it soon started promoting personal-responsibility solutions to another crisis: global warming.

""Be smart about electricity use"" suggested a 2007 ad from the company (now ExxonMobil). ""Heat and cool your home efficiently."" ""Improve your gas mileage.""

Science historian Naomi Oreskes has studied ExxonMobil's climate communications for years.

""They talk about energy demand they talk about need they talk about use and they use the term 'consumers.' And this is basically a way of shifting responsibility away from the producers – that is to say them ExxonMobil – and onto the consumer"" Oreskes told Insider.

In a recent study Oreskes analyzed 180 ExxonMobil documents discussing climate change from 1977 to 2014. The set includes internal communications peer-reviewed publications and ""advertorials"" – ads that looked like editorials and ran in The New York Times.

Internal documents mentioned carbon dioxide more than 1000 times. Terms that appeared most included ""atmosphere"" and ""fossil fuel."" Advertorials by contrast relied on the terms ""energy efficient"" ""demand"" and ""need.""

BP (formerly called British Petroleum) took a similar approach. In 2004 it created the first ""carbon footprint calculator"" a way to pin greenhouse-gas emissions to people's daily activities.

""The carbon footprint calculator then took off as an idea and as a concept and really distracted us from looking at the industry itself"" Janet Redman the director of Greenpeace USA's climate campaign told Insider.

Nalamalapu said she calculated her carbon footprint as one of her first climate-change lessons in elementary school. So did I. By 2010 the popularity of the phrase ""carbon footprint"" had increased by about 1600% from 2006.

Climate scientist Peter Kalmus told ProPublica about how much he took this idea to heart. To reduce his carbon footprint Kalmus has raised chickens in his yard converted an old car to biodiesel and built an outdoor toilet to compost his family's poop. He's had nightmares about plane rides.

""It feels like the plane is flying on ground-up babies to me"" Kalmus told ProPublica.

BP Chevron and ExxonMobil say they're changing

In statements to Insider spokespeople for Chevron BP and ExxonMobil pointed to their companies' efforts to reduce emissions.

""Chevron is investing more than $3 billion from now to 2028 to advance the energy transition"" Chevron spokesperson Sean Comey said. ""Chevron believes the world's demand for oil and gas should be supplied by the most efficient least carbon-intensive producers.""

Comey also said the company is working to reduce emissions from its oil and gas extraction and is exceeding the goals it set for itself for 2023. He said that although ""too much plastic waste ends up in landfills oceans and rivers"" plastics ""are essential to modern life and help improve the quality of life for millions of people around the world.""

BP declined to comment on the company's carbon-footprint calculator but pointed to its net-zero goals and a recent acquisition of solar-energy projects which it aims to more than double by 2025.

""BP believes we have an important role to play in addressing climate change"" spokesperson Joshua Hicks said. ""That's why we launched a new ambition last year to become a net-zero company by 2050 or sooner and to help the world get there too. In line with that ambition we've set targets for drastically reducing our emissions and increasing our low-carbon investments and we're actively advocating for policies that support net zero.""

ExxonMobil meanwhile said it ""is working to reduce company emissions and helping customers reduce their emissions while working on new lower-emission technologies and advocating for effective policies.""

The company alleges that Oreskes has a conflict of interest pointing to her expert testimony in a climate-related lawsuit last year.

""This research is clearly part of a litigation strategy against ExxonMobil and other energy companies"" a statement shared by spokesperson Casey Norton said.

Oreskes said she has offered expertise ""in a number of capacities to groups and organizations involved in fighting climate change"" and does not see any conflict of interest.

BP still advertises its calculator today. One of its subsidiaries backs an app that tracks your carbon footprint in real time Grist reported. BP also made its biggest acquisition in 20 years in 2018: $10.5 billion of west Texas oil fields.

""They don't want a price on carbon they don't want incentives for renewable energy they don't want to block new fossil-fuel infrastructure"" atmospheric scientist Michael Mann told Insider. ""So they say: 'No it's just about you being a better person you being more responsible in your day to day activities.'""

A Chevron lawyer even said as much in federal court according to Grist: In 2018 the company argued that it's not oil production causing climate change ""it's the way people are living their lives.""

A million-dollar distraction

The ads Oreskes and Franta have collected show how much money fossil-fuel interests have poured into influencing the narrative on climate change. The American Petroleum Institute a fossil-fuel trade association spent $663 million on PR and advertising between 2008 and 2017 according to a report from the Climate Investigations Center.

The results Redman said can be insidious.

""It's easy to see that rhetoric that it's about individual responsibility and feel paralyzed and not take the kinds of political action that we need"" she said.

The stakes are only getting higher according to the latest report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For every half-degree of warming the frequency and intensity of heat waves and droughts increase. Even in the best-case climate scenario sea levels will rise nearly a foot over the next 80 years.

Still if you've dedicated time and energy to recycling or biking to work – don't despair. These choices if lots of people make them can make a difference. Nalamalapu takes reusable bags to the grocery store. Mann drives a hybrid car and doesn't eat meat. Oreskes has solar panels on her roof.

""We do all have personal responsibility. The question is: How do we balance that personal responsibility with the larger structural and political questions at stake? And what is the role of the fossil-fuel industry?"" Oreskes said.

""Riding our bikes is important. And turning off the lights not cranking the AC with a window open all that stuff is really important for sure"" Redman said. ""But it pales in comparison to political activity to change the rules about how our energy system is structured who the actors are who benefits who pays.""

Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panda Express located at 3101 Raeford Road and 3103 Raeford Road respectively are currently under construction at the site of the former Christ United Methodist Church which has been closed since merging with Haymount United Methodist Church in 2019.

The 2500-square-foot Panda Express restaurant is expected to open this fall a company spokesperson said.

Food news:6 long-running Fayetteville restaurants that have stood the test of time

The restaurant will be Panda Express' 23rd location in North Carolina which includes a location on Fort Bragg and outside Cross Creek Mall.

Chipotle is also slated to open this fall according to a company spokesperson. The new location will feature a ""Chipotlane"" which allows for drive-thru pick up of orders placed online or through the Chipotle app.

The new restaurant will be Chipotle's third in Fayetteville joining locations on Skibo Road and Ramsey Street.

Stocks are expensive right now with the S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio at its highest level since the dot-com bubble. That doesn't mean that investors should be selling all their stocks and waiting for the next crash. It could be a while until a correction occurs and that sort of strategy would have caused you to miss out on the past year of market growth.

Still some shrewd investors have built more defensive portfolios and are waiting for a pull-back to scoop up great companies that happen to have aggressive valuations right now. These three stocks are great opportunities that you should consider if they get any cheaper.

Nvidia

Nvidia (NVDA 1.27%) is a rockstar tech stock with outstanding growth catalysts and it's returned more than 230% since the pandemic market bottom in March 2020.

Nvidia is the global market leader in PC graphics processor units (GPU) with 83% market share. The company supplies microchips that are essential for gaming high-performance video and other applications that require more advanced visual hardware. The global video game market is expected to grow more than 12% annually over the next five years and high-resolution video content continues to become a preferred media for consumers. Those factors alone provide catalysts for Nvidia for the foreseeable future.

However Nvidia's opportunity isn't limited to gaming and personal computing. The company's chips have important applications in data centers the automotive and autonomous vehicle industry artificial intelligence and automation technology and 5G network infrastructure. Connection to those trends provides an even more enticing growth opportunity.

What's the catch here? Nvidia is expensive. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 55 is high relative to most other semiconductor stocks and it's substantially higher than Nvidia's own recent historical levels. Even the PEG ratio which takes into account the company's bullish growth forecast indicates an expensive-looking stock.

Overall it seems that Nvidia is a great stock to own but there might be less expensive alternatives that can deliver better fundamentals for the price. If there's a market pull-back anytime soon Nvidia should be one of the first stocks to consider at a lower price.

Chipotle

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 0.19%) is a chain of well-known fast-casual restaurants. The company has managed to endure a handful of scandals and an unprecedented pandemic and it just keeps on growing. The chain's perceived value nutrition quality and convenience clearly resonate with consumers. With double-digit growth forecast for this year and next it doesn't seem like there's any reason to expect Chipotle to falter soon.

Chipotle has plenty of avenues for continued growth that excite investors. It has fewer than 2900 locations less than half of its sales are from its digital channel and delivery services only produce 1% of total revenue. The company produces substantial cash flow and the only debt on its balance sheet is related to operating lease obligations not loans. That limits financial risk and means that Chipotle could easily source capital for growth if the need arose.

Once again the issue here is really about valuation. Chipotle has often attracted aggressive valuation multiples and its 56 forward P/E ratio seems more characteristic of a tech company than an established restaurant chain. Its enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio of 50 indicates that it's not a situation in which earnings per share misrepresent true profits. Chipotle is simply expensive to own. If the market gives you an opportunity to scoop up some shares at a more attractive price it's worth consideration.

Visa

Visa (V 0.79%) is a household name with a brand that's nearly synonymous with credit and debit cards. People see that logo every day and it's also featured on the front doors of countless restaurants and retailers that accept Visa cards. There's more going on under the surface here too and this company offers some exposure to a wider fintech revolution that's been occurring.

Visa is really a payment processing network with global reach rather than a credit card supplier. This is a rapidly evolving landscape with the likes of Square (SQ -2.58%) PayPal (PYPL -2.36%) countless ambitious start-ups and various blockchain solutions springing up to bring efficiency and security to digital payments and transfers.

Visa remains competitive by making acquisitions and creating partnerships with innovators that might otherwise turn into competitors. Regulators blocked its acquisition of Plaid and Visa pivoted by purchasing the B2B cross-border payment platform Currencycloud and Tink a European open-banking platform for consumers.

Visa offers a compelling business narrative but its value as an investment is a bit less straightforward. It's hard to consider this a value stock with a forward P/E ratio of 30.6 and a 0.6% dividend yield. Like many other stocks Visa is near the high end of its recent range for the P/E ratio.

On the other hand Visa is mature compared to other fintech stocks and doesn't have quite the same growth prospects. It's also in a tough spot as the incumbent power in an industry that's undergoing rapid evolution.

Other features include the Apostles without Judas a citadel representing heaven and the jaws of Hell. Christ bleeding from the nails and with a gaping wound in his side is flanked by his mother Mary and John the Baptist.

Mr Lawes said: “The church’s original Doom it is thought was painted in the 1420s or 1430s and was plastered over during the Reformation.

“The Victorians uncovered it in 1884 but since then it has suffered further and it is now hard to discern.

“So it was a genuine thrill to be asked to recreate it using traditional techniques. A great deal of research had been done on the original with regard to the pigments used.

“And with the knowledge gained from examining the country’s more complete paintings I was able to interpret the Woodham Ferrers’ version.

“It is not as big as the original but I hope it captures the colour and drama and that it provides a sense of what worshippers would once have been looking at as they attended services.

“We are not used to our churches being decorated with bright coloured paintings but it was once common.”

‘Desire to bring the painting to life’

Nia McIntosh a heritage consultant using money from the National Heritage Lottery Fund has overseen a wide Heritage Hub project at St Mary’s.

She said: “The original Doom has been through a lot over the years. It was damaged in a storm in 1989 and has deteriorated further despite conservation interventions.

“It’s now very hard to see which was why we wanted to find out what it had looked like originally and create a new version. We were able to with money from the Friends of Friendless Churches.

“My desire was to bring the painting to life for our visitors and congregation; to create more of an immersive experience and transport people back to the medieval period.

“Steve is an expert in this area and he examined the parts that remain of the original and studied documentary evidence from examinations since it re-emerged in 1884.

“Tests were done on the remaining paint to establish exactly what pigments were used and examination into extant Dooms enabled an interpretation which is as close as we can get.

“I’m sure there hasn’t been a Doom painting using traditional techniques created for a parish church since the Reformation.

“St Mary’s has other medieval paintings and decorations and we are currently hosting an exhibition and events to celebrate it.”

The exhibition Doom and discovery; wall paintings in the medieval church runs until the middle of June.

Other experts involved include Sara Charles a medieval book production expert who hand made the original recipe pigments and the brushes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3R1cmtleS1yZW9wZW5zLWFuY2llbnQtY2h1cmNoLXByaXplZC0xMTAzNTc0MTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turkey reopens ancient church with prized mosaics to Muslim worship,"FILE PHOTO: Chora Museum or Kariye Mosque re-opens its doors to visitors and worshippers in Istanbul

By Ali Kucukgocmen

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey has opened the ancient Chora church one of Istanbul's most celebrated Byzantine buildings to Muslim worshippers after it was used as a museum for more than 70 years making it the second such major conversion under President Tayyip Erdogan.

Erdogan a champion of pious Muslims in Turkey and head of a party with Islamist roots turned Istanbul's world-renowned Hagia Sophia from a museum into a mosque in 2020 in a ceremony attended by tens of thousands of people.

That move was criticised by church leaders and some Western countries who said reconverting Hagia Sophia risked deepening religious rifts. Erdogan said this was interference in sovereign rights and that he was determined to protect Muslims' rights.

The original Chora or Kariye church dates back to the 4th Century and was turned into a mosque by the Ottomans. It became a museum in 1945 and Erdogan signed an order in 2020 converting it back into a mosque. It reopened on Monday after restoration.

The outer halls were preserved as a museum with visitors able to view the prized mosaics that dot the ceiling unhindered. Curtains concealed the mosaics in the building's prayer section in line with Muslim traditions.

People were seen lifting the coverings to look at the mosaics of Jesus and of Mary with the infant Jesus.

Ferdy Simon a British tourist said he would have preferred the building to remain as a museum so that people could see the mosaics and frescoes there. ""It seems to be a political gambit"" he said speaking outside the Chora.

""It's a bit of a shame when you see devout women who have come here to pray and they are told they can't go into the main narthex area"" he added referring to the fact that the main prayer section is reserved for males as in all mosques.

'POLITICAL GAIN'

Ugur Gokgoz a Turkish man who came to pray said it was Turkish people's right to use the Chora as a mosque adding that the artefacts inside the museum were preserved.

""There was a small section reserved for prayer. At the end they didn't tear everything down and turned it into a mosque"" he said.

A church was first built at the site in the 4th century but most of the existing building dates to an 11th century church that was partly rebuilt 200 years later following an earthquake.

The Church of the Holy Saviour in Chora built near the ancient city walls of Constantinople contains 14th century mosaics and frescoes showing scenes from biblical stories.

They were plastered over after the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 but brought to light when - like Hagia Sophia - it was converted to a museum by Turkey's secular republic in 1945.

Burcin Altinsay Ozguner Turkey head of the International Council on Monuments and Sites said the Chora artefacts are unique and the best way to make them available for researchers is to maintain the building as a museum.

""Of course there are political gains behind it"" she said adding there was no obvious need for a mosque in the case of both Hagia Sophia and Chora with mosques right next to them.

Olive Baptist Church in Pittsview AL burns down after an overnight fire,"PITTSVIEW Ala. (WTVM) - In Pittsview Alabama a pastor is now without his church after it was burned down in an overnight fire. The church is believed to have been struck by lightning.

We went to Mount Olive Baptist Church where there was still smoke from the fire. Officials say the church was around 200 years old and some members had gone to the church for as long as 50 years.

We spoke with Reverand Eugene Brown who has been the pastor at Mount Olive for the last 8 years.

He said the group’s faith is still strong despite seeing their beloved church in ashes.

“The building is destroyed but We are still here because we are the true church of God not the building and we can worship anywhere” said Brown.

No injuries were reported at the church on Continuation Street in Pittsview - there have also been no announcements for rebuilding.

The parishioners are all here. The clergy are too. Well sort of — if you count avatars powered by artificial intelligence.

Today's service features a sermon prayers and songs brought to you almost entirely by ChatGPT.

While AI-led services haven't become mainstream scientists and theologians are exploring how new technology can coexist with some of the world's oldest teachings.

In places like Temple B'Nai Or in Morristown New Jersey the congregation made up of scientists young and old sets out to answer a question: What is a human? And does allowing technology into a fundamentally human experience like faith alter it somehow?

""We started looking at the future that is now and had questions of AI and you know even uploading our mind to the cloud things like that"" Rabbi Michael Satz told Scripps News.

Satz says it isn't the first time the nearly 4000-year-old religion has had to grapple with change.

""My ancestors wrote the Torah in the scroll — 2000 years ago the new technology was to have a book. And so the ancient rabbis had to ask the question can we liturgically use a book when we read the Torah? And they decided no you need to read out of the scroll because that's connecting us to our ancestors"" he said.

Today they're faced with similar questions.

""How do we look at AI as a tool that can help us be who we are rather than help us divide ourselves from others?"" Satz asked.

But can AI answer the tougher questions of spirituality like ""What's the one true religion?""; ""Why do bad things happen to good people?""; ""What happens after you die?""

""I can see people turning to AI as a start as a research tool for those questions and see what have the great Jewish teachers said about this question in the past?"" said Satz.

Congress A congressman wanted to understand AI. So he went back to college AP via Scripps News

Kutter Callaway an associate professor of theology and culture at Fuller Theological Seminary and an adviser with AI and Faith agrees the human touch is necessary.

""Depending upon what data sets it's using we get an intense amount of bias within AI right now"" Callaway told Scripps News. ""And it reflects shock and awe the same bias that we have as humans. And so having someone that is actually a kind of wise guide or mentor to help you discern how to even interpret understand the results that AI is giving you is really important.""

But Callaway says there's good that can come from AI like translating the Bible into various languages.

""That is a very difficult task when it requires on-the-ground humans who know a language really well. But when assisted through AI all of a sudden you have a tool that actually can speed up that process quite a lot"" he said.

Rabbi Geoff Mitelman who helped found the studies at Temple B'Nai Or through his organization Sinai and Synapses agrees saying AI can be an aid in study.

""The best sermons that I ever find ... that I ever hear are when a rabbi sees a word in one text that is used in some other text and links the two of them"" Mitelman said. ""AI can very very quickly say 'Yes here's all the places where this text is used' and then the rabbi can then say 'Oh that's interesting I hadn't seen that connection before but I wouldn't have known this might connect here.'""

However there are concerns across religions about the interpretation of such texts bias and misinformation.

""The spread of misinformation and how easy it is to create and then spread misinformation whether that's using something like Dall-E or ChatGPT or videos and also algorithms that will spread misinformation — because at least for hundreds of thousands of years it was better for humans to trust than to not trust right?"" said Mitelman.

That cautious view of AI and religion seems to translate across practices a poll from the Christian research group Barna shows.

Over half of Christians 52% said they'd be disappointed if they found out AI was used in their church.

In 2020 leaders from the Roman Catholic Church IBM and Microsoft signed the Rome Call for AI Ethics a joint agreement that would eventually include leaders from Judaism Christianity and Islam to make sure future usage of AI is transparent inclusive responsible and impartial.

But no matter how far the technology goes all three agree the embrace of AI and religious life won't happen overnight.

""Our tradition tells us when two people are studying Torah together the divine presence is with them. And I think you know using AI being with AI can be isolating because you're not with other real flesh-and-blood people"" said Satz.

It's just like when places of worship turned to Zoom: Four years later people are slowly coming back to in-person services. The clergy we spoke to said there's a reason for that.

""If you think about so many of the great conversations that you've had or meetings that you've had how many of them were just sort of serendipitous conversations that you had in the parking lot or at services or you know so much of the joy of life are the unexpected meetings"" said Mitelman.

""Often Christian worship is supposed to be cumbersome. It's supposed to be inconvenient. It requires you to bring your body into a space with other bodies and celebrate the broken and bruised body of the God that we worship"" Callaway said.

Which leads back to that church service in Germany and the idea of bots someday replacing faith leaders.

""I think probably yes it is coming and faster than we think"" said Callaway. ""To me depending upon an algorithm essentially to deliver to us what I think is a moment where humans commune with other humans and with God — if you remove the humans from that equation then it's very quickly you're removing God from the equation too.""

Mitelman agrees.

""I think I would be a fool to say that's never going to happen. I think that's certainly not outside the realm of possibility but I don't think it's going to be hugely accepted"" he said. ""People need humanity here whether that's Christianity Islam Hinduism. So much of religion is not just faith but it is a physical manifestation. So is that kneeling is that kissing the Torah scroll is that standing or sitting.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2Zvcm1lci1jaHVyY2gtaW4tc291dGgtbG9yYWluLWRlZW1lZC1hLW51aXNhbmNlLWNpdHktb3JkZXJzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1kZW1vbGl0aW9uL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2Zvcm1lci1jaHVyY2gtaW4tc291dGgtbG9yYWluLWRlZW1lZC1hLW51aXNhbmNlLWNpdHktb3JkZXJzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1kZW1vbGl0aW9uL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former church in South Lorain deemed a nuisance city orders emergency demolition,"A former church located at 1715 E. 31st St. in South Lorain was demolished May 10 because city officials learned vagrants had been inside the structure and partying and maybe even a squatter or two spending time in it.

Dave Faciana chief building official for the city of Lorain’s Building Housing and Planning Department said the Lorain Police Department alerted him May 9 that there were youngsters going inside of the former church.

Faciana said he and one of his building inspectors visited the church later that day and noticed that the roof had collapsed and that someone could fall through it especially on the second floor where the joists are weak.

“At that point I determined that it was an unsafe structure” he said. “We’re doing an emergency demolition.”

American Demolition razed the building.

Faciana said the city doesn’t do emergency demolitions often but this structure fell into that category.

“If there’s an issue and we find out that it’s an unsafe structure and vagrants or squatters in it at that point we determine if it’s unsafe and the hazards of if so that no one gets hurt.”

There was no evidence that people were living in the building but they should not have been in there Faciana said.

“They were in there doing God knows what” he said.

Faciana said the building has been vacant at least five years.

The owners are aware of the city razing the building he said.

The Morning Journal contacted the Lorain County Auditor’s on May 10 to get the names of the owners and contact them for comment.

“We are having issues with our website currently at that’s why you can’t get any owner/address information” according to a statement from the Auditor’s Office. “We don’t have any record of a 1715 E. 31st.”

However for where that address would fall there is an owner the statement said.

Since The Journal cannot confirm the name of the owner it is omitting the name.

However once the building is demolished the owners will receive and invoice from the city for the cost of the flattening the structure.

“If they don’t pay that cost the cost will be assessed to their taxes” Faciana said.

It will cost about $50000 to tear down the building he said.

“This is just another example of a dilapidated building that’s been sitting in Lorain for a long time and these are the things the city needs to do to make it a better community safe for the residents and get rid of these blighted dilapidated buildings” Faciana said."

Cinta Laura akan menjadi pemain pendukung dari spin-off kisah geng indekos dalam film Imperfect.



Imperfect The Series merupakan spin-off dari kisah geng indekos dalam film dengan judul yang sama tersebut.



Cinta Laura pun membocorkan karakternya dalam series tersebut.



""Aku merasa karakter aku adalah sebuah social commentary terhadap banyak influencer atau selebgram (selebritas Instagram) yang ada di luar sana karena mungkin keliatannya hidup mereka gitu-gitu saja"" ujar Cinta Laura ditemui di kawasan Ciganjur Jakarta Selatan Minggu (19/9).



""Ambil foto cantik bikin video keren dan dapat banyak uang padahal enggak (seperti itu)"" sambungnya.



Melalui karakternya di series tersebut aktris berdarah Jerman - Indonesia itu menggambarkan bagaimana realita seorang selebgram.



Meski tampil percaya diri di depan kamera tetapi ada kegelisahan dan ketidakamanan yang disembunyikan.



Menurut Cinta Laura peran itu yang dia bawakan melalui Imperfect The Series 2 tersebut.



""Di belakang itu ada juga orang-orang yang insecure dengan intens yang mereka dapatkan"" ucapnya.



""Jadi walaupun kecil karakternya aku suka banget karena ada realita di balik Cika Cihuy yang keliatannya ya begitu saja pengin jadi orang terkenal tanpa alasan jelas"" imbuh Cinta Laura.



Dia sendiri menilai dirinya tak begitu lucu untuk memerankan karakter dalam series tersebut.



""Aku orang yang enggak lucu. Mungkin cute itu adalah kata-kata yang tepat"" kata Cinta Laura.



""Itu kata Reza ya"" imbuhnya.



Ini bukan kali pertama perempuan 28 tahun itu bermain di drama komedi.



Namun bagi Cinta Laura ada tantangan tersendiri memerankan sosok Cika Cihuy di Imperfect The Series 2.

""Untungnya tadi pagi langsung ngobrol sama Ernest Reza dan mereka setuju dengan approach yang aku ambil"" tambahnya.



Imperfect The Series 2 dibintangi oleh Kiky Saputri Neneng Wulandari Zsa Zsa Utari Aci Resti dan beberapa artis lainnya.

Penyakit cinta dunia (hubbud dunya) merupakan salah satu hal yang sangat membahayakan keimanan seorang muslim. Foto ilustrasi/ist

merupakan salah satu hal yang sangat membahayakan keimanan seorang muslim. Bahaya cinta dunia sangatlah besar bahkan bisa menyebabkan seseorang menjadi kafir dan menjual agamanya.Bahkan Rasulullah Shallallahu alaihi wa sallam sejak 1400 tahun yang lalu sudah mengisyaratkannya. Beliau sangat mengkhawatirkan umatnya yang terpedaya oleh gemerlapnya dunia. Rasulullah Shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda : “Sesungguhnya di antara yang aku khawatirkan pada diri kalian setelah peninggalanku ialah dibukakannya bunga dunia dan pernak-perniknya untuk kalian.” (HR. Bukhari dan Muslim).Dari Tsauban radhiyallahu 'anhu ia berkata: Rasulullah shallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam bersabda:يُوشِكُ الْأُمَمُ أَنْ تَدَاعَى عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَا تَدَاعَى الْأَكَلَةُ إِلَى قَصْعَتِهَا فَقَالَ قَائِلٌ وَمِنْ قِلَّةٍ نَحْنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ قَالَ بَلْ أَنْتُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ كَثِيرٌ وَلَكِنَّكُمْ غُثَاءٌ كَغُثَاءِ السَّيْلِ وَلَيَنْزَعَنَّ اللَّهُ مِنْ صُدُورِ عَدُوِّكُمْ الْمَهَابَةَ مِنْكُمْ وَلَيَقْذِفَنَّ اللَّهُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ الْوَهْنَ فَقَالَ قَائِلٌ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَمَا الْوَهْنُ قَالَ حُبُّ الدُّنْيَا وَكَرَاهِيَةُ الْمَوْتِ""Hampir saja para umat (yang kafir dan sesat) mengerumuni kalian dari berbagai penjuru sebagaimana mereka berkumpul menghadapi makanan dalam piring. Kemudian seseorang bertanya 'Katakanlah wahai Rasulullah apakah kami pada saat itu sedikit?' Rasulullah bersabda ""Bahkan kalian pada saat itu banyak. Akan tetapi kalian bagai sampah yang dibawa oleh air hujan. Allah akan menghilangkan rasa takut pada hati musuh kalian dan akan menimpakan dalam hati kalian 'Wahn'. Kemudian seseorang bertanya 'Apa itu 'Wahn?' Rasulullah berkata ""Cinta dunia dan takut mati."" (HR. Abu Dawud dan Ahmad)Penyakit cinta dunia atau hubbud-dunya berarti lebih mementingkan dunia daripadayang dijanjikan Allah Ta'ala. Dia akan mengagumi dunia dan mencintai kemewahan. Yang ada di hatinya bagaimana mengejar harta tahta wanita rumah mewah kendaraan dan uang.Apa saja ciri-ciri orang yang terkena penyakit cinta dunia ini? Dirangkum dari berbagai sumber berikut beberapa ciri-cirinya:1. Tidak senang beribadahTermasuk dalam hal ini adalah malas beribadah dan ketika beribadah ia melakukannya secara kilat dan ingin cepat-cepat selesai. Seperti orang-orang munafik orang-orang yang terjangkit penyakit Al-Wahn ini hanya mendirikan shalat dengan malas. Mereka mencoba menipu Allah.Allah berfirman : “Sesungguhnya orang-orang munafik itu menipu Allah dan Allah akan membalas tipuan mereka. Dan apabila mereka berdiri untuk salat mereka berdiri dengan malas. Mereka bermaksud riya (dengan salat) di hadapan manusia. Dan tidaklah mereka menyebut Allah kecuali sedikit sekali.” (QS. An-Nisa : 142)2. Bakhil dan kikirOrang yang cinta dunia akan cenderung kikir dan bakhil ia khawatir jika akan bersedekah nanti akan mengurangi hartanya. Mereka terlalu mencintai dunia dan terlalu berambisi untuk dunia. Mereka tamak terhadap dunia. Mereka menjadikan dunia yang dicintainya itu sebagai tujuan akhir dari segalanya.Allah berfirman : “Barangsiapa yang menghendaki kehidupan dunia dan perhiasannya niscaya Kami berikan kepada mereka balasan pekerjaan mereka di dunia dengan sempurna dan mereka di dunia itu tidak akan dirugikan. Itulah orang-orang yang tidak memperoleh di akhirat kecuali neraka dan lenyaplah di akhirat itu apa yang telah mereka usahakan di dunia dan sia-sialah apa yang telah mereka kerjakan.” (QS. Hud : 15-16).3. Suka berdustaSuka berdusta disini sifatnya umum baik itu dalam jual beli maupun dalam bidang yang lainnya. Ia tidak takut dengan ancaman dari Allah maka ia berdusta. Mereka bahkan rela berdusta pada dirinya sendiri. Memalingkan wajahnya dari kebenaran yang sebenarnya hatinya mengakui kebenaran tersebut.

Nonetheless speaking in an event with Wall Street analysts Cisco CFO (Chief Financial Officer) had stressed that a recent hike in chip price hammering down hardware businesses would continue to weigh on overall profits.

Although Cisco has been the largest manufacturer of network gear for data centres alongside corporate tycoons its latest transmutation towards selling subscriptions for software like of WebEx collaboration service and cybersecurity service suggests a lingering shortage in raw materials to manufacture chips which would more likely to last longer than previous forecasts said industry analysts.

Besides latest Cisco announcement came forth just weeks after big-league chipmakers such as Intel Corp and Qualcomm had raised an alarming bell over an ongoing supply constrain adding that a latest leg of ludicrous lag in raw materials for chips could persist at least until end-2023 vindicating recent Cisco move to cash in on lucrative software businesses.

Cisco to forecasts growth from software shift amid supply constrain

On top of that in an event with Wall Street analysts Cisco was quoted saying that its revenues generated from software subscriptions would rise up to 50 per cent by 2025 compared to a 44 per cent logged over its fiscal 2021 that ended on July 31.

Besides the San Jose-based tech conglomerate had forecasted its 2025 revenue to hover at a $62.9 billion while the company was expecting its adjusted profits to stay between 5 per cent to 7 per cent aiming for a median of $4.07 per share by fiscal 2025.

Nevertheless although a majority of Wall Street analysts had projected a flatlined profit margin for Cisco over coming years Cisco CFO Scott Herren was quoted saying that the company’s software unit could have had a higher profit margin than its traditional hardware business which in effect could eventually spur up growth momentum.",,,,,,,,,

After graduating from Natick High School in 1956 Bob continued his education at UMass Amherst where he earned a B.S. in Civil Engineering in 1960 and later completed his Master of Education at Northeastern University. He married his high school sweetheart the late Joan Haskell Brack in June of 1960. Bob and Joan lived in Natick and had three children Virginia Kenneth and William. Tragically Joan died in 1999 from ovarian cancer. Bob married his second wife Janet Bailey in 2001. Bob leaves behind his three children: his daughter Virginia Brack her husband Clay Block and their children Maxwell Block and his wife Nicole Dayhoff and Samuel Block; and his two sons Kenneth Brack his wife Denise their children the late Michael Brack Christopher Brack and his wife Megan and Amanda Brack and her husband Andrew Lowrey; and William Brack his wife Jessica Ladd and their children Benjamin and Isabel Brack. He was the adopted father of Eric Cooper and his daughter Kiara Mundy. Bob also leaves behind his second wife Janet and her two children; David Rossini his wife Molly Chafetz their children Eliza and Gabriel; and Katherine Dennis her husband Joshua and their children Thomas and Miles Dennis. He leaves his brother Harold Skip Brack and his wife Judith Bradshaw-Brown and his sister Beverly Droz and her husband Thomas and several nieces and nephews. Bob was also the brother-in law of Steve Haskell step-brother-in law of William Thompson and step-sister-in law Lisa Pearson. In 1960 Bob joined the family business Barker Steel Company a reinforcing steel fabricator as the third generation following his father Robert and his grandfather Harold Barker who founded the company in 1920. Bob left the steel business in 1963 to teach at Wentworth Institute of Technology before returning to Barker Steel in 1964 to stay. Bob became CEO of the company in 1976 which under his leadership grew from a small one-shop company in Watertown Massachusetts to having 17 locations in 11 states and more than 600 employees at its peak. Bob was very proud when his son Bill (fourth generation) joined Barker Steel in 1995. Under Bobs leadership Barker Steel became one of the largest independent rebar fabricators in the United States and furnished rebar for thousands of concrete construction projects throughout the Northeast including most of the reinforcing steel for the Central Artery/ Third Harbor Tunnel project and several of the World Trade projects and the Freedom Tower. Bob sold Barker Steel to Nucor/Harris Rebar in 2007 and he ""formally"" retired in 2012 never letting go of his life-long passion for the rebar business. Through his compassionate leadership and caring ethos Bob touched the lives of thousands of families over his 50-year career at Barker Steel. Bob was a member of the Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute (CRSI) serving as treasurer and president the CRSI and the CRSI Education & Research Foundation. In 2012 Bob was awarded the first ever CRSI Distinguished Service Award. Bob remained engaged with his alma mater University of Massachusetts at Amherst serving on the Civil and Environmental Engineering Advisory Committee and supporting the establishment of the Robert Brack Structural Testing Facility. Bob was passionate about actively engaging in and supporting the communities he lived in. While residing in Natick Bob was member of Eliot Church (including serving as church moderator and singing with Joan in the choir) and serving on the board of several local charities including the Natick Community Organic Farm Natick Service Council and Foundation for Metro West. Bob also coached his sons in farm league baseball and spring soccer. Bob also had an enduring love for and connection with Machiasport Maine where he and Joan bought property fronting Machias Bay. ""Little Respite"" a cottage built in 1981 became a treasured place of renewal for themselves and their family. In later years Bob worked closely with Maine Coast Heritage Trust in establishing a contiguous preserve to help protect the areas natural and archaeological resources. After the tragic loss of his first wife Joan in 1999 Bob and his children Jinny Ken and Bill created the Joan H. Brack Charitable Foundation. Bob and the foundation provided support for many charities including the Dana Farber Cancer Institute; the Jimmy Fund Golf Program via the Joan H. Brack Charitable Golf Tournament; the Joan H. Brack Learning Center a component of the South Middlesex Opportunity Council (SMOC) in Framingham; Jewish Family Services of MetroWest; and Hope Floats Healing and Wellness Center founded and run by his daughter-in-law Denise and his son Ken. After marrying Janet in 2001 Bob became actively involved at First Parish with Janet and participated in many local charities including Family Promise MetroWest and the First Parrishs Open Table. Most recently Bob was a resident at Newbury Court in Concord. Bob was always most at home on the sea especially on Buzzards Bay. He was an avid sailor sailing his 19-foot Corinthian Embarker for 54 years with his family and friends and participating in the Marion to Bermuda sailboat race several times. Bob loved swimming at Parkwood Beach and Mattapoisett and was known for his world class freestyle backstroke. He enjoyed puzzles of all types especially jigsaw and Sudoku. Perhaps most of all Bob loved his grandchildren. He was their number one cheerleader particularly in soccer and was known for driving hours to see a game. He was very fond of having ice cream with them in the summer - in fact he was very fond of ice cream in general. Bob was an avid runner and regularly participated in the annual Mattapoisett Road Race together with his children and grandchildren.

Posted online on September 19 2021 Published in The MetroWest Daily News Milford Daily News",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbGV4cHJlc3MuY29tL21vbmV5L3Nlbmlvci1jaXRpemVucy1hYm92ZS1hZ2UtNjUtY2FuLW9wZW4tbnBzLWFjY291bnQtbm93LWtub3ctdGhlLW5ldy1ydWxlcy0yMzMyODY3L9IBfWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbGV4cHJlc3MuY29tL21vbmV5L3Nlbmlvci1jaXRpemVucy1hYm92ZS1hZ2UtNjUtY2FuLW9wZW4tbnBzLWFjY291bnQtbm93LWtub3ctdGhlLW5ldy1ydWxlcy0yMzMyODY3L2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Senior citizens above age 65 can open NPS account now – Know the new rules,"By Anil Chopra

The good news is that now senior citizens above age 65 (up to 70 years)are also allowed to open a National Pension System (NPS) account. Earlier Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) had increased the maximum age of joining under NPS from 60 years to 65 years of age. Now any Indian Citizen resident or non-resident and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) between the age of 65-70 years can also join NPS and continue or defer their NPS Account up to the age of 75 years.

Going forward anyone between the age of 18 and 70 years may open a NPS account. Those Subscribers who have earlier closed their NPS Accounts are permitted to open a new NPS Account as per increased age eligibility norms.

Housing Loan: How to slash your home loan repayment time and costs

The new rules regarding the entry age stand to benefit the senior citizens especially those who wanted to open the account and save for their post retirement needs. By investing in NPS they can now plan for a regular pension till their lifetime. The amount invested in NPS also comes with tax benefits and helps the senior citizens save tax. On opening an NPS account a Tier I account gets opened automatically while the Tier II account can be opened to keep savings liquid as it comes with no lock-in period.

Even during retirement one needs to allocate money into equities keeping life expectancy and inflation into consideration. NPS gives you the option to allocate funds between equity & debt options like Govt securities & Corporate Bonds to manage inflation during retirement. Those joining NPS beyond the age of 65 years can exercise the choice of PF ( Pension Fund) and Asset Allocation with the maximum equity exposure of 15% and 50% under Auto and Active Choice respectively.

The exit conditions for subscribers joining NPS beyond the age of 65 years will be as under:

a. Normal Exit will be after 3 years : If someone joins NPS after age 65 the minimum lock-in period will be 3 years. However withdrawing the entire corpus is not allowed and only up to 60 per cent tax free withdrawal can be made by the subscriber. On balance 40 per cent compulsory pension or annuity will be paid by a life insurance company. If the corpus is equal to or less than Rs 5 lakh the Subscriber may opt to withdraw the entire accumulated pension wealth in lump sum. In that case  60% of the withdrawal amount will be considered Tax free and balance 40% will be added in taxable income of the subscriber.

b. Exit before completion of 3 years will be treated as Premature Exit : In case if someone joining NPS after age 65 wants to withdraw before competition of 3 years up to 20 per cent tax free withdrawal will only be allowed. On balance compulsory lifetime pension or annuity. If the corpus is equal to or less than Rs 2.5 lakh the subscriber may opt to withdraw the entire accumulated pension wealth in lump sum. Here  again 60% amount will be tax free and balance taxable.

There are tax-benefits for the NPS subscribers as well. The contribution made in NPS not only qualifies for deduction under Section 80 CCD (1) up to a limit of Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year but also it comes with additional tax benefit under section 80CCD(1B) up to Rs 50000 a financial year. For those joining NPS after the age of 65 the advantage is in terms of better annuity rates as compared to younger individuals. The annuity rates for someone age 65 is better than annuity rates for someone age 55. For those looking to join NPS after age 65 the objective should not be to save only tax but to create a corpus to supplement pension during the retired years.

If the payments became public the thinking went medical school faculty would shy away from serving as the named authors on ghostwritten papers reporting clinical trial results and they would refrain from being paid to give promotional talks as companies built markets for their newly approved drugs.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently published the 2020 payments and thus there is now a seven-year record of payments that can be easily accessed. A Mad in America investigation of these records reveals that while the legislation has indeed reduced the participation of academic psychiatrists in these activities the corrupting influence of pharmaceutical money on all phases of the drug development process—the testing of drugs the reporting of results in journals and the selling of newly approved drugs to the medical community—is ever-present. The corruption today is more entrenched than ever.

In psychiatry there now exists what could be described as a psychopharmacology service industry which can be divided into three sectors. There are a small number of academic psychiatrists who serve as consultants and advisors to companies as they run their phase II and phase III trials and together with company employees serve as authors on the published reports of those studies. There is a second somewhat larger group of psychiatrists who write further reviews of the phase II and phase III results and by doing so help promote increased awareness of the new drugs. The third sector helps market the drugs to prescribers. Psychiatrists from the first two groups speak at conferences and serve as “faculty” for continuing medical education courses and their efforts are complemented by a much larger number of community psychiatrists that populate the dinner circuit.

The most remarkable result of the Open Payments legislation is that the pharmaceutical companies are no longer attempting to hide this financial influence. The face of commerce is visible at every stage of the process: the biased design of the trials the spinning of the results and the subsequent touting of the drugs to prescribers. Thanks to the Open Payments database the amount of money flowing to psychiatrists at each stage can now be reported.

There are two parts to this MIA investigation. The first part reviews the corruption that led Congress to pass the Open Payments legislation and then details the flow of money to psychiatrists that can be gleaned from this database. The second part looks at how this commercial process was present in the testing and marketing of seven new psychotropic drugs that were approved by the FDA from 2013 to 2017 and how this funding regularly turned drugs that failed to provide a meaningful clinical benefit in clinical trials into “safe and effective” medications that generated billions in revenues for the drug companies.

Part One

The Path to Open Payments

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began requiring drug companies to prove that their drugs were safe and effective in 1962 and for the next two decades pharmaceutical companies regularly hired academic physicians to run their studies. As industry veterans later recalled they often had to go with “hat in hand” to ask the academic physicians to do so. Grants from the National Institutes of Health were the coin of the realm for academic researchers at that time not industry funding and in order to get academic researchers to conduct their trials pharmaceutical companies would have to cede control of the studies to them. The academic researchers would design the trials analyze the results and publish papers without interference from pharmaceutical companies.

This wall of separation began to thaw in 1980 once Congress passed the Bayh-Dole act which allowed academic researchers who had made NIH-funded discoveries to license their discoveries to drug companies and collect royalties. The individual researchers could now profit from NIH-funded research and thus academic researchers had a new reason to collaborate with industry. This impulse became more pronounced in subsequent years when it became more difficult for academic researchers to obtain NIH grants.

All of this occurred at the same time that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) with its publication of the third edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM III) in 1980 had adopted a disease model for categorizing mental disorders. The interests of psychiatry as a guild and those of the drug industry were now in perfect alignment.

With the APA’s new disease model drug companies could get medications approved for a much broader range of difficulties. The market for psychiatric drugs was certain to dramatically expand. At the same time psychiatry was now embracing psychopharmacology—as opposed to talk therapies—as its principal domain. Psychiatrists were now treating brain “illnesses” with the prescribing of drugs their primary function. Both industry and psychiatry acting in the manner of a guild had reason to tout new drugs as safe effective and better than existing treatments on the market.

In the 1980s the APA began allowing pharmaceutical companies to sponsor “educational” talks at its annual conference with those talks given by academic psychiatrists who were being paid by the companies. The APA and pharmaceutical companies even publicly stated that they were now in a “partnership” to develop new drugs. Pharma money flowed to the APA for various purposes and soon the drug companies were paying academic psychiatrists to serve as their advisors consultants and speakers.

The pharmaceutical industry cast a wide net with its dollars and this effort was so complete that in 2000 when the New England Journal of Medicine sought to find an expert to write a review article on the treatment of depression it “found very few who did not have financial ties to drug companies.” As psychiatrist Daniel Carlat told the Boston Globe “our field as a whole is progressively being purchased lock stock and barrel by the drug companies: this includes the diagnoses the treatment guidelines and the national meetings.”

During the next decade it became evident that this “capture” of academic psychiatry by industry had come at great cost to the public. SSRI antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics had been pitched to the public in the 1990s as “breakthrough medications” but it eventually became known at least in certain circles that clinical trial results of these two classes had been spun to exaggerate their efficacy and drug harms had been hidden.

In 2007 Iowa Senator Charles Grassley began reporting the amount of industry money that was flowing to academic psychiatrists who had worked as consultants and served on speakers’ bureaus and he named names. Grassley told of industry payments to Joseph Biederman a professor at Harvard Medical School; to Melissa Del Bello an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati; to Karen Wagner director of child psychiatry at University of Texas; and to Charles Nemeroff chair of the psychiatry department at Emory Medical School. Frederick Goodwin former director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) was revealed as having been paid more than a million dollars to promote a mood-stabilizer for bipolar disorder.

In the wake of these revelations Grassley pushed for legislation that would provide for the publication of industry payments to physicians. Starting in 2009 individual pharmaceutical companies began publishing these data on their websites which were gathered by ProPublica into annual “Dollars for Doctors” reports. Then in 2013 as part of the Obama Affordable Care Act all pharmaceutical companies and device manufacturers were required to report direct payments to physicians with annual reports due by June 30 of the following year.

This “sunshine law” was expected to provide at least a partial remedy for the corruption that had become a public concern. Medical journals also began requiring authors of papers to disclose any financial conflicts of interest (but not the amount.) Such transparency would make the conflicts known and the thought was this would produce a changed landscape for the testing of drugs in clinical trials. To protect their reputations academic physicians would need to sever their financial ties to industry and drug companies would be motivated to pay “independent” researchers to run their studies as this would give more credibility to the published results.

The “sunshine” would help clean up the corruption.

Market Size

As the Open Payments database reveals the Open Payments legislation has not achieved this end at least within psychiatry. While the composition of the recipients of pharmaceutical money has changed with salaried faculty at academic medical schools mostly disappearing from pharmaceutical payrolls the flow of money to psychiatrists has continued. From 2014 to 2020 pharmaceutical companies paid $340 million to U.S. psychiatrists to serve as their consultants advisers and speakers or to provide free food beverages and lodging to those attending promotional events. Research support and payments for continuing education lectures are not included in this amount.

Of this total $212 million was for speaking and $33 million for consulting purposes. The expenditures for travel food and beverages tell of speaking events or conferences where drug companies are paying such expenses for the psychiatrists who attend or speak.

As can be seen in the graphic yearly amounts of industry payments to U.S. psychiatrists ranged from $48 million to $56 million from 2014 through 2019. In 2020 with the Covid pandemic putting a halt to conferences and dinner events industry payments dropped to $26 million.

In the pre-Covid years 250 or so psychiatrists would each earn more than $50000 for speaking/consulting services during the year and another 500 or so would earn more than $10000. This is the core number of psychiatrists earning a significant amount from industry annually.

Open Payments lists 31784 psychiatrists who received something of value from the drug companies from 2014 through 2020 which is roughly 75% of the psychiatrists in the U.S. Most of those on this list received a free meal or beverage—these numbers tell of the reach that the industry has in terms of providing at least a favor or two to psychiatrists.

The FDA approved seven new psychotropic drugs from 2013 to 2017 (and thus were marketed during this 2014 to 2020 period) and as would be expected the manufacturers of these seven drugs—Abilify Maintena Brintellix/Trintellix  Rexulti Vraylar Aristada Austedo and Ingrezza—provided the lion’s share of this promotional funding to U.S. psychiatrists during this time.

The Million-Dollar Club

Mad in America (MIA) identified 62 U.S. psychiatrists who received direct payments from pharmaceutical companies totaling $1 million or more from 2014 through 2020. The top earner was Stephen Stahl who earned $8.6 million with $6.6 million coming from Takeda which brought the antidepressant Brintellix to market in 2013. Takeda paid him $3.3 million for his promotion of this drug from 2014 through 2018.

To compile this million-dollar list MIA searched through two online databases: ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs for 2018 (which is the latest year available on the site) and the Open Payments database from 2014 to 2020. While the Open Payments database cannot be used to generate a list of psychiatrists sorted from top to bottom by the total they received during this seven-year period the ProPublica website can provide such a list for 2018. Thus MIA first identified a list of 150 psychiatrists who earned more than $100000 in 2018 and then checked the total that each one earned from 2014 to 2020 according to the Open Payments database.

That produced a list of 62 psychiatrists who made it into the million-dollar club. We also conducted a sampling of psychiatrists who were paid between $50000 and $100000 in 2018 for their services to pharmaceutical companies but none hit the $1 million mark for the seven years. In addition we used the Open Payments database to search through payments by the pharmaceutical companies that brought new drugs to market from 2013 to 2017 and identified the five or six psychiatrists that had been paid the most by each company. This didn’t turn up any new names for the list.

The list of 62 names is notable for the relative absence of academic psychiatrists known for their research. For the most part the million-dollar club is composed of psychiatrists with clinical appointments to medical schools which is often likened to serving as “adjunct” faculty and who have private practices and work in the community. There are few salaried faculty at medical schools in this million-dollar club and there are a fair number of psychiatrists on the list who have no connection whatsoever to an academic medical school.

This is true even of the top 10 on the list. There are no salaried faculty in this group. Seven of the ten have clinical appointments at medical schools one is a professor emeritus and two have no current affiliation with a medical school.

While the psychiatrists in the million-dollar club may not provide pharmaceutical companies with academic prestige they do—as a group—provide industry with a range of helpful services writing psychopharmacology texts publishing reviews of new drugs in journals serving on editorial boards of journals that publish reviews of new drugs running continuing education companies and so forth. And then there is the speakers’ circuit: a number of psychiatrists in the million-dollar club give more than 50 paid talks a year.

As noted above Stephen Stahl sits at the head of this list having been paid $8.6 million by pharmaceutical companies from 2014 through 2020 with 80% of that amount for “serving as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continuing education program.” While Stahl may have only a clinical appointment at a medical school (UC San Diego) he is a star in the psychopharmacology world.

In 1991 Stahl’s career took a stumble when the Office of Scientific Integrity at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determined that Stahl then a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University had been the lead author on two papers that were “seriously misleading” and that he was guilty of plagiarism in a book chapter he had written. Stahl left Stanford for a position at UC San Diego and in very short order this mini-scandal was forgotten. For the past 25 years he has arguably been the most influential psychiatrist in the world regarding the use of psychotropic medications as his textbook Stahl’s Essential Psychopharmacology and his clinical manual Essential Psychopharmacology Prescriber’s Guide can regularly be found on the bookshelves of those who prescribe psychiatric drugs. In 2000 he founded the Neuroscience Education Institute (NEI) a medical education company that produces webinars and continuing education courses on psychopharmacology. NEI also publishes CNS Spectrums a peer-reviewed journal with Stahl as Editor-in-Chief. As new drugs are tested and earn FDA approval he regularly writes articles about them often focusing on their mechanism of action and publishing articles in his own journal. As his bio on the Neuroscience Education Institute website notes he is a popular speaker on the lecture circuit:

“Lectures courses and preceptorships based upon his textbooks have taken him to dozens of countries on 6 continents to speak to tens of thousands of physicians mental health professionals and students at all levels. His lectures and scientific presentations have been distributed as more than a million CD-ROMs internet educational programs videotapes audiotapes and programmed home study texts for continuing medical education to hundreds of thousands of professionals in many different languages. His courses and award-winning multimedia teaching materials are used by psychopharmacology teachers and students throughout the world. Dr. Stahl also writes didactic features for mental health professionals in numerous journals.”

NEI openly promises pharmaceutical companies that it can help them sell their drugs. Its 2021 Congress which is scheduled for November features presentations by a number of the industry’s favorite speakers and drug companies are urged to pay for exhibits that will help them “connect with 2000+ U.S.-based mental health professionals 95% of whom have prescribing privileges.” Pharmaceutical companies may also pay to “host” symposiums to “educate a dedicated audience of prescribers.” Together the exhibits and symposiums provide drug companies with an opportunity to “increase brand recognition and drive attendee interest to your product.”

Rakesh Jain a clinical professor of psychiatry at Texas Tech University School of Medicine occupies the second spot on the million-dollar list. His 41-page resume features a long list of activities of use to pharmaceutical companies: principal investigator on clinical trials (and occasionally a contributing author to research results); advisor to more than 15 pharmaceutical companies over the years; regular presenter on the CME circuit; reviewer for more than a dozen medical journals (most with a focus on drug therapies); numerous media appearances; and speaker for dozens of companies. Pharmaceutical companies paid him $4.867 million from 2014 to 2020 with 67% of this amount for speaking services 19% for “honoraria” and travel expenses and 14% for consulting. He provided services to more than 30 pharmaceutical companies during this period.

Number three on the million-dollar list is Leslie Citrome a Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at New York Medical College in Valhalla New York. While not quite the star that Stahl is in the psychopharmacology world he is a person of great influence. He is currently president of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology. The society’s “official journal” is the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry a favorite venue for pharmaceutical companies as they publish clinical trial results. The society is also a provider of continuing medical education courses. Citrome consults with drug companies as they test and market their new drugs and once a drug is approved he regular writes reviews that expand in one way or another on the evidence for their safety and efficacy. He serves on the board of 11 medical journals and as his Linkedin profile states he has “lectured extensively throughout the USA Canada Europe and Asia.”

Pharmaceutical companies paid Citrome $4.275 million for his services from 2014 to 2020 with 55% of this total for lectures and talks and another 25% for consulting services. The remaining 20% was for honoraria grants gifts and travel expenses. Twelve pharmaceutical companies paid him more than $100000 during this seven-year period.

Another route to getting on industry’s speed-dial for speaking services is to serve as a principal investigator in clinical trials or even better running a for-profit company that conducts industry-funded clinical trials. Jelena Kunovac is one of several with this experience on her resume. In 2012 she founded Altea Research in Las Vegas and as its website states Altea “partners with major pharmaceutical sponsors to conduct clinical research trials for new medications and treatments primarily in the area of psychiatry.” Since 2014 she has been paid $1.276 million for her regular presence on the speaker’s circuit. Most of this work came from three companies: Sunovion (Latuda); Alkermes (Aristada); and Otsuka (Rexulti and Abilify Maintena.)

Prakash Masand 35th on the list has long prospered as a provider of continuing medical education services. An adjunct professor at the Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School he founded psychCME. After that company was acquired by United Health Group in 2006 he founded a second CME company Global Medical Education which was acquired by Clinical Care Options in 2020. Pharmaceutical companies provide support to CME companies which is used to pay speakers at CME events but since the companies “independently” select the speakers these payments don’t show up in the Open Payments database. Such events of course are another way that drug companies create a market for their new drugs and ultimately funnel money to speakers and this has made Masand as an owner of CME companies of considerable value to the industry.

On a personal level Masand was paid $1.448 million from 2014 through 2020 with 84% of this funding for speaking and related travel expenses. Much of this pay came from Allergan for promoting Vraylar an antipsychotic.

Others on the list have built careers as speakers without any academic affiliation. For instance Rebecca Roma a psychiatrist in the Pittsburgh area earned $2.446 million from 2014 through 2020 with 90% for speaking and related travel expenses. Otsuka Janssen and Alkermes were her three top clients. In a similar vein Christopher Bojrab who is the team psychiatrist for the Indiana Pacers earned $1 million during the seven years serving as a speaker for a half-dozen or so companies. His bio tells of how he gives more than 100 lectures each year.

Once psychiatrists move into the top tier of speakers they can expect to remain there particularly if they develop ties to multiple companies. Most of those in the million-dollar club generate steady six-figure incomes year after year (although such payments dropped notably in 2020 during the pandemic as in-person conferences and events disappeared).

In 2013 ProPublica published an article detailing how 22 physicians based on disclosures from the 15 largest pharmaceutical companies had earned more than $500000 from 2009 to 2012 for their speaking and consulting activities. Twelve of the 22 were psychiatrists and all 12 show up prominently in the Open Payments database. Five of the 12 are among the top 10 in psychiatry’s million-dollar list and five others are in the club. The remaining two just missed hitting this mark.

The most prominent academic psychiatrist who shows up in the million-dollar club is Christoph Correll. A professor of psychiatry at the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell he is well known for his research on antipsychotics. Another prominent academic on the list is Rifaat El-Mallakh a professor of psychiatry at the University of Louisville School of Medicine known for his expertise in mood disorders. His appearance on the list is somewhat surprising given that he has authored several articles on how antidepressants can cause tardive dysphoria and even more broadly on how psychiatric drugs may induce an “oppositional tolerance” that leads to long-term “treatment resistance” and chronic illness.

The payments to academic psychiatrists who served as authors of papers relating to the seven new drugs are discussed in Part Two. Here is a sampling of payments to other prominent psychiatrists that provided consulting or speaking services to industry from 2014 through 2020:

The Façade Is Gone

From a public health perspective the clinical testing of new drugs is supposed to provide evidence that a drug is safe and effective and thus can provide a medical “benefit” to society. The published results of these trials then serve as findings that are promoted to prescribers through textbooks CME courses and conferences that “inform” the medical community about what science has revealed about a new medication.

For the public to trust that science it needs to believe that it is free from commercial influence. The trials should be conducted by independent investigators and subsequent reviews of the drug and conference talks should be free of industry taint as well. More than a decade ago the public became disenchanted when it learned that beneath a façade of scientific integrity with reports of clinical-trial results listing academic psychiatrists as authors the pharmaceutical companies were now designing the trials analyzing the results and ghostwriting papers. The named authors were lending their academic prestige to this process as though they were still the ones controlling the research.

That façade is now gone. In this era of disclosure the companies’ control of the research and the lack of any independent testing of the drugs are now quite visible.

From 2013 through 2017 the FDA approved two long-acting formulations of aripiprazole two antipsychotics (tested for multiple indications) an antidepressant and two drugs for tardive dyskinesia. MIA sampled 22 published reports of their clinical trial results and while this sample isn’t exhaustive of all such reports it is representative.

Every article listed at least two company employees as authors. While usually a non-employee was listed as the lead author four articles on cariprazine listed an employee as a lead author. Most remarkable two owners of the patent for cariprazine were listed as authors on five of the articles reviewed by MIA.

In total there were 187 named authors on the 22 reports. One hundred nineteen were employees. As for the 68 non-employees named as authors there were only five instances where an author didn’t have a financial tie to the sponsor either during the study (as disclosed in the published report) or at some point from 2014-2020 (as disclosed in the Open Payments database).

As there were a number of authors named on two or more reports the number of individuals authoring reports was much less than 187.

Many of the trials were conducted abroad and given that the majority of authors were company employees there were a surprisingly small number of U.S. psychiatrists on the roster of authors. Seventeen U.S. psychiatrists and eight U.S. neurologists were named as authors in the 22 reports (who were listed a total of 49 times.) Twenty-three of the 25 received payments from the pharmaceutical companies that sponsored the trials either during the trial or after FDA approval of the drugs.

As a group the 25 U.S. physicians were paid $4.8 million for their consulting/speaker services to pharmaceutical companies whose drug they had “tested.” However many of the 25 provided consulting and/or speaker services to a multitude of other pharmaceutical companies evidence of how they were a go-to group for industry with collective earnings of $17.5 million from 2014-2020.

A Pretense of Science

The fact that the façade of an independent evaluation is now gone might be seen as an improvement: The commercial aspect is out in the open. However the pretense that the trials are a scientific enterprise remains. And while this may seem counterintuitive disclosure requirements help create this pretense.

In the published reports the companies list their employees as authors and the non-employees disclose their financial ties to the sponsor and to other pharmaceutical companies. The disclosure lists of the non-employees may go on and on and often appear in small print that is difficult to read. But this “transparency” is presented as evidence of compliance with sunshine laws and thus part of an accepted scientific process. The published reports then tell of “statistically significant” results from “double-blind placebo-controlled trials” which is language informing readers that such results emerged from a methodologically proper assessment of the drug.

Together the disclosures and the scientific language in the published reports help obscure the obvious which is that the testing of psychiatric drugs—and the reporting of the results—occur completely within a commercial context. The drug companies want to see their experimental drugs declared “safe and effective” and they hire consultants with the expectation that they will help them achieve this end. The influence of money all flows toward achieving that goal.

Moreover the payment to those who author trial results is simply the first step in a drug-development process that is greased by pharmaceutical money from beginning to end.

The Psychopharmacology Journals

Few clinical trial results involving psychiatric drugs are published in prestigious medical journals. Instead they are published mostly in journals with a focus on “psychopharmacology.” Such articles regularly tell of drugs that are “safe and effective” with discussions on how the new drugs may provide a therapeutic benefit of some sort over existing drugs on the market.

One common landing spot for such reports is the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. While it may not be a prestigious journal it has a big impact: the journal states that it is the most widely cited “clinical psychiatry journal” in the world with nearly 22000 citations annually. As noted above it is the official journal of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology (ASCP).

Seven of the 22 reports described above were published in this journal. Moreover once initial trial results are published then other “experts” in psychopharmacology such as Leslie Citrome and Stephen Stahl publish review articles that describe the drugs’ mechanism of action findings from the clinical trials and how the new drugs compare to similar drugs already on the market. Often these review articles will suggest that the new drug has slightly greater efficacy or fewer side effects a bottom-line nugget that can prompt prescribers to try the drug. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry serves as home for these articles too.

In total the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry published at least 53 articles about the seven drugs approved from 2013 to 2017. Twenty-four had an ASCP officer or board member listed as an author; an ASCP board member was the lead author on 16 of the 53. Nearly every officer and board member of the ASCP has financial ties to industry.

The three ASCP officers led by Leslie Citrome were collectively paid $4.62 million by drug companies to serve as consultants or speakers from 2014 through 2020. The 14 ACSP board members were paid $3.37 million for these purposes during this time.

In sum during the period that the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry published at least 53 reports about the seven new drugs ASCP officers and board members were paid $8 million by pharmaceutical companies with most of this funding coming from the makers of the new drugs.

CNS Spectrums is another industry-friendly journal. As noted above Stephen Stahl is its editor-in-chief and the journal is published by the medical education company he founded Neuroscience Education Institute. CNS Spectrums published at least 71 articles about the seven new drugs with Stahl and Citrome each authoring 10 of them.

Together Stahl and Citrome were paid $12.9 million by pharmaceutical companies from 2014 to 2020. Most of this funding was for giving talks: $6.9 million for Stahl; $2.4 million for Citrome.

The CME Money Tree

The Open Payments database provides a record of $340 million in direct payments from pharmaceutical companies to U.S. psychiatrists from 2014 through 2020. In addition pharmaceutical companies provide funding to continuing medical education companies to hold courses and events. This funding while it flows to speakers isn’t included in the Open Payments database because the CME company not the drug company selects the speakers. Thus it isn’t a direct payment to the speakers but these speakers are often the same psychiatrists that are being paid by the drug company to serve as their consultants and speakers. Critics of this non-disclosure practice have likened it to “money laundering.”

From 2014 through 2020 industry payments to CME companies totaled $5.1 billion. A rough estimate based on available data is that this would have provided an additional $100 million in speaking fees to U.S. psychiatrists during this period.

Such is the “big picture” of the psychopharmacology industry. The influence of all money flows in one direction and at every step—the design of the clinical trials the publication of the results and the subsequent publicizing of those results—the money is spent toward telling a story that will result in commercial success. There is not a single dime spent for serving the public good which would be a process designed to critically assess the overall effects of a drug and to communicate those findings even if negative to the medical community and to the public.

Part Two

Case Studies of Seven New Drugs

If industry funding of psychiatrists didn’t compromise the testing of investigational drugs and the subsequent dissemination of results then perhaps it could be seen as a commercial process that nevertheless rested on decent science. The seven new psychiatric drugs approved from 2013 through 2017 provide case studies for assessing whether that is so.

Here are some common elements to look at when critiquing the merits of clinical trial reports on psychiatric drugs:

Do inclusion criteria or the design of the protocol select for a subgroup of patients that could be expected to be good responders to the study drug?

Do inclusion/exclusion criteria select for a subgroup of patients that could be expected to do poorly when switched to placebo?

Is there a true placebo group in the study or is the placebo group composed of chronic patients who have been withdrawn from the psychiatric medications they had been on?

Have multiple doses of the study drug been compared with a single dose of placebo which gives the study drug “multiple” chances to turn up a statistically significant benefit?

Is the statistically significant “efficacy” finding which tells of a point difference in reduction of symptoms between the drug treatment and placebo of clinical significance? Researchers call this standard the “minimum clinically important difference” and it regularly requires a greater point difference than statistical significance does.

Is the conclusion in the abstract consistent with the data presented in the paper?

The composition of the placebo group of course is of particular importance. If it is a drug-withdrawn group these patients may experience a variety of psychiatric and physical difficulties that worsen their outcomes on efficacy measures and lead to a much higher incidence of adverse effects than would be the case in the normal course of the “illness.”

These are all questions that can be investigated by “deconstructing” the published reports. If these machinations exist they should be visible in the papers. What remains unknown from such a review is whether a drug company and its authors have spun the presentation of the data or hidden adverse events and how many failed trials were never published. What follows with one exception is a look at published papers that tell of positive results for the drugs.

Abilify Maintena (injectable aripiprazole)

Otsuka and Lundbeck brought Abilify Maintena a long-acting formulation of aripiprazole to market in 2013 as a treatment for schizophrenia and in 2017 as a maintenance treatment for bipolar 1.

In reports of three pivotal studies for these two conditions 18 of the 21 authors were company employees. Two of the three non-employees were U.S. psychiatrists John Kane and Joseph Calabrese. Kane was the lead author on two schizophrenia studies while Calabrese was the lead author on a bipolar study. Both are board members of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology.

The published results

In the maintenance trial for schizophrenia the researchers enrolled 843 schizophrenia patients who had a “history of symptom exacerbation or relapse when not receiving antipsychotic treatment.” All enrollees were then “cross-titrated” from the antipsychotic they had been on to oral aripiprazole. Those who stabilized on this drug for four weeks were transitioned to injectable aripiprazole once monthly and those who stabilized well on the injectable for three months were randomized into a double-blind trial with one group maintained on the injectable and the other given a placebo injection.

With this design 403 of the initial 843 enrollees made it to randomization. Only 10% of the drug-maintained group relapsed during the weeks and months that followed versus 40% of the placebo group. “The new IM-depot formulation of aripiprazole is effective for preventing relapse in schizophrenia and represents an alternative treatment option with a safety profile similar to oral aripiprazole” concluded Kane and the company employees who authored the report. The article which was published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry was titled “Aripiprazole intramuscular depot as maintenance treatment in patients with schizophrenia: a 52-week multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.”

The maintenance study in bipolar 1 patients had a similar design. Patients who were experiencing a manic episode were first stabilized on oral aripiprazole and then on the injectable for several months. This select group of good responders to Abilify Maintena were then randomized to continued treatment with the injectable or placebo. Twenty-seven percent of the medicated patients experienced a mood episode during the 52-week follow-up compared with 51% of the placebo group. “These findings” wrote Joseph Calabrese and the company employees “support the use of aripiprazole once monthly (AOM 400) for maintenance treatment of BP-1.”

The critique

The bias-by-design in these studies is evident. In the schizophrenia study the inclusion criteria selected for patients who had a history of doing poorly when stopping antipsychotic medication which helped select for patients who could be expected to worsen when randomized to placebo. Then the protocol through its extensive stabilization phase selected for a group of good responders to Abilify Maintena (403 of 843 initial enrollees). At randomization this select group had a mean score of 54.5 on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) meaning they were only “mildly ill.” Given the design of this study those randomized to continued treatment with Abilify Maintena could expect to remain stable which is what occurred. Their PANSS scores stayed the same. However those switched to placebo began to worsen within two weeks with their PANSS scores rising fairly quickly into the mid-60s at which point many were classified as nearing “relapse” and discontinued from the study. Sixty-two percent in the placebo group suffered “treatment emergent” adverse events such as akathisia anxiety headache and tremors all of which are known withdrawal symptoms.

Yet even given this biased design the 12-point difference in mean PANSS scores between the two groups at the study’s end 66 to 54 did not rise to the level of providing a clinically significant benefit. PANSS is a 210-point scale and researchers have determined that there needs to be at least a 15-point difference between drug and placebo for the treatment “benefit” to be of clinical importance.

Moreover starting from the moment of initial enrollment only a small minority of patients stabilized on Abilify Maintena and remained stable during the double-blind trial. Although the math is a bit complicated the failure rate for patients treated with Abilify Maintena—either in the stabilization phase or after being randomized to the drug arm of the trial—was 72%. The researchers also stopped the trial early such that there were only 23 patients in the study who had remained stable on Abilify Maintena for 52 weeks a documented long-term “stabilization” rate of 3%. Yet the title of the published article told of how this treatment had proven to be an effective “maintenance treatment” for a full year.

As for adverse events two patients in the Abilify Maintena arm died including one from a coronary event but the investigators concluded that these deaths were “unrelated” to the treatment.

The numbers are only slightly better for the bipolar trial. There were 731 patients enrolled into the study and of this group 266 stabilized well enough on Abilify Maintena to be randomized into the trial. Of the 133 randomized to the drug arm only 64 stayed well and in the trial to its end (52 weeks). There were 598 patients who had the chance to stabilize on the drug and be maintained on it following randomization (731 minus 133 randomized to placebo); the documented stabilization rate at one year for this consistently medicated group was 11% (64/598).

The money tree

Kane published a second study finding that Abilify Maintena was a safe and effective treatment for acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Once the results from the pivotal trials were published others then published reviews of the Abilify Maintena data helping to make a case for its use. Leslie Citrome wrote three articles discussing Abilify Maintena one of which told of how he had developed a “hypothetical model” for comparing it to Invega a long-acting injectable already on the market and in this comparison Abilify Maintena produced better clinical outcomes and reduced rehospitalization rates which would produce substantial cost-savings for society even though Abilify Maintena’s prescription cost was much higher than Invega’s.

Here is the industry money that flowed to Kane Calabrese and Citrome for their consulting and or speaker services specifically related to Abilify Maintena from 2013 through 2018 (ProPublica database) and their total payments from Lundbeck and Otsuka—the two marketers of Abilify Maintena—from 2014 through 2020 (Open Payments database).

Once Abilify Maintena was approved Otsuka and Lundbeck sent their speakers out into the world. Two of their four top-paid speakers Rebecca Roma and Charles Tuan-S Nguyen appeared regularly on Psych U which is how Otsuka and Lundbeck branded their online “educational services.” The third Matthew Brams helped pitch Abilify Maintena to committees that approve Medicaid payments for drugs. The fourth Rifaat El-Mallakh provided Otsuka and Lundbeck with a speaker that could lend academic prestige to their promotional efforts.

Here is the money they earned for promoting Abilify Maintena from 2013 through 2018 (Pro Publica database) and the total they earned from Lundbeck and Otsuka from 2014 through 2020. (Open Payments database.)

This three-step process—publication of the trial results further reviews of the trial results and then the promotion of the drug through dinner talks conferences and online presentations—turned Abilify Maintena into a commercial success with sales to Medicare and Medicaid alone totaling $3 billion from 2014 through 2019. Sales to private health insurers and non-U.S. sales are not included in this total.

Takeda and Lundbeck obtained FDA approval for vortioxetine as a treatment for depression in 2013 marketing it as Brintellix. In 2016 they changed the trade name to Trintellix.

In four reports of pivotal clinical trials eight of the authors were employees of Takeda or Lundbeck. Of the five non-employee authors four disclosed they had been paid by at least one of the sponsors for consulting and/or speaker services. The only U.S. psychiatrist named as an author in the four reports was Madhukar Trivedi who was a consultant to both sponsors.

The published results

Three trials assessed various doses of the drug versus placebo for up to eight weeks. Together the trials told of five comparisons with placebo that were positive for vortioxetine (at 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg and 20 mg.) and one comparison where it did not show efficacy (at 10 mg). A fourth study found that the drug was effective at reducing the risk of relapse.

Five well-known U.S. psychiatrists led by Alan Schatzberg along with a Canadian psychiatrist subsequently published an “overview of vortioxetine” in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. They wrote the following:

That this “novel antidepressant” was understood to “enhance levels of serotonin norepinephrine dopamine acetylcholine and histamine in specific areas of the brain” which at least in theory could provide “potentially unique beneficial outcomes in patients treated with the agent.”

That it had proven to be effective in treating depression “in six clinical trials.”

That its “multimodal pharmacologic activity may convey benefit in cognitive function.”

That its “favorable tolerability profile may have meaningful advantages with regard to weight gain and low sexual dysfunction that may benefit patients.”

Leslie Citrome published several reviews related to vortioxetine and concluded that in comparison with other antidepressants already on the market it was equally efficacious but possibly more tolerable and with fewer side effects.

The critique

At first glance the three short-term trials do tell of an effective drug. Even though multiple doses of vortioxetine were compared with one dose of placebo in the trials vortioxetine produced a statistically significant benefit in five of the six comparisons and the difference in those five comparisons ranged from 3.6 points to 7.1 points on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) a drug-placebo separation understood to provide a clinically important benefit.

There is the usual problem that the placebo group in each of these studies was composed of drug-withdrawn patients. There was also a design feature in the studies conducted outside the United States—and possibly in the U.S. trials too—that tells of a deliberate effort to downplay adverse events with vortioxetine. Rather than have investigators question patients about specific side effects known to be associated with antidepressants (such as sexual dysfunction) the protocol told investigators to simply ask patients “How do you feel?” Having patients self-report their adverse reactions can be expected to produce a much-reduced tally of adverse events which in this case led to a conclusion that this drug was less likely to cause sexual dysfunction than other antidepressants already on the market.

But the efficacy in the published trials remains. However the Institute for Safe Medication Practices in a subsequent review of the data submitted to the FDA found that there had been 10 trials of vortioxetine rather than the six cited by Schatzberg. In four of the ten the drug was found to provide no benefit over placebo—the sponsors had focused on publishing the positive results and hiding the negative ones.

Among the five studies conducted in U.S. patients three found no drug benefit and in the other two no drug benefit was demonstrated at either the 10 mg or 15 mg starting dose. Thus in five U.S. trials that compared 10 or more doses of vortioxetine to placebo the drug may have provided a statistically significant benefit over placebo only two to four times. The claim of efficacy the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded “depended heavily on foreign trials.”

The Institute also found that once vortioxetine was on the market adverse events reported to the FDA told of a problematic drug. In a 12-month period ending September 30 2017 there were 45 deaths associated with vortioxetine use adverse behavioral changes (suicide self-injury hostility and aggression) numerous reports of sexual dysfunction and the emergence of eating disorders.

Patient Drug News similarly reported a long list of side effects associated with vortioxetine and concluded that the drug provided “little benefit” and had “significant risks.” Meanwhile the FDA informed Lundbeck and Takeda that they couldn’t state that its drug produced cognitive benefits as the data didn’t support such a claim.

The money tree

With their various published reports Trivedi Citrome and Schatzberg’s group had served as U.S. “thought leaders” pronouncing vortioxetine as safe and effective with possible advantages over existing antidepressants. Here is what they were paid by Takeda and Lundbeck for their consulting/speaker services from 2013 through 2018 related to vortioxetine (ProPublica database) and the total amount they received from Takeda and Lundbeck from 2014 through 2020 (Open Payments database):

Rakesh Jain who was one of the authors on the Schatzberg paper also appears on a list of the top four speakers paid by Takeda. Here is the flow of money that went to three others for promoting vortioxetine from 2013 through 2018 and the total they received from Takeda and Lundbeck from 2014 through 2020.

While this antidepressant may not have shown much efficacy in clinical trials it still found success in the marketplace. Medicaid and Medicare paid more than $1.25 billion to the makers of Trintellix/Brintellix from 2014 through 2019 with sales rising each year as Stahl and the other speakers made their rounds.

Otsuka and Lundbeck which had joined together to bring Abilify Maintena to market also jointly developed brexpiprazole. The FDA approved it in 2015 as a treatment for schizophrenia and as an adjunct treatment for depression with the two companies marketing it as Rexulti.

In three reports of pivotal studies of brexpiprazole for schizophrenia 10 of the 12 authors were company employees. The two non-employees were U.S. psychiatrists Christoph Correll and John Kane.

The published results

The phase III studies were conducted in a population of chronic schizophrenia patients experiencing an exacerbation of symptoms nearly all of whom were on antipsychotics before the study. After being withdrawn from whatever antipsychotics they had been on the patients were randomized to one of four doses of brexpiprazole (.25 mg 1 mg 2 mg or 4 mg) or to placebo.

In a pooled analysis of the phase III studies at the end of six weeks those in the 2 mg. and 4 mg. groups had “statistically significant” greater decreases in their PANSS scores than those treated with placebo. Kane Correll and the company employees concluded that this “meta-analysis of the pivotal studies indicates brexpiprazole 2 mg and 4 mg are effective in treating acute schizophrenia.”

The critique

There are three trials of brexpiprazole to review: a phase II study and two separate phase III studies (no pooled analysis). In all three studies there is the usual drug-withdrawal group masquerading as a placebo group and multiple doses of the study drug are compared with one dose of placebo. First-episode patients were not eligible for the trial (which assured that no drug-naïve patients would be in the placebo cohort).

The primary endpoint was reduction in symptoms on PANSS. Even with the biased design not a single dose of brexpiprazole—in either the phase II study or the phase III studies— came close to providing the 15-point difference that is understood to provide a “minimum clinically important” benefit.

Even in terms of providing a statistically significant benefit which is a much lower standard brexpiprazole’s efficacy record was of a marginal sort. In the phase II study all four doses of brexpiprazole failed to provide a benefit over placebo. The phase III studies compared three doses to placebo: a low dose a 2 mg dose and a 4 mg dose. The low dose failed to provide a benefit in both studies and the 2 mg dose failed to do so in one of the two phase III studies. It was only by pooling the results from the phase III studies that the 2 mg dose climbed into the “statistically significant” category.

In the pooled analysis the 2 mg provided only a 5.46-point difference in reduction of symptoms compared with placebo and the 4 mg only a 6.69-point difference. Three studies of brexpiprazole with a total of 10 doses of the drug compared to placebo—the latter a group composed of chronic patients withdrawn from their antipsychotic medication—and not once did a dosage provide a clinically meaningful benefit.

The money tree

After the phase II and phase III results were published Citrome authored several articles on brexpiprazole reviewing its mechanism of action efficacy at secondary endpoints and so forth all of which led him to conclude that brexpiprazole “may be particularly beneficial for patients who have struggled with restlessness or akathisia during past medication trials or those who are looking for an alternative medication that is not highly sedating.”

Here is the money that flowed to Kane Correll and Citrome for consulting and/or speaker services related to brexpiprazole from 2015 through 2018 (ProPublica database) and the total they received from Lundbeck and Otsuka from 2014 through 2020 (Open Payments database).

As Otsuka and Lundbeck had previously jointly brought Abilify Maintena to market they once again regularly employed the same top-earning quartet of speakers: Roma Nguyen Brams and El-Mallakh. However their top-earning Rexulti speaker from 2015 through 2018 may have been Gregory Mattingly a psychiatrist who conducted clinical trials for the “Midwest Research Group.”

Here is the money these speakers earned for promoting Rexulti from 2015 through 2018 and the total they earned from Lundbeck and Otsuka from 2014 through 2020.

Medicaid and Medicare sales of Rexulti grew steadily from 2015 through 2019 with more than $1.4 billion in total sales.

Vraylar/cariprazine

There were three companies involved in the development and testing of cariprazine: Gedeon Richter Forest Laboratories and Allergan. It was approved for treating schizophrenia and mania symptoms in bipolar patients in 2015 and depression in bipolar patients in 2019. Allergan marketed it as Vraylar.

In six reports of pivotal studies for schizophrenia and bipolar 18 of the 30 authors were employees of one of these three companies. Two of the 18 employees were also patent owners of the drug. Of the 12 non-employees named as authors 11 disclosed financial ties to at least one of the companies. The one investigator who had no ties Henry Nasrallah was subsequently paid $75823 by Allergan mostly for speaking services.

The published results

In the three phase II/phase III trials for schizophrenia patients with a history of “treatment resistance” to antipsychotics were excluded from enrolling. First-episode patients were also excluded. The studies were conducted in chronic patients withdrawn from the antipsychotics they had been on and then randomized to one of four doses of cariprazine or to placebo. In a pooled analysis of the three trials at the end of six weeks the cariprazine patients had seen their PANSS scores decrease from 6.5 to 9.5 points more than patients in the placebo group (the variability is reflective of scores for the different dosages.) The researchers concluded that “cariprazine was effective versus placebo in all five PANSS factor domains suggesting that it may have broad-spectrum efficacy in patients with acute schizophrenia.”

The companies also conducted a study of cariprazine for reducing relapse. The chronic patients were first treated with cariprazine and only those who stabilized and remained stable on the drug for 20 weeks were randomized into the double-blind study. Over the next few months the relapse rate was twice as high for the drug-withdrawn placebo group than for the cariprazine-maintained group (48% versus 25%). “Long-term cariprazine treatment was significantly more effective than placebo for relapse prevention in patients with schizophrenia” the authors concluded.

In three pivotal studies of cariprazine for depression in bipolar 1 there were seven comparisons of cariprazine with placebo (at doses of .75 mg 1.5 mg and 3 mg). In four of the seven comparisons cariprazine provided a statistically significant benefit and in the three others it did not. In the four “successful” comparisons the difference in symptom reduction between drug and placebo ranged from 2.4 to 4.0 points on the 60-point MADRS scale. Cariprazine “was effective generally well-tolerated and relatively safe in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with bipolar 1 depression” the researchers concluded.

The critique

The phase II/phase III trials of cariprazine were similar in design to the brexpiprazole trials: First-episode patients were excluded; multiple doses of the drug were compared with a single dose of placebo; and the placebo group was composed of chronic patients that had been abruptly withdrawn from their antipsychotic medication. In addition only patients who had previously responded well to antipsychotics were allowed into the trial (e.g. people with a history of a poor response were excluded). The pooled data told of efficacy similar to that of brexpiprazole at 2 mg and 4 mg: The differences on the PANSS scale were statistically significant but fell short of the 15-point “minimum clinically important difference.”

The relapse study was conducted in a select group of good responders to cariprazine. Of the 765 chronic patients enrolled into the study only 200 successfully stabilized on cariprazine and remained stable for the required 20 weeks before being randomized into the double-blind trial. Only 18 of those randomized to cariprazine completed the 72-week relapse study; the remaining 89 in the drug arm either relapsed discontinued due to adverse events withdrew their consent or were lost to follow-up.

In sum only 26% of the chronic patients recruited into the study stabilized long enough to enter the relapse trial and of the 101 then randomized to continued cariprazine treatment 82% failed to finish the trial. That’s a documented stay-well rate at 72 weeks for the cariprazine-treated group of 3%.

As for the studies of cariprazine as a treatment for depression in bipolar patients only four of seven dosages provided a statistically significant benefit and the difference in reduction of symptoms on the MADRS scale between drug and placebo even in those instances where the difference was statistically significant was of a marginal sort.

It is also noteworthy that five of the six lead authors of reports reviewed by MIA were company employees. Either one or both owners of the drug patent were listed as authors on five of the reports.

The money tree

Here is the money that flowed to the five U.S. psychiatrists named as authors on one or more of the six published studies and to Leslie Citrome who published 17 articles on cariprazine including 10 where he was the sole author.

The four psychiatrists at the top of the Vraylar speakers list are all familiar names from the million-dollar club. Medicare and Medicaid sales totaled $1.18 billion during the drug’s first four years on the market.

Aristada/aripiprazole lauroxil

Alkermes obtained FDA approval for aripiprazole lauroxil in 2015 marketing it as Aristada. This was a second injectable form of aripiprazole touted as being an improvement over the once-monthly Abilify Maintena because it lasted longer in the body.

In a report on the pivotal Phase III study which was published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry eight of the ten authors were employees of Alkermes. The two non-employees were U.S. psychiatrists Herbert Meltzer and Henry Nasrallah. Meltzer was a consultant to Alkermes during the study; Nasrallah was an advisor to the company and on its speakers’ bureau.

The published results

The chronic patients recruited into the study needed to have had a previous “clinically beneficial response” to an antipsychotic. Patients who previously had an “inadequate response to oral aripiprazole” were excluded. After being withdrawn from the antipsychotic medications they had been on the enrolled patients were randomized to aripiprazole lauroxil or to placebo. Those randomized to the injectable aripiprazole were also given an oral dose of aripiprazole for the first three weeks.

At the end of 12 weeks the PANSS scores in the injectable group had decreased by 22 points which was 12 points more than the decrease in the placebo group. “This study demonstrated robust efficacy of multiple doses of aripiprazole lauroxil with a safety and tolerability profile of oral aripiprazole” Meltzer Nasrallah and the company employees wrote. “The clinical profile of aripiprazole combined with the flexibility afforded by novel technology and ability to administer in the deltoid and gluteal muscles may represent a new treatment option for both clinicians and their patients with schizophrenia.”

Leslie Citrome Andrew Cutler and Nasrallah together with four Alkermes employees subsequently published a further analysis of the phase III data in CNS Spectrums that provided information about “supportive efficacy endpoints.”

The critique

This phase III study had the usual design for an antipsychotics trial: Chronic patients with a history of having responded positively to an antipsychotic were abruptly withdrawn from antipsychotic medication and then a comparison was made between those who were put back on an antipsychotic and those left in a drug-withdrawal state. The result is almost always the same. The neural pathways in the brains of these chronic patients have adapted to the presence of dopamine-blocking drugs and so those put back on a drug with this mechanism of action will have a greater reduction of symptoms on PANSS than the “placebo” group.

This design also ensures that the placebo group—since it is a drug-withdrawn group—will suffer frequently from “adverse events.” In this study the percentage of patients who suffered a “treatment-emergent adverse event” was highest for the placebo group (62.3%) which included such events as insomnia akathisia headache and anxiety. This high incidence of adverse events in the placebo group helps provide a foil for assessing the drug treatment as relatively safe and tolerable. (This same factor can be seen in the studies of brexpiprazole and cariprazine.)

This also wasn’t a trial of aripiprazole lauroxil as a stand-alone treatment. The difference in decrease in PANSS scores between the drug and placebo groups occurred mostly in the first three weeks when the aripiprazole lauroxil patients were also being treated with oral aripiprazole. Once on the injectable alone there was little continued decrease in their PANSS scores.

While the 12-point difference in PANSS scores at the end of 12 weeks was statistically significant it still fell short of the “minimum clinically important” 15-point difference. Indeed at the end of 12 weeks the mean PANSS score for the aripiprazole lauroxil patients was 71 which is associated with being “moderately ill.” Only 36% of the aripiprazole lauroxil patients were deemed to have responded to the drug (a 30% drop in PANSS scores) versus 18% of the placebo patients.

The money tree

Here is the money tree for Aristada: payments to the four U.S. psychiatrists who were authors of the two papers; the payments to the top three speakers (other than Citrome who was an active speaker for Aristada) and the Medicaid and Medicare sales.

Austedo/deutetrabenazine

Teva obtained FDA approval of deutetrabenazine as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia in 2017 marketing it as Austedo. The company mostly relied on neurologists to test its efficacy in stilling abnormal motor movements and then heavily promoted it with psychiatrists who are popular on the speaking circuit.

The published report of a pivotal 12-week study listed 15 authors: two were employees eight were neurologists paid by Teva as consultants and/or speakers another was a PhD consultant and the remaining four were U.S. psychiatrists.

The published results

In the study patients suffering from tardive dyskinesia were randomized to deutetrabenazine or to placebo. They were allowed to continue taking the psychiatric medications they were on. At the end of 12 weeks the deutetrabenazine group experienced a drop of 3.0 points on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) compared with a drop of 1.6 points for placebo a difference that was statistically significant. “In patients with TD deutetrabenazine was well tolerated and significantly reduced abnormal movements” the authors concluded.

The critique

AIMS assesses motor function in seven areas with scores of zero to four in each domain. A total score of 7 on the 28-point scale tells of minimal symptoms with abnormal movements “infrequent and not easy to detect.” A total score of 14 tells of “mild” TD—abnormal movements that are “infrequent but easy to detect.”

The mean AIMS score for the patients in the 12-week trial was 9.6 which meant that this study was conducted in a group with minimal to mild symptoms. The 1.4-point difference in reduction of symptoms between drug and placebo while statistically significant would not be of “minimum” clinical importance. Researchers have determined that there needs to be at least a 2-point difference on AIMS for it to be clinically meaningful.

In addition on two other secondary efficacy scales that were used the Clinical Global Impression of Change and the Patient Global Impression of Change the differences in improvement between the deutetrabenazine and placebo groups were not statistically significant. Neither the investigators nor the patients when asked to give their impression of whether they had improved or stayed the same or grown worse on the drug noticed a difference.

The money tree

Here is the money that Teva had paid the eight neurologists by the end of 2020 for their consulting or speaking services:

Teva’s speakers list featured four psychiatrists from the million-dollar club: Richard Jackson Rakesh Jain Arvinder Walia and Andrew Cutler.

In its first two full years on the market Austedo generated nearly $600 million in Medicaid and Medicare sales.

Ingrezza/valbenazine

Valbenazine which was developed by Neurocrine Biosciences and marketed as Ingrezza was approved at the same time as deutetrabenazine as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia.

Four of the nine authors of a phase III report on valbenazine were employees of Neurocrine. Four others had financial ties to the company including the lead author neurologist Robert Hauser.

The published results

In the phase III study two doses of valbenazine were compared with placebo. The 80 mg dose led to a 3.2-point drop in symptoms on the AIMS scale at six weeks; the 40 mg dose a 1.9-point drop. As the placebo group in this study didn’t improve (.1 point decrease in symptoms) the 3.1-point difference between the 80 mg dose of valbenazine and placebo was more robust than the results in the deutetrabenazine trials. “Once-daily valbenazine significantly improved tardive dyskinesia in participants with underlying schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder” the researchers concluded.

The critique

The patients in this study had a mean AIMS score of 10.0 and thus it was a group with minimal to mild symptoms. While the AIMS score at both doses told of a statistically significant benefit only the 80 mg. dose exceeded the two-point difference for a “minimum clinically important difference.”

On a second endpoint the “Clinical Global Impression of Change—Tardive Dyskinesia” there were no significant differences between either drug dose or placebo at week six. This is an assessment by clinicians of the overall change in the clinical status of the patients ranging from very much improved to very much worse on a scale of one to seven. The fact that there was no significant difference on this scale reveals that the investigators in this double-blind trial didn’t notice a clinical difference in the two groups at either dose.

The money tree

Neurocrine’s payments to its thought leaders were generally less than what the thought leaders for the other six drugs approved from 2013 to 2017 were paid.

However the top four on the speakers’ list included three from the million-dollar club (Citrome Jain and Reynolds) and a fourth who didn’t miss that mark by much Craig T. Chepke. Both Citrome and Chepke authored articles on valbenazine with Chepke’s published in CNS Spectrums.

Ingrezza had a fast rise in sales generating more than $1 billion in Medicaid and Medicare payments in its first two full years on the market.

The Bottom Line

The Open Payments database makes it possible to discover the amount of pharmaceutical money paid to individual psychiatrists throughout the testing and marketing of new drugs. What this review reveals is that money flows to the consultants and advisors who help the companies design their trials and author articles on the results; it flows to those who publish reviews and further analyses of the new drug once the trial results are published; and it flows to those who serve on speaker bureaus.

While the $340 million that pharmaceutical companies paid psychiatrists from 2014 to 2020 may have provided individual psychiatrists with substantial earnings it is a small expense for the drug companies. The payments fuel the telling of a narrative wrapped in the scientific gauze of “double-blind placebo controlled randomized trials” of drugs that are safe and effective for a particular condition with possible advantages over existing drugs. As can be seen in the Medicaid and Medicare payments for the seven approved drugs this narrative then generates billions in sales.

What this critique also reveals is that the testing of psychiatric drugs is a charade. It is a process designed not to inform but—as long as the drug makes it past FDA review—to produce a commercially valuable soundbite. These studies were riddled with elements of bad science.

The studies of the four antipsychotics all used inclusion-exclusion criteria to select a group of potentially “good responders” to the drugs and in several instances selected for a group that had stabilized well on the study drug for several months before randomization.

The exclusion of first-episode patients from such trials is also of note. If antipsychotic naïve this is the very group that could provide a real test of whether an antipsychotic reduced symptoms better than placebo. A Cochrane review concluded in 2011 that there is in fact no good evidence that antipsychotics are effective in first-episode patients. By excluding such patients from their trials and only enrolling chronic patients the drug companies can hope they will be spared such failure.

Trials of antipsychotics of course have nearly always relied on placebo groups composed of patients abruptly withdrawn from such medication (or withdrawn over a seven-day period). Here is the moral foil for judging this practice: If a psychiatrist in everyday practice abruptly withdrew a chronic schizophrenia patient from antipsychotic medication and then left that person untreated for weeks and months that would be seen as malpractice. Yet that very act of clinical malpractice stands at the heart of randomized controlled trials of antipsychotics and everyone turns a blind eye to this fact and pretends the withdrawn group reflects the “untreated” course of schizophrenia. The king so to speak is completely naked and yet the psychiatric community when reciting “evidence from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials” pretends that the king is dressed in resplendent scientific garb.

The most remarkable aspect of the clinical trials of brexpiprazole and cariprazine is that even with the biased inclusion/exclusion criteria and even with the use of a drug-withdrawn placebo group these two drugs still failed to provide a “minimum clinically important difference” in symptoms on the PANSS scale over placebo.

A failure to provide a clinically meaningful benefit was also evident in the phase III studies of Aristada and Austedo. Those two drugs also missed the mark and so did Abilify Maintena in the maintenance trial in schizophrenia. That makes five of the seven approved drugs that did not provide a “minimum clinically important” benefit in clinical trials. As for Ingrezza only one of two doses reached that standard and even with the dose that did ratings by clinicians and the patients on whether they had improved or worsened didn’t tell of a difference between the valbenazine and placebo groups.

Yet none of these critiques made it into the abstracts of the published reports for these six drugs nor into the conclusions drawn by the authors. There was no discussion of a lack of a meaningful clinical benefit; instead over and over again the authors told of drugs that had proved “safe and effective” in “randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials.”

As for the trials of vortioxetine Otsuka and Lundbeck published only those that told of a positive finding. The failure of this drug in U.S. trials was kept hidden from the public and this brings up another bad-science element: How can the results possibly be trusted given that company employees are authoring the reports and deciding which results should be published? It is possible that reviews of FDA data for the other six drugs would also turn up negative trials that were never published and that if such findings were known the risk-benefit ratio for the six would appear even worse.

All of this tells of a process that serves a commercial end rather than providing society with an honest scientific assessment of a drug’s risks and benefits and whether the benefit is clinically meaningful. The “framework” of science is utilized to mislead—rather than inform—the public.

As a commercial pursuit however it produces this bottom line: American taxpayers spent $9.3 billion on these seven drugs from the time they were approved through 2019 in the form of Medicaid and Medicare payments and based on the 2019 numbers and growth rates in sales taxpayers spent another $5 billion in 2020.

And that is the “bottom line” when you follow the money: There is money that flows to individual psychiatrists and to the drug companies and at the heart of this commercial enterprise is “science” designed to deceive.

Ramsey Commissioners has criticised the Department of Infrastructure over its plans for flood defences in the town.

Proposals have been published on Government’s official flood hub webpage which include increasing the height of promenade walls.

The local authority’s hit out at the DOI for a lack of communication over the designs.

Commissioners Chairman Alby Oldham says he’s ‘disappointed with the department for the way in which the scheme has been developed and published’ claiming there’s been no engagement with the authority that represents the community of Ramsey.

The plans are dated June 2020 which Mr Oldham believes is a suggestion the designs are being presented as a ‘done deal’.

If they go ahead it would see concrete or rock armour revetments extending up to 19 metres beyond the existing sea wall on south promenade.

On a simple level the colours on the warm side of the spectrum – such as red and yellow – are bold uplifting and energetic while their cooler counterparts blue and green exude calmness and feel more reserved.

This is particularly relevant when it comes to branding. On an emotional level in terms of how consumers feel when they look at it; but also on a practical level in terms of market standout.

For a company to effectively 'own' a colour in its sector can provide an enormous competitive advantage achieving instant recognition – in some cases even without a logo or even a mention of its name. That's the power of colour done right.

Of course owning an entire colour isn't easy and it certainly goes way beyond logo design alone. Skilful planning and execution is needed across all elements of the brand and its advertising.

Depending on the popularity and market saturation of a particular colour we could be talking as specific as an officially registered Pantone shade (Cadbury 2685C anyone?) or as general as being the only brand in a competitive set to use that colour.

See our guide to the best branding books for inspiration. Meanwhile read on to see how different brands around the world have staked their respective claims to 10 colours – in some cases with considerable success.

Red

This is a notoriously difficult colour to own in any sector especially in its primary form. It's the colour of anger and danger but also warmth and passion. And since it's also scientifically proven to increase your heart rate and raise your blood pressure it's a bold choice to use it extensively.

01. Coca-Cola

Coke has made red its signature colour

Two 'red' brands in particular stand out in their sectors – although the first is perhaps the world's most instantly recognised brand in any sector. Red is linked so inextricably with Coca-Cola that popular legend tells it rebadged Santa Claus to match (sadly this is an urban myth). Recent more minimalist packaging and advertising has pared right back to that primary red with the customary flourish of white.

02. Target

Target battles Walmart's trademark blue by owning the colour red

Meanwhile America's chain takes on the ubiquitous blue of its rival Walmart with an ocean of red across its stores logo advertising and beyond. Target's shade of red is a registered trademark; communist grocery shop owners beware.

03. Vodafone

The colouring of Vodafone's logo is designed to signify communication and sophistication

Designed in 1997 by Saatchi & Saatchi Vodafone's previous logo featured a distinctive speech mark symbolising conversation and speech communication while the red stands for sound talking and passion. It was set against a silver backdrop representing sophistication and perfection.

An update to the brand in 2017 by Brand Union put more focus on the speech mark maintaining the brand red but dropped the silver backdrop.

Orange

Bright fun and friendly orange has a playful childlike appeal and two very different brands claim ownership of it in their respective sectors.

04. The Home Depot

Home Depot blankets everything it does with orange

In the US comes a retail chain that's taken to blanketing its stores with a single colour: Home Depot has trademarked orange for use on advertising lettering or any other signage in its sector tying things up pretty neatly. In the UK B&Q arguably does the same.

05. EasyJet group

EasyJet splashes orange everywhere it can

And then of course there's everyone's favourite budget service provider easyGroup – another ocean of orange spanning everything from the original low-cost airline to car rental finance hotels and more.

Yellow

Positive sunny and optimistic yellow is energetic and eye-catching – and particularly effective for point-of-sale messaging as it's proven to catch the eye quicker than any other colour.

06. Veuve Clicquot

Champagne brand Veuve Clicquot adds punch to its packaging with yellow

Yellow provides standout for premium champagne brand Veuve Clicquot – cutting through a sea of green gold and cream with a punchy shot of bright yellow.

07. Caterpillar

Caterpillar vehicles are instantly recognisable by their colour

Meanwhile in a sector that couldn't be more different construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar has a very distinctive trademarked shade of yellow connected to its brand – featured in the triangle on its logo and also on the liveries of its vehicles. Of course in the field the colour is invariably faded by constant weathering on construction sites so it's rare to find a perfect match.

08. JCB

JCB's vehicles are easy to spot

Yellow of course is an eye-catching colour for potentially dangerous heavy machinery so it's no surprise that it's also used by Britain's J.C. Bamford better known as JCB.

Green

Green is an emotionally positive colour signifying growth and rebirth and of course nature. It represents stability and endurance but it also prosperity and abundance and taken to the extreme it can be a colour of wealth and luxury; a real mix of meanings.

09. John Deere

Deere has used green successfully to distinguish itself

Joining Caterpillar and JCB in the large-scale vehicle corner is farm machinery firm John Deere whose iconic bright green-painted tractors (with a touch of yellow) are instantly recognisable – especially when you're stuck behind one on a country lane.

10. Harrods

Harrods opts for a darker green that's associated with wealth and privilege

At the other end of the market rich dark green has associations with wealth and prestige – so it's no surprise that luxury department store Harrods has chosen it as a key part of its branding scheme. From bags and signage to all manner of own-branded products the shade exudes class and sophistication.

11. Starbucks

The green Starbucks logo is a reference to the University of San Francisco

Starbucks started life in 1972 with a brown logo – appropriate enough considering the coffee beans that it originally sold before introducing the wild concept of selling actual cups of coffee – then in 1987 the colour of its stylised woodcut of a siren was changed to green. The reason? It's a reference to the University of San Francisco where all three founders were educated.

Blue

Blue is a cool clear colour which has a trustworthy dependable feel and is often the colour of choice for financial institutions as a result – notably Barclays.

12. NHS

Britain's National Health Service uses a dependable blue to enagage its users

In the UK the National Health Service uses a distinctive shade of blue that takes advantage of its cool reassuring and secure characteristics.

13. Tiffany & Co

Tiffany has trademarked its own shade of 'robin's egg' blue

Like red of course blue is used so broadly in different kinds of branding that standout in a particular sector is difficult: Tiffany's solves this problem with its own iconic shade of 'robin's egg' blue trademarked as Tiffany Blue and ubiquitous on everything from jewellery boxes to shopping bags to advertising.

14. Facebook

The logo's changed over the years but Facebook retains its blue colouring

Originally designed by Cuban Council in 2006 the Facebook logo has been tweaked over the years with changes made to the Messenger logos in particular. The original Facebook logo has retained its blue colour though which Mark Zuckerberg originally chose based on his colour blindness.

Purple

Pale lavender has a nostalgic sentimental feel whereas richer darker purple has a sophisticated tone often linked with royalty.

15. Cadbury's

Cadbury's has made Pantone 2685C inseperable from its branding

Purple's most recognisable association is with Cadbury's chocolate: Pantone 2685C is officially Cadbury Purple.

Purple and Cadbury's have been happy bedfellows since 1914 and woe betide any brand who tries to lay claim to it: Nestlé tried and failed and Cadbury's won the right to exclusive use for chocolate bar and drink packaging. The association is so deeply ingrained that its advertising can be confident enough to remove mention of the brand altogether as in Fallon's Black Pencil-winning Gorilla spot.

Brown

Earthy simple and evocative of honesty and simplicity brown (as well as green) is often used by organic companies to emphasise their links to the soil – although outside of this sector it's largely avoided in a branding context due to potential negative connotations with 'dirt' although this of course depends on the shade chosen. The fact that brown hides dirt can be twisted to a company's advantage – one reason for Pullman railway coaches to have developed their distinctive shade.

16. UPS

UPS uses brown to evoke feelings of simplicity and honesty

And it was Pullman Brown that the United States Postal Service plumped for in 1916 for a combination of practical reasons and the fact that the colour was perceived as the ""epitome of luxury"" at the time. It would become an inseparable part of UPS' branding even becoming shorthand for the company itself as in its former slogan: 'What can Brown do for you?'

The colour has become shorthand for the company itself ('What can Brown do for you?')

Pink

The level of intensity with which pink is used makes a big difference to its impact. Paler shades are often have 'girly' associations while dusty pinks have a sentimental tone – both uses are relatively clichéd and absolutely everywhere so standout with that goal in mind is next to impossible.

17. T-Mobile

T-Mobile uses pink to grab attention

Vibrant hot pinks have a youthful energy and sense of fun that lends itself well to trendy inexpensive products for young women or girls – but they're also increasingly used in other sectors where a punch of bright colour is needed. T-Mobile's eye-catching magenta has been registered since 2000 and is splashed liberally across its stores and branding. Lastminute.com uses a similar punchy shade.

Black

Okay so most brands use black in their branding some capacity – but used as the primary brand colour it has a bold powerful classic effect that feels confident and sophisticated for more expensive products.

18. Hotel Chocolat

Hotel Chocolat coats its stores packaging and branding with black

Once such example is premium British confectionery company Hotel Chocolat which coats its stores packaging and branding with black like the darkest of dark chocolate.

19. Guinness

Guinness' branding makes great place of the drink's black colour

Of course when the colour of your product is one of its most distinctive characteristics it makes sense to shout about it in your branding: nowhere is this truer than The Black Stuff. The Irish icon makes liberal use of black and white in its multi-award-winning advertising including its iconic surfer ad.

White

Simplicity and purity are the overwhelming associations with white in branding and its brightness immediately catches the eye when used in signage. Baby and healthcare products regularly make use of it and as a result standout is tricky.

20. Apple

Apple uses white to evoke feelings of purity and perfection

Where white is far from ubiquitous however is in the technology and computing sectors: here Cupertino's finest has it all tied up. Whether it's the soothing simplicity of its packaging or the simple purity of its logo (which has long since ditched its rainbow stripes) Apple's use of white is nothing short of iconic. The adverts showcasing the white AirPods Pro say it all and perhaps disprove claims that branding has become boring.

If you’ve lived in Japan you probably know that the country has very strict rules on how its trash is separated. While many other countries just have blanket recycling boxes–and some don’t even care if you put recycling in with the regular trash–in Japan you have to not only separate your trash into recyclable burnable and non-burnable trash but you have to separate your recycling by glass plastic and cans too.

These trash rules are also maintained outside the home at businesses malls stations and even vending machines. In fact Japanese vending machines often have recycling bins right next to them for customers’ convenience.

Unfortunately it seems that too many people are using vending machine recycling bins as general trash cans especially in Oita City in southwestern Japan. That’s why Coca-Cola teamed up with environmental protection organization Change for the Blue and hit anime ""Attack on Titan"" to place a Titan-shaped trash can next to one of their vending machines.

The trash can is designed to look like the Female Titan screaming with its mouth wide open waiting to receive your garbage. It’ll be placed alongside the recycling bins next to a vending machine near Oita Station in the hopes that the eye-catching design will help people realize they shouldn’t be throwing their non-recyclable trash in the recycling bins.

The goal is to increase public awareness about recycling. While it’s in place all of the bins will be analyzed to see if the new can makes a difference in the way trash is disposed of around the vending machine. The results of the analysis will be used to further improve public awareness campaigns about mixing trash and of course the ultimate goal is to help preserve the local environment.

The Titan trash can is already out and will be hanging around outside the North Exit of Oita Station next to the Coca-Cola vending machine in front of the Orix Rent-a-car shop until November 22. If you’re an Attack on Titan Fan go and enjoy it but don’t forget to reduce reuse and recycle too.

It was initially published in 1896 and since then a significant quantity of important information has continued to be provided about inventories from various firms. This guide explores all about this robust index.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) is one of many indexes used as a gauge for how well an entire market performs at any given time. The index can be helpful because it shows where and how much specific markets have fluctuated in value for days weeks or months. It also allows investors to track their investment performance and compare themselves against others with different portfolios.

History of DJIA

The DJIA is one of the oldest and most well-known stock market indexes in America. Charles Dow the co-founder of the Wall Street Journal created the index back in 1884. Charles Dow composed his first stock average of nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the Customer’s Afternoon Letter a daily two-page financial news bulletin that preceded The Wall Street Journal. By 1900 the index was renamed Dow Jones Industrial Average and included 30 equities divided into two groups: the industrials (comprising 19 members) and the railroads (11).

DJIA expanded beyond transportation stocks with the addition of General Electric (NYSE: GE) in 1901. It joined as one of 11 industrial sector companies added that year due to perceived growth prospects based on earnings per share multiples at a time resulting from significant expansion following consolidation/merger wave among USUS manufacturing businesses during the 1890s – 1910s.

Many significant adjustments occurred throughout the 20th century as many former components combined departed or were relocated.

Using historical data from the DJIA you could get a good idea about what factors affect stocks in general. For example if you saw that oil prices tend to go up when there’s terrible weather somewhere – maybe your portfolio has some exposure to alternative energy research?

DJIA history is a significant indicator of the overall direction of top-level economic activity as measured by leading US industrial corporations whose performance is indicative of changes in business conditions and investment prospects for stock market investors. DJIA value has been included in significant decisions regarding monetary policy that affect global markets such as Federal Reserve rate decision announcements published in advance so financial professionals can monitor new information before public release.

Understanding the Dow Jones Industrial Average

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) sometimes called the “Dow” is a stock market index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States are trading during a standard trading session in the stock market.

The components of DJIA are chosen from leading US companies across different industry groups to reflect their significance within those specific industries and national markets overall.

For a company’s stocks to be added onto or removed from this average they must meet specific requirements including management integrity and liquidity along with shareholder equity over time which helps ensure only established corporations remain included.

Dow Jones Industrial Average Components

The DJIA comprises numerous components that are crucial to the information it provides about how well or poorly the stock market as a whole has performed on any given day.

As of 2021 the Dow Jones Average Index includes the following companies: Apple Inc (NYSE: AAPL) Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE: CRM) Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) Visa Inc (NYSE: V) The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) The American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: HON) Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) The Travelers Companies (NYSE: TRV) Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) Merck & Co. Inc (NYSE: MRK) UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) IBM (NYSE: IBM) 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) The Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) Amgen Inc (NASDAQ: AMGN) Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT) Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA).

DJIA vs the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite

While the basic mission of DJIA S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite is similar the way they go about the task is very different.

Their selection methodology varies. The Dow tracks the value of 30 large companies which tend to be blue-chip firms that are household names. The S&P 500 tends to be broader hoping to have a bigger representation of companies from various sectors and industry groups. And the Nasdaq composite includes only stocks that are trading on the Nasdaq market.

Conclusion

The DJIA has been a historical benchmark for investors to keep in mind when evaluating their stock performance compared to other top companies on the market. However there are many different indices these days and each investor needs to conduct thorough research before placing any investments with a financial adviser."

Teams must cut their 2024 rosters down to just 12 spots from as many as 18 training camp players. And while this year’s WNBA draft class is undoubtedly rife with talent only 18 draftees remain rostered ahead of Monday's final cuts. Last year just 15 of the league’s 36 draftees made it onto their team’s opening-day squad.

And it's not just rookies. Veteran players are also on the chopping block even former title-winners: On Thursday the Minnesota Lynx waived 2021 WNBA champ Ruthy Hebard.

But with every wave of cuts players that survive dismissal inch closer to claiming a coveted roster spot. The Las Vegas Aces have already reached that magic number 12 opening the door for draft picks Dyaisha Fair and Kate Martin to stay on with the reigning champs.

Additionally Dallas has whittled their training camp group down to 12. Fifth overall pick Jacy Sheldon and undrafted rookie Jaelyn Brown continue to remain in the mix.

Other teams meanwhile still have decisions to make. Seattle currently lists 13 players while others like New York still have a full 18 players in training camp. It’s likely that the final preseason game will tip roster decisions one way or another as coaching staffs continue to evaluate performance and playing time.

But being cut doesn't mean the end of the road for everyone. Should players be waived they can still be signed to short-term hardship contracts with teams carrying injured players on their permanent rosters.

French technology firm Atos will recruit about 15000 people in India over the next 12 months adding to its existing workforce of 40000 in the country.“We are at a tipping point at this moment” chief executive Elie Girard told ET in an interview.“We are experiencing a productivity shock like what we experienced 20 years ago thanks to the acceleration of digitisation and India is at the heart of it” Girard said.This he said has resulted in a demand boom across sectors including public sector and defence which would benefit employment.India is by far the best provider of those skills in the world but at present there is tension between demand and supply he added.The €11 billion firm invests about €400 million in India annually on employee-related expenses including payroll and skilling.India is an important market for the French firm which is partnering with the government on the National Supercomputing Mission. The company has invested in NSM by way of assembly and testing of high-performance computers.“I think this is very important for our employees in India that we are really investing in this” said Girard. At present almost one-third of its revenues are driven out of India. he said.“We have a quantum lab in India and I think India can lead the pack in quantum given the magnificent digital force you have” he said.The coupling of 5G with edge technologies will also open up new opportunities for services firms.“A lot of our product development in cybersecurity is happening in India. We’ve invested in assembly lines on supercomputing and on 5G edge and are working to… make sure we can integrate those two technologies together to build the new services” Girard said.Atos has three clear differentiators that set it apart from other companies.“We have hardware and we have software on top of services and this is very unique” he said. “Second we are number one in Europe and second in the world in cybersecurity services. To that end we are doing a lot of acquisitions there and I believe that in a year or two we will be number one worldwide in cybersecurity services” he said.Last year Atos acquired Paladion which has a significant presence in India.Girard said a lot of the product development in this area was happening out of India currently. The other important part of the company’s strategy was the decarbonisation business line it has built.Earlier this year Atos made a bid to acquire DXC Technology a deal that did not go through eventually.Girard said that the company would not pursue this further even as it continues to focus on smaller acquisition opportunities and is open to midsize options.The post Covid-19 rebound currently underway is likely to plateau next year but will remain high he added.“There is a structural dimension to this where the move to the Cloud has been understood by a lot more companies who were hesitating before the crisis” Girard said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwdHYuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jb2xsZWdlLXNwb3J0cy91bml2ZXJzaXR5LW9mLW1pYW1pL21pY2hpZ2FuLXN0YXRlLXN0dW5zLW5vLTI0LW1pYW1pLTM4LTE30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan State stuns No. 24 Miami 38-17,"MIAMI GARDENS Fla. — Payton Thorne passed for 261 yards and four touchdowns two of those scoring throws going to Jalen Nailor and Michigan State extended its unbeaten start by topping No. 24 Miami 38-17 on Saturday.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

LAPLACE — Comcast has been working around the clock to support restoration efforts since Hurricane Ida devastated LaPlace. As a reminder emergency management procedures dictate that power must be restored first and Comcast must receive clearance that it is safe for crews to begin restoration work.

Currently Comcast is working to bring Xfinity services back to our customers residing near these intersections by the following dates:

W. Airline Hwy. and Belle Pointe Blvd. (on or before Sept. 25)

Lee Dr. and Natchez Ln. (on or before Sept. 25)

W. Airline Hwy. and Magnolia St. (on or before Sept. 25)

Comcast will need to address these situations on an individual basis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL2xhbmNhc3Rlcm9ubGluZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvbG9jYWxfYnVzaW5lc3MvYmx1ZS1yaWRnZS10by1zdGFydC1jb252ZXJ0aW5nLWl0cy1sYW5jYXN0ZXItY291bnR5LW5ldHdvcmstdG8tYWxsLWZpYmVyL2FydGljbGVfMDc1YTEwYWEtMTdlOC0xMWVjLWFlOTktMDNiNTc5OGNhNDQ0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blue Ridge to start converting its Lancaster County network to all fiber,"Blue Ridge Communications intends to convert its internet television and voice network in Lancaster County entirely to fiber-optic cable beginning late this year or early next year the company said Friday.

Blue Ridge with 35000 customers in northcentral Lancaster County said the local project is part of a new initiative to build a so-called “fiber-to-the-home” network across its entire footprint. The upgrade will not lead to a price increase the company said.

The company’s present network is a mix of fiber and coaxial cable.

Blue Ridge based in Palmerton Carbon County declined to estimate the cost of rebuilding its 8000-mile network in 11 counties saying only that the expense will be “significant.”

The rollout comes as a far larger competitor makes inroads in Blue Ridge’s Lancaster County territory which includes Adamstown Akron Denver Ephrata Lititz Manheim Mount Joy and Terre Hill boroughs plus surrounding townships.

Comcast begin building its own network in Blue Ridge territory here in 2019 a project it expects to finish this year.

With Blue Ridge’s new network which will connect its fiber with the customer’s modem Blue Ridge said its customers will see improved reliability and get upload speeds equal to download speeds – important features for adults and students who are working attending classes or doing schoolwork remotely.

""We believe the need for speed and bandwidth will continue to increase as more and more people work learn and are entertained at home. … It is the next logical step in the evolution of our network"" said Mark Masenheimer vice president of operations in a prepared statement.

Masenheimer added that he expects the all-fiber network to be attractive to residents and businesses alike.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcGhpbGx5eWltYnkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvb2JzZXJ2aW5nLXRoZS1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24tb2YtdHdvLWxpYmVydHktcGxhY2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Observing the Construction of Two Liberty Place,"Among the multiple structures that make up the Liberty Place complex Two Liberty Place is the second tallest rising 848 feet and 58 stories yet it is the largest by area with 1.2 million square feet. As such the building is one of the most largest skyscrapers in Philadelphia as the Comcast Center measures nearly 1.4 million square feet and the Comcast Technology Center holds 1.5 million square feet. Two Liberty Place is located near the heart of Center City at 50 South 16th Street. Just like the rest of Liberty Place the tower was designed by Helmut Jahn of Murphy/Jahn who had unfortunately passed away in a bicycle crash in Chicago in May. The project was developed by Willard Rouse of Rouse and Associates which eventually became Liberty Property Trust.

Demolition began at the site of Two Liberty Place in the beginning of the same year One Liberty Place topped out. Multiple businesses would meet their fate as a shopping mall hotel and a massive skyscraper was on the way. The site was cleared by the end of 1987 and the official ground breaking took place on February 16 1988 as One Liberty Place stood proudly next door. By August of the same year the crane for the concrete core was erected on the site starting the ascent of the tower.

The concrete core was above ground by the beginning of 1989 with the structure popping into views by May. The concrete had grown over 500 feet in height over the next few months as the steel rose over 10 floors below the top of the core. The core got slimmer at the top and was completed just after mid-August. The steel followed and rose up quicker due to the floor plates shrinking with the stubby spire placed on top by October. The stone and glass cladding seems to have started installation just after the topping. The exterior was completed at the very end of 1990 with the building opening after the Ritz Carlton and Shops at Liberty Place opened in mid-November.

How many millions of dollars does it take to change a light bulb? While energy wonks have praised the innovation of Con Edison’s Brooklyn Queens Demand Management (BQDM) program low-income communities and communities of color in the BQDM catchment area have seen little improvement to their daily lives from the $200 million program so far.

The BQDM was launched in 2014 to address a growing energy shortfall projected for 12 neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens. The main goal of the program was to reduce the energy demand by 52 megawatts (MW) total – 41 MW from customers and 11 MW from Con Ed. On the customer side Con Ed’s quarterly reports for BQDM implementation show only about 5 MW-worth of program investments have brought tangible improvements for residential customers in 1-4-unit buildings and multifamily buildings. For those residential customers upgrades have largely meant swapping out energy-inefficient light bulbs for LEDs in most cases limited to common areas.

Given the potential impact this $200 million program could have Con Ed’s focus on the low-hanging fruit for energy efficiency solutions in residential buildings is a disservice to impacted customers. The BQDM area includes over 750000 residents – 90 percent of residents are people of color and 76 percent have a median household income below $30000. Many of these residents particularly in Central Brooklyn are disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of extreme heat. These customers are also likely to pay a significant portion of their income on energy costs which makes keeping cool in the summer very costly.

Low-income customers renters and customers with bad credit are excluded from many local and state energy efficiency and clean energy programs because they are unable to take on the associated debt. These vulnerable communities need more investment in solutions that not only reduce demand but also reduce energy costs. Widespread retrofits would keep homes cooler and healthier while investing in workforce development.

One possible approach Con Ed should consider is an innovative on-bill financing model known as Pay As You Save (PAYS)® a market-based system that allows customers to purchase and install cost-effective upgrades through a voluntary on-bill tariff. Energy efficiency improvements would lower the customer’s energy bill even once the tariff is applied. This model is more inclusive than debt-based on-bill programs because PAYS® is available to customers regardless of income credit score or renter status. The PAYS® model has been adopted by utility commissions in Kansas Kentucky Arkansas Hawaii and New Hampshire. New York State’s Clean Energy Advisory Council’s Low- and Moderate-Income Working Group even recommended a model similar to PAYS® in its final report. [1]

The Public Service Commission recently renewed the BQDM program for an indefinite period authorizing Con Ed to spend the remaining $50 million in ratepayer funds on additional upgrades. This sizeable investment to Central Brooklyn should go beyond light bulbs and instead focus on more long-term visionary solutions that make the energy efficiency and distributive energy economically more accessible. Governor Cuomo – who has already acknowledged Central Brooklyn’s vulnerabilities and needs via his “Vital Brooklyn” initiative – should work with the Public Service Commission and Con Edison to include low- and moderate-income communities in a just transition to the renewable energy economy by piloting the PAYS® model in the BQDM.

Commissioners will also vote Monday on upholding City Manager Marty Colburn’s recent termination of City Treasurer Kelli Martin with The Ticker obtaining personnel documents showing Colburn reprimanded Martin for performance-related issues shortly before her firing.

Annika Place Apartments PILOT Agreement

Woda Cooper Companies which broke ground this month on a new apartment complex on Wellington Street already has its sights set on its next project: a four-story 53-unit apartment building called Annika Place at 947 South Garfield Avenue.

Woda is seeking a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes (PILOT) agreement with the city that would allow the company to pay six percent of rental income annually in place of traditional taxes. PILOTs have been used elsewhere in the city as an economic tool to offset costs for developers building affordable or low-income housing. Under the agreement Woda’s annual payment to the city would be approximately $5300. Approving the PILOT “would result in a tax bill reduction of approximately $52200 annually once the development is fully constructed making this development possible” Assistant City Manager Penny Hill wrote in a memo to commissioners. The PILOT would be in place for 16 years from 2023 to 2039; construction on Annika Place is expected to start in April 2023 and be completed by June 2024.

According to Woda the 54310 square-foot apartment complex (pictured rendering) – which will span three parcels – will contain 29 one-bedroom units averaging 652 square feet and 24 two-bedroom units averaging 815 square feet with six barrier-free units offered. Thirty-four units or 64 percent of the building mix will be targeted to renters earning between 70 and 80 percent of the area median income (AMI). “At 80 percent AMI a single person could earn up to $47600 and live at Annika Place and a family of four could earn up to $68000” according to Woda. “Rents for the attainable workforce units are targeted at $860/$875 for the one-bedroom units and $1000/$1050 for the two-bedroom units.” Tenants will be responsible for utilities with trash collection included in rent. Amenities will include energy-efficient appliances and an outdoor community space with a grill picnic tables benches bike racks and a small “tot-lot” for children.

Woda’s total estimated investment in Annika Place is $13.5 million including construction costs of $8.6 million. The developers offered two design alternatives for the building including one with vehicle access from a neighboring property to the south and one with vehicle access off Garfield Avenue. Staff are recommending having vehicle access from the south to eliminate an additional drive on Garfield and reduce traffic conflicts. Staff are also recommending moving the sidewalk adjacent to Garfield away from the street to align with sidewalk to the south and moving trees in between the sidewalk and curb. If Woda’s PILOT is approved Monday the development group will next submit an application to the Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSDHA) for funding by the state’s October 1 deadline.

Treasurer Termination

City commissioners will vote Monday to uphold City Manager Marty Colburn’s recent termination of City Treasurer Kelli Martin. The position of city treasurer is one of two posts – the other being the city clerk – that cannot be hired or fired without the approval of at least five commissioners as those two positions serve as a check on the city manager's spending authority. Commissioners will also be asked Monday to support the appointment of deputy treasurer and deputy finance director James Henderson to serve as interim treasurer until a hiring process can be initiated for a new treasurer.

Colburn previously declined to discuss the cause of Martin’s termination with The Ticker saying it was city policy not to speak on personnel issues. Through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request The Ticker obtained Martin’s personnel file which included two separate emails from Colburn to Martin in August reprimanding her for performance-related issues. In one email Martin said he was writing to counsel Martin about “inappropriate comments directed towards the management team” after staff met to discuss possible options for city emergency transportation services. According to Colburn while staff were reviewing a crucial financial report at the meeting Martin repeatedly complained the team was “nitpicking” the report – even after Colburn said that characterization was inaccurate and emphasized the importance of the review process to Martin.

“Your comment was found to be disrespectful and rude and I see it as an act of disrespect to the efforts of the entire team especially when you continued to repeat the statement…as a department head this type of behavior has a negative effect on our organization” he wrote.

In another email Colburn said he was reprimanding Martin for a “lack of performance” over the last few months saying there had been a “noticeable lack of complying with direct orders for tasks given to you.” Colburn said he instructed Martin on multiple occasions to meet in person with department heads as part of the budget review process and that she ignored those instructions. “The directive was clear and concise. I have recently learned that this directive still has not been complied with” he wrote. “It is imperative that our department heads have a clear understanding of the budgets they are responsible for. I am justified in taking the highest disciplinary action against you due to the repeated insubordination; however at this time I have taken a lenient view and decided to write a letter of reprimand.”

That email was sent to Martin on August 10. Almost a month later on September 8 Colburn sent a letter to Martin stating he was terminating her effective immediately. Noting that Martin's position was at-will and that she could be “released from employment without cause” Colburn said Martin's firing was a “difficult decision but a necessary one in the best interest of the City of Traverse City.”

Martin’s termination was originally scheduled to be on the city commission’s October 4 agenda but was moved up to Monday on the recommendation of City Attorney Lauren Trible-Laucht. When asked whether Martin’s termination is legally enforceable until the city commission votes to approve the dismissal Trible-Laucht told The Ticker she could comment only that ""the charter provides that the city manager may only terminate the city treasurer with the consent of five members of the city commission.""

While Martin could not be reached for comment her husband – Christopher Martin – says his wife is still on the city’s payroll and has been receiving compensation after her September 8 dismissal date. Martin has the right to address city commissioners before their vote Monday with the board having the option to go into closed session. However Christopher Martin says his wife “has no desire to go back to that environment.” He adds: “She didn’t do anything illegal immoral or unethical.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Scheduled for early-2022 release their FRP Quality Control Manual will serve as a guidance documentation for an auditing program currently under American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials review.

The program will provide third-party certification of FRP reinforcement manufacturers for department of transportation engineers who want to include glass or carbon fiber bar in their concrete specifications according to Regulatory Resources principal and DOT Advisory Board facilitator Richard Krolewski. At present he notes 14 state DOTs support the development and future use of the FRP QC Manual for establishing product providers lists. Agencies are receptive to composite reinforcement such as glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) he adds as the material is one-quarter the weight and twice the tensile strength of conventional rebar—and does not rust.

Owens Corning Infrastructure Solutions and Tuf-Bar Inc. representatives are assisting the DOT Advisory Board’s FRP certification program. OCIS and Tuf-Bar are promoting their respective Mateenbar FRP (below) and namesake reinforcement (above) for heavy/civil applications.

“Concrete corrosion from steel is an ongoing problem in infrastructure especially in bridges and particularly in coastal communities where saltwater accelerates the damaging effects of corrosion. A certification program for suppliers will make it easier to specify FRPs for all types of infrastructure projects” Krolewski affirms.

AASHTO is reviewing the FRP QC Manual for prospective National Transportation Product Evaluation Program (NTPEP) inclusion. A proposed NTPEP committee co-chaired by DOT Advisory Board members Joseph Stillwell P.E. Maine DOT Bridge Program fabrication engineer and Cabell Garbee P.E. North Carolina DOT material products engineer would oversee evaluation of GFRP and carbon fiber reinforced concrete (CFRC).

“Developing an auditing program for GFRP and CFRC will create an even playing field for all manufacturers” Stillwell observes. “Third-party lab testing will give an unbiased assessment of the bar or strand [and] states more confidence that the materials being provided will meet their requirements and be high-quality products.”

Regulatory Resources will assist pilot audits in the coming months at facilities supplying FRP material for a demonstration project currently being monitored by the North Carolina DOT. The Harker’s Island Bridge replacement is a single-span design succeeding a double-span crossing and will exclusively use FRP reinforcement according to Garbee. “We are excited about this unique opportunity to put composite reinforcement elements at the forefront and create a very innovative sustainable opportunity for NCDOT and the industry” he adds.

Garbee and Stillwell are among 11 state transportation agency officials comprising the DOT Advisory Board advisers to which represent FRP producers Owens Corning Infrastructure Solutions and Tuf-Bar Inc. (GFRP) and Tokyo Rope (carbon fiber). The Board chartered to advance adoption of new technology within DOTs through open communication among producers certification program operators project owners and material or product providers. Members are working toward standardization of material or product acceptance practices and especially keen on technologies fostering more efficient data sharing and data transfer. — Regulatory Resources LLC Westfield Ind. 317/603-5380; www.regulatoryresourcesllc.com",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXBzdGVycy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS9yZWRtaS0xMC1wcmltZS1wcmljZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Redmi 10 Prime official in Nepal with Helio G88 and 6000mAh battery,"Xiaomi has released the new Redmi 10 Prime in Nepal.

Hard to imagine. That place doesn’t exist here.

Know where it does? Downtown Kannapolis. And for Charlotteans the costs there are hard to imagine. There in the new Vida mixed-use district apartment rents begin at $955 $500 less than the average studio apartment in Charlotte. Nearby homes list for less than $200000 about half of Charlotte’s average home price.

For nearly two decades this town went quiet after its mill closed. But now the downtown’s ambitious revitalization compels a question that would’ve seemed laughable five years ago but seems reasonable today: Could Kannapolis exert a gravitational pull strong enough to make it one of Charlotte’s affordable alternatives?

***

It’s a Thursday evening in June—no holiday no special occasion—but each corner of tiny downtown Kannapolis hosts a crowd. A steady stream of fans enters Atrium Health Ballpark to watch the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers defeat the Carolina Mudcats on Thirsty Thursday. Several hundred people pack Veterans Park with camp chairs and picnic blankets for a free concert by the Tim Clark Band. The scent of buttered popcorn stretches a block beyond the newly renovated Gem Theatre where families watch the premiere of Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway. Every table is filled in front of Old Armor Beer Company on West Avenue.

All of this happens within a third of a mile.

If you came here five years ago downtown would be quiet—“dead” according to many who lived here. If you came here two years ago the entire downtown would’ve been fenced off and shuttered. Yet even this June evening is a shadow of the town’s former glory when three times a day shift changes at the mill crowded so many people into downtown you could barely maneuver through it.

But now downtown Kannapolis is coming back to life.

The revitalization project comes at a crucial time. As surging real estate prices force more people out of walkable neighborhoods in Charlotte—and in New York and California and Illinois for that matter—they seek livable affordable downtowns elsewhere. As remote work severs daily commutes revived Carolina mill towns like Kannapolis hope to lure new residents. It’s a place that compels a visitor to check Zillow and wonder “Could I?”

“When people used to talk about Kannapolis they used to turn their nose up and not have much interest in living here in hanging out” says Meredith Little who grew up in nearby Mount Pleasant and once shared that opinion. “And right now everyone wants to come to Kannapolis. People are wanting to buy in Kannapolis.”

Little laughs as she speaks as surprised as anyone at the transformation of the city—especially now that she’s a business owner there. Last fall she and her two sisters opened 3 jem’s boutique a trendy women’s clothing and accessory shop in downtown. Kannapolis has proved Little wrong but her doubled profits soothe the sting.

“These downtowns (like Kannapolis) are small but they were industrial powerhouses in their day and so you have that urban fabric you can build on” says Chuck McShane director of market analytics for the Carolinas at CoStar Group and a contributor to this magazine. “Places like Kannapolis places like Salisbury and places like Albemarle—places that were just outside the commuting distance from major urban centers—I think there’s going to be a big interest in those places going forward. Places like Kannapolis have a big opportunity to position themselves.”

Stop me if you’ve heard this before. A North Carolina town finds early 20th-century prosperity in textiles—then when industry moves overseas faces crises of economy and identity. To survive into the 21st century it embarks on public-private partnerships that lure new industries and build attractions to entice residents to settle down and visitors to spend up. Old mills house mixed-use developments. Up goes a minor-league ballpark that anchors a district of new shops and restaurants. Rebranding begins.

North Carolinians have heard this story plenty. It’s Charlotte’s story and Gastonia’s and Durham’s and High Point’s.

It’s Kannapolis’ too. But here the story introduces a new angle. The thing that hastened its downfall—downtown Kannapolis’ ownership by one person—propels its resurgence. Single ownership of a city means interconnected fortunes of those within it. Good times are very good; bad times are disastrous. But this time the sole owner is using that angle to the city’s advantage: Renovate an entire downtown all at once set a strategic course then end single ownership forever.

This used to be a company town. James William Cannon founder of Cannon Mills owned the entire town of Kannapolis starting in 1905. Workers rented houses Cannon owned. They borrowed books at the town library exercised at the YMCA took their kids to schools and prayed at churches—all owned by Cannon. He owned the police roads and water and sewage systems. Kannapolis had no mayor or council. Just Cannon and then his son Charles who took over in 1921. It was the country’s largest unincorporated town.

Look at it generously and the Cannons’ goal was to create a town that met the personal and professional needs of healthy happy employees. Look at it cynically and the intention seems like tight workforce control. As older residents recall the Cannon days of cheap rent well-maintained homes and a thriving neighborhood there’s argument for the former. As Charles Cannon twice called the National Guard to quell unionization efforts there’s argument for the latter too.

“It worked both ways. (The Cannon family) built the hospital they built the schools they did a lot of good … but then again you were sort of owned by them too” says Carla Clay 74 who grew up in Kannapolis. “The uptown jail was about as big as Mayberry’s. There was really no crime. If you worked in the mill and you lived in a mill house and if you got in trouble they would make you leave the house and you would lose your job.”

For decades Cannon Mills seemed too big to fail. In the early 20th century it was the world’s largest producer of sheets and towels. But it did fail and when it did the fates of the mill city and residents intertwined.

In 1982 David Murdock—a billionaire from California—bought the struggling Cannon Mills along with all of Kannapolis. Kannapolis incorporated as a city two years later. In 2003 the mill shut down and 4340 workers lost their jobs in one day. Downtown storefronts went dark as Murdock focused on a new venture: the $1.5 billion North Carolina Research Campus housed in large university-style buildings that tower where the mill once stood.

The research in these buildings revolves around a single concept: People can live longer if they eat the right plants and enough of them. There scientists have devised shelf-stable fruit compounds that can nourish people in developing countries or amid natural disasters as well as astronauts and soldiers on extended missions; they’re learning to make crops resistant to pests and disease with genetics not pesticides. Murdock began his quest to extend life span through vegetables and fruits when his wife Gabriele was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1983. Even though he didn’t find an answer before she died two years later at age 43 his mission continues in these buildings.

But the campus has had recruiting problems. “We were told we couldn’t get anybody to come because the downtown is dead” says Kannapolis Mayor Darrell Hinnant. He and the city manager approached Murdock with a plan. “We said ‘Well you know something has to happen with downtown so if you’re not going to do anything why don’t you sell it to us and let us do something with it?”

Five years ago this stretch of West Avenue (above and below) was lifeless. Now it’s the most prominent example of the city’s transformation.

Once Charlotte completes its planned Gateway Station uptown Kannapolis residents could get to the center of the larger city in 35 minutes by train.

In 2015 the City of Kannapolis bought 46 acres of downtown. Now it’s selling downtown buildings and lots one by one. For the first time downtown Kannapolis doesn’t have a single owner. But between buying the downtown and selling it the City of Kannapolis needed a vision to guide what would happen next.

Kannapolis needed two things for a successful revitalization project. First it needed residents to raise their own taxes to pay for big changes in their own downtown. No easy thing especially in a small conservative city rooted in its history. Next the project needed to compel millennials and Gen Zers—families recent grads and entrepreneurs—to find Kannapolis cool enough to move there and become its new taxpaying residents and business owners. No easy thing especially in a small conservative city rooted in its history.

Hinnant added a third goal: Make longtime residents proud. He wanted to stick by the people who had stuck by Kannapolis through Cannon through Murdock and now through its reinvention. He wanted the new downtown to be a tribute to old days.

He had a model for this lofty plan: Durham. The City of Kannapolis hired the same group that ushered Durham from a ghost town that lost its textile and tobacco jobs to a downtown that tops lists of best places to live for both recent grads and retirees. The Development Finance Initiative at University of North Carolina School of Government (DFI) came to help Kannapolis replicate the model.

Although the law required only one public hearing to approve the city’s investment Hinnant knew the public would need more time and information. The city held three public hearings and more than 20 community meetings about the tax hike that would fund the project. The mayor and council shared concept images from DFI. They promised that a three-block section would maintain its original exteriors and oak trees to ensure that Kannapolis still felt like Kannapolis. They pledged to avoid gentrification by requiring nearby affordable housing at below-market rates; they secured funding from the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency to improve older homes—by adding things like handicapped-accessible ramps new hot water heaters and new roofs—so cash-strapped residents could continue to live there.

“It’s important for us as a community to make sure that all this growth and reimagining doesn’t gentrify our community” Hinnant says. “It would be tragic for us to have all this growth and all of a sudden a segment of our community has to move out because they can’t afford to live in it. So part of my strategy and my commitment to the entire community is: This has to be good for everybody.”

The City Council approved the tax hike in June 2015.

The first goal was achieved. Two more to go.

***

Even though the model resembles that of Durham High Point and others Kannapolis had a distinct advantage: Buying an entire downtown meant the city could tear up roads all at once to improve infrastructure—water sewer fiber cable—and renovate streetscapes without disturbing existing businesses. For nearly two years chain-link fencing blocked all of downtown amid construction. Then on Oct. 10 2019 the fences came down.

“When we announced that we were going to take the fences down there were 2500 people anxious to go inside the fence to see what was happening” Hinnant says. “And I’ll tell you the biggest comment I heard was ‘Wow I couldn’t believe it was going to be this.’”

The biggest change was a new linear park that runs along West Avenue. Instagram-ready seating arrangements—swings Adirondack chairs benches—offer places to gather amid pop music that plays from speakers hidden in the landscaping. On one side of the park are the original renovated storefronts now occupied by independent businesses: a coffee shop ice cream shop clothing boutiques bakery. On the other side of the park is the new Cannon Ballers stadium voted Ballpark Digest’s best Low-A minor league stadium which has a playground splash pad and walking paths the community can use when games aren’t being held. Around the corner the Gem Theatre—the circa-1936 movie theater—has a marquee that’s lit up once again.

Around the time of the downtown unveiling Little 32 and her two sisters were looking for a new location for their boutique. They were committed to finding a location that all three sisters would like—a nice idea in theory but nearly three years into their search one that seemed impossible in practice.

“We kept hearing about up-and-coming Kannapolis and that we needed to come out there and look. So we went back when nothing was open but the brewery and stadium” Little says. “We knew immediately. We looked at each other and said ‘This is it. This is what we’ve been waiting for.’”

Their visit in 2020 was intended to be a scouting trip but the three women decided on the location that day. “We literally said ‘Sign us up right now. Don’t you dare give this away.’”

Their 3 jem’s boutique opened in Kannapolis on Black Friday. Business has since doubled foot traffic is “booming” and they’re upfitting the basement to store more merchandise to meet customer demand. They still run their Salisbury boutique as well but some of their regular customers in Salisbury now drive past that store to visit the Kannapolis shop where they can also go to the movie theater the popcorn store the ballpark. Little says that they see groups of high school girlfriends and 30-something moms with small kids in tow coming not just to shop but to make a day of it.

Check off goal two: Make young people dig downtown Kannapolis.

***

As of June the downtown revitalization project is 40% complete with plans in place for most of the remainder. Soon a hotel will rise beside the ballpark. The city’s also sold land to developers who will create high-end townhouses and condos—two projects expected to add more than $50 million in private investment.

“All of the sales that we have made so far have been sold to private companies and they are investing their money into downtown” Hinnant says. “And so the state loves that because that’s private investment bringing wealth and investment into our state and into our community.”

The city’s next challenge will be luring companies to set up locations in or near downtown allowing office space to catch up with residential and retail. It seems a precarious balance without that element as uptown is still a 30-mile trip down I-85 and traffic’s getting no easier. But the possibility of rail travel between the two downtowns—as Charlotte relocates its Amtrak station uptown over the next few years—means that someone living in downtown Kannapolis could enjoy a car-free commute to uptown Charlotte within 35 minutes.

Although it’s the most recent addition to the hub-and-spoke model of development in the Charlotte region Kannapolis wasn’t the first. And likely won’t be the last.

“Now that the Charlotte region is growing outward I think there are a lot of opportunities for those small-town downtowns to be really interesting places for new suburban dwellers” says McShane citing Rock Hill as another example.

But what do older longtime dwellers think of Kannapolis’ transformation? Talking with seniors downtown the reaction to the changes was universally positive. Clay agrees; despite her wariness about the pace of changes to come she believes that the improvements to downtown were as much a return to the old days as the start of new ones. Once again she sees kids line up at the Gem and she and her friends take walks around the city.

Last spring as Hinnant enjoyed one of the season’s first Cannon Ballers games he noticed a 92-year-old native Kannapolis resident with his friends. The mayor asked the man what he thought of the changes to his hometown and nervously awaited his answer.

“He told me ‘I didn’t think I’d live long enough to see this’” Hinnant says. “It brings tears to my eyes that he’s so happy.”

Goal three. Check.

If you’re just joining us on this journey our star reporter Mr. Sato recently fancies himself as something of a Senbero Master wherein “senbero” refers to a serving of food and alcohol for under 1000 yen ($9.08) before tax and capable of providing a solid buzz.

These light meals are usually offered at drinking establishments like izakaya but since restrictions have made that hard Mr. Sato has been seeking out home alternatives to the senbero experience. He already tackled Lawson Store 100 and Don Quijote so what cost-cutting retail chain would be next?

▼ Costco!

Actually Mr. Sato had never really shopped at Costco and didn’t know what to expect there so he asked his boss Yoshio about it.

▼ Yoshio: “What? You don’t know anything about Costco? You can’t make a senbero there. Don’t be stupid?”

As always Mr. Sato interpreted “don’t be stupid” as a challenge and headed right over to the big-box giant.

After studying the alcoholic beverage section Mr. Sato made his drink choice: a 720-milliliter (24-ounce) bottle of 2020 Carmenere Porta Reserve for 580 yen ($5.27). This was a little steeper than his past drinks but it’s important to study all possible combinations of senbero to truly be a master of it.

Since the wine had antioxidants in it our reporter decided that the theme of this senbero should be health. So with his remaining budget he sought out the most nutritious items that would also pair well with his port.

To Mr. Sato’s surprise Costco had a decent selection of fresh foods at reasonable prices. First he picked up a whole head of cabbage for 74 yen ($0.67).

Then he chose a whole daikon for only 91 yen ($0.83). For those unfamiliar with this Japanese radish it’s hard to get a sense of scale from this photo but one daikon is usually about 60 centimeters (24 inches) long give or take.

Last but not least what could be more nutritious than a whole bunch of bananas weighing in at 1.3 kilos (2.9 pounds) and costing only 248 yen ($2.25)?

The grand total for this Costco senbero came to 1084 yen ($9.84).

It was only four items this time but if you consider all the vitamins minerals and alcohol Mr. Sato was way ahead of the game pound for pound.

Before the senbero was to commence Mr. Sato would first have to prepare the food.

He got a grater to convert his bitter vegetable into a flavorful garnish.

One thing you might not know about Mr. Sato is that he loves grating.

Seriously he hasn’t even drunk anything yet…

▼ Mr. Sato: “YEAAAAAAHHHHHHH!”

Next it was time to shred the lettuce.

One other thing you might not know about Mr. Sato is that he isn’t such a fan when it comes to shredding lettuce.

He doesn’t hate it exactly. He can just take it or leave it.

With that part out of the way he was all set to prepare his tray of food to accompany his wine.

Having the right amount of shredded cabbage was essential so he carefully measured out his portion…

…bit by bit until it was perfect.

▼ “There!”

The final piece of the puzzle was a finely peeled banana.

Ah c’est magnifique Monsieur Sato!

And what better way to celebrate than with a nice glass of red wine.

That’s right Mr. Sato. Take a big bite of that raw cabbage. You deserve it!

After chewing through the blades of cabbage like a grazing cow Mr. Sato took another dainty sip of wine. Once again we remind you that Mr. Sato is a bit of a lightweight when it comes to drinking and was certainly already quite tipsy.

But the more he imbibed the sweeter his raw grated daikon tasted.

Also since the food was so healthy Mr. Sato felt comfortable drinking more and more wine. It was a nutritious spiral.

▼ Mr. Sato: “Hahaha! The Costco senboro was superb! Lots of *hic* healthy vegetibbles and…yeah.”

▼ Mr. Sato: “Who…was the JACKASS that told me this wouldn’t work? Thasssssswaddaiwannano.”

As Yoshio stormed out of the room slamming the door behind him. Mr. Sato decided to get back to work while finishing the rest of his senbero.

▼ Mr. Sato: “This food is so good and healthy I don’t even need to do nothing to it.”

▼ Mr. Sato: “Gah it tastes like paper… But it’s good.”

▼ Mr. Sato: “Jus’ need to wet the whistle a little…”

Once again we must remind readers that Mr. Sato is a trained Senbero Master and that his professionally crafted drinking sessions are best done under proper conditions like you see here. Our supervisor Go Hatori was monitoring the situation closely.

And our health and safety expert Takashi Harada was also on guard.

▼ Takashi: “…”

Whether or not he’d get any closer to Mr. Sato was another matter entirely.

While the rest of the world is only now coming to terms with the start of fall and pumpkin pies flooding the bakery aisles at supermarkets there's one retail giant that already has its eyes set on Christmas. Although the holiday season is three months away Costco shoppers have already started spotting the retailer's boozy advent calendars for 2021. It's never too early to get into the holiday spirit especially if there's some booze involved eh?

Per Vinepair Costco has brought back the Brewer's Advent Calendar by Kalea for the seventh year in a row. The giant advent calendar contains 24 16.9-ounce cans of German beer so beer fans can drink their way to Christmas. Each beer the Kalea website claims is sourced from small breweries located in Germany and Austria and packaged specially for the Brewer's Advent Calendar. While the 2021 beer calendar sees the return of Pilsners and Helles Lagers there are six new additions to this year's version. Apart from a new Bavarian-style Marzen a hefeweizen and an Indian pale ale Kalea says that the real kicker this year will be the Zwönitzer Steinbier and the Ladenburger Weizenbock. As with previous years the 2021 Brewer's Advent Calendar is also priced at $59.99.

Yet while a beer advent calendar sounds like a pretty exciting way for adults to get hyped about Christmas some Costco shoppers aren't too happy about it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZGV4dHJhLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGVzLzIwMjEvc2VwLzE4L21heW9ycy1vZi11dGFoLXZhbGxleS1hLWRlY2FkZS1vZi1ncm93dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mayors of Utah Valley: A decade of growth | News Sports Jobs,"Our beautiful mountain and lakefront community of Saratoga Springs is continuing to grow in a proactive manner to balance residential growth attract commercial businesses and provide enhanced public amenities and recreational programs. This is evident by the most recent census data which shows that over the last ten years our population has grown to 37696.

As we progress forward Saratoga Springs is working with commercial developers and brokers to tell our story and demonstrate the unique dynamic of our city and the surrounding region. Our ability to tell this story played a significant role in Costco’s completion last year and the development of the surrounding support retail. Olive Garden Dutch Bros and Apollo Burger to name a few will be part of our community soon.

Since the announcement of Costco a wide variety of businesses have reached out to the city and local developers about opening new locations in our area. These include everything from new office buildings and spaces additional big-box stores to mid-box stores fast-casual dining to sit-down restaurants and hotels family entertainment dance schools medical services and more.

This growth is continuing to attract developments such as medical campuses such Intermountain Healthcare medical campus that will break ground at the corner of Pioneer Crossing and Crossroads Boulevard this fall. The initial phase of this exciting project will include a free-standing emergency room and a same day surgical center. The Saratoga Springs temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints continues to move forward to completion.

During the last year multiple transportation improvements in Saratoga Springs were also completed. These improvements include the widening of Redwood Road and the Continuous Flow Intersection at Redwood Road and Pioneer Crossing. Both of these projects have provided great relief to east-west congestion as well as north-south traffic through the City of Saratoga Springs and were the result of many years of planning.

The city has worked with MAG to secure funding to extend Foothill Blvd. south from Pony Express Parkway to Lariat Blvd. Extending this north-south connection that will parallel Redwood Road and will allow residents to travel throughout the city. The extension of Pony Express east to Saratoga Road is currently under construction. This extension will allow eastbound traffic to continue on Pony Express farther to alleviate congestion on Redwood Road and Pioneer Crossing.

So what does all of this growth and infrastructure mean for economic development in Saratoga Springs? It means more retailers and commercial developers are turning their eyes to Saratoga Springs. It is the result of the city proactively cultivating an incredible synergy that businesses are expanding and thriving on.

Most importantly it means that our residents will continue to find great places to work go out to eat have fun with their families and enjoy the amazing quality of life in our community.

As we like to say in Saratoga Springs “Life’s just better here!”

Special to the Detroit Free Press

We have seen this castle before — five years back when the longtime owners put it up for sale after coddling it for four decades.

Built near the end of the 1920s the castle is now 93 years old — and not to be confused with the 30-year-old ""Game of Thrones""-like castle in Rochester that was recently in the news. This castle had been the trophy home of a successful developer who lost it after the 1929 stock market crash.

Thanks to his vision and that of the 40-year owners who followed the home's interior drips with lavish finishes.

These owners filled the house with lavish effects like trompe l'oeil — that painting technique that makes scenes eerily real by painting them in 3D. Other luxuriant walls and ceilings have faux-finish glazing murals and a small fortune in silver and gold leaf.

Its construction includes complex arches elaborate carved plaster huge architectural antiques antique fireplaces and a spectacular women's bathroom where the art deco design combines 10 or 12 different vintage art tiles.

The morning room which faces east absolutely dazzles. The walls ceiling arches and floors are completely painted with scenes geometric designs gold leaf patterns faux marble real marble carved wood and tiles. Images and patterns overlap and all of it glitters with gold and silver leaf. Current owners call this the Italian room.

The formal dining room is equally arresting with a black and white marble floor. Its deep-stacked carved woodwork and plaster is emphasized with glazes of blue green and gold leaf. This glitters with light from two large crystal chandeliers and five crystal wall sconces.

The lower level has a stunning vintage ballroom full of trompe l'oeil and special effects. A breezeway attaches a carriage house to the main house. There's a swimming pool and a 10000-gallon natural pool for koi.

Now after five years the coddled castle is back in public view — refreshed and relandscaped. That includes a large outdoor basketball and sports court colored the vivid University of Michigan maize and blue.

To the lavishly trimmed existing house the current owners added more embellishment. Barely possible you might say? It's possible.

They invited Pjeter Frroku an artist based in Sterling Heights into the house and gave him free rein.

More:$2.5 million Oakland Township home is as opulent as a European castle

More:$1.19M Brush Park mansion condo is historic on the outside brand new on the inside

Down a second-floor hall Frroku painted lake scenes framed with trompe l'oeil stone arches. In the lower-level billiards room he painted a trompe l'oeil bay window with an ocean outside and four dogs playing pool.

Using paint splotches he changed the entrance to the lower-level entertainment area into a cave-like area. Around some doors he painted faux stone and marble.

Meanwhile these owners lightened up the interior by taking down window coverings. They pulled up all the second-floor carpet and finished the beautiful inlaid two-tone wood floors. The effect feels more fresh.

They replaced banks of leaky windows but left all the overhead arches of stained or leaded glass.

They remodeled the kitchen and more with stone and stone tile. The two-part kitchen is completely new including stone floors and stone tile up the walls and across the ceiling.

They did a full remodeling of the carriage house apartment — a new kitchen new bath and floors of gray-streaked ceramic tile made to look like wood. There is garage space for seven cars.

They especially redid the landscape and the brick patios drives and walks. They regraded the land to end drainage issues. They installed central air conditioning.

Back in the '20s this land near Adams Road and 16 Mile was far out in the country. This street did not even have a name. It has ended up named for its most famous structure. This is Adams Castle Drive.

Nothing says autumn like a giant vegetable competition and the Malvern Autumn Show (24-26 September £18 under-16s free but tickets required) claims its contest is one of the biggest of the bunch. Held in the Three Counties Showground at the foot of the Malvern Hills near Ledbury it features artisan food and drink stalls and talks by gardening gurus. For a treat stay at the gorgeous Cottage in the Wood boutique hotel (doubles £199 B&B) whose fine restaurant has woodland views. Or camp at Eastnor Castle which is most beautiful in autumn and which was used as a set for the TV drama Succession – the deer park and arboretum are beautiful in autumn (pitches until 30 September £12 a night entry to castle and grounds £12.50 adult £7.50 child). Nearby Tenbury Wells hosts an Applefest on 2 October while the National Trust’s Croome estate (£12/£6) provides more lovely autumn walks.

Nature-spotting multi-day trek in the South Downs

Hiking is particularly pleasant in the mild temperatures of a classic autumn and rural routes are buzzing with wildlife and alive with colour. The 65-mile Serpent Trail snaking through heathland in Surrey and Hampshire was created in 2005 but has been altered this year to follow a more picturesque route. Beginning in Haslemere it winds through the South Downs national park and finishes in Petersfield with sculptures dotted along the way. Here you can see live adders sand lizards and smooth snakes – Britain’s rarest reptiles which unusually give birth to young in September. In autumn green tiger beetles and black darter dragonflies may still be around too and the heather is in bloom bilberries are ready to pluck and birds such as stonechats woodlarks and Dartford warblers decorate the breeze with their song.

Walking and dining on the Suffolk coast

View image in fullscreen The Suffolk coast around Orford offers varied walking with sea views heath and woodland.

The cute village of Orford on the Suffolk coast has lots going for it – pretty streets of pubs and delis a quay and the Crown and Castle now a smart bistro with 21 rooms. You can see Henry II’s 12th-century castle from the windows and nearby for spooky autumn walks is mysterious Orford Ness. This long spit which once served as a military base has now been commandeered for wildlife and is a National Trust nature reserve. Aldeburgh is a few miles north and there’s leaf peeping in nearby Rendlesham forest. The hotel has a list of walking routes with varying lengths designed to burn off the calories guests eat in the restaurant that night. Go for the 45-minute ramble and you might only have a main of Orford-landed skate wing with chorizo and crab butter but do the full 7½-hour hike and you could amply justify half a dozen Butley Bay oysters to start plus a pud of strawberry cheesecake with Pimm’s jelly and cucumber sorbet and take the hotel’s posh picnic with you.

South of Skye and Mull the island of Islay (pronounced I-luh) is rich in wildlife and famed for its peaty whiskies. Responsible Travel’s five-day Inner Hebrides autumn wildlife tour covers both with departures scheduled on 22 and 29 October and 5 November. The primary draw at this time of year is birdlife including oystercatchers and skylarks on the Kintyre peninsula eagles on the sea cliffs of Oa nature reserve and 20000 barnacle and white-fronted geese arriving at Loch Gruinart and Loch Gorm from Greenland in October. One day is dedicated to a coastal pathway that links the Laphroaig Lagavulin and Ardbeg whisky distilleries with seal viewing and a wee dram or three to warm the cockles alongside a distillery tour.

The new 48-mile cycling circuit in Herefordshire’s Golden Valley expands on the popular cider trails launched last year. The Porter’s Perfection circuit starts from the village of Dorstone in the shadow of the neolithic monument Arthur’s Stone and tours several west Herefordshire craft cider makers. A leisurely ride along peaceful back roads with glimpses of rolling hills takes in Orgasmic Cider Company’s orchards a horse-drawn mill at the 17th-century Fair Oak Cider farm and the county’s oldest pub Dorstone’s Pandy Inn. The route can also be tackled in smaller bite-size sections. The aptly named Cider Shack from Ty Gwyn Holidays is a tiny holiday home for two in rural splendour comprising two sheds fire pit outdoor bath and log-burning stove.

Two nights at the Cider Shack (tygwynholidays.co.uk) costs £240 or the Pandy Inn B&B has doubles from £85



Cattle droving festival and steaming in the Lake District

The annual droving event on 28-30 October signals the shift from autumn to winter in the northern Lakes. The main event with performers and a street market is in Penrith but the lakeside community of Pooley Bridge also throws its own. Mask-wearing is a major feature of the event which celebrates the cattle droving that has taken place in rural Cumbria for centuries and culminates in a flame-lit procession of horned and cloaked locals. A visit can be combined with hiking sections of the 20-mile Ullswater Way linked by the Ullswater Steamers and tinged with autumnal colours at this time of year. Close to the path the Quiet Site holiday park offers toasty-warm family camping pods with electricity some of which are dog-friendly.

Camping pods sleep two adults and two children from £150 for two nights some availability during the droving

Ballygally Castle on Antrim’s scenic Causeway Coastal Route feels a world away from the big city yet is only 26 miles from Belfast – and in autumn room prices are lower. At this time of year there’s more breathing space along the busy coastal road which runs to Northern Ireland’s most visited attraction the Giant’s Causeway. The castle dates from 1625 and overlooks sandy Ballygally Bay. Nearby is the improbable early-20th-century feat of engineering called the Gobbins (£20/£14.50) a wild seacliff walk of spiral staircases and suspended bridges with tunnels once used by smugglers. There’s also paddleboarding off the Ballygally beach (if weather permits) the Norman Carrickfergus Castle on Belfast Lough and an hour north near the Giant’s Causeway coasteering at Portrush or Ballintoy (available year-round wetsuits provided).

Ancient sites seem more atmospheric as the season turns misty none more so than Hadrian’s Wall. A mile from the wall just outside the town of Brampton lies Hadrian’s Wall Country Yurts (from £218 for a yurt sleeping two adults and two children for two nights hadrianswallglamping.com). There are two yurts – both have woodburners one has a wood-fired hot tub – and they share a paddock on a smallholding that rears sheep chickens and the owners’ small children. Guests can take atmospheric walks at dusk to some of the best-preserved sections of the wall. Eight miles east at Walltown country park near Greenhead there is a self-guided geolocated sound walk Collision and Conflict which uses music sound and storytelling to explore these borderlands via a GPS-triggered app (until 1 October). For more outdoor adventuring there’s the Pennines AONB and Northumberland national park – renowned for its stargazing. For a pint or three Walton village’s Old Vicarage Brewery has a cosy bar serving its own ale and those of other microbreweries. It also has rooms for £75 B&B.

Literature in Manchester

View image in fullscreen Kimpton Clocktower has loft-style rooms.

After the physical event was cancelled last year the Manchester literature festival (9-17 October) is back with live talks and readings for 2021 including sessions with Booker prize winner Bernardine Evaristo and Primal Scream frontman Bobby Gillespie. Manchester became a Unesco city of literature in 2017 thanks to its historic ties to radical writers including Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. They worked together at Chetham’s Library (free closed weekends) founded in 1653 and thought to be the oldest public library in the world which has just reopened after a multimillion-pound renovation. In between literary sessions grab a beer at local Cloudwater Brew Co’s new Piccadilly taproom. The Kimpton Clocktower hotel on Oxford Street opened last year has loft-style rooms inside the sumptuously restored Grade II-listed building.

The injured man was transported to Ocala Regional Medical Center and is expected to survive authorities said.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers said the men were reportedly on their way to go look at a vehicle in the Belleview area.

Homeless man killed:Ocala police believe homeless man found in January may have been killed by passing train

The victims were in an older model Geo Tracker and had traveled on a single-lane dirt road off Southeast 62nd Avenue Road in Belleview.

The driver drove up a small incline at Southeast 102nd Place to cross over the railroad tracks. Officials said the men thought they could make it even though a train was approaching.

The vehicle got struck on the tracks. Realizing they would not get out in time the occupants tried getting out of the vehicle FHP said.

Troopers believe the passenger managed to make it out of the vehicle. He was struck by the oncoming train.

The driver was unable to exit the vehicle troopers said. He was taken to the hospital.

The incident occurred shortly after 1 a.m. FHP said the CSX train had 183 cars and was hauling non-hazardous materials from Tampa to Georgia.

The deceased is identified as a 28-year-old man from Ocala. His family has not yet been notified officials said. The passenger is a 37-year-old man from Morriston. The patrol no longer includes names in its news releases.

Two other crashes

Since the beginning of the year there has been three CSX train wrecks – including Saturday's case – involving vehicles in Belleview. All three happened at night and within a mile of each other.

The first was at Baseline Road and County Road 25 in March. The crash involved a CSX train and an older model pickup truck. Belleview Police Department officers said the crossing gate was down but the driver went around the barrier. The train struck the back of the vehicle.

A man and woman who were in the truck were not injured. The driver was ticketed for driving around the railroad crossing.

Three months later a CSX train struck a semitractor-trailer in the 6200 block of Southeast Baseline Road.

The truck driver told a Star-Banner reporter that the vehicle got struck on the tracks. Unable to move it and seeing the training barreling ahead the man got out.

He said he was on his way to Walmart to drop off supplies.

Our beloved Sister earned her Angel Wings on September 18 2021.

Sister had a way of making everything look like it came easy to her and she was a natural at everything: a natural athlete who excelled at every sport she ever tried and had a special love for the game of basketball; a natural student who was constantly learning and had just begun her senior year of high school and running start; and Sister was a natural beauty with a 100000000 kilowatt smile that lit up an entire community.

Sister’s presence was felt everywhere. She often would announce her arrival as a former teacher of Sister’s said “you heard her coming down the hall before you saw her”.

Watching Sister do anything was magical. She had patience when teaching her brothers she danced her traditional dances with grace and she played basketball with a deep passion. Her long flowing hair was her calling card on all of these activities.

Sister was also a natural model who loved fashion and was an expert at pulling an outfit together accessories and all that set the standard for new trends amongst her peers. She had that rare ability to look fabulous in anything straight off the rack. Sister loved the camera and the camera loved her evidence of this is in every picture ever taken of Sister.

Sister was always surrounded by friends and family. Sis would often say “my first best friend is my mom” and it was true. Wendy and Sister didn’t do anything without each other. Even though Sister was the third baby for Wendy and Robert she was the second Mama to all her siblings which include two older brothers Cody and Colton as well as a younger brother Caleb and a baby sister Armani. Sister and Armani were known to cruise to the beach or make TikTok videos together always laughing together and having a good time. Her brothers and sister were her squad and she was certainly the leader. She was the best big sister who selflessly cared for all the people around her.

Whether Sister was with family and friends at home school work or anywhere laughter and shenanigans were sure to follow. Sister always greeted people with a radiant smile but had a twinkle of mischief in her eyes as well. If you knew Sis you know what twinkle I am talking about. That twinkle in her eye started young too and when you caught it you’d find yourself thinking “what are you up to girl?” Her usual hug and smile always had an accompanying wisecrack or giggle. Quick to joke ready to prank and always armed with her smile a warm hug and infectious laugh Sis brought the good times with her and had the habit of making even the most mundane tasks fun and filled with laughter. If she was serious anywhere though it was on the basketball court. She played ball with a fierce determination dedicated to practicing Sis was incredibly focused when it came to the game. Basketball came to her naturally she was a smooth elegant ballplayer who made it look effortless and easy. Sister was also a selfless teammate who consistently made those around her better. More than just giving it her all to be the best she gave it all so others could be their best as well. Sister was always looking to give others the opportunity to shine and truly celebrated the successes of her teammates. Sister was a crucial part of Neah Bay High School history as a member of the Lady Red’s Basketball Team that took 3rd Place at the Classic Hardwood State Tournament in 2019 her freshman year. If COVID-19 hadn’t hit the Lady Reds were hungry and determined to take it all the next year.

The humor the basketball talent the way she had an inside joke with every person she knew…those close to Sis would say that was her. But those who are older in Neah Bay recognize those qualities as very similar to her late Uncle Shannon “Shadrack” Wright. While Shadrack and Sister were never able to meet face to face those who knew both will agree that their meeting in heaven was followed up with an epic game of one-on-one complete with smack-talking encouragement and storytelling.

Sister had aspirations to work in the medical field and was undecided if she were going to go for her Nursing or Doctor of Medical Degree. She had started courses through the Running Start program and was making plans to move away for college. Knowing her mom would move with her Sister was looking closely at a few out-of-state colleges that would be both a great fit for the entire family as well as provide her an excellent education. It took the entire village to support Sister to the point of being college-ready and the family would like to recognize Mrs. Serena Elvrum one of Sister’s teachers at Neah Bay High School who made a huge impact on her life and went above and beyond to ensure Sister’s success.

Sister was unfailingly described by her peers as a truly caring friend who often went out of her way to check on her people. She loved easily and she loved hard. Her love was solid and steady she remained by her friends’ sides when they needed her the most. And most importantly she never left without telling you she loved you.

Sister was beauty Sister was grace Sister was above all Love. Selfless love for the sake of love. And each of us who knew her are better people for it.

But alas the VW emissions scandal ruined everything in 2015.

Six years after Volkswagen hit the final nail in the coffin of diesel-powered cars in the United States compression-ignition technology soldiers on in a select few vehicles. Most of them are body-on-frame designs predominantly trucks and SUVs. The only exceptions come from Land Rover in the guise of the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport which use the TDV6 also known as Power Stroke in the 2021 model year Ford F-150 half-ton workhorse.After covering the Duramax family of powerplants for the U.S. market it’s high time for us to remember what kind of diesel options Fiat Chrysler Automobiles currently offers. The smallest automaker of the Big Three in Detroit boasts just two under the EcoDiesel and Cummins monikers.The L630 for the U.S. market dates back to 2011 when Italian diesel-making company VM Motori debuted the A630 with 3.0 liters of displacement and a 60-degree V angle. Constructed from graphite iron for the block and lightweight aluminum for the heads the 10-year-old engine design was found to have emissions defeat devices on MY 2014 through 2016 vehicles.Previously offered in the WK2-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee the L630 is currently found under the hoods of the Ram 1500 light-duty pickup Jeep Wrangler off-road utility vehicle and Jeep Gladiator off-road pickup. The 1-2-3-4-5-6 firing order and the 60-degree V angle optimize the firing loads and inertia management therefore eliminating the need for a balance shaft.Heat-treated individual bearing caps for the aluminum heads reduce friction andlevels. The forged steel used for the connecting rods and crankshaft helps with this engine’s durability along with aluminum-alloy pistons that benefit from oil jets. The variable-geometry turbocharger automatic tensioning single-belt drive MultiJet common-rail injection cooled exhaust gas recirculation selective catalytic reduction diesel exhaust fluid system as well as high-temperature glow plugs also need to be mentioned.In the Ram 1500 and Jeep Wrangler/Gladiator twins the EcoDiesel develops 260 horsepower and 480 pound-feet or 442 pound-feet (650 or 600 Nm) of torque. Available in conjunction with an eight-speed automatic transmission this fellow tops 26 miles per gallon (9 liters per kilometers) on the combined driving cycle according to the Environmental Protection Agency.The other diesel engine that Fiat Chrysler sells today is the 6.7-liter Cummins in the Ram heavy-duty truck lineup a torquey behemoth saddled with an extensive range of emissions control systems. A very different animal from the 5.9 from the good ol’ days the 6.7 is offered in two flavors.For the standard-output version customers are treated to 370 horsepower and 850 pound-feet (1152 Nm) of torque. The high-output version of the straight-six Cummins turbo diesel tops the heavy-duty truck segment with 400 horsepower and a decidedly outrageous 1075 pound-feet (1458 Nm).When properly equipped the 2500 and 3500 with this engine can tow up to 20000 and 37100 pounds (9071 and 16828 kilograms). If payload is highest on your list of priorities the Ram 5500 Chassis Cab is your workhorse.Last updated for the 2021 model year Ram heavy-duty lineup the 6.7-liter Cummins flaunts new calibration a.k.a. more boost for the sliding nozzle variable-geometry turbocharger. The fuel delivery system which is capable of sustaining 2000 bars (29008 psi) was treated to an increased flow rate.One advantage of the straight-six layout over the Duramax V8 and Power Stroke V8 is smoothness. Ram also sweetens the deal with more sound-insulating materials than before an acoustic windshield as well as active noise cancellation for top-of-the-line trim levels of the Ram 2500 and 3500.The Cummins-Ram partnership dates back to the 1989 model year when the B-series engine in the Dodge Ram was coupled to the heavy-duty version of the TorqueFlite A727 automatic or a five-speed manual transmission. The 2021 Ram HD with the 6.7-liter mill features two automatics: the 68RFE for the standard-output version and the Aisin AS69RC for the H.O. version.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkbGluZHF1aXN0LzIwMjEvMDkvMTgvaG93LWphbS1iYW5kLXVtcGhyZXlzLW1jZ2VlLXR1cm5lZC1jb25jZXJ0LXdhbGstb24tcmlmZnMtaW50by1hLWZ1bGx5LXJlYWxpemVkLWFsYnVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Jam Band Umphrey's McGee Turned Concert Walk-On Riffs Into A Fully Realized Album,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidlindquist/2021/09/18/how-jam-band-umphreys-mcgee-turned-concert-walk-on-riffs-into-a-fully-realized-album/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkbGluZHF1aXN0LzIwMjEvMDkvMTgvaG93LWphbS1iYW5kLXVtcGhyZXlzLW1jZ2VlLXR1cm5lZC1jb25jZXJ0LXdhbGstb24tcmlmZnMtaW50by1hLWZ1bGx5LXJlYWxpemVkLWFsYnVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raW5nNS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2RlYWRseS1jb2xsaXNpb24td2l0aC10cmVlLWZpdmUtdGVlbmFnZXJzLWh1cnQtZm9ya3MtY2xhbGxhbS1jb3VudHktd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi8yODEtNzNkZmY3YzUtNGQ4My00MjU3LTg4MTYtMTkzOWUxMDZjMTAy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Everybody knows everybody': Forks community shaken by crash that killed 3 teens injured 2,"Clallam County Sheriff officials said it appears the teens were on their way back from a football game.

FORKS Wash. — The community of Forks Wash. is grappling with the tragic death of three teenagers and two others who were hurt after their vehicle collided with a tree early Saturday morning. Speed and alcohol appear to be the contributing factors according to authorities.

The crash happened just after 4 a.m. Saturday Sept. 18 on mile five of the Sitkum-Solduc Road according to officials with the Clallam County Sheriff's Office.

Two 18-year-old males identified Monday by sheriff officials as the driver Jaden Lohrengel and front seat passenger Tyler Ellis died at the scene officials confirmed to KING 5.

Three other teenagers in the vehicle were airlifted to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle for treatment. A 17-year-old female who sheriff officials identified to KING 5 as Shaiyann Cummins died at the hospital.

The two 19-year-olds a male and female identified Monday by sheriff officials as Ariel Sandoval and Gyovanna Morales remain at Harborview receiving treatment. Sandoval is in serious condition as of Monday and Morales is in satisfactory condition according to a hospital spokesperson.

The preliminary investigation revealed the vehicle left the roadway going at least 70 miles an hour and struck a tree. It doesn't appear anyone hit the brakes and no other vehicles were involved officials said.

Clallam County Sheriff Sgt. John Hollis said people living nearby heard what they thought was a tree coming down and went to investigate.

""It took about 45 minutes for them to decide to go down there to see if the tree was viable for cutting and discovered the wreck"" said Hollis. ""Potentially could've been there for about 45 minutes.""

Hollis told KING 5 that deputies found open containers of alcohol in the vehicle and that it appears the teens were coming home from a high school football game.

""There was a big out-of-town football game that night. So it was about the right timing to come back and maybe celebrate or do whatever kids do after a big football game that's out of town"" said Hollis.

Counselors were on hand at Forks High School Monday as students learned of their classmate's deaths.

Being a small community Hollis said the entire town is feeling this loss.

""You can't go to the store without someone knowing you. Everybody knows everybody. It's a tough deal"" said Hollis.

Arsenal claimed their second win of the season - a 1-0 success at Turf Morr against Burnley - courtesy of wonderful a Martin Odeegard freekick that belied an Arsenal performance ran hard but failed to click.

There was half an hour gone when Ashley Westwood toppled over a galloping Bukayo Saka on the edge of the box. Odegaard stepped up and whisked a shot – all spin and swirl – into the top left-hand corner.

It was the first moment of quality in a game that hustled and bustled but quickly fell into a pattern of placid Arsenal possession and a well-shaped Burnley defence that was happy for Thomas Partey and co to pass in front of them.

Moments after the goal Burnley striker Ashley Barnes passed up the chance to level when the ball fell to him in the Arsenal box but it was swept off his toe when he was shaping to shoot.

But it was only with the introduction of new signing Maxwel Cornet that Burnley posed a real threat and it was the 24-year-old's running that opened up the space for Matej Vydra to break clear and force referee Anthony Taylor and his VAR staff into a decision.

Vydra looked to have been clipped by the onrushing Aaron Ramsdale but contact was minimal and VAR reversed the on-pitch decision. Although reinvigorated by the furore surrounding the non-penalty the Clarets struggled to create any meaningful chances and Arsenal looked comfortable in the closing stages.

The Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has doubled his points tally for the season - moving up from 17th to 12th - but his side will need better performances against better opposition. Meanwhile the result means Dyche and Burnley still await their first Premier League win of 2020-21 and remain second from bottom on one point.

TALKING POINT - A significant improvement but sterner tests to come for Arsenal

This was far from Arsenal’s best performance under Arteta but it marks a significant improvement from the start of the season. The 22-year-old Odegaard was helped in shoring up the midfield by the return of Thomas Partey and Arsenal will hope they have again found some balance in that area of the pitch.

But despite improvements Arteta’s men looked short of ideas and confidence going forward. The passing was ponderous and they never looked like breaking down Burnley consistently. Arteta and Arsenal fans will only be interested in the results at this point but sterner tests will come.

MAN OF THE MATCH – MARTIN ODEGAARD

On top of becoming Arsenal’s second goal scorer with an accomplished free kick the summer signing from Real Madrid ran the show in Midfield. While balls bounced off his team-mates he calmly kept possession and stole a few yards from a feisty Burnley midfield.

KEY MOMENTS

29’ GOAL​! Martin Odegaard stands over the ball and then whisks it - all swirl and placement - into the goal to Pope's right. The keeper was nowhere near. That was a beautiful freekick.

59’ Maxwel Cornet almost makes an immediate impact with a first time shot towards the top corner of Arsenal's goal. The crowd go up but Ramsdale was probably comfortable.

69’ NO PENALTY! VAR decides that there was no contact between Ramsdale and Vydra. Burnley fans will disagree. Vydra will say he was avoiding injury otherwise he risks looking a little silly.

Need a big piece of art to spice up your living room? We have just the thing. This factory-built 1:1 scale model of a Porsche 919 Hybrid LMP1 race car is coming up for auction in October via RM Sotheby's. It could be your only chance to own such an accurate representation of the car that dominated Le Mans from 2015 to 2017.

Porsche built a total of 13 full-scale 919 replicas for display and promotional purposes according to RM Sotheby's. The bodies are made from fiberglass and sit on a steel frame but still use real Michelin racing slicks to roll around. The 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder hybrid drivetrain from the real 919 is absent from this car meaning you'll have to push it by hand to get it anywhere.

RM says Porsche used original CAD modeling data from the design team to build these models which is why they look so real. This particular example uses a Porsche Intelligent Design livery similar to the one used on the 919 driven to overall victory in 2015 by Earl Bamber Nick Tandy and Nico Hülkenberg.

The 1:1 scale model shown above is set to be auctioned off by RM Sotheby's at its Open Roads event in Miami happening October 6-13 2021. The auction house doesn't list a price range but considering it was built by the factory and only 13 exist we're betting it won't be cheap.

No association was found between TNF inhibitors and other cancer sites. The study was published in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention.

The authors explained that TNF is highly expressed in the joint tissue of patients with RA making it an attractive target for drug developers. TNF inhibitors have been shown effective at controlling RA and preventing progressive joint damage but they also appear to have immunosuppressive effects that some fear might lead to a higher risk of certain cancers particularly those with infectious or immune-related etiologies they said.

“This issue is especially pertinent for lymphomas and lung cancer because RA patients already have an increased risk of these cancers compared to the general population likely related to RA disease activity and chronic immune stimulation” the authors wrote.

In hopes of better understanding and quantifying the potential for excess cancer risk among patients with RA who take TNF inhibitors the authors consulted the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Medicare database which links data from 18 central cancer registries to data from Medicare. They sought to identify patients with a first cancer diagnosis between the ages of 66 and 99 during 2007 to 2015. A control group was created by a random sample of 5% of cancer-free Medicare beneficiaries from matching years. Patients with RA were identified from within those groups.

A total of 10263 patients with a first cancer diagnosis were identified and compared with 30475 cancer-free controls.

An analysis of Medicare Part B and Part D claims showed that 16.2% of controls overall were exposed to TNF inhibitors. Among patients with cancer the percentage exposed to TNF inhibitors ranged from 12.8% to 33.7% depending on the cancer site.

Logistic regression showed TNF inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.32; 95% CI 1.06-1.63) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aOR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06-1.56). More specifically the data suggested follicular lymphoma risk was much higher among patients with a history of TNF inhibitor exposure (aOR 2.63; 95% CI 1.63-4.24).

No heightened risk was found for basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma or other non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes the investigators said.

They noted that the relationship between TNF inhibitors and cancer is complex and that the existing literature is mixed adding they believe this is the first sizable study to find a greater risk of follicular lymphoma among patients who had taken TNF inhibitors.

The authors said their study had positive findings in showing there does not appear to be a heightened risk of cancers linked with immunosuppression such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and human papillomavirus–associated cancers. Although the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer was relatively small the authors said patients on TNF inhibitors should receive regular skin cancer screenings and counseling on how to protect themselves from excess sun exposure.

Their conclusion bears out that their findings about follicular lymphoma may help explain the association between lymphoma and TNF inhibitors reported in this and other studies.

“Although these findings may have an immune explanation the lack of strong immunosuppression in RA patients treated with TNF [inhibitors] and the pattern of association with cancer suggests that other mechanisms could underlie this increased risk” they said.

Taylor-Joy spoke to ELLE earlier this year about how acting saved her after a childhood of being bullied. “It just really pushed me” she said. “Much the same way as Beth needed chess I needed acting. I needed to believe in a place where I could be valued and appreciated and actually have something to contribute rather than constantly feeling like ‘What is wrong with me and why do I not fit in?’”

She also weighed in on the idea of a second season of The Queen's Gambit and whether she'd do it. “It would be silly of me to go ‘There’s never going to be a second series’ and then I’m 40 and Scott’s like ‘Yo how do you feel about this? You want to go back?’” she said. When imagining what's next for her character Beth she said “I hope she starts doing things for her own enjoyment.

McNealy on top at Napa

Maverick McNealy overcame three consecutive bogeys and holed out from 74 yards for eagle on the last for an 8-under 64 and the second-round lead Friday in the Fortinet Championship in Napa Calif. Winless in 66 career starts on the PGA Tour McNealy had nine birdies -- one from a greenside bunker to offset his stumbles and get to 12 under at Silverado Resort and Spa. Beau Hossler matched McNealy's 64 to get to 6 under with Mito Pereira (67). Three others including tour rookie of the year Will Zalatoris (67) were 9 under. First-round leader Chez Reavie barely made the cut after a round of 75 that included five bogeys and a double bogey left him eight strokes behind. Phil Mickelson (69) was seven back at 5 under. McNealy who missed the cut here a year ago began the day three shots off the pace after an opening 68 but made that up quickly with birdies on three of his first four holes. Austin Cook (Jonesboro Arkansas Razorbacks) is tied for 24th. Cook shot a 71 on Friday and is at 5-under for the tournament. Taylor Moore (Razorbacks) shot a 73 on Friday and missed the cut with a 3-over 147. Andrew Landry (Razorbacks) missed the cut after turning in a 77 for the second day in a row to finish at 10-over.

Ko in front in Portland

Jin Young Ko shot a 5-under 67 on Friday to take the second-round lead in the Cambia Portland Classic. The second-ranked South Korean star needed only 23 putts in her morning round making six birdies and a bogey to reach 8-under 136 at hilly windy and tricky Oregon Golf Club in West Linn Ore. Gemma Dryburgh of Scotland was a stroke back after a 69. Carlota Ciganda the only member of the winning European Solheim Cup team in the field had a 71 to get to 5 under. For University of Arkansas golfer Alana Uriell shot a 66 on Friday and is tied for fourth at 4-under for the tournament. Stacy Lewis (Razorbacks) missed the cut at 7-over. Maria Fassi (Razorbacks) missed the cut at 8-over.

Two share Champions lead

K.J. Choi closed eagle-birdie-birdie for a 7-under 63 and share of the first-round lead with Darren Clarke in the PGA Tour Champions' Stanford International in Sioux Falls S.D. Choi had a bogey-free round at Minnehaha Country Club. The 51-year-old South Korean player won eight times on the PGA Tour. Clarke the 53-year-old major champion from Northern Ireland also finished with a birdie on the par-4 18th. He has two victories this season the TimberTech Championship in November and Mitsubishi Electric Championship in January. Ken Duke (Arkadelphia Henderson State) is tied for 11th after turning in a 4-under 66. John Daly (Dardanelle Razorbacks) is at 2-under 68. Glen Day (Little Rock) fired an even-par 70.

Broberg leads Dutch Open

Kristoffer Broberg of Sweden shot 8-under 64 to take a one-stroke lead after the second round of the Dutch Open on Friday. The 772nd-ranked Broberg rolled in a 12-foot putt at his last hole -- No. 9 after starting at the 10th -- for his ninth birdie of the round to set a course record at the Bernardus club in Cromvoirt. Broberg's only win on the European Tour came six years ago at the BMW Masters in China. Marcus Helligkilde and Thomas Detry both shot 66 and were tied for second place. Former University of Central Arkansas golfer Pep Angles missed the cut finishing with a 5-over 149.

MOTOR SPORTS

Allmendinger slides to victory

AJ Allmendinger slid sideways across the Bristol Motor Speedway finish line to edge rival Austin Cindric for both the Friday night win and the NASCAR Xfinity Series regular-season championship. The race was Cindric's to win and the reigning Xfinity champion was four laps away from a second consecutive regular-season title and a healthy lead for the start of the playoffs. Instead a late caution gave Allmendinger a shot to steal a sixth win from Cindric and continue his own fairytale season. The rivals crashed each other as the cars crossed the finish line and Allmendinger's fourth win of the season was awarded because his Chevrolet was sliding ahead of Cindric's under the checkered flag. The wreck was a wild way to send the Xfinity Series into the playoffs. Allmendinger earned a shot at the win when Justin Allgaier spun Sam Mayer with four laps remaining in regulation.

Teenager wins Trucks race

Chandler Smith bumped past Sheldon Creed on a late restart Thursday night at Bristol Motor Speedway and held on for his first NASCAR Trucks Series victory and a spot in the second round of the playoffs. The 19-year-old Georgia driver challenged Creed on the inside off a restart with five laps left with the No. 18 Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota making contact with Creed that left the defending series champion with a cut left rear tire. Creed ended up two laps down in 19th after leading 189 of the 200 laps on the half-mile oval. Smith advanced to the second round of eight drivers with Todd Gilliland and Austin Hill eliminated.

FOOTBALL

College HOF tackle dies

Roger Brown a College Football Hall of Famer and six-time Pro Bowl selection with the Detroit Lions and Los Angeles Rams has died. He was 84. The Lions and College Football Hall of Fame announced his death on Friday. The Lions said a member of Brown's family confirmed the death. No cause was given. Brown played 10 years in the NFL. He was selected in the fourth round of the 1960 draft by Detroit. In his seven seasons with the Lions Brown went to the Pro Bowl five times (1962-66) and was an All-Pro selection in 1962 and '63. He started in 124 of the 138 games he played. Brown's most memorable game with Detroit was on Thanksgiving Day in 1962 against Green Bay when he sacked Hall of Fame quarterback Bart Starr seven times. The Lions had 11 sacks in that game which remains a franchise record.

Pele in 'semi-intensive' care

Brazilian soccer great Pele ""took a little step back"" in his recovery from surgery to remove a tumor from his colon but he is ""recovering well"" at a Sao Paulo hospital his daughter Kely Nascimento said Friday. However the Albert Einstein hospital said the 80-year-old Edson Arantes do Nascimento had returned to intensive care after ""a brief breathing instability"" Thursday night. Pele was currently stable in ""semi-intensive"" care the hospital said and he ""continues recovering."" It did not give further details. The hospital had not previously issued a new statement on Pele's health since Tuesday when he was removed from intensive care.

Pulisic could miss qualifier

The British government is keeping Panama on its red list which means the United States may have to play without star Christian Pulisic and several other U.K.-based players for its World Cup qualifier at the Central American nation on Oct. 10. The U.S. plays at Panama between home matches against Jamaica on Oct. 7 at Austin Texas and vs. Costa Rica on Oct. 13 at Columbus Ohio. Britain requires anyone visiting a nation on its red list to quarantine upon arrival in England for 10 days. An Oct. 10 match in Panama followed by the game in Columbus would rule out Pulisic from playing for Chelsea in its Premier League match at Brentford on Oct. 16 and a home Champions League game against Malmo on Oct. 20. U.S. Coach Gregg Berhalter could be forced to leave Pulisic and other British-based players in the U.S. for training between the two qualifiers which may cause Berhalter to bring a larger group to camp. Pulisic was among five England-based players on the U.S. roster for the opening three qualifiers in September: a 0-0 draw at El Salvador a 1-1 home draw against Canada and a 4-1 win at Honduras.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMTkvdXMvbmFzaHZpbGxlLXBhcnR5LXZlaGljbGVzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In the Heart of Nashville Rolling Parties Rage at Every Stoplight (Published 2021),"NASHVILLE — The John Deere tractor pulled onto Broadway and rumbled into the madness.

On a Friday night in the heart of Nashville as crowds and music spilled from packed clubs it lumbered along at 5 miles per hour tugging a canopied trailer with flashing lights and a group of friends from Denver sipping drinks and dancing to Shania Twain.

It wasn’t especially conspicuous. The Big Green Tractor as it’s called passed an open-air school bus crammed with partiers and then another and another. It also crept beside a vehicle with women leaning over a railing in tank tops printed with the slogan “Let’s Get Nashty!”

The tractor hadn’t even made it a mile.

“It’s the Wild West out here” Ronee Heatherly said from her perch behind the bar of the Big Green Tractor where she served variously as safety monitor bartender D.J. photographer tour guide and taunter of ride-share drivers blocking the tractor’s path. (She blasted the Ludacris song “Move” as she stared them down.)

As Nashville has cemented its reputation as a destination for getaways and bachelorette trips party vehicles have proliferated promising a rollicking good time and quite a stage to see and be seen while exploring the city.

View the current offers here.

Delta is my favorite domestic airline and American Express Membership Rewards are my favorite transferable points.

Coincidentally Amex and Delta are 1:1 transfer partners. So I can transfer points from my favorite credit cards to my favorite airline. This transfer isn't usually recommended though — Delta SkyMiles have been continuously devalued and are worth just 1.1 cents each per TPG's valuations. This is 0.9 cents lower than Amex's 2-cents-per-point valuation. And in my experience it's hard to get a higher value from Delta SkyMiles.

That said there are some exceptions to this rule. I've personally achieved high redemption values from Delta SkyMiles that warrant transferring points from Amex. These opportunities are few and far between but are still possible if you know where to look.

So in this article I'll show you times that it makes sense to transfer Amex Membership Rewards points to Delta SkyMiles. Some of these redemptions are of niche use while others have a wider appeal. That said all have the potential to stretch the value you obtain from your Membership Rewards points.

Before we start though always compare pricing with other airlines and transfer partners. Membership Rewards has a slew of different airline partners so you may get a better deal depending on the flight you're booking and when you book it.

Now let's dive in!

Book economy flights to Europe

One good way to use Delta SkyMiles is to book economy flights to Europe.

Generally you can book these flights for roughly 25000 SkyMiles one-way with minimal taxes and fees. Remember though SkyMiles awards are priced dynamically. So there's no guarantee that this price will be the same when you go to book. Prices change by day and route so some days are more expensive than others.

For example one-way flights from New York-JFK to Paris (CDG) consistently price at 25000 SkyMiles and just $5.60 in taxes throughout most of next year. Likewise round-trip flights price at just 50000 SkyMiles and $90.05 in taxes and fees.

You can often find reasonable pricing on connecting tickets too. For example you can book a round-trip economy ticket from Charlotte (CLT) to Amsterdam (AMS) via New York-JFK for 58000 SkyMiles and $71.85.

You may not always find excellent U.S.-to-Europe deals with SkyMiles but it's worth a look when booking a trip. You may be able to find a redemption that beats other Membership Rewards transfer partners especially on connecting flights.

Fly to Mexico on the cheap

Flights to Mexico are another solid SkyMiles redemption. Delta and Aeromexico are SkyTeam partners so you can use your SkyMiles to book flights operated by Mexico's largest airline. Between Aeromexico and Delta you can book flights on several different routes to Mexico.

For example you can book round-trip business-class flights from New York-JFK to Mexico City (MEX) for 89000 miles and $114 in early February. These same flights cost $1235 so while it's not the best redemption value at 1.26 cents per point you save some cash and have a comfortable nonstop flight.

(Screenshot courtesy of delta.com)

You can book economy flights to smaller Mexican cities for similar prices. This Delta itinerary from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Guadalajara (GDL) via Atlanta (ATL) costs 12000 SkyMiles and $115 round-trip. The same flights cost $397 so you're getting over 2.3 cents per point in value.

Delta often runs SkyMiles flash deals that offer limited-time discounts on award travel. In the past we've seen amazing deals like round-trip economy flights to Europe for 16000 SkyMiles. These sales are generally limited to specific city pairs and only last for a few days at a time. Keep an eye on Delta's flash deals page for the latest sales.

Low-cost domestic award tickets

My favorite way to redeem SkyMiles is by booking last-minute low-cost domestic award tickets.

Booking expensive last-minute and holiday flights with SkyMiles can save you a considerable chunk of change — even if it doesn't yield the highest cent-per-point value.

Again Delta prices awards dynamically so pricing varies by day and route. That said the airline is known to discount its domestic award tickets between non-hub cities that connect in Delta hubs like Atlanta (ATL) Detroit (DTW) and New York-JFK.

Check out these flights from Moline Illinois (MLI) to Nashville (BNA) via Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) and Atlanta (ATL). A round-trip ticket in Main Cabin economy costs just 15000 SkyMiles and $11.20 in taxes and fees. The same ticket costs $249 so you're getting just under 1.6 cents per point in value.

(Screenshot courtesy of delta.com)

There are solid deals to be had on flights between major cities too. I fly from New York (LGA/JFK) to Chicago O'Hare (ORD) a few times a year to visit family and often book with SkyMiles. You can find tickets for as low as 5000 SkyMiles one-way in basic economy with the option to book standard economy for an extra 2000 SkyMiles.

(Screenshot courtesy of delta.com)

These may not be the most exciting redemptions but they're worth a look if you need to take an expensive domestic flight. Plus these redemptions can save you a nice chunk of change if you take domestic flights frequently.

Last-minute intra-Europe award tickets

Use your SkyMiles to book intra-Europe award tickets on your next European adventure. (Photo by hanohiki/Shutterstock)

If you're based in Europe or are taking a multistop tour of the region you may want to use SkyMiles to book your intra-Europe flights.

Intra-Europe flights price at 10000 SkyMiles one-way in economy or 25000 in business class — even at the last minute. For example this KLM flight from Amsterdam (AMS) to Paris (CDG) in less than two weeks costs 10000 SkyMiles and roughly $45 in taxes and fees. The same last-minute ticket costs $228 giving you 1.83 cents per point in value.

(Screenshot courtesy of delta.com)

Alternatively this one-way business-class flight from Paris (CDG) to Kyiv Ukraine (KBP) costs 25000 SkyMiles and $133 after currency conversion. You'll pay $796 for the same business-class flight giving you over 2.6 cents per point in value.

(Screenshot courtesy of delta.com)

Business-class pricing on flights from Europe to Israel is reasonable too. London Heathrow (LHR) to Tel Aviv (TLV) in Virgin Atlantic Upper Class prices out at just 42500 SkyMiles and $379. A paid ticket on this route costs $1085 at the time of writing this article for roughly 1.7 cents per point in value.

Bottom line

Delta SkyMiles aren't the most valuable points-and-miles currency out there. But you can get solid redemption value from the Delta SkyMiles program if you know where to look.

In this post I showed multiple times it makes sense to transfer your Membership Rewards to SkyMiles. While it may seem like you're devaluing your points when making this transfer you can often get a great value — even when compared to other Amex transfer partners.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvYWlyY3JhZnQtcmV0cm9maXQtbWFya2V0LWlmYy1zeXN0ZW0taW5zdGFsbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aircraft retrofit market readies for new IFC system installs,"A wave of new inflight connectivity system installations is forthcoming as airlines prepare to replace legacy kit with next-gen hardware and in some instances adopt new aero ISPs as they emerge from the COVID-19 crisis.

The latest indicator that industry is readying for IFC retrofits comes from Panasonic Avionics which recently announced it has tapped ThinKom Solutions to develop a new-design Ku-band VICTS antenna for Panasonic’s global IFC solution with plans to offer it for both linefit and retrofit installations in 2023.

“Our new antenna offering with ThinKom is an integral part of our network and will allow airlines to access both current and future satellite constellations” explained Panasonic Avionics vice president of inflight connectivity solutions Jeff Sare.

Earlier this year Sare hinted that the firm was gravitating towards a hybrid antenna design to accommodate GEO and LEO-powered transmissions telling RGN that in the context of talking to LEO satellites in the future “other current technologies that are mechanically steered but closer to the ESA design are probably very viable mid-term technologies…” ThinKom’s ThinAir-branded VICTS is a mechanically steered phased array antenna.

In announcing a formal arrangement with ThinKom Panasonic seems to be effectively conceding that its traditional gimballed antenna solution – which it assembles at its Lake Forest California facility – is yesterday’s news. The arrangement also underscores that low-latency LEO networks will play an increasingly important role in IFC (Panasonic even preserved some of its XTS capital for LEOs).

Asked by RGN if the newly designed antenna will follow the ARINC 792 standard for nextgen antenna installs on brand new aircraft – and if we’re right in assuming it will easily slot into the current ARINC 791 footprint on aircraft currently fitted with Panasonic’s antenna – ThinKom CTO Bill Milroy said:

Regarding the details of the Radome Fairing and Adapter Plate for our new ThinAir® design Panasonic chose to retain responsibility for those. However I can tell you that the integrated assembly will be 791-compliant ready for both retrofit and linefit.

Panasonic has spent many years — and plenty of money — to interface with airframers’ IP and obtain linefit offerability across most commercial types so its pipeline to Boeing and Airbus must be seen as a boon for ThinKom.

But on the retrofit front alone the opportunity could be substantial. According to Panasonic over 2300 aircraft are now connected to its global communications network.

Retrofit specialists prepare

Lufthansa Technik is among the firms readying for the retrofit wave. (Incidentally the MRO giant has through the years fitted a sizeable number of aircraft with Panasonic’s legacy antenna hardware including for Lufthansa and others. It remains to be seen if Lufthansa will adopt Panasonic’s new Ku antenna from ThinKom.)

“Rip & replace is a topic gaining more and more airlines and lessors’ attention (slightly slowed due to COVID)” Lufthansa Technik head of connectivity solutions Lukas Bucher told RGN broadly in reference to the anticipated trend.

“Once airlines have made it past the dark days have settled the fleet setup and are on a positive trend they will continue with upgrades. That requires enhanced STC solutions which respect the IP situation of a given constellation (former IFC STC provider new IFC STC provider airline). Some of the ongoing IAMA standardization activities will support the future ease of such transitions.”

Indeed IAMA — the Independent Aircraft Modifier Alliance which boasts Lufthansa Technik EAD Aerospace Etihad Airways Engineering Envoy Aerospace Collins Aerospace CarlisleIT and others as founding members – is a growing force in the industry. It recently welcomed Qantas to its list of subscribers which share a common desire to ensure an open and transparent retrofit market through STCs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vdW5pdGVkLWFpcmxpbmVzLWpvaW5zLWRlbHRhLW9uLW5pZ2VyaWEtdXMtcm91dGVzL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vdW5pdGVkLWFpcmxpbmVzLWpvaW5zLWRlbHRhLW9uLW5pZ2VyaWEtdXMtcm91dGVzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Airlines joins Delta on Nigeria-US routes,"United States carrier United Airlines says it will operate the first-ever nonstop flight between Washington D.C and Lagos Nigeria and offer more flights between the US capital and Africa than any other carrier.

United is joining another American carrier Delta Airlines which has been flying the Nigeria-US routes in the last 14 years.

The Houston-based United had stopped flights to Lagos about five years ago following exchange rate crisis in Nigeria and a global downturn in the oil market.

According to United the new service between Washington DC and Lagos Nigeria will begin November 29 2021 subject to government approval.

The airline said it would operate three weekly flights connecting the US capital to Nigeria’s largest city which is also the top western African destination for US-based travellers.

The carrier said tickets would be available for sale on its website app this weekend.

The statement quoted the United Airlines Vice President International Network and Alliances Patrick Quayle “This new flight to Lagos has been highly anticipated by our customers and offers the first ever nonstop service between Washington DC and Nigeria as well as convenient one-stop connections to over 80 destinations throughout the Americas including Houston and Chicago” said

“On behalf of all of United we’d like to offer our sincere thanks to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority and U.S. Department of Transportation for supporting our plans to provide this service.”

“We are honored to work with our partners at United Airlines to welcome their second nonstop connection from Dulles International to the African continent” said Carl Schultz acting vice president of airline business development at the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. “Lagos joins nearly 50 other nonstop international destinations currently served by the National Capital Region’s gateway to the world.”

program gives subsidies to airlines serving remote cities. Around $315 million is being spent in 2021 for Lower 48 cities given largely to the country's smallest airlines.

EAS cities are highly sought after and communities can be very particular with who serves them.

Beckley West Virginia; Burlington Iowa; and Clovis New Mexico are among the countless US cities that have been overlooked and underserved by America's largest airlines. There's simply not enough consistent demand to make them profitable.

But one airline's money-losing route can be another's profit-maker. In fact a niche industry of regional airlines seeks out these cities and relies on the US government to help turn a profit when flying to them.

The Department of Transportation 's Essential Air Service program incentivizes airlines to serve more than 100 cities American cities. More than $315 million in yearly contracts is doled out in the Lower 48 alone and nearly $27 million is given in Alaska.

Any airline can submit a bid to serve EAS cities but regional carriers have cornered the market. The top EAS airlines in the US include SkyWest Airlines Cape Air  Boutique Air  Southern Air Express and Denver Air Connection according to the DOT's most recent data.

When considering bids the DOT factors in items including the service reliability of the airline connectivity to larger airlines opinions of the community being served and the cost of the subsidy. The cheapest bid doesn't always win the contract nor does the one with the most community support.

In the case of Rutland Vermont the DOT chose Cape Air to serve the city with an annual subsidy of $1959579 for the first year rising to $2018366 the next. Cape Air's option won out over a cheaper Boutique Air option in part because of a lack of community support for the latter airline.

But what the community gives the community can also take away. San Francisco-based Boutique Air was forced out of Ironwood Michigan for example after its aircraft suffered two incidents on flights from the city.

The airport board voted to ""seek a new air carrier"" according to a government filing and three airlines - Air Choice One Southern Air Express and Denver Air Connection - all submitted multi-million-dollar bids to take Boutique Air's place.

Major US airlines can also advocate in support of their regional airline partners as ease of connections in major airports can be crucial in securing a contract. Some major airlines including American do bid for EAS routes themselves but are a small percentage of the program as of the most recent DOT tally in July.

The unique airlines operating these flights often use unique aircraft including older models that are cheaper to operate. Aircraft can be more than 40 years old such is the case with some of Cape Air's fleet of Cessna 402C aircraft.

Other airlines including Boutique Air use private aircraft intended to transport the wealthy. ""Some airlines do feel more like a private [flight]"" Joey Gerardi an aviation writer who has taken more than 40 EAS flights and has seen the best and worst of the program told Insider.

Most EAS flights that he's taken have been bare-bones with no in-flight entertainment or even a flight attendant.

""A lot of Essential Air Service carriers don't have much service at all and that's just because of the size of the plane"" Gerardi said adding that some offer special treats like a snack basket of full-size candy bars.

Alaska sees a lot of EAS flights given the remote nature of the state's cities and Alaska Airlines is a prominent carrier using its fleet of Boeing and Embraer aircraft. On those flights the experience may be indistinguishable from a standard Alaska Airlines flight.

But the type of aircraft used can be a point of contention for communities. Michigan resident Dennis Lennox complained in a letter to the DOT about SkyWest's Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft operating daily flights between Detroit and Pellston Michigan under the Delta Connection brand.

""This aircraft has outlived its viability is regularly in bad condition and provides an unacceptably uncomfortable in-flight experience for passengers even on a flight of only 45 minutes to 1 hour in duration"" Lennox wrote estimating that 40% of the flight he's booked on the aircraft have been delayed or canceled.

And with millions in government subsidies these airlines don't have to worry about filling every seat and they often don't.

""At least 80% of the EAS flights I've been on have five or fewer people"" Gerardi said."

The credit card company last month froze donations to the Alliance for Global Justice (AFGJ) which provides funding to the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network a group that Israel labeled a terrorist organization earlier this year the Washington Free Beacon first reported.

AMAZON GOOGLE APPLE EMPLOYEES VOICE SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIANS

Israeli officials declared in February that Samidoun a pro-Boycott Divestment Sanctions group that helps free Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons acts abroad on the behalf of the U.S.-designated terrorist group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).

Discover has not said why it severed ties with AFGJ but the decision came after the Zachor Legal Institute pressured the company to do so according to email correspondence shared with Fox News.

Zachor founder Marc Greendorfer praised the move by Discover but slammed other major credit card companies for not following suit.

Mastercard Visa and American Express began blocking donations to Samidoun in January 2020 but they currently still allow donations to AFGJ which lets people donate to Samidoun through its website the Free Beacon noted.

""There are a number of federal laws that prohibit funding for terror connected organizations and we reached out to the four credit card companies (AmEx Visa and MasterCard along with Discover) that had been used by the Alliance for Global Justice for the benefit of Samidoun"" Greendorfer told Fox News in a statement.

""What surprised us is that only Discover seemed to understand the law and the risks it faced for violating the law"" he continued. ""We appreciate that Discover has done the right thing to shut off terror funding in this case but we can’t believe that the other three companies didn’t respond and didn’t apparently shut down funding to Samidoun.""

DieHard. Craftsman. Discover Card. Allstate Insurance. This collection of iconic if somewhat disparate brands all share a common ancestor.

These (and more) were created by a certified American business pioneer: Sears.

With a deep sense of nostalgia we now mark the closing of the last Sears store in the state where it all began: Illinois. As digital transformation remakes the retail map there’s something oddly appropriate about Sears’ current owner Transform SR Brands LLC or Transformco for short.

Transformco just announced plans to shutter its last Illinois Sears store located in the Woodfield Mall just about 50 miles from where Founder Richard Sears and partners first opened shop back in 1893. As CNBC reported on Thursday (Sept. 16) the Woodfield Mall store will go dark on Nov. 14 leaving Sears with no presence where it all began a century ago.

Still operating are a handful of Sears and Kmart locations throughout the U.S. as well as Sears.com Transformco’s ShopYourWay.com site (a “social shopping destination” and rewards program) as well as the leading product repair provider Sears Home Services.

Sears’ retail troubles are by no means breaking news. As Business Insider observed “Sears was once the world’s largest retailer reporting billions of dollars in profits. With a headquarters located in the Sears Tower once the tallest building in the world.” Not long ago one could find a copy of the Sears catalog in a preponderance of U.S. households. Talk about ubiquity.

But after a series of strategic missteps and the invention of a thing we like to call the internet all of that changed and Sears declared bankruptcy in 2018. It’s looked like a fait accompli ever since.

Right now Sears’ history is perhaps more interesting than its future. Inheritors like Amazon and Walmart may be able to take lessons from the fate of an absolute original of American retail.

Seared Into Payments History

From a payments perspective talking about Sears is a stroll down financial memory lane.

If the name Dean Witter Reynolds sounds familiar that makes sense. At one time the biggest retail brokerage on Wall Street Sears acquired the operation in 1981 as part of the grand plan for the Sears Financial Services Network which at one time also included Coldwell Banker real estate.

In what some saw as the company straying from its sweet spot in mixed-merchandise department stores Sears then launched The Discover Card in 1986. That foresighted financial instrument was the first among credit cards to offer cash rewards and no annual fees.

Sears’ foray into finance was not to last however — in 1993 the Dean Witter Discover & Co. unit merged with Morgan Stanley and today is giant Discover Financial Services.

Today there’s nothing unusual about retail giants issuing branded credit cards. Personal finance firm NerdWallet recently compared the relative strengths of the Walmart Rewards Mastercard versus rivals — namely the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card. Business is booming.

Too bad Sears didn’t make the great digital shift. We might be looking at a considerably different retail and payments landscape had it been equipped differently.

Learning from the Past at Digital Speed

Fast-forward to how things are now and the same market dynamics are still at work.

A recent PYMNTS article headlined “Amazon’s Department Store Plans May Be Death Knell for Walmart’s Retail Lead” sounds ominous. Does the Sears story have any bearing? Perhaps.

See also: Amazon’s Department Store Plans May Be Death Knell For Walmart’s Retail Lead

As the article noted: “In each category where Amazon has taken the lead from Walmart it has done so by slowly and steadily chipping away at Walmart’s lead with its ever-growing digital business.” It sounds eerily like analysts recalling the big force that really took down Sears: Walmart.

Hedge fund manager Edward Lampert bought Sears then Kmart looking for a magic bullet to compete with Walmart as its big-box concept captured the imagination of U.S. consumers much as the internet and Amazon’s online marketplace have done today.

ndgit develops End-to-End Open Finance Tools

Traditional banking services maintain restricted access to customers’ financial data for both customers and third-party providers (TPPs) that are essential in creating financial products and services. Due to this governments now regulate open banking services that enable data sharing and collaboration with FinTech companies. This further facilitates the transition to a secure open finance ecosystem that provides greater transparency and convenience for availing investments lending and mortgages.

ndgit is a German startup that offers an open finance Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform. The application programming interface (API) management platform combines tools for identity management microservice security and analytics. The platform functions as a middleware for financial services to enable fast and secure rollouts thereby enabling efficient collaboration with banks for financial and insurance companies. ndgit leverages its open finance platform to offer banking-as-a-service ecosystem banking digital lending and wealth management.

Konsentus enables TPP Verification

Conventional banking provides minimal transparency and flexibility to monitor financial transactions and activities. At the same time advancements in online banking offer real-time cash flow details to customers. However FinTech companies and third-party providers need full access to customers’ financial data to further enhance their services. This is why startups develop open finance tools that offer end-to-end visibility into customer activities. In addition authorities devise regulations to standardize this process and ensure the safety of sensitive information Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) for example.

UK-based startup Konsentus develops Konsentus Verify a SaaS platform for third-party verification. The startup identifies TPPs using electronic IDentification Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS) certificates. If there are any data inconsistencies it reports suspicious activity to issuers. Additionally Konsentus Verify checks the regulatory compliance of the TPPs with the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) data. Thus it allows financial institutions API aggregators and technology service providers to ensure the safety of their customer information.

faire.ai advances Credit Automation

Traditional credit scoring systems are static and this approach denies loans to borrowers with a weak or nonexistent credit history. Open finance facilitates data sharing between banks and service providers especially non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). They use data analytics and machine learning (ML) to develop an alternative credit scoring system that utilizes the overall financial activities of customers to predict their credit scores increasing the customer base.

faire.ai is an Italian startup that provides AI-based credit automation for banks and financial institutions. The startup uses open banking to retrieve customers’ data and transaction history as well as applies artificial intelligence to predict their spending behavior. This allows faire.ai to offer retail credit score-as-a-service analyze cash flow and quantify loan eligibility. It further provides a loan management system that enables instant credit approval and disbursement.

truID provides Open Finance Integration

Traditional banking lacks the ability to personalize its financial products and services for customer requirements mainly because of the conventional credit scoring system. On the contrary open finance offers extended visibility into customer activities allowing retailers and TPPs to personalize their products and services. This forces major issuers to streamline their services to offer their customers more financial freedom.

truID is a South African startup that enables end-to-end open finance integration for financial applications. The startup attains compliance and customer consent to connect the banks and customers. It then collects customer information and generates beneficial insights with data analytics to improve customer experience and net profit. truID’s solution enables credit providers retailers insurers and banks to speed up their application’s time to market while ensuring compliance and security.

Quanto develops an Open Finance Platform

Traditional third-party lenders manually audit customer finance to assess their credit eligibility which is time-intensive and error-prone. Open finance forms a network of banks and third parties that grants transparency into financial activities for both customers and lenders. As a result it facilitates the centralization of financial services including loans transfers and financing. That is why FinTech startups provide open finance APIs for retail and other third-party service providers.

Brazilian startup Quanto develops Quanto Link an open finance platform. Quanto Link connects customer bank accounts to third-party apps to simplify user onboarding and know-your-customer (KYC). Besides it evaluates credit card consumption profiles and credit overdrafts along with income and expense analysis. This enables recurring and standardized access to users’ financial information thereby improving credit analysis.

Flynn had just two days notice that he would be co-piloting one of the Hawaiian Airlines planes that would bring Afghan refugees to safety. The people he had seen in news reports running for their lives to escape the Taliban in Kabul would be his passengers.

He called his wife Dayl Workman to tell her. Her first question was “What can we get for them?”

Workman was standing outside Daiso at the time. She went through the Japanese dollar store gathering up things like origami paper and colored pencils — whatever seemed useful and charming — to make 300 goody bags to give to the children who would be on her husband’s flights.

In the first week of September two A330 Hawaiian wide-body planes made 13 flights to help bring Afghan civilians to safety at U.S. military bases.

Hawaiian was one of six commercial airlines called up to serve in the Department of Defense Civil Reserve Air Fleet. Thirteen pilots and 36 flight attendants brought just over 3000 people to military bases from their initial east coast American entry points.

Flynn flew two full flights from Dulles International in Washington D.C. to Wisconsin. He asked the flight attendants if they wouldn’t mind passing out the bags to any kids who were on the plane. At the end of the first flight he checked to see how it went.

“They were a huge hit” Flynn said. And then he showed the photo on his phone that brings tears to his eyes. One Afghan child had found the origami paper in the goody bag folded a little boat and gave it as a gift to a flight attendant.

“They never stopped saying thank you” Flynn said. Some spoke the words in English. Most just touched their hands over their hearts. For some it was the look of gratitude in their eyes.

“In all my years in aviation I will never forget those flights” he said.

Maydell Morgan has been a Hawaiian Airlines flight attendant for 53 years. She served on two similar Department of Defense missions for Hawaiian Airlines transporting American troops during Operation Desert Storm and the war in Iraq but the flights this month were different. Her passengers weren’t soldiers. They were mothers cradling their babies children looking lost and scared.

Morgan had the same impulse to make little goody bags for the kids. She and her crew pooled their money and went to Target to buy things like toys and snacks and coloring books. She flew one flight from Dulles to Indiana and two from Philadelphia to New Mexico. For her first flight she made 50 bags. She made 70 for the next flight then 80 for the last. Each time there were just enough for every child on board.

“We were playing ball with the kids on the aircraft” Morgan said. “The flight crew went down to our lower crew rest areas and got all the blankets and just gave it to them. We said to keep them. These people had nothing. Some didn’t even have shoes. Anything we could do we wanted to do for these people.”

Flynn describes images that will stay with him. A passenger on his second flight wanted to board the plane by herself but she had lost both legs. She got halfway up the stairs and couldn’t go any farther. The captain of the flight asked if he could help her and he and a member of the military one on each side carried her onto the plane.

On Flynn’s second trip to Wisconsin a soldier was waiting at the gate holding flowers. He was there to meet his wife who had been evacuated from Kabul. The whole plane applauded as the two were reunited.

At that moment the situation in Afghanistan — seen up close in tattered clothes and tired faces on a blue Hawaiian Airlines seat — wasn’t about politics or military strategy. It was about people wanting to live wanting their children to be safe.

“We were there for just a small portion of their big journey” Flynn said. “They went from Kabul to Frankfurt Frankfurt to Dulles. We took them the last part of the way and the flight to Wisconsin was just over an hour. But we still made a difference.”

For Morgan it was the first flight she had worked in over a year.

In the spring of 2020 as Covid-19 was ravaging the airline industry Morgan’s husband was diagnosed with cancer. Morgan went on leave to care for him. He lived just four months after his diagnosis and Morgan took time to grieve.

When she came back to work this month her first flight was supposed to be the Boston route but she traded that for the DOD charter.

“It was a calling for me” she said recalling the overwhelming kindness that she experienced from people when her husband was sick.

“People we didn’t even know reached out to us and took care of us. There were times I said we could open our own restaurant because there was so much food at our house” she said. “After that experience I needed to give back. I wanted to take care of these people.”

In all her years at Hawaiian Airlines Morgan can’t remember ever being so deeply affected by passengers on a flight.

“When I got home I walked into my house. I started crying just by myself. My house is so simple but it’s safe and secure” Morgan said. “To those people on those flights my house would be a castle.”"

Andrew Tang is vice president of energy storage and optimization at Wärtsilä Energy  which provides solutions for renewable energy integration and EV charging infrastructure development.

As electric vehicles (EVs) become the new standard charging infrastructure will become a commonplace detail blending into the landscape available in a host of places from a range of providers: privately run charging stations the office parking lot home garages and government-provided locations to fill in the gaps. We need a new energy blueprint for the United States in order to maintain a stable grid to support this national move to EV charging.

The Biden administration announced 500000 charging stations to be installed nationally and additional energy storage to facilitate the shift to EVs. Integrating all of this new infrastructure and transitioning requires balancing the traffic on the grid and managing increased energy demand that stretches beyond power lines and storage itself.

The majority of EV infrastructure pulls its power from the grid which will add significant demand when it reaches scale. In an ideal situation EV charging stations will have their own renewable power generation co-located with storage but new programs and solutions are needed in order to make it available everywhere. A range of scenarios for how renewables can be used to power EV charging have been piloted in the U.S. in recent years. Eventually EVs will likely even provide power to the grid.

These technological advances will happen as we progress through the energy transition; regardless EV infrastructure will heavily rely on the U.S. grid. That makes coordination across a range of stakeholders and behavior change among the general public essential for keeping the grid stable while meeting energy demand.

The White House’s fact sheet for EV charging infrastructure points to a technical blueprint that the Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute will be working on together. It is critical that utilities energy management and storage stakeholders and the general public be included in planning — here’s why.

Stakeholder collaboration

Charging infrastructure is currently fragmented in the U.S. Much of it is privatized and there are complaints that unless you drive a Tesla it is hard to find charging while on the road. Some EV owners have even returned to driving gas-powered vehicles. There’s reason to be hopeful that this will rapidly change.

ChargePoint and EVgo are two companies that will likely become household names as their EV networks expand. A coalition made up of some of the largest U.S. utilities — including American Electric Power Dominion Energy Duke Energy Entergy Southern Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority — called the Electric Highway Coalition announced plans for a regional network of charging stations spanning their utility territories.

Networks that swap out private gas stations for EV charging is one piece of the puzzle. We also need to ensure that everyone has affordable access and that charging times are staggered — this is one of the core concerns on every stakeholder’s mind. Having charging available in a range of places spreads out demand helping keep power available and the grid balanced.

Varying consumer needs including location and housing work schedules and economic situations require considerations and new solutions that make EVs and charging accessible to everyone. What works in the suburbs won’t suit rural or urban areas and just imagine someone who works the night shift in a dense urban area.

Biden’s plan includes “$4 million to encourage strong partnerships and new programs to increase workplace charging regionally or nationally which will help increase the feasibility of [plug-in electric vehicle] ownership for consumers in underserved communities.” Partnerships and creative solutions will equally be needed.

An opportunity to fully engage technologies we already have

“Fifty percent of the reductions we have to make to get to net-zero by 2050 or 2045 are going to come from technologies that we don’t yet have” John Kerry said recently causing a stir. He later clarified that we also have technologies now that we need to put to work which received less air time. In reality we are just getting started in utilizing existing renewable and energy transition technologies; we have yet to realize their full potential.

Currently utility-scale and distributed energy storage are used for their most simplistic capabilities that is jumping in when energy demand reaches its peak and helping keep the grid stable through services referred to as balancing and frequency regulation. But as renewable energy penetration increases and loads such as EVs are electrified peak demand will be exacerbated.

The role that storage plays for EV charging stations seems well understood. On-site storage is used daily to provide power for charging cars at any given time. Utility-scale storage has the same capabilities and can be used to store and then supply renewable power to the grid in large quantities every day to help balance the demand of EVs.

A stable power system for EVs combines utilities and utility-scale storage with a network of subsystems where energy storage is co-located with EV charging. All of the systems are coordinated and synchronized to gather and dispatch energy at different times of the day based on all the factors that affect grid stability and the availability of renewable power. That synchronization is handled by intelligent energy management software that relies on sophisticated algorithms to forecast and respond to changes within fractions of a second.

This model also makes it possible to manage the cost of electricity and EV demand on the grid. Those subsystems could be municipal-owned locations in lower-income areas. Such a subsystem would collect power in its storage asset and set the price locally on its own terms. These systems could incentivize residents to power up there at certain times of the day in order to make charging more affordable by providing an alternative to the real-time cost of electricity during peak demand when using a home outlet for example.

Behavior change

The greatest challenge for utilities will be how to manage EV loads and motivate people to stagger charging their vehicles rather than everyone waiting until they are home in the evening during off-peak renewable generation periods. If everyone plugged in at the same time we’d end up cooking dinner in the dark.

While there’s been talk of incentivizing the public to charge at different times and spread out demand motivators vary among demographics. With the ability to charge at home and skip a trip to the “gas station” — or “power station” as it may be referred to in the future — many people will choose convenience over cost.

The way we currently operate individual energy usage seems like an independent isolated event to consumers and households. EVs will require everyone — from utilities and private charging stations to consumers — to be more aware of demand on the grid and act more as communities sharing energy.

Thus a diverse charging network alone won’t solve the issue of overtaxing the grid. A combination of a new blueprint for managing energy on the grid plus behavior change is needed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2MtbWFudWZhY3R1cmVyLXRvLWNsZWFuLXVwLWl0cy1tZXNzLWRlY2FkZXMtYWZ0ZXItcG9sbHV0aW5nLW15cnRsZS1iZWFjaC1zaXRlL2FydGljbGVfZDBkZDk0ODAtMTRiYy0xMWVjLWI0M2YtMmIyNGQxNmUzNGI5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SC manufacturer to clean up its mess decades after polluting Myrtle Beach site,"A onetime Myrtle Beach electronic parts manufacturer could soon clean up the soil and groundwater contamination it caused decades ago at its plant in an area known more for its tourist attractions than heavy-industry.

AVX Corp. is waiting on state regulators to finalize a plan to remove a chemical called trichloroethylene or TCE from its former manufacturing site at 1801 17th Avenue South.

The former factory near Myrtle Beach International Airport used to make ceramic capacitors which act like tiny batteries on computer chips that run everything from wireless phones to automobiles.

TCE is the byproduct of a degreaser AVX used at the Grand Strand site beginning in the 1970s. While the chemical has been shown to cause cancer it wasn't considered a health hazard in the Myrtle Beach case because groundwater there is not a source for drinking water.

Owned by Japan's Kyocera Corp. AVX moved its headquarters to Fountain Inn in the Upstate in 2009 shortly after the TCE contamination came to light.

Most of the buildings have been removed from the Myrtle Beach site and some of the soil that was beneath the structures has been excavated. A pair of groundwater extraction wells have been operating at the site for years but the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control expects to approve a plan by the end of this year to get rid of the TCE and other contaminants for good.

That plan will include further excavation of soil and injecting a molasses-like substance into the groundwater. The sticky mixture creates bacteria that eat TCE and break it down into harmless matter.

All told the plant site cleanup will cost AVX about $5 million.

That's in addition to about $8 million the manufacturer spent to clean up TCE that migrated through groundwater from its site to a roughly six-block neighborhood in the middle of town. That groundwater eventually wound up in Withers Swash which empties into the Atlantic Ocean. DHEC used the same molasses treatment for the neighborhood's groundwater.",,,,,,,,,

SOPA Images | LightRocket | Getty Images

China's ""highly distressed"" real estate companies are at risk of collapse as the country's highly indebted developer Evergrande is on the brink of default warns AllianceBernstein's Jenny Zeng. Speaking with CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Friday the co-head of Asia fixed income at AllianceBernstein warned of a ""domino effect"" from a potential Evergrande collapse. ""In the offshore dollar market there is a considerable large portion of developers (who) are implied to be highly distressed"" Zeng said. These developers ""can't survive much longer"" if the refinancing channel remains shut for a prolonged period she added. Evergrande the world's most indebted property developer is crumbling under the weight of more than $300 billion of debt and warned more than once it could default. Banks have reportedly declined to extend new loans to buyers of uncompleted Evergrande residential projects while ratings agencies have repeatedly downgraded the firm citing its liquidity crunch.

The financial position of the other Chinese property developers also took a hit following rules outlined by the Chinese government to rein in borrowing costs of the real estate firms. The measures included placing a cap on debt in relation to a company's cash flows assets and capital levels.

While the struggling developers are tiny individually compared to Evergrande they make up about 10%-15% of the total market on aggregate Zeng said. She warned that a collapse could result in a ""systemic"" spillover to other parts of the economy. ""Once it starts it takes much more from a policy perspective to stop it than to prevent it from happening"" she added.

On its own a managed default or even messy collapse of Evergrande would have little global impact beyond some market turbulence. Simon MacAdam Senior Global Economist Capital Economics

Taken on its own the financial or social risks associated directly with Evergrande itself are actually ""reasonably manageable"" Zeng said. She cited the fragmentation of the Chinese property market as a reason behind this. ""Despite Evergrande's size – we all know it is the largest developer in China probably the largest in the world – [it] still accounts for only 4% and now it's even less of the total annual sales market"" Zeng said. ""The debt particularly the onshore debt is well collateralized.""

Some economists have warned that the collapse of Evergrande could become China's ""Lehman moment"" — a reference to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis. However Capital Economics senior global economist Simon MacAdam described that narrative as ""wide of the mark.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY2EuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xOS1jb3VwbGVzLWhhbGxvd2Vlbi1jb3N0dW1lcy13b250LTE0MDEwMDEyMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,19 couples Halloween costumes you won't see everyone else wearing this year,"19 couples Halloween costumes you won't see everyone else wearing this year

“The buyer saw it for the first time at 3pm on Facetime and he bought it at 7pm” says Alexander Phillips of PPD who originally had a $10m guide for the five-bedroom residence with private resort-style garden and heated mineral pool at 90 Military Rd Dover Heights.

There’d been a September 30 auction scheduled but by Friday afternoon a week after it was first listed with strong interest pushing the guide to $11m Phillips had three people fighting for the keys.

The buyer is understood to work in the mining industry is in his early 40s and will relocate to Sydney next year.

The gobsmacking result means that Johnson and Thomson have achieved even more for this property than the North Bondi home they’ve paid an exorbitant $11235000 for at 99 Murriverie Rd.

The Wentworth Courier and REA Group exclusively revealed yesterday that Johnson founder and managing partner of executive search firm Johnson Partners and Thomson a sales consultant at MindBody Inc were the $11235000 buyers of a six-bedroom Murriverie Rd residence that traded for just $6.3m two years ago.

The extraordinary 78 per cent price hike has been the talk of the eastern suburbs for a week.

The Murriverie Rd home in the name of 30-year-old Annabelle Shamir is on a 440 sqm block.

She’s upgrading to the Bellevue Hill mansion of the fashion designer-turned-lifestyle blogger Stephanie Conley-Buhre which sold for more than $30m in July with her investment banker husband Adam Blumenthal chairman of EverBlu Capital.

Agents Ray White Double Bay’s Daryl Rosen and Warren Ginsberg had a $9m price guide for Murriverie Rd ahead of last Thursday’s online auction.

The Johnson-Thomson current property is a bigger 645sqm block but the trade off is that it’s on Military Rd Dover Heights rather than a North Bondi address.

The couple had purchased it for $5.76m in 2018 before engaging star designer Yasmine Ghoneim of YSG Studio for a renovation.

Inside Jason Johnson’s award-winning home

As I reported last week the interiors are now fresh — and quite incredible.

The residence was the national winner for residential design in both the Australian Interior Design Awards and the Design File Awards in 2020 and has appeared in Vogue Living and Belle Magazine.

Ghoneim is also co-ordinating the revamp of the Palm Beach house that couple snapped up last November for $9.17m which was owned by Emlen Bell daughter of the late US senator Joseph Tydings.

The two-storey Dover Heights house is surrounded by lush established gardens and features a “Black Panther” marble kitchen that flows to a private resort-style garden with heated mineral pool.

Other highlights are the private deck with ocean views and the entertainer’s lounge with outdoor kitchen.

Jason Johnson also made the property news in 2019 when his Bondi Beach apartment sold for $3525000 pre-auction.

There’d been a $3.4m price guide for the two-bedroom two-bathroom apartment at 208/180 Campbell Pde which was also a winner at the Australian Interior Design Awards in 2018.

Johnson bought the unit in 2017 and immediately brought in Amber Road Design for a $400000 renovation.

It too appeared in multiple design publications.

The couple are now looking for their next renovation project.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was initially published in 1896 and since then a significant quantity of important information has continued to be provided about inventories from various firms. This guide explores all about this robust index.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) is one of many indexes used as a gauge for how well an entire market performs at any given time. The index can be helpful because it shows where and how much specific markets have fluctuated in value for days weeks or months. It also allows investors to track their investment performance and compare themselves against others with different portfolios.

History of DJIA

The DJIA is one of the oldest and most well-known stock market indexes in America. Charles Dow the co-founder of the Wall Street Journal created the index back in 1884. Charles Dow composed his first stock average of nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the Customer’s Afternoon Letter a daily two-page financial news bulletin that preceded The Wall Street Journal. By 1900 the index was renamed Dow Jones Industrial Average and included 30 equities divided into two groups: the industrials (comprising 19 members) and the railroads (11).

DJIA expanded beyond transportation stocks with the addition of General Electric (NYSE: GE) in 1901. It joined as one of 11 industrial sector companies added that year due to perceived growth prospects based on earnings per share multiples at a time resulting from significant expansion following consolidation/merger wave among USUS manufacturing businesses during the 1890s – 1910s.

Many significant adjustments occurred throughout the 20th century as many former components combined departed or were relocated.

Using historical data from the DJIA you could get a good idea about what factors affect stocks in general. For example if you saw that oil prices tend to go up when there’s terrible weather somewhere – maybe your portfolio has some exposure to alternative energy research?

DJIA history is a significant indicator of the overall direction of top-level economic activity as measured by leading US industrial corporations whose performance is indicative of changes in business conditions and investment prospects for stock market investors. DJIA value has been included in significant decisions regarding monetary policy that affect global markets such as Federal Reserve rate decision announcements published in advance so financial professionals can monitor new information before public release.

Understanding the Dow Jones Industrial Average

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) sometimes called the “Dow” is a stock market index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States are trading during a standard trading session in the stock market.

The components of DJIA are chosen from leading US companies across different industry groups to reflect their significance within those specific industries and national markets overall.

For a company’s stocks to be added onto or removed from this average they must meet specific requirements including management integrity and liquidity along with shareholder equity over time which helps ensure only established corporations remain included.

Dow Jones Industrial Average Components

The DJIA comprises numerous components that are crucial to the information it provides about how well or poorly the stock market as a whole has performed on any given day.

As of 2021 the Dow Jones Average Index includes the following companies: Apple Inc (NYSE: AAPL) Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE: CRM) Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) Visa Inc (NYSE: V) The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) The American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: HON) Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) The Travelers Companies (NYSE: TRV) Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) Merck & Co. Inc (NYSE: MRK) UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) IBM (NYSE: IBM) 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) The Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) Amgen Inc (NASDAQ: AMGN) Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT) Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA).

DJIA vs the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite

While the basic mission of DJIA S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite is similar the way they go about the task is very different.

Their selection methodology varies. The Dow tracks the value of 30 large companies which tend to be blue-chip firms that are household names. The S&P 500 tends to be broader hoping to have a bigger representation of companies from various sectors and industry groups. And the Nasdaq composite includes only stocks that are trading on the Nasdaq market.

Conclusion

The DJIA has been a historical benchmark for investors to keep in mind when evaluating their stock performance compared to other top companies on the market. However there are many different indices these days and each investor needs to conduct thorough research before placing any investments with a financial adviser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMTkvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWZ1dHVyZXMtb3Blbi10by1jbG9zZS1uZXdzLmh0bWzSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wOS8xOS9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtZnV0dXJlcy1vcGVuLXRvLWNsb3NlLW5ld3MuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S&P 500 falls 1.7% for its worst day since May Dow sheds 600 points,"Monday's sell-off briefly pushed the S&P 500 5% below its last record on an intraday basis. It's been a long time since the market has faced a sell-off of this magnitude as investors continued to buy the dip with fiscal and monetary stimulus backstopping the markets. The index closed the session 4.1% below its record high from Sept. 2.

There were a number of reasons for the sell-off:

One optimistic sign from Monday's rout: The Dow closed well off its session low. The 30-stock average was down 971 points at it low for the day.

The S&P 500 fell 1.7% to 4357.73 posting its worst daily performance since May 12. It was a broad sell-off with each of the main 11 sectors of the benchmark registering losses. The Dow Jones Industrial average lost 614.41 points or 1.8% to 33970.47 for its biggest one day drop since July 19. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2% to 14713.90.

U.S. stocks began the week deeply in the red as investors continued to flock to the sidelines in September amid several emerging risks for the market.

Stocks linked to global growth led the broad-based sell-off Monday. Ford lost more than 5%. General Motors and Boeing fell 3.8% and 1.8% respectively. Steel producer Nucor shed 7.6%

Energy stocks tumbled as WTI crude oil fell nearly 2% on concerns about the global economy. The energy sector slid 3% becoming the worst-performing group among the 11 S&P 500 groups. APA shed more than 6% while Occidental Petroleum and Devon Energy both dropped over 5%.

Bond prices gained as investors sought safety. The move pushed the 10-year Treasury yield down by 6 basis points to 1.31%. (1 basis point equals 0.01%)

Big bank stocks took a hit as the falling rates may crimp profits. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase dropped 3.4% and 3% respectively.

""We think the mid-cycle transition will end with the rolling correction finally hitting the S&P 500"" wrote Mike Wilson Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist. ""We point to downside risk to earnings revisions consumer confidence and PMIs.""

Wilson said he believes a ""destructive outcome"" is looking more likely that results in a pullback of 20% or more. On Friday University of Michigan's September consumer sentiment index came in at 71 just slightly above the August level that was the lowest in 9 years.

The Cboe Volatility index  Wall Street's fear gauge jumped above the 28 level on Monday the highest since May.

""We are in an information vacuum at the moment"" said Jamie Cox managing partner at Harris Financial Group. ""Stalemates in Congress on the debt ceiling worries on policy changes or mistakes in monetary policy and a litany of proposed tax increases have dampened the mood for investors. When this occurs corrections happen.""

Stocks have struggled so far in September in line with historical trends. For the month the Dow is off 3.9%. The S&P 500 is lower by 3.7% and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 3.6%.

On Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average turned in three straight weeks of losses for the first time since September 2020. The S&P 500 saw its biggest trading volume Friday since July 19 more than doubling its 30-day average volume.

Friday coincided with the expiration of stock options index options stock futures and index futures — a quarterly event known as ""quadruple witching."" History shows volatility tends to pick up around this event.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference Wednesday at the conclusion of the two-day meeting. Powell has said the so-called tapering could occur this year but investors are waiting for more specifics particularly after mixed economic data released since Powell's last comments.

Some investors believe this is just normal market action that can occur in September.

""The reasons for drop this morning are the same as last week: China concerns (Evergrande regulation COVID) Fed tapering and possible tax hikes but nothing new occurred this weekend to justify [Monday's] declines"" Tom Essaye founder of Sevens Report said in a note.

Other risky assets declined on Monday. Bitcoin lost as much as 10% to below $43000.

Most commodities were in the red. Gold was among the few assets in the green adding 0.7% to $1764.

All week long The Wall Street Journal’s “Facebook Files” series has invited comparisons of the social media platform to tobacco companies.

The Journal relied on internal company documents it obtained to show Facebook (FB) knows “in acute detail” about the problems with its platforms. The assorted harms to users are well-documented. But in the words of the Journal Facebook (FB) “hasn’t fixed” the flaws.

So: Social platforms are addictive and often harmful. Sen. Richard Blumenthal a Democrat told the Journal “Facebook seems to be taking a page from the textbook of Big Tobacco — targeting teens with potentially dangerous products while masking the science in public.”

U.S. Rep. Ken Buck a Republican tweeted “Big Tech has become the new Big Tobacco. Facebook is lying about how their product harms teens.”

The series matters because it comes with evidence.”Time and again the documents show Facebook’s researchers have identified the platform’s ill effects” the Journal says. “Time and again despite congressional hearings its own pledges and numerous media exposés the company didn’t fix them. The documents offer perhaps the clearest picture thus far of how broadly Facebook’s problems are known inside the company up to the chief executive himself.”

Regarding the company’s CEO Friday’s story had his name in the headline: “How Facebook Hobbled Mark Zuckerberg’s Bid to Get America Vaccinated.”

Here’s where to get caught up on the entire series.

This was a very big week for the Journal. Is there more reporting work to do? Definitely. My sense is the series has given the newsroom a jolt of inspiration and this may not be the Journal’s last word on the Facebook Files.

Facebook’s new response

The company’s response to the five-part series was measured during the workweek. Facebook could have deployed spokespeople and surrogates onto TV shows for example but it did not. I noticed Joe Scarborough on MSNBC saying “Facebook reminds me of big tobacco” because “they know their product is damaging to people.”

There was no rebuttal from the company on his show.

But on Saturday Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg issued a seven-paragraph blog post objecting to some parts of the Journal series.

“At the heart of this series is an allegation that is just plain false: that Facebook conducts research and then systematically and willfully ignores it if the findings are inconvenient for the company. This impugns the motives and hard work of thousands of researchers policy experts and engineers at Facebook who strive to improve the quality of our products and to understand their wider (positive and negative) impact” Clegg said.

Clegg deplored what he called the “impugning” of Facebook’s motives. Perhaps responding to some observers’ concerns the company will stop doing internal research since some of it was leaked to the Journal Clegg said “We will continue to invest in research into these serious and complex issues. We will continue to ask ourselves the hard questions. And we will continue to improve our products and services as a result.”

He also seemed to address the comparisons of Facebook to Big Tobacco. “The truth is that research into the impact social media has on people is still relatively nascent and evolving and social media itself is changing rapidly” he said.

FB disinformation doesn’t happen in a vacuum

Journal reporter Jeff Horwitz who has earned many plaudits this week tweeted Friday “some Facebook folks have told me we should pay more attention to how the interplay between social media and cable TV news affected the public discussion of Covid vaccines including on the company’s platforms.” He agreed with that assessment he said.

Former Twitter and Facebook executive Nu Wexler said he also concurred: “If we’re measuring reach/engagement of health misinfo on FB we need a way to compare it to Hannity’s nightly audience or the impact of a governor/senator saying the same things IRL.”

Further reading and listening

– “There’s a lot to unpack” from the “Facebook Files” CNN’s Allison Morrow writes. “But one thing that stands out is just how blatantly Facebook’s problems are documented using the kind of simple observational prose not often found in internal communications at multinational corporations.”

– Washington Post columnist Will Oremus says he sees a pattern emerging: “Facebook keeps researching its own harms – and burying the findings.”

– Friday’s “Files” story describes a gathering of Facebook leadership in and around its Menlo Park HQ early this month at which “the tone from some participants was ‘We created the machine and we can’t control the machine’ one of the people said.”

– David Kirkpatrick who wrote a “generally positive” (his words) book about FB a decade ago says “the Journal series may bespeak a major shift even for those who are jaded and expect little other than evasion and apathy from this shockingly-powerful company. The articles suggest it may start to be seen widely as an outlaw enterprise.”

– The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson says the Journal series underscores that social media is “attention alcohol:” Like booze he says “social media seems to offer an intoxicating cocktail of dopamine disorientation and for some dependency.”

– On Monday the Journal will hold a live Q&A with several reporters about the “Facebook Files” findings. There is also a companion podcast series on Spotify.

The city had some significant updates as where things stand right now.

As of Saturday there are about 16 agencies working on the massive project including Detroit agencies DTE Energy Great Lakes Water Authority and several state agencies as well.

As far as the gas main DTE has completed rerouting its high pressure 24 inch main. Originally that was expected to take at least a week. GLWA is now resuming normal operations at its Water Resource Recovery Facility.

Also DTE is working to decommission additional overhead infrastructure to ensure safety for residents and businesses. AT&T and Comcast have relocated some of their service lines as well.

Lastly they’re working on the soil borings.

“I can tell you that our investigation still goes on. We’ll be completing our boring over the weekend. That’s where we’ll be doing various soil samples about 100 feet” said Detroit Chief Operating Officer Hakim Berry. “We look to start excavating sometime early this week. Then we can get into more what’s underneath there and what caused the opening.”

The smoldering embers of this once historic concert venue the great Pine Knob (aka DTE Music Center) glow red with the screaming souls of metal head heathens who have arrived to worship before the shrine of the zombie god… Rob Zombie. Day one of RIFF Fest 2021 is here and headlining our first night of non-stop carnage is the mighty Rob Zombie along with his horde of musical protégés guitarist John 5 bassist Piggy-D and master of the skins Ginger Fish.

Saturday night 9:30p.m. the arena seating area is full to capacity as is the same with the legendary “Pine Knob” lawn/hill. Both sides jump to life as massive wall-sized jumbotrons begin to illuminate the dark stage indicating that Rob Zombie must be creeping nearby. Guitarist John 5 emerges from stage right armed with a telecaster. A bass-wielding helmet-wearing Piggy-D slides across the stage to take his position in the shadows of the left. The crowd roars as Rob Zombie first appears with his hands held high and wearing his signature demon-skull cowboy hat. Rob jumps onto a stage riser with the spryness of a 20-year-old athlete and the band has launched into the opening tune “The Triumph of King Freak.” Rob begins to deliver a unique jig of kung-fu kicks knee drops and stripper moves that might make “Cinnamon” blush.

The night is underway as the band proceeds to nail down “Super Beast” and into “Dead City Radio and the New Gods of Super Town.” RZ is all over the stage running across the riser platforms greeting fans on the right side on the left side and centerstage with a vigorous headbanging of his dreadlocks like hairdo. “Well Everybody’s F**king in a U.F.O.” is next followed by the crowd favorite the White Zombie song “More Human Than a Human.” Piggy-D’s pounding baselines and drummer Ginger Fish’s thunderous kick drum can be felt right down to your very soul.

John 5 leads the band into “Living Dead Girl” “Demonoid Phenomenon” followed by “House of 1000 Corpses.” The new track “The Eternal Struggles of the Howling Man” from Rob‘s latest album The Lunar Injection of the Kool-Aid Eclipse Conspiracy (released March 16 2021) is received well by the crowd. The band fires into the dark and campy track “In the Age the Consecrated Vampire We All Get High” followed by “Scum of the Earth” and another new track “Shadow of the Cemetery Man.” Fans are treated with a surprise ode to the Ramones with a zombie-like rendition of the classic “Blitzkrieg Bop” that has everyone in attendance chanting out “Hey ho… let’s go!” The band tastefully transitions into the White Zombie megahit “Thunder Kiss 65.” Guitarist John five delivers yet another blazing guitar solo full of tasty fretboard magic and tricky riffs that only a true guitar virtuoso could pull off.

The night comes to a close with Rob Zombie leading the crowd of metalhead heathens to a fist smashing cover of The Beatles classic “Helter-Skelter“ or does it? The band ruse is cut short and Rob and his horde return to the stage to give the fans one more song the powerful “Dragula.” As the last note rips across the speakers our crowd of thousands and in attendance began to chant “Zombie… Zombie… Zombie…” RZ turns to face the crowd as John 5 holds a telecaster high and the squad shoots hands in the air and with one final roar the lights dim and Riff Fest 2021 day 1 is now over.

Rob Zombie comes as an energetic and explosive concert experience that is a must see for the music loving metal head. Catch him on tour now… coming soon to a house of horrors near you. Be sure to check RZ’s official website for appearance details dates and artist updates.

“It was a fun event. I enjoyed being able to compete in the rodeo. There was a lot of good competition. There were so many things to see and learn from so many linemen” said Renner of Highland a 2019 HFC PTP alumnus.

Annual event tests linemen’s mettle

This competition open for journeymen and apprentice linemen is held annually to determine the fastest and most efficient pole-climbers. Their technical skills and safe work practices are showcased through a variety of challenges such as a hurt man rescue pole climb and jumper change-out. Journeymen compete in three-person teams. Apprentices compete as individuals.

“It was cool taking stuff from the field and putting it into a big event like this” James of Kingston a 2020 HFC PTP alumnus.

“I’m really excited and proud of the accomplishments of my former students” said former HFC PTP instructor and retired DTE lineman Dan Boylan who attended the event.

Next up: October’s International Lineman’s Rodeo

According to Deborah Majeski Manager Workforce Development at DTE Energy Renner and James have been invited to test their mettle against crews from around the world at the International Lineman’s Rodeo in Overland Park KS Oct. 13-16. Linemen travel from as far as England Ireland Jamaica and South Africa for the international competition.

“HFC’s PTP program is a pre-apprenticeship certificate program that provides fundamental skills and knowledge for in-demand jobs within the energy sectors” said Cassandra Myers HFC Workforce Development Program Manager.

“We’re excited to work with Henry Ford College to prepare future skilled trade workers” said Majeski. “The PTP program helps prepare people for a successful career in this field.”

Speaking to Detroit's WRIF radio station prior to ROB ZOMBIE's performance at yesterday's (Saturday September 18) Riff Fest at DTE Energy Music Theatre in Clarkston Michigan John 5 stated about Mustaine's involvement with the track: ""It was a complete honor. 'Cause there was a James Brown [sample] in there and it's pretty hard to top James Brown. But Mustaine it was just perfect 'cause he's got that growl that voice. I mean the delivery was epic and I'm super excited and super honored to have him on the track.""

""I love those instrumental songs with cool vocal hooks or it could be anything like that"" he continued. ""It just makes it so different and interesting. It just came together perfect. I'm super happy. When I played it for him he was down with it. I'm really really happy with it.""

""Sinner"" was produced and mixed by Barry Pointer at Riott House Studio in North Hollywood. Drums were engineered by ex-GUNS N' ROSES guitarist Gilby Clarke at Redrum Recording in Los Angeles. The LP also features a guest appearance by original KISS drummer Peter Criss on a cover of ""Georgia On My Mind"" a 1930s classic by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell that's become famous thanks to Ray Charles decades later.

John 5 whose real name is John William Lowery told WRIF about Criss's contribution to the song: ""Peter of course has played Gene Krupa he's played the Buddy Rich he's played that style his whole life. And so I said 'Hey man I'm doing 'Georgia On My Mind'. And he was like 'I would love to.' It's just what he has done his whole life played like that. So my producer Barry Pointer went to his house and we set it up just like an old '40s kit — a couple of mikes not miking every drum or anything. And I'm not exaggerating he did two takes. And the first one was perfect. He was like 'Well let's just do a second one just for safety.' I mean walking down the stairs took longer than his epic drum performance. It was incredible. And then there was some magic. Before the song Peter is talking to Barry — he's talking about me and the song and all that stuff. And we caught that on the mikes. And we asked Peter if it was okay to start the song like that. And he said 'Sure.' It's really neat. It's really great.""

Stocks with game-changing growth potential can grow exponentially in a matter of years but among the many companies aggressively pursuing growth today only a handful seem capable of making it through the stock gyrations and hitting the coveted $1 trillion market capitalization by 2035. After all only five companies have made it to the $1 trillion club so far so unless a company is already growing like a weed and has convincing catalysts ahead to sustain that momentum it's hard to make it that far.

To be able to get your hands on a potential trillion-dollar company early in the game is a dizzyingly tempting idea though so I dug deep into the hundreds of stocks with a market capitalization of more than $100 million to see which ones could go that far. I found four stocks that have a really good chance of making it. Read along.

COVID-19 pandemic is a boon for this stock

Many use Visa (V 0.79%) cards but few are aware of the kind of growth the company can enjoy in coming years.

At the recently held Deutsche Bank Technology Conference Visa's CFO Vasant Prabhu highlighted four structural trends triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic that should power up the company's growth:

Acceleration of cash digitization or the use of digital modes of payment instead of cash.

Booming e-commerce particularly cross-border e-commerce as people are buying things online they traditionally bought in stores like groceries and drugs.

Greater adoption of cashless modes of payment by merchants of all sizes as they realize the importance of going online for survival.

Growth in value-added services like data solutions digital security and CyberSource -- an e-commerce card payments management company owned by Visa.

These are all secular trends that Visa knows how to exploit given its dominance in the payments processing space with 3.6 billion cards issued under its name as of the last quarter.

Management has clear-cut plans to grow shareholder wealth: Capture growing consumer payments and value-add markets through acquisitions and new services pay out 20% to 25% of annual earnings per share in dividends and repurchase shares with remaining cash. Visa's attempt to acquire fintech company Plaid may have fallen through on regulatory concerns but it's a fine example of Visa's hunger for growth.

Visa is already a cash-cow machine thanks to a low-capital high-margin core business and it generates operating margins north of 60%. With the pandemic forcing economies to go cashless and online Visa with its market cap of $492 billion should be able to hit $1 trillion long before 2035.

There's more money to be made from this massive trend than you think

I am going to make my boldest $1 trillion contender pick yet: It's a utility with a market cap of $165 billion.

Yes you read that right but I strongly believe NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%) will become the first utility stock in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club by 2035.

NextEra Energy's stock price has risen more than fivefold in 10 years and even more in dividends which have risen every year for more than 25 years. Now if the company could achieve that kind of growth when renewable energy was still in its nascent stage imagine where it could be once countries start working toward their net-zero emission goals. 137 countries have already committed to these goals mostly by 2050.

Statista projects that the global renewable energy market will cross $1 trillion as early as 2027 up from only $613.8 million in 2020. Projections through 2025 from the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2020 report are even more notable:

By 2025 major oil and gas companies' spending on renewables could grow tenfold.

Renewables could account for 95% of the increase in total global power capacity.

Renewables could make up one-third of the world's total electricity led by hydropower solar and wind.

Now consider this: NextEra Energy's subsidiary Energy Resources is already the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and has a backlog of 16.7 gigawatts (GW) which means near-term growth is already built into its portfolio.

To top that NextEra Energy's Florida Power & Light company is a steady cash-flow machine and its affiliate NextEra Energy Partners a steady source of funds. Then there's the opportunity in green hydrogen which alone could be a $12 trillion market by 2050.

There's another reason why NextEra has me excited: Growth via acquisitions. After its failed bid for Duke Energy I'm sure NextEra Energy is on the lookout for the next big merger or acquisition opportunity which could speed up this top renewable energy growth stock's journey to $1 trillion.

This company is beating the best in its game

Customer relationship management (CRM) has emerged as the fastest-growing software market as a rising number of businesses now understand why digitizing customer management is critical to retain and gain customers in an ever-expanding virtual world. These stunning statistics reveal why Salesforce.com's (CRM 0.55%) market cap could easily grow fourfold to $1 trillion well before 2035:

The global CRM market grew by 6% to $69 billion in 2020 according to Gartner.

Salesforce dominated the market with 19.5% share two percentage points higher than the combined market share of SAP  Oracle  Microsoft MSFT 0.59% ) Adobe  according to Statista.

   according to Statista. While SAP's and Oracle's market shares dropped in 2020 Salesforce's market share grew from 18.4% in 2019 to 19.5%.

Salesforce has more than doubled its revenue in the past three years.

Salesforce predicts revenue to cross $50 billion by 2026 from $21.1 billion in fiscal 2021.

Clearly Salesforce has its pulse on the CRM market like none other. Salesforce uses artificial intelligence extensively and its recent acquisition of business messaging platform Slack could be a potential game-changer as Slack competes directly with Microsoft's Teams platform. Slack added a record net new 13000 paid customers and had 169000 total paid customers as of last quarter including biggies like IBM.

As Salesforce is also already profitable its journey toward a $1 trillion market cap should be easier if it can grow sales as projected.

These industries could explode and so could this stock

Sea Limited's (SE -1.64%) market cap has grown at an astounding pace to $189 billion from only about $4.9 billion in October 2017. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results but Sea Limited's market cap growth so far wasn't a fluke: It was backed by exponential growth in revenues and gross profit. And if Sea Limited can continue to make a splash in the two big markets it's targeting nothing can stop its stock from hitting $1 trillion.

Sea Limited's integrated online platform forms the base of its three core businesses:

Entertainment (gaming): Garena.

E-commerce: Shopee.

Digital financials services: SeaMoney.

Here's how each business is faring:

Garena: Quarterly active users (QAUs) and quarterly paying users (QPUs) hit 725.2 million and 92.2 million respectively in second-quarter 2021. QAUs and QPUs were 402.1 million and 35.7 million as of March 30 2020.

Shopee: Gross merchandise value and orders hit $15 billion and $1.4 billion respectively in Q2 2021 from only $6.2 billion and $0.4 billion as of March 30 2020.

SeaMoney: Mobile wallet payment volumes crossed $4.2 billion in Q2 2021 from only $1.1 billion as of March 30 2020.

If anything at all these numbers indicate Sea Limited's growth potential.

Its flagship game Free Fire beat Tencent's (TCEHY -0.15%) PUBG Mobile to become the world's third-most downloaded mobile game in August 2021. Shopee is already the leading e-commerce company in Southeast Asia and Taiwan and is now expanding into Latin America Europe and even India. SeaMoney is growing beyond mobile payments -- it has already won a banking license in Singapore and recently acquired Indonesia's PT Bank.

Remember though Sea Limited's losses are swelling and that's something that may not sit well with some investors. However Sea Limited is a typical growth stock focused on customer and top-line growth and has successfully monetized Garena to reinvest the cash into e-commerce and financial services beyond Southeast Asia. If you believe in the power of these two businesses Sea Limited could be an enormous winner by 2035.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYWxpc2J1cnlwb3N0L25hbWUvcmVuYS1jaGlsZGVycy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0yMTYwNzcwNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rena Childers Obituary (1956 - 2021) - Salisbury NC - Salisbury Post,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/salisburypost/name/rena-childers-obituary?id=21607705 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYWxpc2J1cnlwb3N0L25hbWUvcmVuYS1jaGlsZGVycy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0yMTYwNzcwNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8xOS9ob3ctdG8tbWVldC10aGUtZGVtYW5kLW9mLWV2LWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLWFuZC1tYWludGFpbi1hLXN0YWJsZS1ncmlkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to meet the demand of EV infrastructure and maintain a stable grid,"Andrew Tang Contributor

Andrew Tang is vice president of energy storage and optimization at Wärtsilä Energy  which provides solutions for renewable energy integration and EV charging infrastructure development.

As electric vehicles (EVs) become the new standard charging infrastructure will become a commonplace detail blending into the landscape available in a host of places from a range of providers: privately run charging stations the office parking lot home garages and government-provided locations to fill in the gaps. We need a new energy blueprint for the United States in order to maintain a stable grid to support this national move to EV charging.

The Biden administration announced 500000 charging stations to be installed nationally and additional energy storage to facilitate the shift to EVs. Integrating all of this new infrastructure and transitioning requires balancing the traffic on the grid and managing increased energy demand that stretches beyond power lines and storage itself.

The majority of EV infrastructure pulls its power from the grid which will add significant demand when it reaches scale. In an ideal situation EV charging stations will have their own renewable power generation co-located with storage but new programs and solutions are needed in order to make it available everywhere. A range of scenarios for how renewables can be used to power EV charging have been piloted in the U.S. in recent years. Eventually EVs will likely even provide power to the grid.

These technological advances will happen as we progress through the energy transition; regardless EV infrastructure will heavily rely on the U.S. grid. That makes coordination across a range of stakeholders and behavior change among the general public essential for keeping the grid stable while meeting energy demand.

The White House’s fact sheet for EV charging infrastructure points to a technical blueprint that the Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute will be working on together. It is critical that utilities energy management and storage stakeholders and the general public be included in planning — here’s why.

Stakeholder collaboration

Charging infrastructure is currently fragmented in the U.S. Much of it is privatized and there are complaints that unless you drive a Tesla it is hard to find charging while on the road. Some EV owners have even returned to driving gas-powered vehicles. There’s reason to be hopeful that this will rapidly change.

ChargePoint and EVgo are two companies that will likely become household names as their EV networks expand. A coalition made up of some of the largest U.S. utilities — including American Electric Power Dominion Energy Duke Energy Entergy Southern Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority — called the Electric Highway Coalition announced plans for a regional network of charging stations spanning their utility territories.

Networks that swap out private gas stations for EV charging is one piece of the puzzle. We also need to ensure that everyone has affordable access and that charging times are staggered — this is one of the core concerns on every stakeholder’s mind. Having charging available in a range of places spreads out demand helping keep power available and the grid balanced.

Varying consumer needs including location and housing work schedules and economic situations require considerations and new solutions that make EVs and charging accessible to everyone. What works in the suburbs won’t suit rural or urban areas and just imagine someone who works the night shift in a dense urban area.

Biden’s plan includes “$4 million to encourage strong partnerships and new programs to increase workplace charging regionally or nationally which will help increase the feasibility of [plug-in electric vehicle] ownership for consumers in underserved communities.” Partnerships and creative solutions will equally be needed.

An opportunity to fully engage technologies we already have

“Fifty percent of the reductions we have to make to get to net-zero by 2050 or 2045 are going to come from technologies that we don’t yet have” John Kerry said recently causing a stir. He later clarified that we also have technologies now that we need to put to work which received less air time. In reality we are just getting started in utilizing existing renewable and energy transition technologies; we have yet to realize their full potential.

Currently utility-scale and distributed energy storage are used for their most simplistic capabilities that is jumping in when energy demand reaches its peak and helping keep the grid stable through services referred to as balancing and frequency regulation. But as renewable energy penetration increases and loads such as EVs are electrified peak demand will be exacerbated.

The role that storage plays for EV charging stations seems well understood. On-site storage is used daily to provide power for charging cars at any given time. Utility-scale storage has the same capabilities and can be used to store and then supply renewable power to the grid in large quantities every day to help balance the demand of EVs.

A stable power system for EVs combines utilities and utility-scale storage with a network of subsystems where energy storage is co-located with EV charging. All of the systems are coordinated and synchronized to gather and dispatch energy at different times of the day based on all the factors that affect grid stability and the availability of renewable power. That synchronization is handled by intelligent energy management software that relies on sophisticated algorithms to forecast and respond to changes within fractions of a second.

This model also makes it possible to manage the cost of electricity and EV demand on the grid. Those subsystems could be municipal-owned locations in lower-income areas. Such a subsystem would collect power in its storage asset and set the price locally on its own terms. These systems could incentivize residents to power up there at certain times of the day in order to make charging more affordable by providing an alternative to the real-time cost of electricity during peak demand when using a home outlet for example.

Behavior change

The greatest challenge for utilities will be how to manage EV loads and motivate people to stagger charging their vehicles rather than everyone waiting until they are home in the evening during off-peak renewable generation periods. If everyone plugged in at the same time we’d end up cooking dinner in the dark.

While there’s been talk of incentivizing the public to charge at different times and spread out demand motivators vary among demographics. With the ability to charge at home and skip a trip to the “gas station” — or “power station” as it may be referred to in the future — many people will choose convenience over cost.

The way we currently operate individual energy usage seems like an independent isolated event to consumers and households. EVs will require everyone — from utilities and private charging stations to consumers — to be more aware of demand on the grid and act more as communities sharing energy.

Thus a diverse charging network alone won’t solve the issue of overtaxing the grid. A combination of a new blueprint for managing energy on the grid plus behavior change is needed.",,,

The perfect polymer—one that balances physical properties and environmental performance—doesn’t exist but polybutylene adipate co-terephthalate (PBAT) comes closer than many.

Producers of synthetic polymers have for decades failed to stop their products from ending up in landfills and oceans and they are now under pressure to take responsibility. Many are redoubling efforts to boost recycling to fend off critics. Other firms are trying to tackle the waste problem by investing in biodegradable biobased plastics such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) hoping natural degradation will mitigate at least some of the waste.

But both recycling and biopolymers face obstacles. Despite years of effort the plastics recycling rate in the US for instance is still less than 10%. And biopolymers—often the products of fermentation—struggle to achieve the same performance and manufacturing scale of the established synthetic polymers they are meant to replace.

PBAT combines some of the beneficial attributes of synthetic and biobased polymers. It is derived from common petrochemicals—purified terephthalic acid (PTA) butanediol and adipic acid—and yet it is biodegradable. As a synthetic polymer it can readily be produced at large scale and it has the physical properties needed to make flexible films that rival those from conventional plastics.

Interest in PBAT is taking off. Established producers such as Germany’s BASF and Italy’s Novamont are seeing increased demand after decades of cultivating a market. And they are being joined by over a half-dozen Asian producers which expect brisk business in the polymer as regional governments push for sustainability.

Marc Verbruggen former CEO of the PLA maker NatureWorks and now an independent consultant considers PBAT the “cheapest and easiest way to make a bioplastics product.”He sees it emerging as the preeminent flexible bioplastic ahead of contenders such as polybutylene succinate (PBS) and PHA. And it will likely become one of the two most important biodegradable plastics overall alongside PLA which he says is becoming the major product for rigid applications.

PBAT’s main selling point—its biodegradability—comes from ester linkages as opposed to carbon-carbon backbones seen in non-degradable polymers such as polyethylene according to Ramani Narayan a professor of chemical engineering at Michigan State University. Ester bonds are susceptible to hydrolysis and attack from enzymes.

For example PLA and PHA are polyesters that degrade when their ester linkages are broken. But the most common polyester—polyethylene terephthalate (PET) used for fiber and soda bottles—doesn’t break down so easily. This is because of the aromatic rings in its backbone which come from PTA. The rings which impart structural properties also make PET hydrophobic according to Narayan. “Water cannot get in that easily and it slows down the whole hydrolytic process” he says.

Some clever chemistry led to the invention of PBAT in the 1990s as a bridge between aliphatic and aromatic polyesters.

BASF produced polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) a polyester made using butanediol and the firm’s researchers were looking for a biodegradable polymer they could readily produce. They substituted the aliphatic diacid adipic acid for some of the PTA in the PBT. Separating the aromatic sections of the polymer this way made it biodegradable. At the same time enough PTA was left to give the polymer worthwhile physical properties.

Narayan rates the biodegradability of PBAT a little better than that of PLA which needs industrial composting to break down. But it doesn’t quite match commercially available PHAs which are biodegradable in ambient conditions even in marine environments.

Experts most often compare the physical properties of PBAT to low-density polyethylene a stretchy polymer used to make films such as for trash bags.

PBAT is regularly blended with PLA a polymer with rigid polystyrene-like properties that lend stiffness. BASF’s Ecovio brand is based on such blends. For example Verbruggen says a compostable shopping bag is typically 85% PBAT and 15% PLA.

Novamont adds another dimension to formulation. The company blends PBAT as well as other biodegradable aliphatic-aromatic polyesters with starches to create resins for specific applications.

“Novamont for the last 30 years has always been addressing applications where the degradability adds value to the product itself” says Stefano Facco the company’s new business development manager.

One big market for PBAT is mulch films which are laid around crops to prevent weeds and help retain moisture. When polyethylene films are used they must be pulled up and often landfilled. But biodegradable films can be tilled right back into the soil.

Another big market is compostable refuse bags used for food service and household collection of food and yard waste. Bags from companies like BioBag which Novamont recently acquired have been available at retailers for years.

“The major ecological benefits of compostable plastics result from their end of life because these products help to divert food waste from landfills or incineration to organic recycling” says Joerg Auffermann BASF’s team leader for global business development in biopolymers.

Over the years the biodegradable polyester industry has moved into applications beyond films. For example in 2013 Swiss Coffee Company launched coffee capsules made with BASF’s Ecovio resins.

An emerging market for Novamont’s materials is biodegradable cutlery which can be composted along with other organic matter. Facco says the cutlery has been taking off in places such as Europe that have passed regulations limiting the use of single-use plastics.

Anticipating more environmentally driven growth new Asian PBAT players are entering the market. In South Korea LG Chem is building a 50000 metric ton (t) per year PBAT plant set to open in 2024 as part of a $2.2 billion sustainability-focused investment program in Seosan. SK Geo Centric formerly known as SK Global Chemical and Kolon Industries are partnering on a 50000 t PBAT plant in Seoul. Kolon a nylon and polyester maker is providing the production technology while SK has access to the raw materials.

The PBAT gold rush is biggest in China. The Chinese chemical distributor OKCHEM projects that Chinese PBAT production will rise to about 400000 t in 2022 from 150000 t in 2020.

The largest project on the horizon is from the Chinese PTA maker Hengli. Details are unclear and the company couldn’t be reached for comment. In media and financial disclosures Hengli has variously said it is planning a 450000 t plant or a 600000 t plant for “PBS-type” biodegradable plastics. But when describing the materials needed for the investment the company names PTA butanediol and adipic acid.

Verbruggen sees a number of drivers for the investments. For one thing biopolymers of all kinds have experienced a run-up in demand recently. Supply is tight and thus prices for PBAT and PLA are high.

Moreover Verbruggen says the Chinese government has been pushing the country to “go big” into bioplastics. Earlier this year it passed a law banning nonbiodegradable shopping bags straws and utensils.

The PBAT market holds appeal for Chinese chemical makers Verbruggen says. The technology isn’t complex especially for companies with experience in polyesters.

PLA in contrast is more capital intensive. Before the polymer can be made a company needs to ferment lactic acid from an ample source of sugar. Verbruggen points out that China has a “sugar deficit” and needs to import carbohydrates. “China is not necessarily a favorable place to build a massive amount of capacity” he says.

The existing PBAT makers have been keeping up with the new Asian players. In 2018 Novamont completed a project to convert a PET plant in Patrica Italy to make biodegradable polyesters. The project doubled its biodegradable polyester output to 100000 t per year.

And in 2016 Novamont opened a plant that uses fermentation technology developed by Genomatica to make butanediol from sugar. The 30000 t plant is located in Italy and is the only one of its kind in the world.

The new Asian PBAT makers will likely make a limited number of grades of commodity polymer for large-scale applications according to Facco. “It’s not rocket science” he says. In contrast Novamont will maintain its strategy of serving specialized markets. “This is where we have a certain knowledge and a certain benefit to the market” he says.

BASF is reacting to the Asian PBAT building trend by getting involved in a new Chinese plant. The company licensed its PBAT technology to the Chinese firm Red Avenue New Materials which plans to build a 60000 t in Shanghai by 2022. BASF will sell the output from the facility.

“With upcoming new laws and regulations directing the use of bioplastic materials in packaging mulch film and bag applications the positive market development is expected to continue” Auffermann says. The new plant will allow BASF to “cater the increasing demand from a local source within the region.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

But about 24 hours later he was living exclusively in the here and now.

In fact Martin and all 60 of his teammates on the Reds football team were completely soaking in the moment.

Martin engineered an opportunistic offense and a pulverizing Eaton defense created plenty of opportunities. The Reds dominated their rival Platte Valley 32-0 on Saturday inside the Broncos’ home stadium.

On Friday Martin — one of the top baseball prospects in the state — verbally committed to play Division I baseball in the Southeastern Conference for the University of Arkansas a couple years from now.

Then on Saturday he threw for a pair of touchdowns and ran for another.

“I got home from practice (on Friday) I had all my family there — we had a whole group there” Martin said of his announcement party. “It was pretty special to me. I took my time (deciding). I’m going to be a Hog. I’m pretty excited and ready to get to work.

“But it’s football season now. So I’ve got to stay focused on this.”

The Reds the top-ranked team in Class 2A and the defending state champion improved to 3-0. Through three games they’ve outscored their foes by a combined 126-7.

Platte Valley ranked seventh in 2A by CHSAANow.com fell to 1-2. The Broncos lost consecutive home games for the first time since 2011 falling 17-14 to Severance a week ago.

Martin’s individual statistics Saturday may not fly off the page. He completed 4 of 14 passes for 98 yards two touchdowns and two interceptions and rushed five times for 38 yards and another touchdown.

But he and the Reds offense were opportunistic. They took full advantage of prime opportunities created by Eaton’s high-octane defense — never more so than late in the second quarter when the Reds scored 20 points in 2 minutes 14 seconds to turn a 3-0 lead into a 23-0 advantage heading into halftime.

Eaton’s smothering defense created those scoring opportunities by recovering a Platte Valley fumble and picking off a Broncos pass in close succession.

All night the Reds defense was flying around the field creating havoc for a normally dangerous Platte Valley offense.

“Don’t underestimate us” Eaton senior defensive end/running back Ryan Dirksen said. “The biggest thing I’ve seen is you get mouthy with us and we turn it up. We’ll stay quiet but we’ll turn (the physicality) up on opponents. … You’ve got to have that alpha mentality.”

While the Reds ran for 172 yards and had 270 yards of total offense Platte Valley managed just 14 yards of net offense.

The Broncos were moving backward for most of the game registering minus-5 yards of net rushing on 43 carries.

“It starts with our defensive line and the ability of our defensive ends to plug a hole in the middle and also run sideline to sideline” Eaton coach Zac Lemon said. “Our guys want to improve week after week after week. And it’s not about winning a state championship. It’s about being the best Eaton Reds.

“And eventually if we can do that we’re hoping to be back in the championship hunt.”

Steve Morphew Labour leader at Norfolk County Council has tabled a motion at the next full council meeting to put forward the bid which he believes will help shape future generations of Olympic and Paralympic talent.

The £1m skatepark at Oxhey Activity Park near Watford is among the facilities which has inspired the idea.

But it is not expected a facility in Norwich would cost anything like that sum.

The Airport Industrial Estate to the south of Norwich International Airport is jointly owned by Norfolk County Council and Norwich City Council.

Mr Morphew who motion has been seconded by fellow councillor Colleen Walker will call on the council to give some ""serious thought"" for a skatepark there which would cater for all abilities.

He said: ""There is a bit of land there which is in the right place with reasonable access in the north part of the city as well as for suburbs such as Sprowston and Hellesdon.

""It would also be accessible on the NDR for north Norfolk and would bring an international standard facility to Norfolk on the back of the Olympics success. There is potential there so why not?""

Mr Morphew has tabled the idea for the September 27 meeting but wants the council debate postponed until November to test the level of public - and councillor - support.

He recalled a real desire for a skating facility in Eaton Park before it was built in 2010 while he was city council leader.

Sam Avery who runs the Drug Store skateboarding shop on Bridewell Alley in Norwich has also backed the plans for a new skating and BMX facility.

""There is a huge demand that far outweighs facilities currently available in Norwich"" Mr Avery said.

""The north side of the city hasn't got any free outdoor space for skateboarding so that seems a logical place to build a skatepark.""

Norwich's skating links

Mr Avery has recently unveiled plans for an indoor skatepark at the disused St Peter Parmentergate church in King Street.

He has long campaigned for Norwich to become a more “skate-friendly” city and was involved with the build of Eaton skatepark in 2010.

The Eaton skatepark was funded through an £8m investment agreement with the Homes and Communities Agency.

The city council said it was proud of the ""popular facility"" which was designed to national competition standard.

But Mr Avery and skaters have called for more to be done to address the provision in the city.

Charge Unit skatepark was opened in 2013 as Norwich’s only indoor skatepark.

But the facility was closed after owner Andrew Biss searched for someone to secure its survival.

Mr Biss invested £100000 in buying various ramps and equipment for the Delta Close venue but the business was put on the market for just £10000 in February 2020.

But the Delta Four Skatepark has now been given a new lease of life by BMX riders Max Ward and Joe Foster after 10 months of hard work and renovations.

After opening in April the facility is open seven days a week and caters for all abilities.

It is open to BMX scooter skateboard in-line skating quad skating and WCMX.

What does Mr Morphew's motion call for?

Mr Mophew's motion says there is now an opportunity to build an ""international standard skatepark for Norfolk"".

It does two things:

Urges cabinet to retain a suitable site from the sale of the airport estate and use part of the sale proceeds from the remainder towards building an international skatepark.

Requests officers to develop a scheme in conjunction with the skateboarding community for an operational model based on a community business that could manage a new skatepark without relying on county council revenue funding.

He said that while we should take great pride in our athletes just four of the 375 Olympic Team GB athletes were from Norfolk - 1.4pc of the total.

Of the Paralympic Team GB there were 215 athletes of which three were from Norfolk - 1.1pc.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml3bWJ1enouY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9uZXdzLXNwb3J0cy9uYW1pYmlhLWhhcy1hbm5vdW5jZWQtaXRzLXNxdWFkLWZvci10aGUtdXBjb21pbmctdDIwLXdvcmxkLWN1cC8yMDIxLzA5LzE50gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaXdtYnV6ei5jb20vc3BvcnRzL25ld3Mtc3BvcnRzL25hbWliaWEtaGFzLWFubm91bmNlZC1pdHMtc3F1YWQtZm9yLXRoZS11cGNvbWluZy10MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLzIwMjEvMDkvMTkvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Namibia has announced its squad for the upcoming T20 world cup,"Namibia has announced its squad for the upcoming T20 world cup

David Wiese a former South African all-rounder has been called up to Namibia’s national side for the forthcoming T20 World Cup in 2021. Gerhard Erasmus will lead the team in the ICC event which will take place in October and November.

Wiese was a member of the Proteas before leaving the nation to focus on playing for Namibia. He represented South Africa in six One-Day Internationals and 20 Twenty-20 Internationals before retiring in March 2016.

His father was born in Namibia hence he is eligible to play for Namibia by first descent. During his prime the 36-year-old had a lot of experience playing in the shortest forms and was in high demand. He has participated in the Indian Premier League (IPL) the Chinese Premier League (CPL) the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) and the Pakistan Super League (PSL).

Wiese will play his first match for his new country during the T20 World Cup. Namibia will be one of just two African teams competing in the forthcoming multi-nation tournament. It will also be their first World Cup debut after defeating co-hosts Oman in the qualifiers.

There are a number of players to keep an eye on in Namibia. Leg-spinner Nicol Loftie-Eaton and fast bowler Ruben Trumpelmann are two names that come to mind. In the A group of the first round. The African nation is grouped with Ireland Sri Lanka and the Netherlands.

If they finish in the top two they will advance to the Super-12 stage which will feature the big nations. Despite the fact that the prospects of qualifying are slim Namibia has a habit of surprising people.

The flamboyant Durban club owner said there was no added “pressure” for her side to signal their intentions in the elite league given that she’s still building Royal into a competitive top-flight combination.

Speaking to Power 98.7 Sport on Friday Mkhize popularly known by her nickname MaMkhize revealed her three-year plan in the PSL saying the main objective is to “unearth talent” in KwaZulu-Natal.

“The support has been extremely good” she said. “People were so willing to see us starting to play our first game.

“As much as the first games were not good people never lost faith in us. They said 'Keep on building we know you are still building and we are building.”

Mkhize added that it has been her son Andlile Mpisane's vision that Royal becomes a club that sources talent in KwaZulu-Natal.

“Actually it's Andile's dream to make sure that everybody that has never got an opportunity be seen and noticed” she said.

“And he will be a root for the youth direction. Those are the people he wants to be giving a chance.”

MaMkhize also clarified that her side know they cannot challenge big three clubs Chiefs Sundowns and Pirates in the PSL in their first season.

“For us this season I don't think we want to compete with the big guns — we just want to have stability” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlcmJ5dGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvcGVuc2lvbmVyLXRoYW5rcy1oZXJvLW5laWdoYm91ci13aG8tNTkyNzMyN9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlcmJ5dGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvcGVuc2lvbmVyLXRoYW5rcy1oZXJvLW5laWdoYm91ci13aG8tNTkyNzMyNy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pensioner thanks 'hero' neighbour who faced her fears to save him,"Something went wrong please try again later.

A pensioner who collapsed in his bedroom has thanked his ""brilliant"" neighbour for climbing on his roof to help paramedics get to him.

John Colley locked his front door at around 11.30pm on Thursday September 9 before heading to bed but collapsed after reaching his bedroom.

Unable to get up the 82-year-old pressed a panic button attached to his wrist which alerted his daughter Lisa and neighbour Donna Baxter to the problem.

But neither they nor the paramedics could enter the house due to Mr Colley leaving the key in the front door in Alfreton Road off the B6179 in Little Eaton.

Hearing his shouts for help Donna who lives and works at the Little Kitchen café next door sprang into action.

Mr Colley said: ""Halfway up the stairs I started to feel dizzy and nauseous I felt awful. By the time I'd got into my bedroom I was gasping for breath because I suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

""I couldn't get my breath so I pressed my panic button.

""The next thing I hear is someone banging on the front door and shouting my name. I couldn't move as I was so out of breath I tried to shout back to them. I didn't know what to do and Donna came round to the back and shouted to open the window as far as I could.

""This young lady gets one of the chairs out of the garden climbs on top of a wheelie bin and scrambles up the sloping roof into my bedroom.

""She dives onto my bed and then she went downstairs to unlock the front door the paramedics rushed upstairs and within about an hour they had sorted me out. Without her climbing through that window I would have been in serious trouble.""

Mr Colley who also has angina alongside his COPD was believed to have had low blood pressure but did not need to go to hospital and is now set to make a full recovery.

Donna however remained modest about her actions which saw her overcome her fear of heights to help her neighbour.

She said: ""I could see Lisa [John's daughter] panicking and I could see it in her face that she was frantic. My heart was racing and I wanted to make sure John was OK.

""He was vulnerable up there and there was no real option it was the only option so I just did it. You don't really think about any danger really. It was a bit daunting but at least we got to John that was the main thing.""

Donna 47 founded the Little Kitchen with her husband Dave 62 after they moved to the village from Belper in 2014. They also own a second outlet at Horsley Lodge with a third to follow in Ilkeston.

Mr Colley a retired production manager said: ""Donna befriended my wife Norma when they first moved into the shop and they had seven good years as very good friends. My wife used to come round to the café and Donna would come round to my house.

""Unfortunately at Christmas I lost my wife and I was down in the dumps. I was really really depressed and if it hadn't have been for this lady popping in for two or three times a day I don't know where I'd be I really don't.

""I was in a bad place but she dragged me up by my bootlaces and got me out and about again and talking and I can't thank her enough for that.

""Dave has been part of it too if there are any jobs that need doing. He's a wizard with electrical things but that's the kind of thing they do.

""What people don't know is the work Donna and Dave do for the elderly people in the village. If anyone is ill Donna is there in a flash taking cakes and has even taken a Sunday roast to them. She is always on the spot but they don't go shouting about it.""

The couple's support for Mr Colley is just one of a number of ways that they have helped countless people around the village including by delivering papers supplies and meals throughout the toughest points of the pandemic.

At one point they even arranged for a singer to perform outside an elderly resident's house to put a smile on their face and Donna said helping people is reward enough in itself.

She added: ""We do it to make sure that people have got a bit more quality of life and they see people and they talk to people and you see a smile on their face and they appreciate what you do.

""All the people that we do provide food for say a really big thank you and that's all we need really we don't expect anything else.""

Dave who also works as an engineering manager said: ""The community element is what we're about here and that's what we tried to deliver is good community spirit and I think Covid is a really big thing in that.

""We recognised in the village that unfortunately we've got quite a few people who have lost partners and we've always helped them.

""We've always been a centre for them to come out and meet other people because it's a lonely life when you don't go out and don't know where to go or what to do it's a big thing.""

Saurabh Chawla pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy interstate transportation of stolen goods and tax evasion.

According to court documents Chawla purchased stolen goods valued at $3.5 million between 2009 and 2019 with the help of three primary co-conspirators: James Bender Kristy Stock and Joseph Kukta.

In a press release federal prosecutors said Bender controlled and operated multiple online eBay and Amazon accounts including ""HiddenGemFurniture"" (""HGF"") ""EddiesAffordableGear"" (""EAG"") and ""AffordableGoodies4You"" (""AG""). The 36-year-old Baltimore resident offered use of his accounts in exchange for a cut of the Chawla's sales. With Bender's help Chawla offered and sold a large amount of stolen goods and merchandise for sale through HGF other eBay stores and other online marketplaces. At one point Chawla had 400 active listings for goods and products on eBay.

Stock according to prosecutors was a New Mexico public school employee responsible for overseeing a program to provide Apple iPods intended to benefit underprivileged Native American children in New Mexico. The 46-year-old Stock stole more than 3000 iPods purchased by the school district valued at more than $1 million and sold them to Chawla. Stock admitted that she received more than $800000 in illegal proceeds from selling the stolen iPods.

Kukta 45 was a FedEx employee in a Delaware facility. He obtained most of the items he sold to Chawla from bulk purchases shipped via FedEx and marked for delivery to FedEx customers including a Walmart Distribution Center in Smyrna Delaware. Kukta discreetly avoided detection by the delivery company and shipped stolen items to a relative of Chawla in Maryland.

Bender Stock and Kukta have pleaded guilty to federal charges and are currently awaiting sentencing.

In addition Chawla also filed fraudulent tax returns for eight of the years the stolen goods scheme was in operation. This was done according to prosecutors but falsely inflating the costs of goods sold and underreporting his adjusted gross income. Chawla was also deemed partly responsible for his Delaware relative's tax evasion.

Chawla was ordered to immediately pay $713619 in restitution to the IRS. The judge's decision regarding possibly restitution for the stolen goods was delayed until Dec. 3.

Chawla has to report to the Bureau of Prisons to serve his term by Dec. 6.

Chawla was the focus of a 2015 dispute with his Aurora neighbors over his AirBnB rental activity as reported by the Aurora Sentinel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2F1Y3Rpb24tZGlsZW1tYS1jaGV2cm9sZXQtc2lsdmVyYWRvLTI1MDBoZC12cy1mb3JkLWYyNTAtc3VwZXItZHV0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Auction Dilemma: Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD Vs Ford F-250 Super Duty,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2F1Y3Rpb24tZGlsZW1tYS1jaGV2cm9sZXQtc2lsdmVyYWRvLTI1MDBoZC12cy1mb3JkLWYyNTAtc3VwZXItZHV0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2F1Y3Rpb24tZGlsZW1tYS1mb3JkLWZpZXN0YS1zdC12cy12b2xrc3dhZ2VuLWd0aS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Auction Dilemma: Ford Fiesta ST Vs Volkswagen GTI,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2F1Y3Rpb24tZGlsZW1tYS1mb3JkLWZpZXN0YS1zdC12cy12b2xrc3dhZ2VuLWd0aS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay93aGF0cy1vbi9zaG9wcGluZy9zaG9wcGVycy1mdW1pbmctbGlkbC10cmFpbmVycy1zb2Nrcy0yMTYxMTk3NdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay93aGF0cy1vbi9zaG9wcGluZy9zaG9wcGVycy1mdW1pbmctbGlkbC10cmFpbmVycy1zb2Nrcy0yMTYxMTk3NS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shoppers fuming as Lidl trainers and socks sell out in stores - and turn up on Ebay for hundreds of pounds,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Budget supermarket Lidl has vowed to investigate after fuming shoppers say they've not been able to get hold of the brand's new trainers and sock range - which sold out within days and has now been turning up on auction site eBay for vastly inflated prices.

The new inexpensive range of Lidl-by-Lidl branded clothing in its signature bold colourways went on sale across the UK in stores from September 16.

Trainers for men and women are priced at £12.99 while the matching novelty socks are £1.49.

But the stock swiftly sold out across all UK stores according to Lidl's official Twitter account with no current plans for a restock.

And now the striking blue and red trainers have been turning up on resale site eBay where sellers have been offering them for prices that range from £30 £500 right up to Buy-it-now prices of £1000 - to the disgust of shoppers.

Some took to Twitter to complain about the situation directly to Lidl's GB account.

One said: ""Can’t even get a pair because t***pots have snapped them up in bulk and are banging them on eBay at stupid prices.""

(Image: Lidl)

Another claimed: ""Not easy to get the trainers when the staff in my local store are chatting openly about buying 3 or 4 pairs each to sell online.""

Lidl said on Twitter it would be investigating after a number of customers alerted them to eBay sales of the trainers.

A spokesperson for Lidl said: ""With regards to items being sold on eBay we have been made aware and are looking into this.""

They have said they ""are hopeful for their return to stores again in future"" but no date has been confirmed for a restock of the Lidl by Lidl branded clothing.

But how did this guy go from having to hide his actual name to distribute his art to becoming one of the best-known craftspeople in the pot world?

According to Welch much of his success can be attributed to collaboration and bartering. No ego was involved in the process: just a desire to get his art out to the world.

“People at shows that would have new items for the cannabis industry and I would offer to trade. I’d make some weed art post it up on my Instagram account and get something cool for my archives. Win win” he said during a recent interview.

Cannabiscapes

And his good will paid off. Four years later Greg is working with many of the companies he collaborated with early on in his career.

Now let’s rewind for a second: where did the idea of making art with marijuana come from?

Putting The One Hitter Before The Blunt

Greg wasn’t a cannabis consumer as a youngster. In fact he fist started consuming it in his 20s when he moved to South Florida and fell in with a group of people he defines as “successful hustlers.”

“All were responsible and smoked weed so I figured it couldn’t be all bad” he voiced. “That was really the start of me consuming and recognizing the connections that cannabis creates.”

A few years later Greg decided to look for a job in the cannabis industry landing a sales role for a track and trace software company.

He recalls hundreds of cold calls he had with West Coast and Colorado-based companies and the subsequent opportunity these contacts generated. He was travelling all around the country meeting cannabis industry pioneers making friend and business connections getting to know the space.

“That really showed me that I was in right space with the right people” he said.

And it was around that time that he started making weed art and created the Cannabiscapes Instagram account.

“I was thinking about who I’d want to smoke weed with and what the best way to make that happen would be. My solution was to make their faces out of weed” he explained.

Snoop Dogg

In his mind no other figure in the world said weed more than Snoop Dogg. So he found a reference photo and spent “way too much time shaping it into in retrospect a pretty awful rendition of the Doggfather.”

Story continues

Ultimately his goal was to create pieces that people appreciated prior to or without ever knowing that they were made out of pot. And he felt that first trial did not make the cut.

“My goal is to create something that my 85-year-old grandmother who doesn’t like weed and doesn’t really like what I do would appreciate. That’s kind of the game I play.”

Going Pro

As time went by Greg perfected his craft. And with it came the public attention.

Things really took off when he made a piece for a Berner album in late 2017.

This was a special moment for him.

“It was not only memorable because of who he is in the game but also it was my first major project and it immediately put me in front of a huge population of cannabis enthusiasts.”

But despite the recognition Greg was not ready to come out of the cannabis closet just yet. He still signed all of his pieces as Ty Forto.

“For a long time I was making the stuff out of Florida and specifically at that time it was still pre-medical so the landscape wasn’t very good for putting my name out publicly for making pictures out of pot” he explicated.

Beyond legality Greg was concerned with public perception.

“I was also worried about judgment. And back to location: I was literally living right behind the police station and it was one of those things that...not that I have anything really to hide other than some pot... but don’t create problems that are avoidable ya know?”

The time to go West had come he thought in 2018. And so he did.

“Now I don’t give a f*ck; I’m all about putting my face and name out there to promote to the right aspects of the industry.”

Making A Career Out Of Weed Art

In the past this column focused on cool cannabis jobs has looked into the emergence of cannabis art and the viability of making a career out of it. People like cannabis photographer Bentley Rolling comedian Rachel Wolfson performance artist Laganja Estranja or multimedia artist Emily Eizen are living proof of it.

“I mean anything can be a career if you do it long enough right?” – Greg commented when prompted about the issue.

But one can’t make it alone he added. It’s all about connecting with the right people and establishing authentic lasting relationships.

Seth Rogen

“By spending time with some of the people that have pioneered different aspects of the game or have been in it for a long time it’s really humbling to see how much they put into what they do and what kind of sacrifices personal risks they’ve taken on.”

Nowadays Greg creates cannabis art and advises many companies on marketing design and aesthetics.

“There’s definitely opportunities to create a business out of the cannabis art by networking correctly and leveraging those relationships. That’s something that I’m continuing to explore and experiment with and see which direction I want to go with it. I’m still in an exploratory phase and enjoying the journey. But my mind is always looking at gaps in the market and ways to help the aspects of the industry I support” he added.

Cannabiscapes

Taking his own advice Greg is starting a podcast and web series in 2021 exploring new opportunities to create around cannabis culture.

“I get to spend time with so many inspiring people I feel obligated to start sharing more of their stories. And that’s where I’m looking in 2021 I’m going to start a podcast and web series around the hustle and show people what the real weed game looks like. At least what we’re ready to show if you know what I mean” he explained.

‘Provide Value Before Requesting Value’

For Greg there’s no slowing down. At any given time he said he’s got roughly 10 projects “swimming around” in his head.

“I wanna ride the wave wherever the weed game takes me. Whoever’s got events going on whoever I’ve recently collaborated on with a logo piece that I wanna drop off and meet in person and sesh or a pop up at a dispensary... Whatever is going on that’s what I wanna experience right now because it’s unprecedented it will never happen again and I’m fortunate that I get to hang out with some of the best to ever do it.

“My number one piece of advice to anybody seeking to make it as any type of content creator is to provide value before requesting value” he ended. “What I mean by that is before you ask somebody to part with their hard-earned money show them how you can help them. So many of my projects have come from me creating a piece for a brand I respect and simply posting it. The right people see and share work they vibe with and that goes a long way in weed.”

Special to The Detroit News

Lansing — Michigan’s hemp industry could get up to $100 million in federal funds to help it compete globally under a proposal pushed by a nationwide growers association.

The state is one of four — along with Oregon New York and Florida — with emerging hemp industries targeted by the National Hemp Association. The funding would be for developing a “regional super site” in each state to aid in the industry’s growth said Geoff Whaling the association’s chair.

Hemp is a cannabis plant with a very low percentage of THC the psychoactive element of marijuana. Developing the industry could benefit Michigan environmentally and economically Whaling said. The plant has many uses but the state’s auto industry is what makes it a target for development.

For example BMW is planning to reduce its carbon footprint by using hemp bioplastics a renewable resource in production Whaling said. The growth of electric vehicles means more opportunities because hemp rope is lightweight and can hold an electric charge like copper.

“The biggest potential use for hemp today outside of food is the automotive industry” Whaling said. “That’s why we’ve called for $100 million of that money to be allocated specifically to Michigan.”

The proposal comes as Michigan’s growers navigate the state's plan for cultivation of hemp that lawmakers approved last year. The plan implemented Dec.1 after U.S. Department of Agriculture approval brought Michigan in line with the 2018 Farm Bill which federally legalized the industry.

The USDA requirements involve state licensing and THC testing procedures to ensure plants don’t exceed the accepted threshold for industrial hemp. If samples test above the 0.36% limit farmers have to destroy the crop.

“Having that final rule at the federal level is a good thing it leads to consistency among the states” said Molly Mott Michigan’s hemp program specialist. “It doesn’t matter if you’re talking about hemp or pesticides or any other range of topics regulated at the federal level.”

The state plan is a positive step for the industry but there are areas where the system can be improved said Blain Becktold the government and industry liaison for IHemp Michigan an affiliate of the National Hemp Association.

Becktold owner of Down On The Farm consulting services in Spring Lake said a big issue for some farmers is the rules regarding CBD a nonpsychoactive compound found in cannabis plants like hemp in dietary supplements for people and feed for livestock.

The Food and Drug Administration prohibits CBD in food products like hemp edibles. Under Michigan’s new plan state-licensed growers are compelled to follow the federal guidelines and could face consequences for selling CBD edibles.

Many Michigan farmers who worked with plants high in CBD are now sitting on the hemp they grew two years ago because the products that contain it are illegal at the federal level Becktold said.

The oversupply has disrupted the legal market because a lot of the interest in hemp comes from companies that want to make CBD products. Those following the rules are at a distinct disadvantage.

“If we make any we can’t sell edibles at the farm markets it’s illegal” said Joe Brown owner of Brown’s Farmacy Michigan’s oldest hemp farm market in Saranac. “So the only group in the whole state that is being affected negatively by this is the farm market folks.”

It is frustrating that he cannot have these products on his farm while the gas station several hundred yards away can carry them he said.

The state requires anyone growing hemp to register with the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and provide the growing location Mott said. For those creating unlicensed CBD products there is no system that requires testing or safety inspections. But there is no enforcement to stop the production and sale of these products given the agricultural agency’s resources.

“The risks associated with each situation are assessed before a determination is made on whether enforcement actions should be taken” said Jennifer Holton the department’s communications director.

But state agriculture officials said the issue is important given the confusion for consumers regarding the legality and safety of these products.

Becktold said he hopes to see legislation passed to force the FDA to create a legal pathway for CBD in the marketplace. Mott said such legislative action has been proposed at both the state and federal levels.

Whaling said there is no easy fix. FDA officials told him they won’t look at CBD as a dietary supplement and he doubts legislation would be able to address this issue. Therefore Whaling said investment in Michigan like the $100 million proposed would focus on hemp fiber and grain where there is unified national support.

Without solving this CBD problem many hemp farmers are stuck in limbo. Those following the license system would be punished for competing with the illegal products spread across the market. That’s why Brown said the problem needs to be addressed as soon as possible.

“We’ve got a special set of rules for us and people like us” Brown said. “It’s been killing our industry.”

It Sat Dark for 2 Days. (Published 2021),"NEW ORLEANS — Linda Williams is used to power outages in her neighborhood where strong winds often damage the electrical lines that crisscross her street. But Hurricane Ida was different. Within days of losing power the heat was making her so dizzy that she had to stay in bed.

“My head started spinning real real bad” said Ms. Williams 71 who struggled to even wash dishes without starting to feel ill.

Just a few miles from Ms. Williams’s house in New Orleans East sits a new 128-megawatt gas power plant that she and tens of thousands of other New Orleans residents help fund each month when they pay their bills to Entergy the city’s sole electric utility.

Mosquitoes and Mud: A Lineworker’s Day in South Louisiana

09/19/2021

In a couple sentences Jude Orgeron an Entergy Louisiana operations coordinator cut to the core of what it’s like for crews working around the clock in swamps and marshes to bring back power to the hardest hit areas of the Bayou State:

“It’s hot. There are Mosquitoes and alligators. It’s a mess of mud and quite frankly the environment can be miserable at times.”

While these are extreme conditions for any lineworker South Louisiana’s terrain became an even greater challenge for thousands of restoration workers from more than 40 states who are repairing and rebuilding the electric system following Hurricane Ida’s historic winds. Many have never worked such a hot and humid environment much less stumbled upon an alligator during their workday. But despite these challenges they’re giving it their all.

Zach Young an Entergy lineworker who is overseeing hundreds of workers from beyond Louisiana’s borders said he recently observed a crew from Chicago who were soaking wet and tired but amazingly were relentless in their quest to continue repairing broken poles and crossarms in the marshes of Jefferson Parish. Although this is the most grueling work some crews have ever encountered Young said they continue to arrive at the marshes around dawn each day in hope of resurrecting another key piece of Entergy’s distribution system.

“It doesn’t matter what job you give them” Young said adding “They really enjoy this kind of hard work. It means everything to them to get the job done.”

Varying depths of mud scattered growths of vegetation and vast stretches of water require crews to utilize heavy-duty boots specific clothes and equipment as well as high-water vehicles airboats barges drones and helicopters. Given the extreme and often unfamiliar conditions crews review a long list of safety protocols before taking on a job each morning. They then work toward the unified goal of restoring power to a foreign land leaving the marsh after each job covered in mud sweat and a sense of satisfaction that poles and wire are back in the air.

Ida caused more damage to Louisiana’s distribution system than Hurricanes Katrina Delta and Zeta combined and it’s the craft and unique skillsets of lineworkers to overcome any terrain — including swamps and marshes — that continue to be critical in bringing back power to South Louisiana communities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbGFpbGx1bWluYXRvci5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8xOC9sb3Vpc2lhbmEtZ292ZXJub3ItcmVwbGFjZXMtbWVtYmVycy1vZi10aGUtYmF0b24tcm91Z2UtYXJlYS1ncm91bmR3YXRlci1jb21taXNzaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Louisiana governor replaces members of the Baton Rouge area groundwater commission • Louisiana Illuminator,"Gov. John Bel Edwards appointed two new members to the 18-person board that regulates groundwater use in the Baton Rouge region less than three months after rejecting legislation that would have allowed employees from companies who use the groundwater to continue to sit on the commission without penalty.

Alvin Broussard the public works director and chief building official for the City of Gonzales is taking the seat that used to be occupied by Dennis McGhee. McGhee whose term expired in December is one of five current and former members of the Capital Area Ground Water Conservation Commission facing state ethics charges over their service on the board.

Edwards’ other appointee Patrick J. Engemann replaced Mark Frey who isn’t facing ethics charges. Engemann and Frey were both nominated by the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation which holds a designated seat on the board.

McGhee ran afoul of the ethics board because he is an employee of the Baton Rouge Water Company a private entity that supplies drinking water to the Baton Rouge region. State law prohibits employees from sitting on the regulatory bodies that oversee their own companies according to the ethics board.



The groundwater commission’s main purpose is to oversee the use of the Southern Hills Aquifer which provides the drinking water for over 600000 people in the Baton Rouge region. The Baton Rouge Water Company McGhee’s employer is one of the biggest users of the aquifer’s resources.

SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. DONATE

Several industrial companies also make use of the aquifer’s water to help run their plants. They too have historically had employees sitting on the groundwater commission.

Ryan Scardina who also works for Baton Rouge Water Company and Todd Talbot who works for ExxonMobil still sit on the commission even as they face ethics charges. Their terms have not expired yet.



Former commissioners Nelson Morvant who works for Entergy and Ronnie Albritton who works for Georgia-Pacific have been replaced but could still face penalties over their time on the board.

Environmental advocates and scientists have repeatedly raised concerns that the aquifer is being drawn down faster than it can be replenished raising the risk for saltwater intrusion that would make it unusable as a drinking water source. They question whether the groundwater commission has been conservative enough about private industry’s use of the aquifer.

But employees from the aquifer’s industrial users have sat on the groundwater commission without repercussions since its inception in the early 1970s and if the Louisiana Legislature had its way they would continue to do so.

State lawmakers passed legislation earlier this year to carve out an exception to the ethics law that allowed industrial users to continue to put their own employees on the commission. It also would have voided the current ethics charges being brought against the McGhee and the four other men.



Edwards vetoed the bill in late June.

“The industrial users of the aquifer can provide nominations of individuals that will not run afoul of the ethics code and my most recent appointees to the Commission do not have this issue” Edwards wrote in a letter explaining his veto.

While the governor said he couldn’t support industrial users continuing to sit on the commission he would support a narrower bill that erases the current ethics charges faced by McGhee and others.

“Should the legislature come back in the next session with an exception that is narrowly drafted to cure a previous inadvertent violation I will support it” he wrote. “I cannot support a broad exception for all members in the future.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGNoZXpkZW1vY3JhdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8xOC92aWRhbGlhLXRvLXBheS0yLTVtLWluLWh5ZHJvLXJveWFsdGllcy10by11dGlsaXR5LWN1c3RvbWVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vidalia to pay $2.5M in hydro royalties to utility customers - Mississippi's Best Community Newspaper | Mississippi's ...,"Vidalia to pay $2.5M in hydro royalties to utility customers Published 9:09 am Saturday September 18 2021

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

VIDALIA La. – Customers of Vidalia utilities will be getting a check in the mail in coming weeks thanks to a $2.5 million royalty refund approved this week by the mayor and council.

“We approved the refund on Tuesday and we’re going to sit down and finalize the percentages” said Mayor Buz Craft. “Right now it looks like we will be refunding between 45% and 48% percent of their utility costs for the last year.”

The council approved Craft’s recommendation to refund the town’s $2.5 million royalty revenues from the Sidney A. Murray Jr. Hydroelectric Station also known as Louisiana Hydroelectric in the form of rebates for utility customers.

The royalties are generated by the sale of electricity from the plant between July 1 2020 and July 30 2021. The town has received annual royalties on utility sales since the plant went online in 1990. The plant sells 94% of the power it generates to Entergy of Louisiana and 6% to the Town of Vidalia which resells the power to Louisiana Energy Power Authority and buys back only what is needed to provide service to local utility customers both residential and commercial customers who are not exempted by other incentive plans.

The town leaders always have the option to refund up to 50% of the utility customers’ bills with annual royalties if the funds are available although refunds have been inconsistent over the years.

Since 2016 Craft said the council will have refunded a total of $5 million to Vidalia residents thanks to this year’s royalties.

“We don’t credit back their utility bills … we send them one check which makes for a nice Christmas present” Craft said.

Craft added that providing these royalty refunds is important to him and the council members. “I’m excited for our people and happy for them” he said. “This is one of the things I promised people we would do and we’re doing it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMzAvdXMvbmV3LW9ybGVhbnMtcG93ZXItb3V0YWdlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ida Knocks Out Power To New Orleans,"It will take days just for utility crews to determine the extent of the storm damage to the New Orleans power grid and far longer to restore power to the region officials of Entergy Louisiana said on Monday.

“We have a lot of rebuilding ahead of us’’ the company said on Twitter. “We’ll be better prepared to give restoration estimates once assessments are done.”

As of 7 a.m. on Monday Entergy said there were more than 888000 power outages in Louisiana after Hurricane Ida thrashed much of the state Sunday evening snapping cables damaging buildings uprooting trees and spreading debris along roads.

On Monday morning 216 substations 207 transmission lines and more than 2000 miles of transmission lines were out of service and the company also reported more than 45000 outages in Mississippi."

Find: These States Still Ban Evictions Even After National Ban Is Struck Down

You could be wondering if an eviction could hurt your credit score. After all most people understand that missed credit card and loan payments lower your credit score. On-time payments account for 35% of your total FICO credit score so missing even one payment can drastically reduce your score as can loan defaults and accounts in collection.

But here’s the good news: As long as your landlord doesn’t report rent payments to any of the three credit bureaus (Experian TransUnion or Equifax) missed payments cannot hurt your score. And even if you missed so many rent payments that it ended in eviction that also won’t be reflected in your credit score or on your credit reports.

Howard Dvorkin CPA chairman of Debt.com explains “If you get evicted your credit score won’t take a direct hit but the glancing blow will still sink you.”

That’s because evictions go into public records Dvoskin explains. “Many landlords now do background checks on their potential tenants” he says. “Good luck getting that affordable lease if your new landlord finds that eviction judgment.”

Likewise if you were ordered by a court to pay back rent and your landlord then sent the debt into collections it will get reported to the credit bureaus by the collection agencies. And that will lower your credit score by showing up as a past due account in collections.

If you’re facing eviction your best course of action may be to seek help through the federal Emergency Rental Assistance program. You can also speak to your landlord to work out a payment plan that will keep you in your apartment while making your payments more manageable for your budget.

For a long time downtown Menlo Park was a place where things didn’t happen.

A look through the Menlo Park Historical Association archives crammed into a basement room at the Main Library yields articles about renewal plans dating to the late 1960s. Most of them never got off the ground amid public sentiment to maintain a residential low-density vibe.

The city didn’t go along with Stanford University’s plan to widen Sand Hill Road to four lanes and extend it to El Camino Real so unlike neighboring Redwood City and Palo Alto there’s no easy way to get from Highway 101 to Interstate 280. Several proposed parking garages along Santa Cruz Avenue weren’t built. Three hazardous at-grade railroad crossings were never replaced.

But finally downtown is getting a new look. Three major redevelopment projects are expected to open along El Camino within a year two of them featuring plazas open to the public.

This story was originally published in the September edition of Climate Magazine. Click here to read the full digital publication.

The first glimpse that El Camino could become more than a dreary strip highway came in the 1990s when Menlo Center was developed around the existing British Bankers Club bar-restaurant at the intersection of Santa Cruz the heart of downtown.

The Café That Led the Way

With outdoor tables on a wide brick plaza Café Borrone became the first place on El Camino anywhere on the Peninsula where people would sit drink coffee read material bought at Kepler’s Books and visit with friends urban architect Donlyn Lyndon said at the time.

The impetus for more change came when four car dealerships—Cadillac Buick Pontiac GMC of Menlo Park Stanford Lincoln Mercury University Ford and Anderson Chevrolet—closed between 2005 and 2007 as the auto business migrated to the easier-to-access 101 corridor.

“Menlo Park is in what I call the messy middle” said City Councilmember Ray Mueller a former mayor. “Candidly the difference between El Camino and Santa Cruz is on El Camino we had old vacant car lots.”

The city responded to the embarrassing eyesore by preparing an Environmental Impact Report and formulating the El Camino and Downtown Specific Plan issued in 2012.

The plan established a maximum allowable net new development cap of 680 residential units and 474000 square feet of non-residential uses including retail office and hotel. It was intended to reflect likely development over a 20-to-30-year timeframe.

Developers snapped up almost all the non-residential quota though in some cases it took years to get shovels in the ground. Here is a look at three key developments nearing completion:

Middle Plaza (Rendering in Top Image)— Stanford University is redeveloping an 8.4-acre parcel at 200-500 El Camino Real it has owned almost since its founding which had been leased by three of the car dealerships.

The project includes three retail and office buildings totaling 145000 square feet and three residential buildings with 215 one- and two-bedroom rental units tiered as three- four- and five stories.

“It’s a great project for Menlo Park because it’s on El Camino close to Caltrain with good walkability to apartments” said Steven D. Elliott managing director of development for Stanford Real Estate. “We expect this to be a Stanford staff and faculty housing project. Housing is a real priority for us because of the difficulty of recruiting staff and professors.”

A community benefit is a half-acre public plaza across from Middle Avenue that will include shops and a restaurant Elliott said. A pathway will connect to a Caltrain crossing tunnel to Burgess Park for pedestrians and bicyclists. He expects it to open for residents in the second half of next year.

Springline—A decorative metal arch leads invitingly to a public outdoor plaza. Presidio Bay Ventures is finishing up a 6.4-acre mixed-use development at 1300-1302 El Camino Real and 550 Oak Grove Ave. part of which had been vacant since the Cadillac dealership closed in 2005.

The project will include two 100000-square foot office buildings and a residential building with 183 units of 1- 2- and 3-bedrooms (including 20 units classified as affordable). Retail is located along the ground floors. There is also a two-level underground parking garage.

“We have signed leases or are in advanced discussions with retail operators for all of the 25000 square feet” said K. Cyrus Sanandaji managing director Presidio Bay Ventures. “We have also signed a handful of leases and letters of intent throughout the office buildings from the ground to third floors making up approximately 50 percent of the office space.”

The office buildings are expected to be completed this month with the first tenants moving in shortly afterwards Pre-leasing for residences is expected to begin in the fourth quarter with construction completed by January.

Guild Theater—The movie house at 949 El Camino Real was built in 1925 and became famous for midnight showings of “Rocky Picture Horror Show.” Like most of the cinema’s brethren it declined with the rise of the multiplex and finally closed amid community regrets in 2019.

Local investors and donors came to the rescue. The Guild is being rebuilt as a three-story live entertainment hall for music and live performances operated by the nonprofit Peninsula Arts Guild.

Concerts are expected to begin at the end of this year or early 2022. Capacity will be roughly 200 people seated or 500 when configured with standing room instead of chairs. Musical styles envisioned include rock jazz blues singer-songwriter country metal and EDM.

A movie screen with surround sound is also being installed. “How many we show will be dependent on how successful they turn out to be” a spokesperson for the Guild said.

Besides those three downtown projects include 1540 El Camino a 48000-square-foot office building and 27 apartments at the site of the old Beltramo’s Wines and Spirits; the 61-room Park James Hotel at 1400 El Camino Real; and the three-story Alma Station office building at 1020 Alma St. adjacent to the Caltrain station.

What will all this redevelopment mean for residents? One enthusiast is longtime resident Clem Molony a retired environmental manager and a Chamber of Commerce director.

“Those two El Camino Real projects (Springline and Middle Plaza) are absolutely home runs” Molony said. “Two small office projects will pay for hundreds of units of housing near transit. After those are finished everybody’s going to be so pleased about the architecture the fit the right size. Neighboring cities are going way tall—Redwood City is allowing 10 stories tall.”

Going Higher

The downtown Menlo Park height limit is two to three stories except near the train station where up to four to five stories are allowed.

“The NIMBY keep residential sentiment that was dominant in the ‘80s and ‘90s in Menlo Park has ended. During those years developers stayed away in droves because the electorate did not want to modernize the downtown core. City Councils have become more and more knowledgeable about the wisdom of building housing and modernizing building codes so that developers will be more interested in investing” Molony said.

The progressive citizen’s group Menlo Together doesn’t think the plan allows enough housing.

“The allowable density in the Bayside is 100 units per acre; and downtown it is 40. We believe this is backwards” said Adina Levin of Menlo Together.

“Menlo Park’s general and specific plans currently call for more and denser housing in the Bayside area east of 101 (near Facebook and the Belle Haven neighborhood) than in the area near downtown where we have a Caltrain stop and major bus line great schools and bike and pedestrian access to services and park” Levin said.

At least 1300 new apartment units have been approved or proposed for the Bayside an area with a heavy minority population.

Drew Combs the city’s mayor said “From an equity standpoint increasing housing we are very much focusing west of Highway 101.”

Where to Add Housing

For downtown “I don’t see a scenario where there would be lots of community support for raising caps on office space. Where I could see community support is allowing for more housing. I do see that as something that will likely happen. We haven’t reached the cap for housing units for those specific plans yet. We’re discussing what could we do within current plan to try to hit that cap for housing” Combs said.

Councilmember Betsy Nash said she finds attitudes are changing. “I’m encouraged that residents are embracing at least some increased density and see the need for more housing around transit. There is concern with redevelopment and inevitable growth that we don’t displace current residents and also that we can house our local workers including teachers city employees and retail staff.”

Like many California cities Menlo Park has the state looking over its shoulder. The latest update of the state-mandated Housing Element requires planning 3000 new residential units between 2023 and 2031 a big swallow for a suburb with a slow-growing population around 35000.

Mueller said the period when the City Council was divided between pro-growth and residentialist factions has ended. “That sort of distinction has really been eviscerated by the state. At the end of the day you have to find a place to zone for 3000 units and owners of properties have to express desire to legally qualify.”

Possibilities for SRI

Some of the housing will come from adjacent to downtown. SRI International is in the early stages of a redevelopment project that will change the 63-acre parcel along Ravenswood Avenue between Middlefield Road and Laurel Street from a closed campus to a mixed-used development.

The project is called Parkline (not to be confused with Springline). Its developer Lane Partners held three open houses this summer to get community feedback before the plan is finalized and submitted to the city.

It includes at least 400 housing units at densities ranging from 25 to 60 per acre with one plan calling for five apartment buildings on Laurel. It also includes the replacement of 1.1 million square feet of existing office space as SRI consolidates into a fraction of the site. There will also be approximately 28 acres of open space including a trail connecting with Burgess Park and the new rail underpass at Middle Plaza allowing pedestrians and bicyclists to have a dedicated route from El Camino to Middlefield.

Another chance for housing will come at the U.S. Geological Survey campus at 345 Middlefield which is being moved to lower-rent space at Moffett Field. The federal government is in the process of selling the 17-acre property. Local and congressional leaders want housing on the site.

Beyond that possibilities for housing include expanding and refurbishing the stock of old apartment buildings near downtown and investigating whether the Sharon Heights Shopping Center could be made available for mixed use Mueller said.

One factor complicating redevelopment is traffic. Downtown has short blocks and streets that do not line up precisely notably where Menlo and Ravenswood avenues meet at El Camino in a counterintuitive lane pattern. Caltrain at-grade crossings at Ravenswood Oak Grove and Glenwood avenues lead to traffic backing up during commute hours.

A Look at Grade Separations

Mayor Combs is hoping to restart the grade-separation process. “Menlo Park has debated this issue for a number of years or decades” he said. “Other communities have gotten their acts together ahead of us and taken advantage of state and federal money.”

Construction on El Camino has caused problems for old-line businesses such as Menlo Clock Works which is next door to the Guild Theater and its remodeling. “Like being near any construction site there’s noise trucks disturbance. It hasn’t been too bad except when they have to block a lane to get a truck in or out” said owner Alex Delly.

He said his loyal customer base built up over 40 years is putting up with the inconvenience to buy watches and get them repaired. “I’m amazed at the clientele that keeps coming to us and supporting us.”

Members of a Facebook group for people who grew up in Menlo Park lament the closures of longtime favorites like the Oasis bar and grill on El Camino and the teenager hangout Foster Freeze on the Springline site.

“I can’t believe all the building going on! Just think how the traffic will be after all those apartments and condos are filled with new residents! It’s already bad enough!” said one commenter.

Change is coming more slowly for the traditional downtown on Santa Cruz Avenue which consists mostly of older low-slung buildings with surface parking behind the stores on both sides.

The Covid-19 pandemic hit Santa Cruz hard creating numerous empty storefronts most notably Ann’s Coffee Shop a fixture since 1946. The vintage café was closed for months limped back into operation and went out of business in April after the building was sold to developers.

“It’s heart-wrenching but also promising in that we’re going to see long-hoped for redevelopment” Combs said.

The pandemic has triggered a movement to beautify Santa Cruz Avenue and make it more pedestrian-friendly. Parklets have displaced parking spaces and two segments have been closed in one direction. The movement was spearheaded by Ali El Safy owner of Bistro Vida who received an award from the Chamber of Commerce for his efforts.

Many of the buildings are owned by family trusts that have had little incentive to do much with them Mueller said. “The challenge is to figure out how to work with business owners and property owners and the community to take the lessons learned from redevelopment and create a vibrant services and restaurant-oriented area.”

Most Read from Bloomberg

Geolo Capital an investment arm of billionaire John Pritzker’s family office also participated as did VentureFriends and Prime Ventures Blueground Chief Executive Officer Alex Chatzieleftheriou said in an interview. Blueground is now valued at $750 million according to people with knowledge of the matter. The New York-based company separately obtained a $40 million debt facility from Silicon Valley Bank.

Funding will be used to fuel Blueground’s expansion from an existing presence of over 5000 apartments in 15 cities across the globe including Los Angeles Seattle and Istanbul Chatzieleftheriou said. The company plans to launch in Miami Madrid Zurich and Berlin by year-end and is targeting being operational in 50 cities by 2025.

“Blueground is uniquely positioned to address the growing need for flexibility in real estate as companies continue to delay return-to-office mandates” Pritzker Geolo Capital’s founding partner said in an emailed statement. “There’s an immense opportunity here.” Tom Gottlieb co-founder and managing general partner of Geolo Capital will join the Blueground board.

Chatzieleftheriou co-founded Blueground in 2013 in Athens after enduring months-long hotel stays for various work assignments in his prior career as a McKinsey & Co. consultant and realizing furnished apartments for short durations were difficult to find.

At the onset of the pandemic in 2020 occupancy dropped to 88% in some cities before stabilizing at 92%. Blueground had lowered its rates amid dramatic rental declines in cities such as New York and San Francisco. Its residents mostly single professionals or couples aged 25 to 45 remain hesitant to sign 12-month leases due to uncertainty a theme that has persisted in 2021.

The minimum length of a Blueground stay is one month and the average rental spans 4.5 months said Chatzieleftheriou who has lived in Blueground residences for the past five years mostly in three- to six-month stints. Around 60% of bookings are repeat customers either extending stays moving to a new neighborhood within the same city or a different city.

Story continues

The startup has been bolstered by the ongoing adoption of remote working Chatzieleftheriou said.

“More companies are giving employees the ability to choose where they want to live and work and we believe that trend is here to stay” he said. Blueground itself allows staff to be nomadic.

The company counts Related Companies AvalonBay Communities Inc. and Equity Residential among landlords with which it either inks traditional leases or revenue-sharing agreements. It expects revenue to grow 40% in the 12 months through December to $140 million and is projecting 85% revenue growth in calendar 2022 to around $260 million Chatzieleftheriou said.

After dusting off her old sewing machine third-year biology and English student Kylie Pham established Himawari Boutique in August 2020. The Etsy-based shop sells diversely patterned hand-sewn masks often paired with matching scrunchies and headbands. Pham said an Etsy business was always something she wanted to try and when the COVID-19 pandemic brought about masking she found her perfect product.

“I thought ‘Oh that’s something I can make and sell hopefully to increase mask- wear’” Pham said. “So I saw the opportunity and I took it and it worked a lot better than I thought it would.”

After taking a sewing class in seventh grade Pham said she hadn’t touched her machine until quarantine. Stuck at home during the pandemic lockdowns Pham said she was inspired to pick up the craft again. She said she first sewed a bucket hat but then pivoted to masks when she realized a business could be right around the corner.

As for the name of her boutique Himawari means sunflower in Japanese. Pham said she wanted a meaningful name for her boutique and the idea of sunflowers resonated with her especially as a symbol during tough times.

“I liked how (sunflowers) always held their head high even during difficult times and I wanted that message to transcribe to my brand” Pham said.

Inspired by Pham’s new venture her freshman year roommate and third-year communication student Aye Pyae purchased masks from Himawari Boutique to support her first and closest friend at UCLA. In addition to helping a small business Pyae said she wanted reusable masks that would be more convenient and less of a waste than disposable ones.

With purchases from supporters like Pyae Pham said it makes her so happy to see others wearing her masks and hear about how they wear them every day. She said it brings her pride as an artist especially since she is responsible for the entire process herself.

“I print my own fabric; I cut my own masks; I sew my own masks” Pham said. “I completely design the whole process so I would say in that way it’s pretty artsy and creative.”

This artistic process results in stylish prints rather than a simple disposable and pleated mask which third-year communication student Chantal Tan said helps encourage others to wear masks. The boutique’s designs for popular interests like “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba” or Animal Crossing also make wearing masks more fun and personal Tan said. Even if people don’t like wearing masks Tan said Himawari Boutique’s designs provide an opportunity for face coverings to act as accessories.

Pyae said Pham’s mask business is an important venture since masks have become a politicized topic in the past 1 1/2 years. With Himawari Boutique’s stylish masks Pyae said she hopes mask-wearing in general will increase. Tan said wearing masks may make the fall quarter’s return to campus look a little different but the practice is an important addition.

“I think if people wear masks … it can help return things to normal a lot quicker and allow other Bruins to feel a lot safer on campus” Tan said.

While the addition of mask-wearing will make the campus experience new and unfamiliar Pham said if people have a mask with a character or design they like the statement can say a lot about who they are. These designs may help overcome the strange feeling of only seeing half of people’s faces she said.

Though mask-wearing means she can only see a part of their faces Pham said it makes her happy to see others wearing her masks and she never thought Himawari Boutique would grow to the point where she was sewing 16 masks a day during finals week of spring quarter. She said she had thought about stopping but with the recent surge of COVID-19 cases she sees how a mask business is all the more relevant now.

“(My business) really helped me learn how to strike a balance between schoolwork and having a side business and it’s made me more well-rounded as a person” Pham said. “It all worked out and I’m happy with (what) my business has become.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZWxpemFiZXRoLWhvbG1lcy10aGVyYW5vcy10cmlhbC1jb3VydC1mYW5zLWhvbG1pZXMtZ2lybC1ib3NzLWZyYXVkLTIwMjEtOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elizabeth Holmes Fans ('Holmies') Call Her 'Girl Boss' Amid Trial,"By clicking “Sign Up” you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Three blond women dressed in black waited outside a courtroom to catch a glimpse of their hero on September 9. They were captured in a photo tweeted by journalist Dorothy Atkins as she reported on the trial of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.

Holmes who dropped out of Stanford at 19 to start her blood-testing business Theranos has been charged with ""massive fraud"" since the company which was once valued at $9 billion was accused of selling its services despite known shortcomings and inaccuracies in its blood-testing technology. Holmes became infamous after journalist John Carreyrou's investigative book ""Bad Blood"" and several popular podcasts documented Theranos' downfall. She faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Despite the charges and the trial some fans online won't stop idolizing Holmes. TikToks with the hashtag #ElizabethHolmes have received 13 million views on the platform showing people copying her fabled characteristics such as a wide-eyed expression low voice and black turtlenecks.

On Facebook an unofficial Elizabeth Holmes page has just under 3000 fans where people comment messages of support on sporadic vague status updates. Another unverified account has comments from fans from just three days ago saying ""You go girl! We believe in you!"" and ""You're brilliant!"" Several people have posted messages of congratulations underneath a false status update suggesting Holmes was ""cleared of all charges.""

Holmes fandom is complex blurring the line between irony and genuine reverence and even arguing supporting her is a feminist issue.

Holmes' cult following frequently labels her a 'girl boss'

The term ""girl boss"" was popularized in the 2010s to refer to women who had achieved an aspirational level of professional success. Since the concept was called out for a perceived lack of inclusivity and focus on wealth it has begun to pop up satirically online with Elizabeth Holmes stans dubbed ""Holmies"" by some observers using it frequently.

An Instagram account called @elizabethholmesupdates asks in the bio ""Are you on the right side of herstory?"" and posts updates about Holmes and the court case. On September 10 the account shared the photo of the Holmes lookalikes outside the courthouse.

""In solidarity [with] Elizabeth Holmes put on your best black turtleneck"" the caption read. ""United we slay divided we fall.""

The owner of the account Annuncia Roberts told Insider she started the account as a joke for her own entertainment after following Holmes for a while.

""At the core the situation is almost funny"" she said. ""I don't know how people fell for her schtick.""

A post shared by @elizabethholmesupdates

TikToker Rania Blaik who has over 10000 followers has posted several videos about Holmes. Her Instagram bio states she is an ""Elizabeth Holmes Stan."" Last June she said she went through a phase of posting memes of Holmes and tagging her as a ""girl boss"" as a joke. It quickly turned into more than that.

By August she was selling ""Elizabeth Holmes is my #GirlBoss"" T-shirts on Etsy for $22.25 each.

Blaik told LA Mag ""Having a fraudulent healthcare company with an awful culture and simultaneously being named Glamour's Woman of the Year is deeply funny.""

Blaik's store is no longer active but there is plenty more Holmes merchandise on Etsy in the form of mugs and T-shirts.

'Holmies' may be drawn to the subversive nature of idolizing a female villain

Not all of the idolatry is in jest however.

According to TikToker Serena Shahidi who has 424000 followers and frequently posts about Holmes a woman finding fanfare as a villian is admirable either ironically or un-ironically.

Shahidi told Insider that people love that ""there's a woman at the center of it all.""

""I guess there's empowerment in the idea of having a female villain because that's typically something that's like very taboo"" she said. ""There is something kind of progressive about the idea that a woman in the news isn't playing by anyone's rules.""

Male villain figures in popular culture have been idolized numerous times. ""Pharma Bro"" Martin Shkreli for instance who infamously raised the price of HIV and cancer drug Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 a pill has a fanbase.

In August a cult following emerged for TikToker Cameron Herrin after he was sentenced to 24 years in prison for vehicular homicide. Film characters such as ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" Jordan Belfort and ""American Psycho"" Patrick Bateman are frequently idolized.

Being a Holmes' fan may be a sign of an agreeable personality

Stephen D. Benning an associate professor of psychology at the University of Nevada Las Vegas who specializes in the personality disorder of psychopathy has a theory about the kinds of people who celebrate those who are widely regarded as having behaved immorally or antagonistically.

He told Insider the people who develop attachments to infamous public figures generally score highly in tests of agreeableness — defined in psychology as being kind considerate and inclusive when dealing with other people.

""Relatively agreeable people tend to be more likely to want to form these parasocial relationships"" he said. ""They are people who want to get along with others and who see themselves smoothing social interactions.""

People may see themselves in Holmes Benning said seeing their own mistakes and hardships in Holmes' which are playing out in public.

He said Holmies may think ""If someone so competent as Elizabeth Holmes could be taken advantage of so badly that might help explain some of the problems that I've had with people taking advantage of me as well.""

The women who dress up as her may perceive themselves as helping her in some way he said. This could be because they believe they are picking up subtle signs that she is a good person deep down.

During his senior year the alumnus took his knowledge of digital art and started making prints leading to the development of a full-fledged print shop. He said he started making prints to raise money for the 2020 presidential election campaigns through portraits of political figures beginning with one of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez then Cori Bush Bernie Sanders and Stacey Abrams. Between graduating during the pandemic and his initial political art the print shop was born and Shochat said he launched his Etsy shop and dedicated his Instagram account to promoting his work.

“(The print shop) started with those first couple of prints trying to raise money for certain candidates in the 2020 election and then … that made me decide to spend more time working with it (with) the success I had” Shochat said.

Although his business started with political prints Shochat said it quickly extended beyond partisan statements as he drew inspiration from other creative outlets such as various artists fashion and nature. He said his recent work incorporates American traditional tattoo style such as the classic Sailor Jerry technique with three distinct and recognizable elements: bold colors thick black outlines and specific imagery. Themes such as skulls skeletons flowers and animals are now central to his style Shochat said.

[Related: Student art shop explores the female form with abstract line pieces]

Such creative exploration and stylistic additions are indicative of Shochat’s artistic versatility said Shochat’s friend and print shop customer Leo Pollack. Pollack said Shochat has experimented more recently with patterns and subjects transitioning from his original portrait-style prints. For Pollack Shochat’s patterns are interesting because they warrant multiple viewings in order to understand the piece.

“It’s not like you can just look at it once and get the whole gist” Pollack said. “It’s always something you can look at and find different parts of the work that you haven’t noticed before or appreciated.”

With a largely online business Shochat said he had to learn to strategize while marketing his work. His political work sells more on Etsy because he said people more often search directly for specific figures such as Bernie Sanders rather than random images of a rat in space. Shochat said this disparity in sales is due to his choice of keywords in the listing of his work so he is still determining how to best utilize search engine optimization to ensure his work shows up more often in potential customers’ searches.

“I still do sell some of my nonpolitical work online every once in a while. … The people who are looking to find my … political artwork are more likely to find it online” Shochat said. “There’s not as specific of a definition for the other work that I’m doing. It’s just harder to get in front of people’s faces online.”

Company owners have also commissioned Shochat’s prints including skateboard company owner and friend James Jordan whose company sponsors Shochat. He said Shochat designed a logo and several sports graphics for the brand. These designs represent the Bay Area community and skateboarding culture including a graphic based on Bay Area pride a rose knife graphic and a rat in space graphic Jordan said.

Most recently Shochat said his print shop moved to the Melrose Trading Post. He began selling his work there in July and he said the in-person environment has given him more sales than his digital platforms. With an additional location for business other inspiring artists and new customers each Sunday Shochat said he has expanded his company.

“Getting into the art marketplace industry – starting to sell my own work at Melrose Trading Post – has been really helpful in terms of marketing myself” Shochat said. “I’ve just been able to meet so many new customers which has helped me grow my social media a good amount and meet other artists as well.”





[Related: Art Students Collective creates space for artists to connect build community]

Through his time at markets Shochat said he met other vendors who have introduced him to the newest development in the digital art realm: NFTs which allow artists to sell ownership of their original artwork and assign monetary value to it. The ownership of the digital artwork cannot be copied similar to how only one person owns an original painting. Since Shochat began learning about NFTs as a result of his experience at Melrose Trading Post he said it is something he is looking to get more involved in.

For Shochat the print shop enabled him to monetize his creativity but he said he needed some market experience before gaining confidence. Although he was hesitant at first to apply to the Melrose Trading Post Shochat said his sales at smaller markets gave him the confidence to reach out. In order to gain insight into artistic and marketing opportunities he needed to put himself out there Shochat said.

“That’s my thing I say: Put yourself out there and don’t hesitate to apply whether it’s a market or some other art show or other event” Shochat said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdG90YWxseXRoZWJvbWIuY29tL2dpYW50LXBpbmstZmxhbWluZ28tc2N1bHB0dXJl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Giant Pink Flamingo Sculpture Is One Of Four Amazing Art Exhibits Going In At The Tampa International Airport,"This post may contain affiliate links.

You are totally going to want to make a stop at the Tampa International Airport (TIA) next time you have a layover or a connecting flight.

Yes. I said the airport.

You are probably thinking “WTH?!? It’s a freaking airport. They are all pretty much the same. Hallways people planes. That about sums it up.”

Well not this one! Tampa International Airport is about to become a cool go-to spot for all those Instagrammers clamoring to get amazing selfies.

What am I even talking about? Well just keep reading. It’s about to get real up in here — really big and really cool!!

My sister is OBSESSED with pink flamingos? She accidentally started collecting them and hasn’t stopped.

I say “accidentally” because we just started buying her all the pink flamingo things and now it has become a whole thing.

Last birthday I got her these quirky Dancing Yard Flamingos and I even managed to surprise her with a Pink Flamingo Frappuccino off the Starbucks Secret Menu. I win the birthday gift-giving game!!

ThePhatMermaidShop – Etsy



Now I’m totally going to have to take her to the airport in Tampa Florida and I’ll tell you why.

TIA is about to get FOUR new art installations and the gem of the group is the giant floor to ceiling pink flamingo art piece called Home. It’s going in the section of the airport that houses the Shoppes at Bayshore.

TIA

HOME is a massive floor-to-ceiling sculpture that depicts a hand-sculpted resin and fiberglass flamingo as it gently dips its head beneath the surface of the water. The immersive installation located prominently near the Shoppes at Bayshore transports viewers underwater inviting them to walk up and share a simple moment in the life of one of Florida’s most well-known birds. Tampa International Airport

How cool is that?!? It’s going to be like you’re a tiny little fish underwater in the world of the flamingo.

This art piece is going to be last in the 4-part series and is expected to be completed in Spring of 2022.

TIA

There are three more art pieces you might want to check out.

Paths Rising which is currently being installed is a piece made entirely of ladders. Yes I said ladders. Like the ones you climb to put up Christmas lights.

TIA

It is going to be showcased on the ceiling of the Main Terminal near the SkyConnect station so make sure you look up!!

Then there’s going to be TWO murals that you won’t want to miss.

TIA

One mural by Jason Middlebrook of Hudson NY features a composition of local flora and fauna and will live on the northwest wall of the building. The other mural by Catherine Wagner of Oakland CA uses photos that are laser-etched onto anodized aluminum panels to depict a verdant landscape. The work will be located on the northwest wall of vertical circulation building. Tampa International Airport

TIA

Now if you go to Tampa International Airport you better send us pictures. We want to see them all especially that flamingo!!

Power Authority. Operated by PSEG Long Island the cable allows electricity to be transmitted between Long Island and Connecticut.

The articulated concrete block mattresses were developed by ECOncrete Tech Ltd. based in Tel Avi with New York office in partnership with Besser Co. under the BIRD Foundation funding framework in 2016. The Long Island project is the first full-scale deployment of ECOncrete’s ecological Marine Mattresses after pilot installations in Fort Lauderdale Fla. and Neptune N.J.—both having undergone comprehensive multi-year monitoring efforts for field validation.

The mattresses will provide ecosystem regeneration serving as a habitat for Long Island Sound marine life in addition to fulfilling the structural purpose of protecting the underwater cable. The project marks a major step to reduce the ecological footprint of offshore construction such as changes to native seabed ecosystems that can result in the dominance of invasive and nuisance species.

EXR,Extra Space Storage,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vaG93LXRvL2ZyZWUtdXAtc3RvcmFnZS1vbi1hLWNocm9tZWJvb2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to free up storage on a Chromebook,"Most Chromebooks ship with no more than 64 or 128GB of onboard storage. Even if you’re someone who exclusively works on the web it won’t take you long to max out that limited space. Your browser alone can accumulate gigabytes of cache data over time. Lucky for you there’s plenty of ways you can free up or expand your Chromebook’s storage.

Your Chromebook allows you to easily offload your local data to an online and external storage or you have the option to free up some of it by getting rid of the heaps of non-essential cache your device collects over the course of your usage. Here's how to get started.

Check how much storage you have left on your Chromebook

The first step to restoring your Chromebook’s storage is to check how much you have left and where you need to make cuts. Chrome OS offers a storage tool that can help you do just that.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Visit Settings > Device > Storage management on your Chromebook to get started. Here you’ll find a breakdown of your disk space and its current allocation across your Chromebook’s partitions including Android Google Chrome and Linux.

You can use the storage management utility as a starting point. If you spot a partition that’s taking up an unreasonably high amount of space begin by deleting any files you no longer need. This can be anything from clearing your Downloads folder to uninstalling Android apps.

Remove your least used Android apps and their cache

From the storage management tool you can’t tell which apps aren’t worth keeping around. For that you need the Play Store which lists your least used apps.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Go to Play Store > Manage apps & device > Manage. Select “least used” from the “Recently updated” dropdown. Check the box next to the app you wish to delete and hit the trash button at the top right corner.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Alternatively in case you don’t want to get rid of the app entirely you can wipe its cache to free up a portion of the space it’s consuming on your laptop. Apps save temporary data in their caches to speed up their launch times and remember information. They simply act like they’ve been freshly installed when you delete it.

To erase an app’s cache on your Chromebook head over to Settings > Apps > Manage your apps. Click the app’s entry navigate to More settings and permissions > Storage and select the “Clear Storage” button.

Manage your browser’s cache

Similarly Google Chrome stores all sorts of data on your Chromebook’s local storage to speed up your browsing. For instance for websites you often visit Chrome will cache their icons and other images. However after years of use Chrome’s cache can quickly end up blocking tens of GBs of space on your computer. So if your Chromebook has been gasping for storage lately it may be time to purge your browser’s cache.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

To do this go to Google Chrome > Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data. Check the “Cookies and other site data” and “Cached images and files” boxes. From the “Time range” dropdown pick how far back in your usage history this action should go and click “Clear data.”

Switch to web apps

Another way you can save space on your Chromebook is by switching to the web counterparts of your Android apps.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Web apps of the majority of popular services like Zoom offer all the features you’d expect from their Android client and the best part is they barely take any of your local storage. Many of them such as Google Docs can even work offline. Plus on Chromebooks you have the option to pin a web app to the taskbar.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

If you do decide to make this switch you should also consider uninstalling the Android partition entirely from your Chromebook to free up additional space. You can do this from Settings > Google Play Store > Remove Google Play Store.

Move your local files to the cloud

Instead of deleting files from your Chromebook you can relocate them to your cloud storage account. Your Chromebook’s Files app lets you link a range of online storage platforms including Google Drive Dropbox OneDrive and more and use them as just another drive in your file manager. Once you’ve done that you can easily drag and drop the files you don’t regularly require from your Chromebook to online storage and retrieve them later in a click.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

To connect an online drive to your Chromebook open the Files app. On the left sidebar you’ll already have a tab for your Google Drive storage. You can paste files and folders here from your local “My Files” section. Inside the Google Drive tab you can also click any file and toggle the “Available offline” option at the top to access it without the internet.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

For OneDrive and Dropbox  you’ll need to install third-party apps from the Chrome Web Store.

Expand Chromebook’s storage with microSD card

If none of these tips did the trick for you and you’re still struggling to find room on your Chromebook external storage expansion is your last resort. Most Chromebooks have a microSD card slot you can take advantage of to add tens of GBs of extra storage instantly. In case it doesn’t you can try investing in a compact USB flash drive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9uaW50ZW5kby1zd2l0Y2gtb2xlZC1zaG91bGQteW91LXdhaXQtb3ItYnV5LWEtc3dpdGNoLW5vd9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nintendo Switch OLED — should you wait or buy a Switch now?,"A new Nintendo Switch is coming on October 8. No it’s not the 4K Switch Pro we were hoping for but it does offer its own array of modest improvements that for some people will make it worth waiting for.

You can read about the key differences between the Nintendo Switch and Switch OLED here but in this piece I’ll try and give a more subjective viewpoint. If you’re dead-set on buying a Nintendo Switch — which you should be as it’s a fantastic system with a mature library of games — it might help you decide whether you should buy one now or wait for the Switch OLED.

Here are five reasons to wait for the release of the Nintendo Switch OLED and six reasons to buy the existing hardware right now instead.

5 reasons to wait for the Nintendo Switch OLED

(Image credit: Nintendo)

The Nintendo Switch OLED is set to be better on the go

While you won’t see much of a difference when playing your Switch OLED docked on the move it receives a handful of really useful quality-of-life improvements. The first one is in the name: OLED is generally regarded as being superior screen technology to the LCD panels used in the original Switch offering better contrast and deeper blacks.

But it doesn’t stop there. The new Switch’s OLED panel is 0.8-inches — or 13% — larger than the existing one without offering much extra bulk thanks to a reduced bezel. If you like to play the Switch in tabletop mode it also has a more sensibly designed kickstand which looks a whole lot less flimsy. In short if you’re out and about it’s set to be a markedly better experience than the current model.

Currently the Nintendo Switch only has Wi-Fi built in for downloading games and playing online and while that’s undoubtedly the convenient way to play it doesn’t offer the speed and reliability of a wired connection. The new dock comes with an Ethernet port built in so you can wire your Switch straight to your router for the best possible online performance.

There’s more space for games

The Switch OLED doubles the built-in storage on offer from 32GB to 64GB. Given most Switch games come in between 4- and 8GB that’s not insignificant.

Yes both models let you expand that storage with a microSD card but with Digital Foundry finding that the internal storage offers faster performance more space is definitely better.

(Image credit: Nintendo)

There may be hidden reliability improvements

OK so this one is a little speculative but it’s worth at least holding out to see. Since launch the existing Nintendo Switch has been plagued by something called Joy-Con drift where the built-in controllers gradually deteriorate until the analogue sticks begin to move a little on their own causing in-game problems.

Nintendo hasn’t said if the Joy-Con tech in the new models is better and it's notable that existing controllers will work with it. But it’s also possible that those fancy white Joy-Cons offer more than just a cosmetic improvement.

Patience can lead to price cuts

Nintendo has already revealed that the existing Switch will get a price cut in Europe when the OLED model arrives and while the American wing says it has no plans to follow suit that doesn’t mean that individual retailers won’t offer their own savings to try and clear stock.

In other words even if you don’t plan on buying a Switch OLED it may pay to wait.

6 reasons to buy a Nintendo Switch now instead

It’s basically the same console

For all Nintendo's attempts to outline the advantages of the new hardware it’s hard to get past the feeling that for the most part this is the same product and any improvements will feel marginal. It has the same processor outputs at the same resolution (both handheld and docked) has a very similar design and even has the same promised 4.5 to 9-hour battery life.

Put it this way: I have a first-generation Switch and I don’t feel remotely tempted to upgrade.

The storage is expansive so you don’t need the extra space

The 64GB of internal storage is a selling point but with the microSD card slot offering support for cards of up to 2TB in size it doesn’t feel entirely necessary.

Yes this may offer slower performance but without the two consoles side by side you’d be unlikely to notice. Plus if some games do perform better on the built-in storage 32GB is still ample for key titles given Switch games’ relatively small footprint.

Handheld mode may be better… but not as optimal as the Switch Lite

There are reasons to suspect that the Switch OLED will be a better handheld gaming machine thanks to its larger screen and OLED panel as outlined above. But if handheld gaming is all you want it for then you’re probably better served with the Switch Lite which is optimized for on-the-go play.

The original Switch feels more bulky and awkward in the hand and while good for portable gaming in a pinch it isn’t that comfortable for extended sessions. It’s hard to imagine that the Switch OLED will be much different.

It’s cheaper

Even without the tantalizing possibility of a price cut the older Switch hardware will be cheaper. While the new Switch OLED is set to sell for $350 the older hardware can be had for $299. Go pre-owned and the price difference will be even more stark.

(Image credit: Nintendo)

You get way more color choices

The Switch OLED looks very stylish in white but that’s currently the only option. Yes you can spruce it up with existing Joy-Cons but that’s just an added expense and any theoretical reliability improvements will be lost too.

The original Switch meanwhile comes in gray neon or limited-edition colors like Super Mario Red or Animal Crossing’s pastel shades.

There may be shortages

The Switch has been subject to stock shortages in the past but at the moment it’s reasonably easy to find Nintendo Switch stock. We don’t know what kind of demand there will be for the Switch OLED yet but given the difficulty in finding other games consoles in 2021 are you really happy to leave that to chance?

Bottom line

It may be 6-5 to buying an original Nintendo Switch right now but these points aren’t evenly weighted and holding on for the Switch OLED could well be better for you.

If money is no object and you’re happy to wait then the Switch OLED is objectively the better hardware. But it’s also possible that anybody who buys a Switch now won’t be missing out on that much. Until we've tested the new model we won't know for sure how much of an upgrade it is but if you're making a buying decision right now then we suggest you weigh up the pros and cons above and do what’s right for you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNoL2hvdy10by1kZWxldGUtYWxsLXByb21vdGlvbmFsLXNvY2lhbC1qdW5rLWVtYWlscy1nbWFpbC1nb29nbGUtZHJpdmUtY2xvdWQtc3RvcmFnZS00MTg0NzM1Lmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3czE4LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy90ZWNoL2hvdy10by1kZWxldGUtYWxsLXByb21vdGlvbmFsLXNvY2lhbC1qdW5rLWVtYWlscy1nbWFpbC1nb29nbGUtZHJpdmUtY2xvdWQtc3RvcmFnZS00MTg0NzM1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want to Delete All Promotional Social and Junk Mails On Gmail at Once? Here's How To Do It,"From Gmail to Google Drive Google offers 15GB of free space but there is no surprise that many exceed this limit after some time. Therefore it is important to know how to manage all the storage given efficiently unless you are paying Google for extra space. Every Google account starts with 15GB of free storage and it is shared across Google Photos Google Drive and Gmail. At first it may sound enough but considering that documents files and pictures range in a few megabytes nowadays the given space will not be enough for most users. Google bundles its storage plans under the Google One subscription option. For India users it starts at Rs 130 per month and Rs 1300 per year for 100GB of cloud storage that is shared across Google apps and services.

After paying Rs 1300 for a year you get 100 GB of storage on Google Drive that is shared across apps. If users still fall short of storage you can double this to 200GB by paying Rs 2100 per year or Rs 210 per month. If this is not enough there is a 2TB storage plan that is available for Rs 6500 per year and Rs 650 per month. In the US Google also offers 5TB and 10TB cloud storage plans. But since most users don’t want the added cost they should know how to free up space.

User can delete all the promotional junk and social emails on Gmail that unnecessarily take up storage. Here is how you can do it:

Step 1: Install an email application known as Inbox by Google

Step 2: Open the app and select priority inbox (here all your mails will be sorted into a number of categories including unread priority updates forums purchases and promotion).

Step 3: With this all your mails will automatically get marked in the above-mentioned categories.

Step 4: Now you can delete or archive all your mails from a certain section at once without doing the tedious job to select mails individually.

You can track all the emails in the respective categories by clicking on the 3 horizontal lines present on the left-hand side of the Gmail application.

What are some gaming room essentials?

A gaming room looks different for everyone but some items are pretty standard across the board. A basic PC gaming setup includes a desk a gaming chair at least one monitor a mouse a keyboard and of course the PC. However beyond that there are some handy gaming accessories. That can include headphones speakers and even mini-fridges for a decent snack and drink supply.

Gamers who plan on streaming might need a few more accessories: a camera a microphone and good lighting. Once all the basics are there some organizational tools can come into play like cable ties or clips a cup holder and a headphone stand.

For console gaming the setup needs a space for the consoles like cubes or a bookshelf. A TV/entertainment center is also essential as well as storage for controllers extra cables video game cases etc.

In a press release on Sept. 16 IKEA announced that its gaming collection would launch in October aimed at PC gamers. For help creating the collection the furniture store turned to one of gaming’s leading retailers: ASUS ROG. According to the press release the partnership’s goal is to “democratize the gaming experience” with affordable and stylish products for every gaming space.

“We believe there’s a lot to be done to democratize the gaming experience” IKEA’s Global Business Leader of Workspace Ewa Rychert said in a statement. “Now we take the first step on our gaming journey and we do it by presenting affordable high-performing gaming products and complete solutions that we hope reflect people’s personality and taste.”

IKEA and ASUS ROG created one of the collection’s six product families UPPSPEL together. However the other five — LÅNESPELARE MATCHSPEL GRUPPSPEL UTESPELARE and HUVUDSPELARE — were created by IKEA using what it learned from the gaming company.

“Our new partnership with the experts at IKEA will allow Republic of Gamers to find new and interesting ways to delight gamers in and around the home” added ASUS’ Gaming Gear and Accessory Business Unit General Manager Kris Huang.

John Bel Edwards appointed two new members to the 18-person board that regulates groundwater use in the Baton Rouge region less than three months after rejecting legislation that would have allowed employees from companies who use the groundwater to continue to sit on the commission without penalty.

Alvin Broussard the public works director and chief building official for the City of Gonzales is taking the seat that used to be occupied by Dennis McGhee. McGhee whose term expired in December is one of five current and former members of the Capital Area Ground Water Conservation Commission facing state ethics charges over their service on the board.

Edwards’ other appointee Patrick J. Engemann replaced Mark Frey who isn’t facing ethics charges. Engemann and Frey were both nominated by the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation which holds a designated seat on the board.

McGhee ran afoul of the ethics board because he is an employee of the Baton Rouge Water Company a private entity that supplies drinking water to the Baton Rouge region. State law prohibits employees from sitting on the regulatory bodies that oversee their own companies according to the ethics board.



The groundwater commission’s main purpose is to oversee the use of the Southern Hills Aquifer which provides the drinking water for over 600000 people in the Baton Rouge region. The Baton Rouge Water Company McGhee’s employer is one of the biggest users of the aquifer’s resources.

SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. DONATE

Several industrial companies also make use of the aquifer’s water to help run their plants. They too have historically had employees sitting on the groundwater commission.

Ryan Scardina who also works for Baton Rouge Water Company and Todd Talbot who works for ExxonMobil still sit on the commission even as they face ethics charges. Their terms have not expired yet.



Former commissioners Nelson Morvant who works for Entergy and Ronnie Albritton who works for Georgia-Pacific have been replaced but could still face penalties over their time on the board.

Environmental advocates and scientists have repeatedly raised concerns that the aquifer is being drawn down faster than it can be replenished raising the risk for saltwater intrusion that would make it unusable as a drinking water source. They question whether the groundwater commission has been conservative enough about private industry’s use of the aquifer.

But employees from the aquifer’s industrial users have sat on the groundwater commission without repercussions since its inception in the early 1970s and if the Louisiana Legislature had its way they would continue to do so.

State lawmakers passed legislation earlier this year to carve out an exception to the ethics law that allowed industrial users to continue to put their own employees on the commission. It also would have voided the current ethics charges being brought against the McGhee and the four other men.



Edwards vetoed the bill in late June.

“The industrial users of the aquifer can provide nominations of individuals that will not run afoul of the ethics code and my most recent appointees to the Commission do not have this issue” Edwards wrote in a letter explaining his veto.

While the governor said he couldn’t support industrial users continuing to sit on the commission he would support a narrower bill that erases the current ethics charges faced by McGhee and others.

“Should the legislature come back in the next session with an exception that is narrowly drafted to cure a previous inadvertent violation I will support it” he wrote. “I cannot support a broad exception for all members in the future.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZm9zc2lsLWZ1ZWwtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNwZW5kLW1pbGxpb25zLXRvLXByb21vdGUtaW5kaXZpZHVhbC1yZXNwb25zaWJpbGl0eS0yMDIxLTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fossil-Fuel Companies Spent Millions to Play up Your Carbon Footprint,"Marianne Ayala/Insider



Plastics companies spent millions to kickstart recycling programs and it helped them avoid bans.

Decades later fossil-fuel interests spend millions to promote carpooling and reducing energy use.

Activists and researchers say this individual-action narrative distracts from the biggest polluters.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Ben Franta is trying to collect every climate-related ad the oil and gas industry has ever produced.

Franta who is pursuing a law degree and PhD at Stanford is among a small cohort of researchers who track fossil-fuel industry propaganda. These historians social scientists and activists have documented the extent to which major oil companies knew their products were changing the climate as early as the 1960s and how they poured tens of millions of dollars into sowing doubt about the science through the 1990s.

""Not to get too tin-hat-y but once you start to see these ads over and over again you see the common elements arise"" Franta told Insider.

So it was clear to him that around the year 2000 fossil-fuel companies changed marketing tactics. After decades of denial they pivoted to blaming the climate crisis on you and me.

Franta pointed to a 2007 Chevron ad campaign called ""Will you join us?"" Each poster featured a person's face and a pledge – promises like ""I will leave the car at home more"" and ""I will finally get a programmable thermostat."" In small print Chevron describes its own initiatives to be energy-efficient.

On the campaign's now-defunct website users could even make pledges like carpooling to work a few days per week and a calculator would tell them how many DVDs they could watch with the energy saved.

""The framing is: 'No we the companies are the good ones. We're working on the problem and we want you the consumer to join us in our positive efforts'"" Franta said.

This approach – telling people to solve a crisis by changing their own habits – is a tried and true corporate tactic pioneered by the tobacco and plastics industries. Now fossil-fuel giants like Chevron BP and ExxonMobil have spent millions to convince the public that consumer choices and lifestyle changes will solve the problem.

""It's almost become natural when people think about the climate crisis to think of individual action"" Denali Nalamalapu a communications specialist for the climate organization 350.org told Insider. ""Which is super convenient for fossil-fuel corporations.""

But at this point personal lifestyle changes will not turn the climate crisis around. A report from the International Energy Agency which lays out a path to a net-zero-emissions energy system by 2050 estimates that individual behavioral changes would only account for about 4% of the necessary reductions.

To have even a 50% chance of stopping the world's temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius according to a study published this month 90% of coal and 60% of oil and gas reserves must stay in the ground.

A blame campaign: litterbugs and recyclers

In 1971 TVs across the US blasted a heart-wrenching PSA. In it an actor in ambiguous American-Indian garb his hair in two long braids climbs into a canoe and paddles across a river full of discarded newspapers. He passes an industrial barge. Smokestacks puff in the background. He pulls his canoe onto a garbage-strewn shoreline and climbs to a busy highway. A passing motorist chucks a bag of fast food at his moccasined feet.







""People start pollution. People can stop it"" a narrator says as the actor looks into the camera a tear rolling down his cheek.

This ""Crying Indian PSA"" as it's now known came from a nonprofit called Keep America Beautiful – a group funded by companies like Coca-Cola PepsiCo and Dixie Cups. It debuted at a time when single-use packaging lined streets beaches and parks and environmental activists had begun to rail against plastic pollution.

""That was an intentional well-funded effort to convince us all that the responsibility for pollution was on us on individuals on litterbugs rather than the companies that were flooding the world with single-use packaging"" John Hocevar a marine biologist who leads Greenpeace's oceans campaigns told Insider.

The tobacco industry did something similar in the 1950s hiring PR firms to create campaigns blaming smoking-related illness on smokers. But the plastics industry took the strategy further.

As local governments considered banning single-use plastics a council of plastic-producing companies – including Chevron Exxon Dow and DuPont – spent millions to implement recycling programs across the US. Their own scientists however had told them that recycling wouldn't work on a large scale according to an investigation by PBS and NPR.

""Making recycling work was a way to keep their products in the marketplace"" Ron Liesemer a former Du Pont manager who led the effort told PBS and NPR. ""It improves the image of the material.""

By 2015 the quantity of plastic produced each year had increased 10-fold from 1971. Less than 10% of that material has ever been recycled. Each square kilometer of ocean contains an average of about 13000 pieces of plastic.

Microplastics – fragments smaller than a fingernail that never fully break down – have been found in the Mariana Trench and at the top of Mount Everest. The average American ingests about 50000 microplastic particles each year and inhales about the same amount.

Plastic production is expected to double by 2040 and triple by 2050 according to the World Economic Forum.

""Just about everybody understands that we need to do something about plastic"" Hocevar said. ""The challenge is that many companies – well most companies – and many politicians are still thinking in this personal-responsibility frame and putting the emphasis on individual consumers. And so that really keeps the conversation focused on solutions that can't solve the problem.""

Exxon was on the council that led the charge for recycling and it soon started promoting personal-responsibility solutions to another crisis: global warming.

""Be smart about electricity use"" suggested a 2007 ad from the company (now ExxonMobil). ""Heat and cool your home efficiently."" ""Improve your gas mileage.""

Science historian Naomi Oreskes has studied ExxonMobil's climate communications for years.

""They talk about energy demand they talk about need they talk about use and they use the term 'consumers.' And this is basically a way of shifting responsibility away from the producers – that is to say them ExxonMobil – and onto the consumer"" Oreskes told Insider.

In a recent study Oreskes analyzed 180 ExxonMobil documents discussing climate change from 1977 to 2014. The set includes internal communications peer-reviewed publications and ""advertorials"" – ads that looked like editorials and ran in The New York Times.

Internal documents mentioned carbon dioxide more than 1000 times. Terms that appeared most included ""atmosphere"" and ""fossil fuel."" Advertorials by contrast relied on the terms ""energy efficient"" ""demand"" and ""need.""

BP (formerly called British Petroleum) took a similar approach. In 2004 it created the first ""carbon footprint calculator"" a way to pin greenhouse-gas emissions to people's daily activities.

""The carbon footprint calculator then took off as an idea and as a concept and really distracted us from looking at the industry itself"" Janet Redman the director of Greenpeace USA's climate campaign told Insider.

Nalamalapu said she calculated her carbon footprint as one of her first climate-change lessons in elementary school. So did I. By 2010 the popularity of the phrase ""carbon footprint"" had increased by about 1600% from 2006.

Climate scientist Peter Kalmus told ProPublica about how much he took this idea to heart. To reduce his carbon footprint Kalmus has raised chickens in his yard converted an old car to biodiesel and built an outdoor toilet to compost his family's poop. He's had nightmares about plane rides.

""It feels like the plane is flying on ground-up babies to me"" Kalmus told ProPublica.

BP Chevron and ExxonMobil say they're changing

In statements to Insider spokespeople for Chevron BP and ExxonMobil pointed to their companies' efforts to reduce emissions.

""Chevron is investing more than $3 billion from now to 2028 to advance the energy transition"" Chevron spokesperson Sean Comey said. ""Chevron believes the world's demand for oil and gas should be supplied by the most efficient least carbon-intensive producers.""

Comey also said the company is working to reduce emissions from its oil and gas extraction and is exceeding the goals it set for itself for 2023. He said that although ""too much plastic waste ends up in landfills oceans and rivers"" plastics ""are essential to modern life and help improve the quality of life for millions of people around the world.""

BP declined to comment on the company's carbon-footprint calculator but pointed to its net-zero goals and a recent acquisition of solar-energy projects which it aims to more than double by 2025.

""BP believes we have an important role to play in addressing climate change"" spokesperson Joshua Hicks said. ""That's why we launched a new ambition last year to become a net-zero company by 2050 or sooner and to help the world get there too. In line with that ambition we've set targets for drastically reducing our emissions and increasing our low-carbon investments and we're actively advocating for policies that support net zero.""

ExxonMobil meanwhile said it ""is working to reduce company emissions and helping customers reduce their emissions while working on new lower-emission technologies and advocating for effective policies.""

The company alleges that Oreskes has a conflict of interest pointing to her expert testimony in a climate-related lawsuit last year.

""This research is clearly part of a litigation strategy against ExxonMobil and other energy companies"" a statement shared by spokesperson Casey Norton said.

Oreskes said she has offered expertise ""in a number of capacities to groups and organizations involved in fighting climate change"" and does not see any conflict of interest.

BP still advertises its calculator today. One of its subsidiaries backs an app that tracks your carbon footprint in real time Grist reported. BP also made its biggest acquisition in 20 years in 2018: $10.5 billion of west Texas oil fields.

""They don't want a price on carbon they don't want incentives for renewable energy they don't want to block new fossil-fuel infrastructure"" atmospheric scientist Michael Mann told Insider. ""So they say: 'No it's just about you being a better person you being more responsible in your day to day activities.'""

A Chevron lawyer even said as much in federal court according to Grist: In 2018 the company argued that it's not oil production causing climate change ""it's the way people are living their lives.""

The ads Oreskes and Franta have collected show how much money fossil-fuel interests have poured into influencing the narrative on climate change. The American Petroleum Institute a fossil-fuel trade association spent $663 million on PR and advertising between 2008 and 2017 according to a report from the Climate Investigations Center.

The results Redman said can be insidious.

""It's easy to see that rhetoric that it's about individual responsibility and feel paralyzed and not take the kinds of political action that we need"" she said.

The stakes are only getting higher according to the latest report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For every half-degree of warming the frequency and intensity of heat waves and droughts increase. Even in the best-case climate scenario sea levels will rise nearly a foot over the next 80 years.

Still if you've dedicated time and energy to recycling or biking to work – don't despair. These choices if lots of people make them can make a difference. Nalamalapu takes reusable bags to the grocery store. Mann drives a hybrid car and doesn't eat meat. Oreskes has solar panels on her roof.

""We do all have personal responsibility. The question is: How do we balance that personal responsibility with the larger structural and political questions at stake? And what is the role of the fossil-fuel industry?"" Oreskes said.

""Riding our bikes is important. And turning off the lights not cranking the AC with a window open all that stuff is really important for sure"" Redman said. ""But it pales in comparison to political activity to change the rules about how our energy system is structured who the actors are who benefits who pays.""

Finance professionals rely on the company's free and paid services to conduct research and support their trading activities. In this article we discuss some of the top Bloomberg tools available and how they can be used in financial analysis.

Bloomberg Website

The Bloomberg website offers a wealth of free and subscription-based tools and utilities most of which offer customized views in each region or market.

News : Top headlines and market-moving news from all corners of the financial world.

Bloomberg Newsletters

These daily and weekly newsletters cover a host of financial topics some of which are exclusive to Bloomberg subscribers. Some of the topics include:

Market opening and closing reports

Regional reports from the Americas Asia and Europe

Environmental news and green finance

Technology reports and insights

Hollywood and Silicon Valley

Symbol Lookup Service

The Bloomberg Open Symbology tool allows users to search and map different symbols (for example a SEDOL CUSIP number ISIN a stock exchange ticker etc.) in use around the world.

Individual traders and investment firms use this service to consolidate data that arrives from multiple sources with different symbols. For example a mutual fund company might have two different data feeds: one from Bloomberg containing a Bloomberg symbol and the other from a stock exchange containing a local ticker. The Symbology service enables cross-referencing to validate data across the two sources. Another feature is its dedicated symbol search tool.

Bloomberg Professional Services

At the heart of Bloomberg's paid services is the Bloomberg terminal which has an installed base of 325000 units globally. The Bloomberg terminal connects users with markets tools and data feeds from around the world. It is supported by a news-gathering operation that employs more than 2700 journalists in 120 countries. The terminal also provides access to sell-side research and independent research from more than 1500 sources.﻿﻿

Apart from charts graphs technical indicators and market data coverage a key selling point of the Bloomberg terminal is its instant messaging feature which enables easy communication across individuals dedicated workgroups and Bloomberg representatives.

Other aspects of Bloomberg Professional Services include execution and order management; content and data feeds; financial data management; data integration and distribution; and the Bloomberg Tradebook which provides access to 125 markets in 43 countries.

The Bottom Line

Bloomberg is a world leader in providing financial information. While the vast majority of market information is freely available online professional investors have come to depend on Bloomberg for their financial analysis and trading needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you wanted to send a package from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv you would go to downtown Jerusalem and send it through one of the companies and your recipient would go to their office in Tel Aviv to pick it up. Twenty-Five years ago I ran a consumer-facing business where we tried to service customers outside Jerusalem. Back then I thought if only UPS operated in Israel it would transform business in the country. For many years I had a web-based consumer physical goods business in the US. Every day at 4 PM my local UPS man would show up and I would know that every package that was within 200 miles would arrive the next day guaranteed and the further from New York the time would increase all for little money. I could also ship via priority mail for $4; and my package would arrive within three days anywhere in the US. All of this without talking about other options that for more money could get my package delivered anywhere in the US by as early as 9 AM.

Well I received my wish… sort of. Today the brown-colored UPS trucks can be seen in Tel Aviv and their delivery personal are dressed just like their counterparts in the US. FedEx and DHL are also present as is the Israeli post office. But other than their superficial colors the Israeli versions of all these companies are hardly even a pale comparison to their foreign versions.

Receiving packages or even letters in Israel is a little like playing the roulette wheel in Las Vegas. Sometimes you win and sometimes…..

Let’s start with the loses: the postal services’ ability to deliver the mail. Recently I sent an envelope from my nearby post office (they have removed all the mailboxes so you cannot mail a letter without going to the post office) to my accountant two miles away in Tel Aviv. It was not urgent and the post office seems to have known that since it took over two weeks to make the journey. However when it comes to receiving packages from the post office the service is strangely erratic. It seems to work well for larger parcels with a delivery person coming to the house very soon after the package has arrived in the country. Smaller packages which in the past you would pick up at the post office have been outsourced to stores for pickup. In the case of the post office you do not get to choose where you want to pick up the package. In my case this past few months the box had gone to a store about a mile from my apartment-(there are three post offices closer). This particular store is a home goods store. When you arrive they direct you to go to the back of a cavernous store; there you find an old staircase which you have to descend to a poorly lit basement there you traverse until you come to a door where you are efficiently given your package.

UPS FedEx and DHL all use similar services for small packages. And all have provided rich stories in the last few months. About six months ago we received notice that package had been delivered to an ice cream store about a 15-minute walk from our house. My wife went to pick it up and when the proprietor said it was not there she asked if she could look. He then said she was not being nice to him and would not look for the package. The next day I went back and the same person refused to talk to me saying my wife was not nice and a few other choice words I will not repeat. He refused to give me the package; I of course complained to UPS. Their only solution two days later was to send a taxi to get the package and bring it for us. FedEx has generally been efficient even if they charge way too much to clear a package but we had one very typical Israel story last year.

The only thing our family still brings from the US after being back in Israel for the last ten years is Kellogs Corn Flake Crumbs a key ingredient in my wife’s Schnitzel recipe. In the pre-COVID era that was never a problem as there were always people coming and going from the US and Israel. Due to the pandemic we ran out and as it was not an item that Amazon ships to Israel my son to whom the Schnitzel is special took it on himself to order 12 boxes from Walmart and have them shipped FedEx to Israel. Unfortunately we did not know that under the rules of the Ministry of Health one cannot import more than 5 kilos of a particular food item. Even though several people told us that this rule is never enforced FedEx refused to clear the package. Its only solution was to break up the parcel into two. We said fine but they said they could not do it; we would have to come to the airport pay to receive the forms from the Tel Aviv Commerce Office and then physically break up the shipment and pick it up. In short after spending 4 hours at Ben Gurion airport we left with 8 of the 12 packages.

Two weeks ago we ordered a Kindle from Amazon and paid for expedited delivery. DHL handles those deliveries. We tracked the package and on Saturday night it was cleared from customs. I had been asked where I wanted the package delivered and their website pushed me to select a location. The nearest was about a kilometer from our apartment so I picked it and the site confirmed it would be delivered there. The DHL tracking site listed that it would be delivered on Sunday; the day passed and not a word from DHL on the delivery of the Kindle. The next day in the morning I called them. The agent told me I had made a mistake specifying delivery to one of their storefront locations since that takes longer. I asked her why their website pushes you to pick an alternative delivery? The only answer I received was that I should have chosen “other delivery options”on their site. In the meantime DHL had handed the delivery off to a subcontractor that did not work on the day before a holiday. The agent said hopefully the package scheduled to be delivered on Sunday would be delivered to the store on Thursday it was.

Now for the wins in Israeli delivery. When you order from Amazon and choose the slower speed it almost always arrives much quicker than promised. They generally use a a global delivery service which gives you many options for delivery; two are within a block of my apartment. The other service that works is FedEx and UPS delivery of overnight letters. Every time a bank in the US has sent me a credit card it has arrived in 3-4 days from the US.

On a final good note everyone in Tel Aviv knows the Wolt delivery service. The service allows you to order from hundreds of restaurants (and other food services) in Tel Aviv and usually receive delivery within 30 minutes. If only the established delivery services knew how to provide that level of service. Of course even Wolt has its disadvantage mainly delivery people that are in such a rush to make the delivery that they ignore traffic rules.

I was pretty sure I would. But then I’d seen an eclipse before and knew what was coming. And then at that moment when the moon moved from 99.9% coverage to 100% I screamed and raised my hands to the sky. It was a sacred moment and it was a terrifying moment. Two minutes and 37 seconds of holy terror. I felt scared and safe all at once.

In her famous 1982 essay “Total Eclipse” Annie Dillard describes it well:

“At once this disk of sky slid over the sun like a lid. The sky snapped over the sun like a lens cover. The hatch in the brain slammed.”



And so it did. But it wasn’t slammed shut not quite. Though there was instant darkness there was—like the sun’s corona surrounding the moon like a consecrated aura—light and meaning and purpose all magically mystically finding their way around those lunar edges stretching out into the sky and down to us on the planet below.

How could one not scream out of sheer joy and fear? It’s the most alive I’ve ever felt.

What we saw when we looked up

Our ORBITER team watched the eclipse on the campus of Clemson University right smack in the middle of the path of totality. A big shout-out to Clemson’s publicity team for their help throughout the day Southern hospitality at its best. (See a TON of Clemson’s photos here.)

(The Clemson folks even put together a stellar playlist for the crowds that had gathered—songs about space the sun the moon etc. But here’s one they missed.)

I wasn’t the only one who experienced strong feelings during the eclipse. Here are some reactions from my ORBITER colleagues:

Tara Collins Assistant Editor:



Being an alumnus of a SEC university I was curious how southern football culture would pervade the viewing of this celestial event—especially when the host is the defending college football champion Clemson University. When we started seeing images of a giant paw print eclipsing the sun I was worried they might over Tiger-ize the event. (Fortunately they didn’t. But they did bring out the marching band and cheerleaders and the Tiger mascot was eager for photo-ops.)

The Tigers hosted their guests well—from food trucks to an “eclipse-chaser” host—providing a day-long “tailgazing” experience to some 50000 people scattered across the campus.

This was my first total solar eclipse as admittedly I wasn’t alive for the previous one crossing America. I had heard that reactions could be a little surprising—from cries of fear to magnificent awe—and mine was quite the latter. With the abundance of telescopes on Clemson’s lawns I was wondering if I would truly be able to see the glory of totality (those couple of minutes when the moon completely obliterates the sun). Finally the last crescent sliver of the sun was hidden by the moon and awe completely took over. The rays from the sun’s corona were visible around the whole eclipse and my eyes were viewing the very same eclipse beauty that I had only seen captured in NASA images.

It was an incredible sight—from the beauty in the heavens to the 360° sunset around us to being with a crowd completely in awe. However dreamy an awe-stricken crowd may sound the reality of our time kicked in as awe was mainly experienced through shouts iPhones lifted to the sky and collegiate cheers roared across campus.

Dale Goldberg Director of Video:

I was somewhat unprepared for how incredible the experience of totality is. I live in an area where I would not have experienced totality but about 95% coverage of the sun. I had assumed that would be enough to get the full experience of the eclipse. In reality the difference between even 99% coverage and 100% is quite staggering. Even if a slight sliver of the sun is showing you get quite a bit of sunlight and even though it does get a little darker it’s nothing compared to the darkness of totality.

The best way to describe totality is like dusk with a giant ominous orb in the sky. The look of the moon placed against the sun is truly like something out of a movie. I didn’t expect the corona to be so bright but it is clear as day. You can see the sun’s corona branching out from around the moon as well as stars and planets all around. The mix of the corona stars and dusk-like colors combined with the eclipse in the sky create a sense of awe and wonder as you realize how utterly small and insignificant you are. When I’m reminded of how we are the only planet in the solar system that can experience an eclipse like this I feel incredibly lucky to be alive. If you have a chance to experience totality in 2024 do it! The experience is unforgettable.

This time he assembled a powerful telescope that has allowed him to photograph the Sun with incredible detail. In fact this latest picture is a 230-megapixel image that is the result of 100000 individual still photos—all taken in his backyard.

The fiery glow of the Sun is ever-present and the high-quality images that McCarthy captures mean that we can really get into the fine details of this dwarf star. This includes spicules or plasma jets that flare up from the Sun. He was able to get such crisp detail by modifying a refractor telescope made for nighttime usage with a daystar quark hydrogen-alpha filter and a Baader IV/IR cut filter. This allowed him to safely take images of the Sun and obtain incredible quality.

Surprisingly it only took about 20 to 30 minutes to capture all 100000 still photos. That is because McCarthy was shooting at high framerates that allowed for batches of 3000 photos at a time. While the actual shoot was easy the real challenge was making sure that his computer didn't run out of memory while downloading all the images.

Once the shoot was complete McCarthy went to work to process the photos. This first required converting all 100000 images and scanning them for imperfections such as birds planes or other distractions. Once that was complete McCarthy used special software that stacked the sharpest frames. This resulted in 50 stacked and sharpened images that he imported into Photoshop and composited into the finished image.

The result is a highly polished photograph that even took McCarthy by surprise. “Much of what I do is variable based on conditions during capture” McCarthy told My Modern Met “and I make sure to experiment with different processes throughout the project to ensure my work is always adapting and improving as I learn new methods. This final image was much clearer and had fewer compositing artifacts than I envisioned mostly due to the quality of the data captured.”

McCarthy has since moved to a new backyard but will continue keeping his eye out for transits and other celestial events that he can capture. If you like this particular photo you can find it along with many others for sale on his website.

Andrew McCarthy took 100000 photos in his backyard to put together this photo of the Sun.

At 230-megapixels the final image is incredibly detailed and even shows plasma jets on the Sun's surface.

Instead of relying on outdated manual paddling he built an autonomous solar-powered tugboat.

The tugboat uses a pair of molded fiberglass hulls in a catamaran configuration. The wide platform allows a pair of 100W solar panels to be mounted on top. It was [rctestflight]’s first time molding anything out of fiberglass so there was quite a bit of trial and error going on. The mold was 3D printed in sections aligned with dowel pins and glued together. After the epoxy had cured the mold halves could be split apart for easier removal of the hull.

As with most of [rctestflights] autonomous vehicles control is handled by a Pixhawk 4 running ArduPilot/ArduRover. A pair of 76 mm brass propellers powered by brushless motors provide propulsion and differential steering. The motors get power from six LiFePO4 batteries which charge from the solar panels via MPPT charge controllers. The hulls are covered with plywood decks with removable hatches and inspection windows. After a bit of tuning he took the boat for a few test runs the longest being 5.1 km with himself in tow in the kayak. At less than 5 km/h (3 mph) it’s no speedboat but certainly looks like a relaxing ride. Many of [rctestflight]’s previous vessels were airboats to avoid getting underwater propellers tangled in weeds. It was less of an issue this time since he could just haul the tugboat close to the kayak and clear the propellers.

[rctestflights] are always entertaining and educational to watch and this one certainly sets the standard for sea-shanty soundtracks at 13:32 in part two.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcHVibGljd29ybGQuY29tL3RlY2gvaW5kaWFzLWZpcnN0LXNvbGFyLW1pc3Npb24tYWRpdHlhLWwxLWxpa2VseS10by1sYXVuY2gtaW4tdGhpcmQtcXVhcnRlci1vZi0yMDIyLWlzcm8v0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVwdWJsaWN3b3JsZC5jb20vdGVjaC9pbmRpYXMtZmlyc3Qtc29sYXItbWlzc2lvbi1hZGl0eWEtbDEtbGlrZWx5LXRvLWxhdW5jaC1pbi10aGlyZC1xdWFydGVyLW9mLTIwMjItaXNyby8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India's first solar mission Aditya L1 likely to launch in third quarter of 2022: ISRO,"Advertisement

India's first solar mission which was delayed from early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to launch in the third quarter of 2022 at the same time as the country's second space observatory Xposat which will aid astronomers in studying cosmic sources such as pulsars and supernovae according to senior officials from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). At a briefing this week Dr Unnikrishnan Nair director of the human spaceflight centre stated that the solar mission Aditya L1 will be launched in the third quarter of next year (2022) and will reveal deeper insights into the beginning of the cosmos and many other unknowns.

The spacecraft will be launched 1.5 million kilometres from Earth to L 1 Lagrangian a position between the Earth and the Sun where the gravitational pull of both bodies on the satellite is equivalent to the centripetal force required to keep the satellite in orbit. It's like a parking lot in a space where you may see various events without being disturbed.

The other strictly scientific mission that the space agency will conduct next year is Xposat. It will be launched aboard a small satellite launch vehicle that is still in development. The new launch vehicle is expected to fly for the first time in December of this year. After two successful development flights ISRO declares a launch vehicle mission-ready.

Solar Mission Aditya L1

ISRO will be able to investigate the polarisation of celestial occurrences thanks to Xposat. It will be launched via an SSLV that is currently in development. The first development flight is scheduled for the end of this year. Academicians are eager to see the data gathered by this mission Nair said.

The SSLV which is being designed for commercial small satellite launches costs only 30 crores as opposed to 120 crores for a polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) said reports. The SSLV can be assembled in seven days by a team of six scientists compared to a team of 600 that takes several months to assemble a PSLV.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the number of launches ISRO could conduct in 2020 and 2021. There have only been four launches in the last two years one of which was a purely commercial launch with the main payload being a Brazilian earth observation satellite dubbed Amazonia-1.

Aramark and the Browns have beefed up a few concession offerings as positive predictions and energy about the Browns are expected to lead to a full house on Sundays. Restaurateurs – and longtime Browns fans - Michael Symon (B Spot) and Rocco Whalen (Rosie and Rocco’s) will maintain a presence in the stadium. But three additional stands have been brought in:

“Tenders Love and Chicken”

Located on the main concourse near section 129 the new stand showcases chicken sandwiches – a spicy version and signature sandwich - country-style fried-chicken cutlet with thick-cut apple-smoked bacon Vermont cheddar Roma tomatoes leaf lettuce house pickle and herb remoulade on a butter-toasted sesame-seed potato bun. It also will have premium chicken tenders with a variety of special sauces and more.

The stand “is being added because we have recognized how much fans enjoy some crispy chicken and French fries at the game” said Jessie Jacobson Aramark general manager.

Aramark had a trial run Thursday night at the stadium during the Paraguay-U.S. women’s soccer match. Jacobson said the stand was “a huge hit” as the U.S. team went on to a 9-0 rout.

“We had people flocking to the location” she said.

Walk Thru Bru

Additional “Walk Thru Bru” stations have been installed. Basically it’s a beer store on site. The first one was put in on the 100 level in 2019.

“It was so successful and we were able to get a lot of people through the location” Jacobson said. “So as we look for having a full-capacity crowd this season we wanted to add some more.”

That means there will be five stations total: One on the 300 mezzanine level on the west side one on each side of the 500 level and a second one coming in October on the 100 level. They will offer about 10 craft and domestic beers canned cocktails hard seltzers and wine.

Similar stations in Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse and other sports venues are automated via an AI-based self-checkout system but the ones at FirstEnergy use a standard cashier said Kevin Kearney Aramark district manager of sports and entertainment.

“It’s very effective” he said. “I think you’re going to see more and more of this type of technology evolve.”

Sauce the City

Vic Searcy’s Sauce the City will open in FirstEnergy Stadium. Aramark is familiar with Searcy who had participated in Taste of Black Cleveland events at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse and has a presence in the arena. He also operates Sauce the City Cleveland food hall at West 25th Street and Detroit Avenue.

It will be available to ticketholders in the Moen Lake Club and the 7UP City Club. Menu items include the D’ETE chicken sandwich Cleveland hot-chicken sandwich chicken tenders with signature sauces fries and street corn. It will debut Sunday when the Browns host Houston at 1 p.m.

“He is a fun and young and energetic entrepreneur and he’s really working hard at growing his business” Kearney said. “It’s been fun to work with Vic the last few years.”

At nine of its service centers including in Parkersburg Mon Power will store used utility poles that will be redistributed to other parties — such as farmers mills charitable organizations and even employees — for direct reuse. Alternative uses for poles typically include fencing parking bollards guide rail posts landscaping or treated wood construction.

“We are committed to reducing waste and improving our recycling efforts and this is an exciting opportunity for us to adopt a more environmentally friendly practice and find new uses for our secondhand utility poles in West Virginia” said Jim Myers president of FirstEnergy’s West Virginia operations.

If a utility pole is damaged and no longer fit for use Mon Power will remove any utility hardware from the pole and store it at one of its participating service centers. Each pole which weighs roughly 50 pounds per cubic foot must be at least eight feet in length to be part of the reuse program.

When Mon Power has collected a full load of approximately 25 poles the company will work with Blackwood Solutions a transportation and materials management firm to pick them up and distribute them for reuse. The poles will be delivered at no cost to interested parties who are willing to accept a full load can be accessed by tractor trailer and are located within a certain distance from the collection sites.

In the past Mon Power’s discarded poles had been cut into smaller pieces and stored on site until a waste management company took them to a landfill for proper disposal. While it could take up to a year for Mon Power to accumulate a full load of poles to be recycled the program is expected to reduce Mon Power’s waste stream significantly over time as most poles weigh between 300 and 4100 pounds.

The company will review the program over the next 12 months and consider expanding it to additional locations in its service territory. The pole recycling program was first piloted last year at Ohio Edison a FirstEnergy electric subsidiary.

More information about the pole recycling program is available at www.bwoodsolutions.com or by calling 812-676-8770.

Mon Power serves about 395000 customers in 34 West Virginia counties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53a3ljLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwvYnJvd25zL2NsZXZlbGFuZC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLWdlYXItdXAtZm9yLWVjb25vbWljLWJvb20tYnJvd25zLXJldHVybi1mdWxsLWNhcGFjaXR5LWZpcnN0ZW5lcmd5LXN0YWRpdW0vOTUtYjE0MTU5MTYtNjY1YS00MzJlLWJlMDgtN2RjNGY3M2Q0MjU50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Businesses get ready for Cleveland Browns' home opener,"The Browns will entertain the Houston Texans in the home opener at FirstEnergy Stadium on Sunday at 1 p.m.

How can I make sure I'm in my seat on time?

The Browns offered a number of best practices for fans to ensure the most efficient entry into FirstEnergy Stadium Sunday.

Before the game fans should download the Browns Mobile App and also access their tickets in advance adding them to their Apple Wallet or Google Pay and transferring them to the guests in their party ahead of time. Fans should be downtown by 11:30 a.m. and head to the stadium early with their mobile ticket ready to be scanned.

Fans can also enroll in the Express Access program which utilizes touchless facial recognition technology with their tickets. Fans upload a selfie and valid ticket to the game under their account. Once at the game fans with the Express Access program will receive a confirmation email that will allow those with it to enter the stadium seamlessly through the marked Express Access lanes at each gate without the need to present a ticket.

When does the Muni Lot open?

While buses and other tailgating vehicles began lining up Saturday morning the Muni Lot Cleveland's popular tailgating area does not open until 7 a.m. Sunday.

Those planning to head to the Muni Lot for pregame festivities are encouraged to arrive early. Traffic officers will be on site directing traffic.

What are the Muni Lot rules?

While some rules are more strictly enforced than others Cleveland police remind tailgaters of Muni Lot protocols including:

No open pit fires

Propane grills only (No charcoal)

No alcohol

Saving spaces prohibited

You will be charged for all parking spaces that you occupy

No in & out privileges

All litter must be dispensed in trash containers

Vandalism of any type will not be tolerated

Crossing the shoreway is prohibited

No private latrines.

Lanes must remain clear of activity at all times

Cleveland police said violation of the rules may result in ejection from the parking lot.

Are there vaccination and masking policies at the stadium?

At this time there are no mask or vaccine mandates in place at FirstEnergy Stadium. However the team ""strongly encourages"" fans regardless of the vaccination status to wear a mask when in indoor spaces like the concourse Browns Pro Shop elevators and club areas.

Fans who are not vaccinated are strongly encouraged to wear a mask at all times unless actively eating or drinking.

What are the traffic changes for the game?

The Browns issued the following information regarding traffic changes ahead of Sunday's game:

Vehicles commuting into downtown are recommended to use alternate traffic routes and minimize usage of the Shoreway’s E 9th Street Lakeside Avenue/W 6th Street and W 3rd Street.

Continuing in 2019 road closures of East 9th and West 3rd Streets will be implemented between Lakeside Avenue and FirstEnergy Stadium including Shoreway/State Route 2 exits around the stadium. Rolling road closures will begin 1.5 hours prior to kickoff and end after postgame egress.

Recommended entry points to Downtown Cleveland are W 25th Street off Eastbound Route 2 when approaching from the west side of Cleveland and Superior Avenue off 90 W when coming from the east side. Additionally this recommendation to use W 25th Street off Eastbound Route 2 is notable as W 6th Street will be closed as part of the rolling pregame road closures.

During the road closures that begin 90 minutes prior to kickoff (see above) all Browns parking pass holders and guests with disability drop-offs will only be able to reach FirstEnergy Stadium by use of North Marginal Road from East 55th Street (Exit 175 on I-90).

What players will be in the game?

As of Saturday there have been two Browns players ruled out for Sunday's game—wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. (knee) and offensive lineman Chris Hubbard (tripceps). Offensive lineman Michael Dunn (back) cornerback Troy Hill (hamstring/foot) wide receiver Anthony Schwartz (knee) center JC Tretter (knee) and left tackle Jedrick Wills (ankle) were all listed as questionable prior to the game.

The Browns will release a final injury report with a list of inactive players 90 minutes before kickoff.

Go ahead grab it and give it a little shake. The plastic case your card goes into is sometimes replaced by a phony case which captures your pin and card info while you’re conducting a legitimate transaction. When you’re walking away from the ATM don’t react to any “Watch Out For Pickpockets!” signs you might see. Police in Hungary discovered that pickpockets themselves were putting up the signs. That’s because people instinctively reach for their valuables when warned of pickpockets immediately telegraphing where da loot at.

If you think there’s lots of fraud happening in the real world wait until you see what’s happening in the digital world. That’s probably why Feedzai another private company to recently join the unicorn club is gaining traction for its machine learning platform to prevent and detect fraud and money laundering in the financial services sector.

Fraud is on the Rise

And if you believe the statistics – many of them from Feedzai which issues quarterly financial crime reports – fraud in the financial services sector is out of control. All banking fraud across the Internet telephone and in-person banking (people still do that?) – grew 159% in the first quarter of this year compared to the last quarter of 2020. Online banking which accounts for 96% of all banking transactions made up 93% of all fraud cases. The analysis reportedly covers more than 12 billion global banking transactions.

But let’s remove the implied bias and turn to a neutral party: The consumer credit reporting behemoth TransUnion comparing a similar period of time said that suspected financial services digital fraud attempts increased 149%. That’s what we could call a growth market:

Growth of the fraud detection and prevention market in billions. Credit: Statista

With a company name that’s impossible to spell over the phone Feedzai seems to be putting itself in the pole position within the fraud detection and prevention market.

A New AI Fintech Unicorn

Founded in 2009 the Silicon Valley-based startup has raised $277.5 million in disclosed funding with most of the money coming from a massive $200 million Series D in March. That vaulted the company to a valuation of $1 billion.

While most of the names on the investor list skew toward the venture capital (VC) side of the spectrum such as Sapphire another notable name is the venture arm of Citigroup (C). It’s usually a pretty good sign when one of the largest banks in the world not only buys your product but also invests in it including an undisclosed venture round back in 2016. In fact Feedzai’s war chest may be north of $300 million as the private company just raised another undisclosed venture round at the beginning of this month from a little VC firm based in Madrid Spain called Conexo Ventures. The investment will make a little more sense later on in our story.

How Does Feedzai Use AI to Detect Fraud?

The answer: Pretty damn quick. The startup claims its platform can calculate a risk score in three milliseconds evaluating thousands of decisions to score a transaction in real time. Machine learning models identify patterns in the transaction by analyzing customer behaviors and profiles as well as leveraging external third-party data that the models use to assess the risk of the transaction and detect financial crime patterns. Customers can customize the models by adding other rules and lists to fine tune the decision to approve reject or review. The result is reportedly transparent with clear documentation for the decision.

The Feedzai AI platform clearly documents its decisions and provides cool-looking visualization tools to detect larger patterns of fraud. Credit: Feedzai

But it’s not all up to the machine: A risk analyst reviews the transaction scores and fraud alerts passing on anything suspicious to a company’s senior data analyst. This person uses Feedzai’s AI-powered visual analysis tool called Genome which can help uncover larger patterns of financial crime and fraud. All decisions are fed back into the machine learning model to improve performance over time.

Feedzai Use Cases

The platform protects financial institutions against funny business involving account openings transactions and money laundering. Its clients include retail banks payment processors and merchants among others. Feedzai claims it monitors companies that serve more than 800 million customers in 190 countries with products protecting half of the populations in the UK and Canada as well as four of the five largest banks in North America. But here’s the stat that really caught our attention: More than 20% of the world’s money flows through the Feedzai platform according to the company.

In addition to Citibank other large financial institutions such as Fiserv (FISV) and Santander (SAN) are also customers along with fintech companies like SoFi (SOFI) and Mox by Standard Chartered. Another customer that is part of the new generation of financial institutions is SafetyPay a digital alternative payment platform focused in Latin America and Europe. SafetyPay allows consumers to shop online via bank transfer or cash without sharing their information online. Feedzai comes into the picture by monitoring patterns in payment activity and comparing them against a customer’s historical data to authenticate transactions.

Feedzai Acquires Revelock

No doubt Feedzai will take some of its new fortune to further build out its platform. In fact the company wasted little time doing just that by acquiring Madrid-based Revelock a behavioral biometric platform for an undisclosed amount of money last month. Founded in 2015 the startup had raised $14.3 million to date. Most of the investors are headquartered in Spain including a name that showed up earlier – Conexo.

Biometrics employs various technologies to verify or authenticate identity including everything from facial recognition on your iPhone to voice verification to the way you handle your mobile device. In the case of Revelock the company has developed a hybrid AI model that powers BionicID a unique digital identifier that is created by collecting each user’s thousands of biometric behavioral device and network data points. It continuously analyzes user behavior from login to logout across every interaction. If everything appears cool the session continues uninterrupted. Otherwise Revelock goes into action which might involve verifying the user with stepped-up authentication terminating the user session or locking the account.

Apparently ticks are part of the threat intel. Credit: Revelock

Feedzai has some grand plans around this acquisition to create the “world’s largest Financial Intelligence Network a vault of more than a trillion data points sessions and profiles of both good and bad actors.” The network would combine Feedzai’s 150 billion data points for fraud detection with Revelock’s BionicID a sort of human digital twin based on how it’s described. Of course every session promises complete anonymity to “ensure people are treated as people and not as data points.”

Conclusion

The digital shift of the economy is becoming seismic with The Rona shaking things up even harder when people started treating paper money like the plague with ATM withdrawals down 58% in 2020. About 41% of consumers switched from cash to online/phone payments and more than half of them do not plan to switch back to cash according to Zelle the mobile payment app that defaults to sharing your every transaction on social media. Meanwhile the bad guys haven’t missed a beat finding new ways to separate people from their money and identities. Fintech companies like Feedzai are betting they can outsmart them with artificial intelligence.

Giannis Antetokounmpo was without a doubt the best player in Milwaukee Bucks this season. It is surprising that he won his first championship even before the age at which Michael Jordan or LeBron James won their first. He has set himself on a path to the Hall of Fame in the NBA.

The Greek Freak’s path to his first championship was not easy. But it was not as difficult as it could have been had many of his opponents not faced crucial injuries like the Brooklyn Nets did not have James Harden or Kyrie Irving for most of the games in their series.

So the question emerges had teams been healthier would the Bucks still win the championship? And what would Giannis have to do to repeat the success of this season for the Bucks?

NBA Legend Robert Horry certainly believes that for Giannis’ success at the Bucks Mike Budenholzer needs to go. Seven-time NBA Champion Horry has never been shy of his critique of Bud and he has now openly admitted on his podcast that Giannis needs a better coach than Mike.

NBA Legend on how Giannis Antetokounmpo can win more NBA rings

On his own podcast Horry said “The one thing that I respect out of Giannis is he said ‘I ain’t friends with nobody you know I want to do this thing and go out and win.’

“So I respect his championship I respect it and if he’s able to do it again I would be his biggest fan. But he just needs a better coach than Bud.”

All NBA followers know the Bucks had their season saved by Kevin Durant’s “big a** foot.” At the beginning of the playoffs the Bucks were not favorites to win this championship. Arguably they got to the finals out of sheer luck.

Therefore many critics around the NBA have questioned whether the head coach deserves the contract extension he got at the end of August. Despite the glory even in July on ESPN’s The Jump Horry admitted he felt Mike did not deserve that. He felt that the franchise should have waited to give him that extension.",,,,,,,,,

Ford recently announced the Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center is one of three Michigan plants to receive a $250 million investment and an extra 450 jobs to meet demand for the new 2022 F-150 Lightning.

Ford already has taken more than 150000 reservations for the new electric version of its immensely popular F-150 pickup truck Kumar Galhotra Ford’s president of the Americas said during a news event Thursday.

“As the orders have been coming in as the reservations have been coming in it was just time for us to (increase) the capacity to meet that demand” he said.

Galhotra made the announcement at the new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in the automaker’s hometown of Dearborn where the first pre-production trucks are being made.

Ford provided tours of the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center to members of the media as well as government officials including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer who said the facility “will be a place where the future is determined and built by the hard-working men and women of the UAW.”

Ford officials hope the F-150 Lightning will be the catalyst that hastens America’s transition from gasoline to battery-powered vehicles. The new truck which will be available to customers by next spring will be able to travel up to 300 miles (480 kilometers) per battery charge and carries a starting price of around $40000.

Ford’s $250 million investment will create 450 hourly direct jobs with most of those workers assembling the F-150 Lightning at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center. Workers at the Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti will assemble batteries and the Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center on Van Dyke Avenue at 18 Mile Road in Sterling Heights will increase its capacity to supply electric motors and electric transaxles for the Lightning.

The investment and added jobs will help increase production capacity to 80000 trucks a year Ford said.

“Electric vehicles aren’t a foofoo California car” Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell of Dearborn said. “They are what real Americans drive.”

In late August the Sterling Heights plant formally installed a sign to signify Ford was no longer operating as the Van Dyke Transmission Plant and switching over to its growing electric vehicle lineup

September 18 2021 — A Ford F-150 class action lawsuit has been dismissed after the plaintiff alleged the aluminum side panels hoods and roofs corrode because the paint bubbles and peels away.

The one Ford F-150 owner who filed the class action lawsuit claims the paint peeled on the roof hood and side panel followed by corrosion of the body.

The plaintiff says a dealer technician told Ford there was probably defective primer applied to the truck not defective paint. The technician allegedly said the evidence showed the paint simply didn't stick to the primer.

The class action lawsuit says Ford allegedly knows about F-150 paint and primer problems based on technical service bulletins (TSBs) issued to dealerships.

The F-150 class action mentions how Ford had always used steel for their trucks but switched to aluminum to make the trucks lighter and more fuel efficient.

One TSB (04-25-1) goes back to 2004 because of complaints about 2004 Ford F-150 trucks with bubbling under the paint on the aluminum body. Ford said corrosion of the aluminum was caused by iron particles entering the aluminum body before it was painted.

Model year 2004-2007 Ford F-150s were mentioned in TSB 06-25-15 because of corroded aluminum and TSB 16-0028 informed dealers about aluminum corrosion in 2004-2016 Ford F-150 trucks.

Another bulletin (TSB 17-0062 for 2002-2017 F-150s) went so far as to tell technicians to replace any aluminum body panels that were corroded.

According to the F-150 class action lawsuit an extended warranty offered by Ford really doesn't help truck owners because the warranty says the aluminum must perforate. The plaintiff says this won't happen because aluminum will never perforate.

Ford F-150 Class Action Lawsuit Dismissed

According to court documents Ford and the plaintiff resolved the lawsuit to the satisfaction of both parties.

""Pursuant to Local Rule 83.13(b) it is respectfully requested that the Court direct the Clerk to remove any upcoming deadlines and dates for this matter from its calendar and that the Court provide Plaintiff and Defendant with twenty-eight (28) days with which to complete their settlement and file a Stipulation of Dismissal pursuant to Fed.

Ford Motor Company Does The Right Thing Replaces New Vehicle With New Vehicle.

My brand new 2021 Ford Explorer ST died just three months into use on July 28th. Ford Motor Company just replaced the vehicle after the company couldn’t locate one part after trying for 40 days.

BY: ANDREW COLTON | Editor and Publisher

BOCA RATON FL (BocaNewsNow.com) (Copyright © 2021 MetroDesk Media LLC) — I wrote back in August about my brand new Ford Explorer ST — a beautiful vehicle that inexplicably died on July 28th — roughly three months after I drove it off the lot. Dying near Target in West Boynton Beach Ford roadside assistance sent the flatbed that took the Explorer to Grieco Ford on Federal Highway in Delray Beach. I assumed it would be fixed in a day. And if this was 2019 it would have been.

But in our 2021 world of COVID-related supply chain issues what should have been a simple fix never happened. A $28 wiring harness which was defective and led the car to smoke and eventually die couldn’t be obtained by Ford. Its supplier quite simply wasn’t supplying.

If you want to skip to the end here it is: After nearly 50 days of being unable to locate the wiring harness Ford replaced the Explorer ST with a brand new Explorer ST. I took delivery of the new car earlier this week. While BocaNewsNow.com is not known for praise I can not praise Grieco Ford Delray enough. Service Manager Jarrod Pilone became my advocate with Ford. His near daily emails took the professional tone and tact of a doctor sharing bad news with the family of a loved one needing a heart transplant. If it were an episode of a hospital drama he’d be the doctor suggesting there’s always hope but with no hearts in stock it’s time to pray.

The prayers went unanswered. The days turned into weeks. My Explorer remained dead on Grieco’s lot.

While Jarrod worked with Ford to obtain the wiring harness I worked with the Better Business Bureau. Under Florida statute a car may need to be replaced or repurchased by the automaker if it remains out of service and unfixable for a specific amount of time — normally 30 days. To make a “lemon law” claim there is a very specific checklist that must be followed which includes opening a case with the BBB. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody’s website explains it all. We’re linking to it below.

With Jarrod and the Better Business Bureau on my team Ford surprised me. After I rejected an offer of $1500 from Ford to basically go away the BBB scheduled mediation on my behalf. But before we ever made it to the mediation table Ford did the right thing. The company offered to buy back my dead SUV or replace it.

For those not following car inventories as COVID-related chip shortages continue it turns out there is very little inventory on most car lots and there is almost no ability to negotiate on what exists. That led me to realize that I really had one option: have Ford replace the vehicle with a similar vehicle. That’s where Grieco Sales Manager David Lyons and Fleet Manager Paul Wuest made magic happen. David worked with me while Paul worked with Ford Motor Company which secured and purchased an Explorer ST from Grieco’s inventory. Ford then gave me that vehicle.

Nearly 50 days after my new Explorer ST died I’m back in a new Explorer ST. There was no cost to me at all.

Nothing is ever quite as simple as it should be and new vehicles shouldn’t die — and be unfixable — just months after acquisition. But Grieco turned a bad situation into a customer service win.

Jarod David and Paul helped me every step of the way. When loaner cars were available — also a rarity in 2021 — I was able to use one. When bad news came in from Ford’s suppliers they passed the bad news to me directly. There was no sugarcoating but there was advocacy. I truly felt Grieco was on my team. And if the company ended up profiting when Ford bought the car it gave to me as the replacement so be it. Grieco worked hard for the sale.

It is a rare day that I recommend anything to anyone but I absolutely recommend Grieco Ford to anyone in the market for a Ford. Not only is their new dealership on Federal Highway gorgeous but the team that I worked with is a professional group of individuals.

I also have to thank a Lacey at Ford corporate in Michigan. She oversaw the replacement and also was a true professional.

Bad things happen. Sometimes vehicles break. But even with the craziness of COVID-19 both Ford Motor Company and Grieco Ford in Delray Beach truly turned a frown upside down. Jarod Paul David Lacey: thanks.

Ford to Unveil New Expedition at Motor Bella: https://t.co/T70uSmCSmw via @NAIASDetroit — Mike Levine (@mrlevine) September 17 2021

Based on the F-150 platform ever since the first generation rolled out for the 1997 model year the family-sized Expedition will receive minor styling tweaks. Based on test mules captured by the carparazzi most of these changes are focused on the grille bumper headlights and the DRLs.As far as the cabin is concerned prospective customers will be much impressed by the SYNC 4 touchscreen infotainment system of the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. The 15.5-inch display will be complemented by a digital instrument cluster of course along with over-the-air updates.SYNC 4 relies heavily on the cloud which is why FordPass Connect with 4G LTE connectivity and a Wi-Fi hotspot also have to be mentioned. Oh and by the way SYNC 4 offers the convenience of wireless implementation of Apple CarPlay Android Auto as well as SYNC AppLink applications.Ford BlueCruise also needs to be mentioned a hands-free highway driving assistant offered on 2021 model year F-150 and Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with the Ford Co-Pilot360 Active 2.0 Prep Package. Bear in mind however that BlueCruise is a Level 2 driver-assist system just like the haphazardly named Autopilot withCapability offered by Tesla and the General Motors Super Cruise system we know from Caddy.The 2022 model year Expedition lineup will add a new trim level for adventure-minded customers. Timberline is how the Ford Motor Company designates the newcomer which features unique front-fascia garnish badging more ground clearance and Goodyear Wrangler all-terrain tires.

To that point Homa had traded three birdies with two bogeys and Mickelson two birdies and a bogey as they both turned in pedestrian front-nine scores of 1-under 35. But the pep talk worked.

Mickelson strung together five birdies in a row after a sloppy bogey at No. 12 and Homa went one better with six birdies in all including the final three holes. It added up to 67 for Mickelson and 65 for Homa as they charged up the leaderboard at the Fortinet Championship in the third round.

“Max playing as well as he did shooting 6 under on the back made my round feel not as great but it was still fun” Mickelson said.

Homa who won the Genesis Invitational in February enters the final round two strokes behind in a tie for third at 12-under 204 as has thrived playing the opening two rounds alongside World No. 1 Jon Rahm and Saturday with fan favorite Mickelson.

“I won my first event playing with I think World No. 1 at the time Rory on Saturday. I won Riviera playing with World No. 1 at the time DJ. It just makes it fun. I believe in my game a lot more the last two three years so it’s fun to go out there and play with arguably one of the best golfers of all time and arguably the best golfer in the last 30 years” Homa said. “When you’re playing well with the crowds you kind of feed off it too. I don’t really get that many people watch just me so it’s nice to have somebody help bring some people to the golf tournament.” Of Mickelson he added “It’s always fun playing with a legend you get to watch him just will that ball in the hole sometimes.”

Lefty was even for the day after blocking a 4-foot putt left of the hole. But it didn’t deter him. He capped his five-birdie stretch with a 24-foot birdie putt at No. 17.

“I just felt like I had been putting really well all week and I just needed to settle down and let one go in not force it” said Mickelson who improved to 10-under 206 through 54 holes. “I needed to get a couple of fairways hit because so much easier from the fairways getting to these pins. I just rolled a couple in so it was nice.”

Mickelson has been using a longer arm-lock model this week and has found it mostly to his liking. He ranks fifth through three rounds in Strokes Gained: Putting.

“It’s how I putted as a kid. Like I always had a lot of forward press and all it’s doing now is getting in the same position as a kid but it’s getting to that same position every time” explained Mickelson. “I’m not overpressing I’m not underpressing so my launch characteristics when I get on the Quintic system is very consistent and that’s what I’m looking for.”

Mickelson’s hot run on the back nine lifted him into the top 10 (T-9) heading into the final round and lurking just four strokes behind leaders Maverick McNealy and Jim Knous.

“I’m in a position where a good round tomorrow will do some good and it’s fun to have a little later tee time and to feel some of the nerves and so forth” Mickelson said. “I know I’m going to have to shoot probably 7 8 9 under par to have a chance but either way it’s fun having that chance.”

Earlier in the day Webb Simpson made a move to get into the trophy hunt shooting 7-under 65 before the leaders had even teed off and is tied with Mickelson at 10 under.

“I think if I’m within five there’s a chance” Simpson said. “This is a golf course as you guys know where you can shoot 10 11 under. There’s that many scoring clubs in your hand. But we’re supposed to have wind tomorrow so this course is fun to play because it’s the right kind of challenging. They’re giving you birdie opportunities but it’s hard to make birdies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBnYXRvdXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sYXRlc3QvMjAyMS8wOS8xOS9waGlsLW1pY2tlbHNvbi1jb21lcy11cC1zaG9ydC1hdC0yMDIxLWZvcnRpbmV0LWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phil Mickelson comes up short at Fortinet Championship - PGA TOUR,Mickelson has 14 career TOUR wins in California tied with Tiger Woods for most since 1983 and will remain at that number for now.

The world’s largest music company behind stars including Taylor Swift Drake and the Beatles will debut on Amsterdam’s Euronext stock exchange with shares to be distributed to Vivendi’s investors. The move comes amid rising interest in the resurgent music business as an investment and following a recent boom in the value of music catalogs music-streaming companies and technology for creators.

Analysts value Universal Music above €40 billion equivalent to about $46.9 billion higher than recent estimates and transactions indicate. In August the company was valued at €33 billion when billionaire William Ackman bought a 10% interest through his Pershing Square Holdings Ltd. hedge fund. The purchase came after Mr. Ackman scrapped ambitious plans to use his special-purpose acquisition company or SPAC to invest in Universal  citing Securities and Exchange Commission concerns.

MILEY CYRUS REVEALED SHE ALMOST HAD A PANIC ATTACK AT A RECENT CONCERT AMID RETURN TO STAGE AFTER LOCKDOWN

Last year Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd. doubled its stake in Universal to about 20% in a deal that valued the business at about €30 billion.

When the shares list the Tencent-led consortium will have a 20% stake and Mr. Ackman’s entities and Vivendi each will have 10%. The rest will be distributed to each Vivendi shareholder. As a result French investor and former chairman of Vivendi Vincent Bolloré will hold an 18% stake. There are no restrictions on investors that would keep them from selling the shares upon receiving them.

Tencent and Mr. Ackman have expressed interest in holding Universal long-term. Vivendi said it would hold on to its stake for at least two years to remain associated and for tax reasons. Whether Mr. Bolloré chooses to hold on to his stake—which would be worth roughly €6 billion at a €33 billion valuation—will be closely watched by investors and analysts.

Because Mr. Bolloré controls Vivendi via a 27% stake that means he will control some 28% of Universal either directly or indirectly. People close to Mr. Bolloré said it was unclear what the tycoon would do with his stake though they expect he will likely hold on to it for a while.

Mr. Ackman has laid out a bullish case for music  pronouncing it a better streaming business than video and drawing comparisons to the software industry. ""You need food and water to live but music comes next"" Mr. Ackman said. ""If you own UMG you own a royalty on people listening to music.""

At its capital markets day presentation to analysts last month Universal executives said they expect revenue to grow by more than 10% this year at constant currencies and profit to rise by double that amount.

The targets led Barclays to increase its valuation of the company to €41.4 billion from €38.5 billion. JPMorgan analysts said they believe their base case value of €54 billion ""will prove conservative.""

Once public analysts say Universal will be the best way to participate in the music market. Competitor Sony Music Entertainment is accessible only as a small piece of Japanese conglomerate Sony Group Corp. ; Warner Music Group Corp. has less than 15% of its stock listed publicly and is controlled by billionaire Len Blavatnik.

‘HOME IMPROVEMENT’ 30TH ANNIVERSARY: HOW MUCH TIM ALLEN MADE ON THE SHOW

Universal’s prospectus outlines the growth prospects of the music business in which it commands some 40% market share. The more big acts it has under its umbrella the more Universal makes from its licensing agreements with music-streaming services such as those offered by Spotify Technology SA Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Nine of the top 10 recording artists of 2020 by sales—and slices of the 10th—are on its roster according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.

After years of decimation because of piracy and plummeting CD sales the music industry has been growing since 2016 thanks to the rise of music streaming. ""Even with its strong growth in recent years UMG believes streaming is still in the early stages of global penetration"" the music company said pointing to technological innovations across devices and formats such as voice-controlled speakers and connected cars. It also highlighted music’s intersection with social media and gaming and licensing opportunities in digital health and fitness industries.

Vivendi is cashing in on its longtime prized asset. The French company which dates back to the middle of the 19th century will be left with businesses that include French pay-TV group Canal Plus ad-holding firm Havas and publishing company Editis as well as small divisions like the videogame maker Gameloft. (On Wednesday Vivendi struck a deal to increase its stake in French media group Lagardère SA to 45.1% and indicated its intent to take over the entire company.)

Vivendi has held Universal since 2000 when it bought the media assets of Canadian conglomerate Seagram Co. then controlled by the Bronfman family.

Mr. Bolloré has made a fortune over the past three decades by seizing control of businesses often without paying a premium. It took Mr. Bolloré less than two years to effectively take control of Vivendi after exchanging some pay-TV operations he owned for a small stake. Though his holding company remains Vivendi’s No. 1 shareholder Mr. Bolloré was replaced on Vivendi’s board by his son Cyrille in 2019 one year after another son Yannick succeeded him as chairman.

Mr. Bolloré’s handling of Universal has further enhanced his reputation as one of Europe’s more skilled if sometimes unpredictable corporate tacticians. Since Mr. Bolloré took the helm Vivendi has rebuffed offers for Universal when the music company was valued at far less than it is today.

In 2015 Vivendi ignored calls from the U.S. hedge fund P. Schoenfeld Asset Management to sell some or all of Universal and use the funds to boost cash returns. In 2013 Vivendi rejected an $8.5 billion offer for Universal from Japan’s SoftBank Corp.

Internally Universal management has enjoyed a hands-off approach according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Bolloré backed Chief Executive Lucian Grainge on acquisitions and let the company’s results which have outperformed any other Vivendi unit by sales and profit speak for themselves the people said.

As streaming revenue rose in recent years Vivendi repeatedly teased the idea of floating all or part of Universal arguing that the increasing value of the music business wasn’t reflected in its own share price. Vivendi’s sales of stakes in Universal ahead of the listing added around €10 billion to the company’s coffers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9zaG9wLXZhYy12YWN1dW0td2lsbGlhbXNwb3J0LWxvd2VzLWNoaW5hLTIwMjEwOTE5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shop-Vac rebounds in Pa. under Chinese ownership after near-death experience,"Sandy Fox assembles a Shop-Vac vacuum cleaner on the company's assembly line in Williamsport Pa. Shop-Vac was left for dead a year ago by its previous owner but it got picked up by GreatStar Tools USA owned by a big Chinese tool maker. GreatStar has gotten Shop-Vac back up and operating in Pennsylvania under American management. Read more

WILLIAMSPORT Pa. — A year ago the founding family of Shop-Vac Corp. left town and abruptly shut down the iconic vacuum company leaving bankers to clean up the mess. Many workers feared that the company would be stripped and scrapped and that production of yet another American brand would be sent overseas.

But something happened on the way to extinction. The bank indeed sold Shop-Vac’s assets to a Chinese company. But the new owner through its subsidiary GreatStar Tools USA decided to keep Shop-Vac’s operations in Williamsport led by new American managers.

More than 200 of the old workers -- about half of the previous Pennsylvania workforce -- were retained or rehired this year. If the company rebounds as hoped the new managers say 100 more could be hired in the next year.

“We’re still in business” said an elated Brian Machmer a 25-year Shop-Vac veteran. He repairs the giant injection molds used to produce plastic canisters hoses and nozzles for wet-dry vacuums which were invented here in north-central Pennsylvania and now occupy places in millions of garages and shops across America. “I plan on finishing my career here” said Machmer 58.

“It’s very positive very exciting” said Robin Keller 42 a product manager who was let go by Shop-Vac last year found another job and then was persuaded to return to his old company in June.

Previous owners left a mess

Keller and others said the new Shop-Vac’s atmosphere is refreshing compared with the gloom of working at a company that had lost its bearings got buried under debt and could not compete.

Everybody knew there was mismanagement under the leadership of Jonathan Miller whose father founded Shop-Vac in 1953. But the company’s secretive leaders said little to the workforce and less to the community.

“It was scary” said Vincent Knauff 59 the engineering lab manager who has worked for Shop-Vac for half of his life. “You were scared to pick up the phone scared to answer a page.” Knauff who was unemployed for more than four months after the closure was announced on Sept. 15 2020 was rehired by the new owners this year.

Chinese owners went with a seasoned executive

GreatStar Tools USA which owns several other American hardware brands including Arrow Fasteners the maker of heavy-duty staple guns hired Charlie Lawrence a veteran marketing and brand management executive to turn around Shop-Vac.

Lawrence 63 grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs and has worked at several firms across the country including the last nine years as president for Workrite Ergonomics a California manufacturer of height-adjustable office accessories.

Lawrence said he and his wife longed to return to Pennsylvania to live near their son a pharmacist in West Norriton when GreatStar recruited him for Shop-Vac. His mission: Rebuild Shop-Vac’s culture and restore harmony with the mighty home-improvement store chains that control the retail market for hardware.

Rebuilding relationships

“A lot of relationships were damaged with our retail and distribution partners” said Lawrence who grew up in Parkesburg Chester County. “We have been spending a large part of our energy rekindling those relationships. Some have been very receptive because our competitors didn’t do a very good job while we were absent.”

Shop-Vac has signed a deal to supply Menards a Midwestern home-improvement chain with 300 outlets. And Lawrence said that the company is close to sealing a deal to be a primary brand at Lowe’s the second-largest national home-improvement chain after Home Depot. Lowe’s had been a key outlet for Shop-Vac before the company closed last year and it also has long-established supply relationships with other GreatStar Tools brands.

Shop-Vac’s pitch to retailers is that because it still produces the larger vacuum units in Pennsylvania it can more quickly fill orders than its major competitors who have moved nearly all production of wet-dry vacuums overseas. Deliveries of imported goods have slowed because of post-pandemic supply-chain congestion and logistics is no longer cheap: The cost to ship a container from China to America has soared to more than $20000 up from $3500 Lawrence said.

“That is putting incredible cost pressure on our competitors” said Lawrence. “It’s also creating empty shelves for the retailers and distributors because the supply is so unreliable. That’s a big advantage for us.”

As a bonus for Williamsport GreatStar is also relocating some manufacturing operations to Shop-Vac from another subsidiary SK Hand Tools a suburban Chicago company GreatStar acquired in July. SK makes premium ratchet wrenches and the kinds of tools that are now produced and used in Shop-Vac’s facility so GreatStar saw synergies in relocating some of its operations from Illinois to Shop-Vac’s sprawling plant.

“Chicago is a little higher-cost market to operate than in Williamsport” said Lawrence.

Business and political leaders in Williamsport who were blindsided by Shop-Vac’s closure are delighted with the company’s revival. They had feared the worst.

Jason Fink president of the Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce said that GreatStar was the only potential Shop-Vac buyer interested in maintaining operations in Williamsport. GreatStar outbid “a couple of U.S.-headquartered vacuum companies that were looking at shipping the brand to Mexico” he said.

When GreatStar announced in December it was buying Shop-Vac for $42 million the prospect of Chinese owners taking over one of Lycoming County’s prized manufacturers was not universally applauded. Amid a polarized political climate in which China is frequently cast as a villain Fink heard much grumbling that the new buyers would surely impose a Chinese work culture or worse dismantle operations and move out.

Fink said GreatStar’s actions speak to a company that is reestablishing local roots. Shop-Vac joined the Chamber of Commerce and reached out to community leaders something the previous owners had shunned.

“Shop-Vac has made a commitment to the Williamsport Area which is very good news” said Williamsport Mayor Derek Slaughter.

Shop-Vac held a two-day sale

Lawrence whose expertise is in marketing said he has changed some practices to send a more positive message to the workers and the community. He converted the old chief executive’s wood-paneled office into a conference room and moved his workspace among the other administrative offices. When he walks on the factory floor workers exchange friendly banter.

In August Shop-Vac held a two-day tent sale at its headquarters to empty its warehouses of odd lots of vacuums that it acquired at a discount from the previous owners. Its very American workforce conducted the sale. Buyers with pickup trucks lined up to buy Shop-Vacs at 40 cents on the dollar and the company sold $160000 in vacuums and filter bags in two days.

“I wanted to say thank you to the community and make sure the community knew we were back in business and we’re here to stay” said Lawrence. Employees told Lawrence the previous managers would never have conducted a similar event. “It’s part of building the culture giving to the community” he said.

A former employee at Shop-Vac sued the previous owners of the company in federal court in June alleging that Shop-Vac Corp. violated the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act by laying off workers without the required 60-day notice. But the current owner Shop-Vac USA LLC is not a party to the lawsuit.

Gary DuBoff the chief executive of GreatStar Tools USA said his company saw the Shop-Vac acquisition as a rare opportunity to acquire a brand so well-known that its name is synonymous with all wet-dry vacs. Though many people doubted him Duboff said GreatStar never considered dismantling the company.

“Once they found out who GreatStar was I don’t think anybody believed that this thing wasn’t going to close down and move to China and that would be the end of it” said DuBoff. “But that was never our plan. We all along wanted to make this more or less a U.S. manufacturing base and to try and bring it back to its former glory.”

DuBoff who grew up in Northeast Philadelphia and got a communications degree from Penn State said he encountered similar concerns four years ago when GreatStar acquired Arrow Fastener in Saddle Brook N.J. where he was president.

At the time GreatStar told him it only wanted to buy the company if the management team the employees and the plant were part of the deal. Under Chinese ownership he said nothing really changed in the way Arrow Fastener operated.

“Basically they said to me `We are not as familiar with operating a business in the United States as we are outside so we are relying on the team’s expertise to continue to run this business successfully’” said DuBoff. “And to their credit they have absolutely adhered to that. We do not have culture clashes because they don’t really operate the day-to-day business.”

GreatStar’s owner

GreatStar Tools USA is owned by Hangzhou GreatStar Industrial Co. Ltd. which describes itself as a leading manufacturer of hand tools in Asia serving markets worldwide. It was founded in 1993 by Qiu Jianping 59 an entrepreneur who has a master’s degree in engineering. Qiu also controls Hangcha Group one of China’s largest suppliers of forklift trucks and parts.

About $974 million or 71% of Hangzhou GreatStar’s $1.4 billion in 2020 sales were made in the United States according to the company’s annual report. Though its shares are traded on the Chinese stock exchange Qiu and his family own a controlling interest. Qui is listed as a multibillionaire by Forbes.

Lawrence said Qiu sometimes sends emails containing broad guidance for the company but is “very much hands-off.”

GreatStar seems to be following what it called a “glocal” approach to the U.S. market in which the parent company takes a global role for strategy and direction but leaves operational decision-making to local managers said Charles J. Skuba professor of the practice at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.

“They seem to be bent on this local management approach to the U.S. market which seems to be pretty smart” said Skuba.

But Skuba also cautioned that the early stages of foreign direct investment “are always the stage of big promises” and that the hand-tool industry does not have huge growth prospects. There likely will be some consolidation and reductions at Shop-Vac as GreatStar optimizes costs among its various operating units.

Lawrence acknowledges that Shop-Vac is unlikely to employ the 400 people who worked in Williamsport before last year nor the 1700 employees worldwide before it closed. GreatStar Tools USA will take over some of the marketing and distribution -- it maintains sales offices near the headquarters of major retailers like Lowe’s Home Depot and Walmart to service its big retail customers.

And Shop-Vac will consolidate operations in Williamsport from three buildings to two and is looking to sell surplus vacant properties it owns in Canton Pa. and in Binghamton N.Y. where the previous owners manufactured motors for its vacuums before relocating that business to Asia several years ago.

Lawrence said Shop-Vac will continue to produce motor assemblies for all of its vacuums in Asia and it will also continue to produce small Shop-Vacs -- under four gallons -- in China or in Vietnam to reduce tariff costs. Those smaller household vacuums sell at a lower profit margin and they can still be produced in Asia at a lower cost.

“The only way we’re going to be able to rebuild this company is to be smart” said Lawrence. “Obviously we’re going to need workers to do that. But we’re going to be more efficient about how we do things.”

The alternatives could be worse according to Skuba the Georgetown business expert:

He has signed a global commentary deal with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. A nightly talkshow will be central to the plans of a new venture talkTV which is to be launched “early next year”. Morgan’s show will also air on Fox Nation a streaming spinoff from Fox News in the US and Sky News in Australia making him a daily presence on three continents. He can also be enjoyed – or avoided – in print where a twice-weekly column will appear in the Sun and the New York Post and in a book deal with Murdoch’s HarperCollins publishers.

Morgan who stagily stormed off the set of Good Morning Britain in March will seemingly no longer be “silenced” by “cancel culture”. He will instead be given global amplification as part of a new battle for the small but economically significant audiences for right-leaning news. The media village gossip is part of a much larger pattern of change affecting all mainstream newsrooms and challenging how broadcasters think about bias opinion news and their own presenters. It is also part of a testing of the generational tensions within journalism where the hunger for diversity and broader representation is creating economic opportunities for those mining the often older whiter righter and richer demographic.

The talkTV venture is clearly a personal project of Rupert Murdoch who turned 90 this year and it reassembles his dream team of the News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks and Morgan – both once rising stars on the pages of Murdoch tabloids. The project is tinged with the sense of a last hurrah: Fleetwood Hack going on the road or indeed an old firm of bank robbers getting together for one last job.

The project does feel strangely old-fashioned in a world where the subscription newsletter service Substack backed by venture-capital millions has been siphoning commentators with large followings. Stories of how a successful Substackers can pull in $1m a year have unsettled columnists and the emerging world of even higher rewards for talking heads on streaming platforms such as YouTube creates as much intrigue as incredulity.

The question for talkTV is therefore whether a mainstream media dinosaur gatekeeper such as News UK can compete with the multiplatform rightwing bloviators with low production costs who are steadily gnawing away at core audiences. As Fox News in the US has demonstrated combining the leverage of legacy with the costs and reach of technology platforms has proved highly successful for companies who are unconcerned with reflecting a diversity of opinion or have a famously tenuous relationship with the truth.

It is also significant that News UK not so long ago ruled out producing a fully fledged TV channel suggesting it was “not commercially viable”. The arrangements and formats of talkTV have yet to be finalised – it will be reportedly be available to be streamed on smart TVs and as a traditional channel. In News Corp’s global results announcement in August its chief executive Robert Thomson attributed a very upbeat picture for the media divisions to global content deals signed with Facebook and Google: “These deals which are confidential will add revenue annually into nine figures and are a profoundly positive sign of the ongoing transformation of the news landscape.”

The unveiling of the Morgan/Murdoch vehicle follows a series of disasters at GB News the rightwing news channel launched in June that has been beset by technical and editorial issues. Their own star defection from mainstream media Andrew Neil left after an amateurish launch made the station a laughing stock. It has been reported that Neil was locked in a legal battle with the channel as he tried to extricate himself from the mess. It is tempting to speculate that Neil was aware of the shadow moves by Murdoch and his key executive Brooks to recruit Morgan and launch a rival to GB News though whether this played any part in his desire to leave is uncertain. Just as the Conservative party under Boris Johnson moved rightwards to squeeze out Brexiteer threats so Nigel Farage and his beer garden of followers on GB News may find themselves outflanked by the more professional talkTV.

Mainstream news broadcasting which is constrained in the UK by Ofcom from having an explicitly political lens to its coverage lurches along in a sea of social media interest optimised for emotion and outrage. The hard expensive work of reporting the news has always suffered in relation to the cheaper business of discussing the news. Facebook one of the most successful advertising companies in history has suffered a series of recent embarrassments on the public relations front (uncovered by Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal) with its content moderation reportedly goes easy on individuals with large followings. Despite outrage at its real-world political effects Facebook’s lightly moderated publishing strategy remains fundamentally unaltered – because it is wildly wildly profitable.

In this sense the arrival of talkTV says as much about Murdoch’s keenly opportunistic business instincts as it does about ideology and culture wars – or indeed his own desire to have something else to watch amid pandemic TV bingeing."

The world’s largest music company behind stars including Taylor Swift Drake and the Beatles will debut on Amsterdam’s Euronext stock exchange with shares to be distributed to Vivendi’s investors. The move comes amid rising interest in the resurgent music business as an investment and following a recent boom in the value of music catalogs music-streaming companies and technology for creators.

Analysts value Universal Music above €40 billion equivalent to about $46.9 billion higher than recent estimates and transactions indicate. In August the company was valued at €33 billion when billionaire William Ackman bought a 10% interest through his Pershing Square Holdings Ltd. hedge fund. The purchase came after Mr. Ackman scrapped ambitious plans to use his special-purpose acquisition company or SPAC to invest in Universal  citing Securities and Exchange Commission concerns.

MILEY CYRUS REVEALED SHE ALMOST HAD A PANIC ATTACK AT A RECENT CONCERT AMID RETURN TO STAGE AFTER LOCKDOWN

Last year Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd. doubled its stake in Universal to about 20% in a deal that valued the business at about €30 billion.

When the shares list the Tencent-led consortium will have a 20% stake and Mr. Ackman’s entities and Vivendi each will have 10%. The rest will be distributed to each Vivendi shareholder. As a result French investor and former chairman of Vivendi Vincent Bolloré will hold an 18% stake. There are no restrictions on investors that would keep them from selling the shares upon receiving them.

Tencent and Mr. Ackman have expressed interest in holding Universal long-term. Vivendi said it would hold on to its stake for at least two years to remain associated and for tax reasons. Whether Mr. Bolloré chooses to hold on to his stake—which would be worth roughly €6 billion at a €33 billion valuation—will be closely watched by investors and analysts.

Because Mr. Bolloré controls Vivendi via a 27% stake that means he will control some 28% of Universal either directly or indirectly. People close to Mr. Bolloré said it was unclear what the tycoon would do with his stake though they expect he will likely hold on to it for a while.

Mr. Ackman has laid out a bullish case for music  pronouncing it a better streaming business than video and drawing comparisons to the software industry. ""You need food and water to live but music comes next"" Mr. Ackman said. ""If you own UMG you own a royalty on people listening to music.""

At its capital markets day presentation to analysts last month Universal executives said they expect revenue to grow by more than 10% this year at constant currencies and profit to rise by double that amount.

The targets led Barclays to increase its valuation of the company to €41.4 billion from €38.5 billion. JPMorgan analysts said they believe their base case value of €54 billion ""will prove conservative.""

Once public analysts say Universal will be the best way to participate in the music market. Competitor Sony Music Entertainment is accessible only as a small piece of Japanese conglomerate Sony Group Corp. ; Warner Music Group Corp. has less than 15% of its stock listed publicly and is controlled by billionaire Len Blavatnik.

‘HOME IMPROVEMENT’ 30TH ANNIVERSARY: HOW MUCH TIM ALLEN MADE ON THE SHOW

Universal’s prospectus outlines the growth prospects of the music business in which it commands some 40% market share. The more big acts it has under its umbrella the more Universal makes from its licensing agreements with music-streaming services such as those offered by Spotify Technology SA Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Nine of the top 10 recording artists of 2020 by sales—and slices of the 10th—are on its roster according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.

After years of decimation because of piracy and plummeting CD sales the music industry has been growing since 2016 thanks to the rise of music streaming. ""Even with its strong growth in recent years UMG believes streaming is still in the early stages of global penetration"" the music company said pointing to technological innovations across devices and formats such as voice-controlled speakers and connected cars. It also highlighted music’s intersection with social media and gaming and licensing opportunities in digital health and fitness industries.

Vivendi is cashing in on its longtime prized asset. The French company which dates back to the middle of the 19th century will be left with businesses that include French pay-TV group Canal Plus ad-holding firm Havas and publishing company Editis as well as small divisions like the videogame maker Gameloft. (On Wednesday Vivendi struck a deal to increase its stake in French media group Lagardère SA to 45.1% and indicated its intent to take over the entire company.)

Vivendi has held Universal since 2000 when it bought the media assets of Canadian conglomerate Seagram Co. then controlled by the Bronfman family.

Mr. Bolloré has made a fortune over the past three decades by seizing control of businesses often without paying a premium. It took Mr. Bolloré less than two years to effectively take control of Vivendi after exchanging some pay-TV operations he owned for a small stake. Though his holding company remains Vivendi’s No. 1 shareholder Mr. Bolloré was replaced on Vivendi’s board by his son Cyrille in 2019 one year after another son Yannick succeeded him as chairman.

Mr. Bolloré’s handling of Universal has further enhanced his reputation as one of Europe’s more skilled if sometimes unpredictable corporate tacticians. Since Mr. Bolloré took the helm Vivendi has rebuffed offers for Universal when the music company was valued at far less than it is today.

In 2015 Vivendi ignored calls from the U.S. hedge fund P. Schoenfeld Asset Management to sell some or all of Universal and use the funds to boost cash returns. In 2013 Vivendi rejected an $8.5 billion offer for Universal from Japan’s SoftBank Corp.

Internally Universal management has enjoyed a hands-off approach according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Bolloré backed Chief Executive Lucian Grainge on acquisitions and let the company’s results which have outperformed any other Vivendi unit by sales and profit speak for themselves the people said.

As streaming revenue rose in recent years Vivendi repeatedly teased the idea of floating all or part of Universal arguing that the increasing value of the music business wasn’t reflected in its own share price. Vivendi’s sales of stakes in Universal ahead of the listing added around €10 billion to the company’s coffers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9zaG9wLXZhYy12YWN1dW0td2lsbGlhbXNwb3J0LWxvd2VzLWNoaW5hLTIwMjEwOTE5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shop-Vac rebounds in Pa. under Chinese ownership after near-death experience,"Sandy Fox assembles a Shop-Vac vacuum cleaner on the company's assembly line in Williamsport Pa. Shop-Vac was left for dead a year ago by its previous owner but it got picked up by GreatStar Tools USA owned by a big Chinese tool maker. GreatStar has gotten Shop-Vac back up and operating in Pennsylvania under American management. Read more

WILLIAMSPORT Pa. — A year ago the founding family of Shop-Vac Corp. left town and abruptly shut down the iconic vacuum company leaving bankers to clean up the mess. Many workers feared that the company would be stripped and scrapped and that production of yet another American brand would be sent overseas.

But something happened on the way to extinction. The bank indeed sold Shop-Vac’s assets to a Chinese company. But the new owner through its subsidiary GreatStar Tools USA decided to keep Shop-Vac’s operations in Williamsport led by new American managers.

More than 200 of the old workers -- about half of the previous Pennsylvania workforce -- were retained or rehired this year. If the company rebounds as hoped the new managers say 100 more could be hired in the next year.

“We’re still in business” said an elated Brian Machmer a 25-year Shop-Vac veteran. He repairs the giant injection molds used to produce plastic canisters hoses and nozzles for wet-dry vacuums which were invented here in north-central Pennsylvania and now occupy places in millions of garages and shops across America. “I plan on finishing my career here” said Machmer 58.

“It’s very positive very exciting” said Robin Keller 42 a product manager who was let go by Shop-Vac last year found another job and then was persuaded to return to his old company in June.

Previous owners left a mess

Keller and others said the new Shop-Vac’s atmosphere is refreshing compared with the gloom of working at a company that had lost its bearings got buried under debt and could not compete.

Everybody knew there was mismanagement under the leadership of Jonathan Miller whose father founded Shop-Vac in 1953. But the company’s secretive leaders said little to the workforce and less to the community.

“It was scary” said Vincent Knauff 59 the engineering lab manager who has worked for Shop-Vac for half of his life. “You were scared to pick up the phone scared to answer a page.” Knauff who was unemployed for more than four months after the closure was announced on Sept. 15 2020 was rehired by the new owners this year.

Chinese owners went with a seasoned executive

GreatStar Tools USA which owns several other American hardware brands including Arrow Fasteners the maker of heavy-duty staple guns hired Charlie Lawrence a veteran marketing and brand management executive to turn around Shop-Vac.

Lawrence 63 grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs and has worked at several firms across the country including the last nine years as president for Workrite Ergonomics a California manufacturer of height-adjustable office accessories.

Lawrence said he and his wife longed to return to Pennsylvania to live near their son a pharmacist in West Norriton when GreatStar recruited him for Shop-Vac. His mission: Rebuild Shop-Vac’s culture and restore harmony with the mighty home-improvement store chains that control the retail market for hardware.

Rebuilding relationships

“A lot of relationships were damaged with our retail and distribution partners” said Lawrence who grew up in Parkesburg Chester County. “We have been spending a large part of our energy rekindling those relationships. Some have been very receptive because our competitors didn’t do a very good job while we were absent.”

Shop-Vac has signed a deal to supply Menards a Midwestern home-improvement chain with 300 outlets. And Lawrence said that the company is close to sealing a deal to be a primary brand at Lowe’s the second-largest national home-improvement chain after Home Depot. Lowe’s had been a key outlet for Shop-Vac before the company closed last year and it also has long-established supply relationships with other GreatStar Tools brands.

Shop-Vac’s pitch to retailers is that because it still produces the larger vacuum units in Pennsylvania it can more quickly fill orders than its major competitors who have moved nearly all production of wet-dry vacuums overseas. Deliveries of imported goods have slowed because of post-pandemic supply-chain congestion and logistics is no longer cheap: The cost to ship a container from China to America has soared to more than $20000 up from $3500 Lawrence said.

“That is putting incredible cost pressure on our competitors” said Lawrence. “It’s also creating empty shelves for the retailers and distributors because the supply is so unreliable. That’s a big advantage for us.”

As a bonus for Williamsport GreatStar is also relocating some manufacturing operations to Shop-Vac from another subsidiary SK Hand Tools a suburban Chicago company GreatStar acquired in July. SK makes premium ratchet wrenches and the kinds of tools that are now produced and used in Shop-Vac’s facility so GreatStar saw synergies in relocating some of its operations from Illinois to Shop-Vac’s sprawling plant.

“Chicago is a little higher-cost market to operate than in Williamsport” said Lawrence.

Business and political leaders in Williamsport who were blindsided by Shop-Vac’s closure are delighted with the company’s revival. They had feared the worst.

Jason Fink president of the Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce said that GreatStar was the only potential Shop-Vac buyer interested in maintaining operations in Williamsport. GreatStar outbid “a couple of U.S.-headquartered vacuum companies that were looking at shipping the brand to Mexico” he said.

When GreatStar announced in December it was buying Shop-Vac for $42 million the prospect of Chinese owners taking over one of Lycoming County’s prized manufacturers was not universally applauded. Amid a polarized political climate in which China is frequently cast as a villain Fink heard much grumbling that the new buyers would surely impose a Chinese work culture or worse dismantle operations and move out.

Fink said GreatStar’s actions speak to a company that is reestablishing local roots. Shop-Vac joined the Chamber of Commerce and reached out to community leaders something the previous owners had shunned.

“Shop-Vac has made a commitment to the Williamsport Area which is very good news” said Williamsport Mayor Derek Slaughter.

Shop-Vac held a two-day sale

Lawrence whose expertise is in marketing said he has changed some practices to send a more positive message to the workers and the community. He converted the old chief executive’s wood-paneled office into a conference room and moved his workspace among the other administrative offices. When he walks on the factory floor workers exchange friendly banter.

In August Shop-Vac held a two-day tent sale at its headquarters to empty its warehouses of odd lots of vacuums that it acquired at a discount from the previous owners. Its very American workforce conducted the sale. Buyers with pickup trucks lined up to buy Shop-Vacs at 40 cents on the dollar and the company sold $160000 in vacuums and filter bags in two days.

“I wanted to say thank you to the community and make sure the community knew we were back in business and we’re here to stay” said Lawrence. Employees told Lawrence the previous managers would never have conducted a similar event. “It’s part of building the culture giving to the community” he said.

A former employee at Shop-Vac sued the previous owners of the company in federal court in June alleging that Shop-Vac Corp. violated the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act by laying off workers without the required 60-day notice. But the current owner Shop-Vac USA LLC is not a party to the lawsuit.

Gary DuBoff the chief executive of GreatStar Tools USA said his company saw the Shop-Vac acquisition as a rare opportunity to acquire a brand so well-known that its name is synonymous with all wet-dry vacs. Though many people doubted him Duboff said GreatStar never considered dismantling the company.

“Once they found out who GreatStar was I don’t think anybody believed that this thing wasn’t going to close down and move to China and that would be the end of it” said DuBoff. “But that was never our plan. We all along wanted to make this more or less a U.S. manufacturing base and to try and bring it back to its former glory.”

DuBoff who grew up in Northeast Philadelphia and got a communications degree from Penn State said he encountered similar concerns four years ago when GreatStar acquired Arrow Fastener in Saddle Brook N.J. where he was president.

At the time GreatStar told him it only wanted to buy the company if the management team the employees and the plant were part of the deal. Under Chinese ownership he said nothing really changed in the way Arrow Fastener operated.

“Basically they said to me `We are not as familiar with operating a business in the United States as we are outside so we are relying on the team’s expertise to continue to run this business successfully’” said DuBoff. “And to their credit they have absolutely adhered to that. We do not have culture clashes because they don’t really operate the day-to-day business.”

GreatStar’s owner

GreatStar Tools USA is owned by Hangzhou GreatStar Industrial Co. Ltd. which describes itself as a leading manufacturer of hand tools in Asia serving markets worldwide. It was founded in 1993 by Qiu Jianping 59 an entrepreneur who has a master’s degree in engineering. Qiu also controls Hangcha Group one of China’s largest suppliers of forklift trucks and parts.

About $974 million or 71% of Hangzhou GreatStar’s $1.4 billion in 2020 sales were made in the United States according to the company’s annual report. Though its shares are traded on the Chinese stock exchange Qiu and his family own a controlling interest. Qui is listed as a multibillionaire by Forbes.

Lawrence said Qiu sometimes sends emails containing broad guidance for the company but is “very much hands-off.”

GreatStar seems to be following what it called a “glocal” approach to the U.S. market in which the parent company takes a global role for strategy and direction but leaves operational decision-making to local managers said Charles J. Skuba professor of the practice at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.

“They seem to be bent on this local management approach to the U.S. market which seems to be pretty smart” said Skuba.

But Skuba also cautioned that the early stages of foreign direct investment “are always the stage of big promises” and that the hand-tool industry does not have huge growth prospects. There likely will be some consolidation and reductions at Shop-Vac as GreatStar optimizes costs among its various operating units.

Lawrence acknowledges that Shop-Vac is unlikely to employ the 400 people who worked in Williamsport before last year nor the 1700 employees worldwide before it closed. GreatStar Tools USA will take over some of the marketing and distribution -- it maintains sales offices near the headquarters of major retailers like Lowe’s Home Depot and Walmart to service its big retail customers.

And Shop-Vac will consolidate operations in Williamsport from three buildings to two and is looking to sell surplus vacant properties it owns in Canton Pa. and in Binghamton N.Y. where the previous owners manufactured motors for its vacuums before relocating that business to Asia several years ago.

Lawrence said Shop-Vac will continue to produce motor assemblies for all of its vacuums in Asia and it will also continue to produce small Shop-Vacs -- under four gallons -- in China or in Vietnam to reduce tariff costs. Those smaller household vacuums sell at a lower profit margin and they can still be produced in Asia at a lower cost.

“The only way we’re going to be able to rebuild this company is to be smart” said Lawrence. “Obviously we’re going to need workers to do that. But we’re going to be more efficient about how we do things.”

The alternatives could be worse according to Skuba the Georgetown business expert:

He has signed a global commentary deal with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. A nightly talkshow will be central to the plans of a new venture talkTV which is to be launched “early next year”. Morgan’s show will also air on Fox Nation a streaming spinoff from Fox News in the US and Sky News in Australia making him a daily presence on three continents. He can also be enjoyed – or avoided – in print where a twice-weekly column will appear in the Sun and the New York Post and in a book deal with Murdoch’s HarperCollins publishers.

Morgan who stagily stormed off the set of Good Morning Britain in March will seemingly no longer be “silenced” by “cancel culture”. He will instead be given global amplification as part of a new battle for the small but economically significant audiences for right-leaning news. The media village gossip is part of a much larger pattern of change affecting all mainstream newsrooms and challenging how broadcasters think about bias opinion news and their own presenters. It is also part of a testing of the generational tensions within journalism where the hunger for diversity and broader representation is creating economic opportunities for those mining the often older whiter righter and richer demographic.

The talkTV venture is clearly a personal project of Rupert Murdoch who turned 90 this year and it reassembles his dream team of the News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks and Morgan – both once rising stars on the pages of Murdoch tabloids. The project is tinged with the sense of a last hurrah: Fleetwood Hack going on the road or indeed an old firm of bank robbers getting together for one last job.

The project does feel strangely old-fashioned in a world where the subscription newsletter service Substack backed by venture-capital millions has been siphoning commentators with large followings. Stories of how a successful Substackers can pull in $1m a year have unsettled columnists and the emerging world of even higher rewards for talking heads on streaming platforms such as YouTube creates as much intrigue as incredulity.

The question for talkTV is therefore whether a mainstream media dinosaur gatekeeper such as News UK can compete with the multiplatform rightwing bloviators with low production costs who are steadily gnawing away at core audiences. As Fox News in the US has demonstrated combining the leverage of legacy with the costs and reach of technology platforms has proved highly successful for companies who are unconcerned with reflecting a diversity of opinion or have a famously tenuous relationship with the truth.

It is also significant that News UK not so long ago ruled out producing a fully fledged TV channel suggesting it was “not commercially viable”. The arrangements and formats of talkTV have yet to be finalised – it will be reportedly be available to be streamed on smart TVs and as a traditional channel. In News Corp’s global results announcement in August its chief executive Robert Thomson attributed a very upbeat picture for the media divisions to global content deals signed with Facebook and Google: “These deals which are confidential will add revenue annually into nine figures and are a profoundly positive sign of the ongoing transformation of the news landscape.”

The unveiling of the Morgan/Murdoch vehicle follows a series of disasters at GB News the rightwing news channel launched in June that has been beset by technical and editorial issues. Their own star defection from mainstream media Andrew Neil left after an amateurish launch made the station a laughing stock. It has been reported that Neil was locked in a legal battle with the channel as he tried to extricate himself from the mess. It is tempting to speculate that Neil was aware of the shadow moves by Murdoch and his key executive Brooks to recruit Morgan and launch a rival to GB News though whether this played any part in his desire to leave is uncertain. Just as the Conservative party under Boris Johnson moved rightwards to squeeze out Brexiteer threats so Nigel Farage and his beer garden of followers on GB News may find themselves outflanked by the more professional talkTV.

Mainstream news broadcasting which is constrained in the UK by Ofcom from having an explicitly political lens to its coverage lurches along in a sea of social media interest optimised for emotion and outrage. The hard expensive work of reporting the news has always suffered in relation to the cheaper business of discussing the news. Facebook one of the most successful advertising companies in history has suffered a series of recent embarrassments on the public relations front (uncovered by Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal) with its content moderation reportedly goes easy on individuals with large followings. Despite outrage at its real-world political effects Facebook’s lightly moderated publishing strategy remains fundamentally unaltered – because it is wildly wildly profitable.

In this sense the arrival of talkTV says as much about Murdoch’s keenly opportunistic business instincts as it does about ideology and culture wars – or indeed his own desire to have something else to watch amid pandemic TV bingeing."

Here are 5 features you may be using wrong and how to fix that,"Garmin watch owners listen up! Even if you had a Garmin watch for a while chances are you aren't using it to its full potential; worse still you could be using some of the watch's features wrong which can possibly hinder your progress. Here are five Garmin watch features you're definitely not using right (and how to use them correctly).

And where else would you go to find out how to use Garmin watches correctly than right to the source of course! We asked Vangellis Stamatiadis Junior Product Manager at Garmin to explain some of the Garmin features people might not know about or know but use incorrectly.

If you're on the market for a new Garmin watch you should definitely check out T3's best running watch guide (curated by yours truly) as well as the cheapest Garmin watch deals so you can get a decent fitness wearable without breaking the bank. There are some Garmin products on our best triathlon watch guide as well as the best fitness tracker guide. Garmin does it all.

Custom alerts for hydration and food intake

“Not many people know that you can actually set an alert on your Garmin device that will vibrate to remind you at regular intervals to do something"" Vangellis starts off the conversation ""We often hear customers complain that they struggle to drink enough or get up from their desk to move.""

Indeed custom alerts are a great way of setting new habits or breaking ones you want to change. ""You can set an alert to remind you to drink or eat for example which can encourage better longer-term habits in the future. Plus you can set alerts for heart rate abnormalities” Vangellis adds.

Here is a quick tutorial on how to set up custom alerts on your Garmin.

T3's Garmin Forerunner 745 review explains the main features of this excellent triathlon watch

(Image credit: Garmin)

Training status – what ""productive"" and ""unproductive"" status mean

The Training Status feature gives you an overview of your longer-term training habits to provide insights into how your training is going. Garmin watches generally display either a ""productive"" or an ""unproductive"" status.

""Productive status means your current training load is moving your fitness level and performance in the right direction and you should plan recovery periods into your training to maintain your fitness level"" says Vangellis.

However even if you're ""unproductive"" according to your Garmin this doesn't necessarily mean you're slacking off. ""An unproductive status means your training load is at a good level but your fitness is decreasing"" he adds ""Your body may be struggling to recover so you should pay attention to your overall health including stress nutrition and rest.”

So it is possible for you to train loads and still be unproductive. Overtraining can fatigue the body and cause injuries which is admittedly not great for your fitness.

It's worth mentioning that Training Status on any compatible Garmin watch works best if you wear them all the time even for sleeping so the watch knows how well rested your body is.

And most importantly pay attention to your body as no watch can ever replace your own built-in sensors for fatigue and performance. If you feel like your training is getting out of hand have some rest regardless of what your watch says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjEvMDkvMTgvdGVzdGluZy0yMmxyLXNpbGVuY2Vycy1vbi1hLTUtN21tLXBpc3RvbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Testing .22LR Silencers on a 5.7mm Pistol,"In this episode of TFBTV James Reeves – along with Ryan @gunhipster and Brendan of @tomato_tactical – tests three different .22LR silencers on the Ruger-57 pistol.

Despite its name being slightly – let's say – unconventional JaxJox is a brand you won't forget anytime soon. Not only because of the silly name but due to it quickly becoming one of the most innovative fit-tech firms out there. Still a relatively small company JaxJox made a great first impression at CES in Vegas back in 2019 with its connected kettlebell the JaxJox KettlebellConnect and has surpassed expectations ever since.

In the last year JaxJox has managed to secure some sizable investments an ode to its growing success. Now armed with a growing arsenal of innovative workout gadgets the brand has the power to take a bigger share of the at-home fitness market. Watch out Peloton!

JaxJox’s latest release the DumbbellConnect is the firm’s first-ever – and therefore

– best adjustable dumbbell set. While it comes 18 months later than we’d have liked (and saved our lockdown fitness woes) it does bring something unique to the table over other adjustable offerings.

With Bluetooth connectivity each unit can be adjusted digitally via the tap of a button to offer 16 different weights ranging from 8lbs all the way up to 50Ibs (that’s 3.6kg - 22.7kg by European standards).

The set packs a pretty substantial 100Ibs (45.4kg) total across both dumbbells in a bid to replace an entire rack of weights which is more than decent. But how do they fare in the real world? We’ve been making use of them the past few weeks to find out. Here’s what we think.

Jaxjox DumbbellConnect review: price and availability

The JaxJox DumbbellConnect was launched in spring 2021 and is available to buy now for £499.99 in the UK and $499 in the US .

For that price you’ll get two adjustable dumbbells each offering an 8-50 lbs (3.6-22.7kg) weight range a charging dock for each dumbbell and two USB Type-C charging cables. As you can imagine the box is pretty heavy and you’ll probably need some help getting it through the door or up the stairs especially if you live in a flat.

There’s only one colourway available and that’s the stone grey with a lime green accent.

JaxJox DumbbellConnect review: design

When it comes to looks the JaxJox DumbbellConnect set boasts a slick minimal design thanks to the clean neutral grey colour scheme. A sleek lime green accent along the bottom gives the set a floating appearance - almost like they’re glowing from underneath.

However the best thing about the DumbbellConnect is that unlike most other adjustable weights – which usually have some kind of strange or ugly design - they look like your standard class gym dumbbells. They’re not too flashy but they have a good professional look with no flamboyant branding just a subtle JaxJocks imprint on both sides of the weights. Because of this they’d certainly not look out of place in any home.

We also like how the two dumbbells’ weight plates have a circular design that is levelled off at one end to prevent them from rolling around during a workout when they’re not sitting in their respective charging docks.

Build quality is also outstanding. The weights themselves feel exceptionally solid with a great gnarled pattern on the grip. The only downside is the plastic housing on the inside of the dumbbell closest to the handle - this does cheapen the overall feel somewhat.

If you’re wondering about size the DumbbellConnect set isn’t too bad and shouldn’t take up more space than just one pair of heavyweight dumbbells measuring 78 x 24.5 x 54cm.

JaxJox DumbbellConnect review: set up

Setting up the DumbbellConnect is extremely straightforward. Just take the weights out of the box sit the 12 plates into the charging dock and then turn them on by tapping one of the unit’s arrow buttons. Then to connect them to the JaxJox app simply ensure they are charged and switched on install the app and it will find them almost instantly. You’ll have them up and running in about five minutes.

The only annoying thing here is the charging. The USB Type-C cables supplied are short and don’t come with a plug. This is fine with a smartphone as most people already have a smartphone plug or are happy to charge from their laptops etc but it’s not ideal for something like this as you’re likely to want to charge them from a specific place in the home. And with the cable being just one metre long we found it quite difficult to find an appropriate location for charging them easily.

Jaxjox DumbbellConnect review: features and performance

The JaxJox DumbbellConnect function just like any good quality dumbbells would however their built-in digital adjustment tech means their weight can be switched rapidly and effortlessly between sets. At the push of a button on either side of a digital display you can increase or drop weight in 6-pound increments of 8lbs 14lbs 20lbs 26lbs 32lbs 38lbs 44lbs 50lbs. A simple (and kind of irritating) high-pitched ‘beep’ sound signifies that they’ve been successfully docked and will sound again when the weight has been shifted and are ready to be picked up again.

In our experience it takes around five or so seconds for the dumbbells to shift from one weight to another after selection. This is nothing compared to most manual adjustable dumbbells which prove fiddly and can be done easily via the physical arrow buttons on the dock or within the Jaxjox smartphone app. The smart thing here is that the dumbbells are connected to one another so you only have to increase or decrease the weight on one of the units for it to sync across them both (provided they’re both switched on).

(Image credit: Lee Bell)

One niggle is that the dumbbell docks do turn themselves off in periods of inactivity and have to reconnect to Bluetooth when they detect they’re being used again which takes an extra 10 or so seconds. There’s no option in the app to prolong power saving mode annoyingly. However this is only an issue if you’re doing faster HIIT-based weights sessions where time is of the essence.

Another concern is that these dumbbells are definitely not a set that you can throw around. You’ve got to take a lot of care during use to ensure you’re placing them back into the dock at the right angle and in a controlled manner so they’re seated properly and all the plates line up before altering the weight. This can prove tricky mid-workout when adrenaline is pumping.

We had an issue where one plate was misaligned in the dock and when selecting a new weight the dumbbell couldn’t connect to it so the weight distribution was uneven when we pulled it out again and it messed up the whole dock. It took a few minutes to fix which is the last thing you need during a timed session. This didn’t often happen during our time with the dumbbells but something to keep in mind.

Also be aware that if the battery is low on the base units the dumbbells might be unable to switch weights and the screen may appear frozen. If this happens to you as it did to us just give them a charge. Would be nice to see a “please charge” warning though.

JaxJox Dumbbellconnect review: the JaxJox app

As mentioned earlier the DumbbellConnect units link up to the JaxJox app which can not only be used as a control for altering their weight between sets in addition to the physical buttons but comes loaded with a host of trainer-led video workouts to follow. However this extra feature is only available as part of a paid subscription service similar to how Peloton operates its business.

However there’s another somewhat nifty part of the app called FitnessIQ. Here JaxJox uses a proprietary machine-learning algorithm to calculate a score (your “FitnessIQ”) and tries to motivate you through gamification by keeping you informed on your overall progress. It does this by tracking your reps your sets and - if you have a JaxJox heart rate monitor - your heart rate to tell you how many calories you've burned. The app has Peloton vibes but with a focus on weightlifting... and not quite as swish or premium feeling. Sadly.

JaxJox DumbbellConnect review: verdict

Overall the DumbbellConnect is an excellent set of adjustable weights. They're well made smart look great and – in most instances – work effortlessly. While it’s by no means a major concern the care required when docking the dumbbells to switch between weights could become irritating for those that prefer fast-paced HIIT-style wright sessions.

There’s also the small worry that by relying on their digital smarts to function they might not stand the test of time when compared to more straightforward manually adjustable weights. But that’s nothing but a presumption on our part.

Yes at $499/£499 they don’t come cheap and the app could be better but for a pair of great-quality smart dumbbells with a relatively wide weight range we have to say these are some of the best we’ve come across.

JaxJox DumbbellConnect review: also consider

You didn't think we won't mention the Bowflex SelectTech 1090i Adjustable Dumbbell here did you? Aren't you just silly. The Rolls Royce of dumbbells is still one of the most sought after adjustable dumbbells on the market today years after its release. Bowflex's home weights are as premium as it gets and unlike the JaxJox DumbbellConnect these are manual dumbbells so you don't even have to worry about the battery giving in.

Another mechanically adjustable dumbbell option the Core Fitness Adjustable Dumbbell and Stand set is perfect for people who take muscle building at home seriously but can't afford a pair of Bowflex 552s. If you want to get big arms get these bad boys.

But wait there is more! The NordicTrack Select-A-Weight Dumbbell Set is a great fitness tool from a big name brand that's ideal for anyone who lacks space. It's also great for anyone new to weight training since the purchase includes one year of virtual fitness classes courtesy of iFit. And iFit certainly have a more robust workout library than JaxJox so there is that.",,,,,,

It is 43 years ago today - September 19 - since Manly Warringah Sea Eagles beat Cronulla Sharks 16-0 in the 1978 NSWRL Grand Final replay.

It was the second time in history that a Grand Final had to be replayed after the Sea Eagles and the Sharks drew 11-all three days earlier in the premiership decider at the Sydney Cricket Ground on September 16.

Remarkably it was the second Grand Final in a row to end up going into a mid-week replay after the 1977 Grand between St George and Parramatta finished in a 9-all draw.

The grand final replay was Manly's sixth game in 24 days with several Sea Eagles players having painful injections to get onto the field. Second-rower Terry Randall had a total of six injections - four in a shoulder and two in a groin.

The victory in 1978 gave the Sea Eagles their fourth premiership title to complete a domination of the '70s after premiership wins in 1972 1973 and 1976.

Let the family know you are thinking of them

George A. Elles

Millcreek Twp. - George A. Elles age 98 was lifted up to Heaven on Tuesday September 14 2021 while at LECOM Senior Living Center. He was born on November 25 1922 in Duquesne Pa. son of the late Miklos and Elizabeth Illes.

George was a graduate of Duquesne High School where he excelled as a center on his basketball team. He served his country in the U.S. Army; Technician Fifth Grade Company B 148th Infantry Regiment stationed in the Philippines during WWII.

George was employed at various machine shops with his longest employment of 38 years at General Electric (GE) in Building 64 Aerospace Division. He started at GE in their Apprentice Program and in his later years was mentor to a plethora of apprentices coming through the same program. He retired as an Inspector. George was a member of St James RC Church. He coached Boys Little League Baseball was active in Boy Scouts and volunteered at church functions.

George was a very generous person; quick to give a smile a song food from his plate and whatever was in his pocket. He made friends easily and was beloved by many. His caregivers at LECOM Senior Living Center fondly referred to him as ""Georgie Porgie"" and always spoke of his kindness and pleasant disposition.

George loved singing and strumming his country music for others to enjoy. His gifts to others were his songs. He is now playing his guitar and singing with all his siblings in Heaven.

Gen Z has taken over as the 'it' generation.,"Millennials aren't cool anymore.

No longer cool millennials have fallen as the 'it' generation. That title belongs to Gen Z.

As the oldest millennial turns 40 Gen Z has lambasted them for their side parts and skinny jeans.

On the surface millennials feel outdated. But the real issue is that they're reckoning with a new life stage.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

I was sipping a Moscow Mule in the corner of an East Village bar one night when a sense of déjà vu came over me.

The room was a sea of spaghetti straps claw clips baguette bags and bright colors catapulting me into my teenage past – more than a dozen years ago.

Confused about how these trends became cool again and when I aged out of my favorite bars I looked down at my frayed skinny jeans and wondered if I should find new spots that attracted an … older crowd. My peers feel the same taking to TikTok to cry about feeling old and outdated in their favorite NYC haunts.

At 29 I recognize my youth but am also painfully aware of the cultural gap between a late 20-something and an early 20-something especially when they're divided into two generations: millennials and Gen Z.

I would know – I've been writing about millennials for the past two-and-a-half years so I've been particularly attuned to how generational conversations changed during the pandemic.

I watched as the media pounced on Gen Z mocking millennials on TikTok for how they wear their hair and for their love of coffee and wine. I saw headlines pop up deeming millennials ""ancient"" or ""officially old"" when their cult-favorite brand Glossier launched an anti-aging retinol. And I noticed how the millennial narrative shifted to middle-aged experiences like having kids and buying houses while new lifestyle trends and consumer behavior increasingly fell to Gen Z.

Between last spring's lockdowns and this spring's economic reopening we're all a year older than we once were. But the lost year of 2020 accentuated the starkness of the cultural shift as a new generation enters young adulthood.

Millennials many of whom suddenly became known as ""geriatric"" or ""cheugy"" are no longer cool. Gen Z has taken over as the 'it' generation.

The oldest millennial is now 40

Millennials began to lose 'it' status when the oldest turned 40 this year. While the youngest millennials are just 25 the vast majority of the generation are no longer in their 20s. A term even popped up to describe the oldest cohort much to the internet's chagrin: geriatric millennial.







This homeowning millennial isn't the avocado toast-loving Instagram-obsessed living-with-their-parents millennial that the world has learned to love and hate. That title now goes to Gen Z except they've swapped out avocado toast for oat lattes and Instagram for TikTok.

Millennials have entered middle age this year.

While millennials aged so too did the generation behind them the oldest of whom turn 24 this year. Much like millennials graduated into the Great Recession Gen Z has their own tale of economic plight: graduating in the pandemic. And as does every generation they have certain hallmark traits: They're activists favor neon colors and dress in 2000s clothes.

The world has noticed it all. After all the fascination with young people is not about any particular generation but about whoever is driving trends and influencing consumer spending. Now it's Gen Z's turn to take over the economy as their collective income reaches $33 trillion. (It's set to surpass that of millennials in 2031.)

It's a natural evolution Jason Dorsey who runs the Center for Generational Kinetics a research firm in Austin Texas told me. ""At around this age and life stage the next generation sort of takes the mantle as the 'it' generation because they're old enough to really start to exert their influence.""

Society feels like it finally understands millennials he added switching their focus to the generation that remains a mystery. That leaves Gen Z ""shifting and driving much of the conversation"" which he predicts they'll do for the next 15 years.

Awakening from the pandemic to a cultural shift

Pandemic or no pandemic everyone turned another year older in 2020. But a year at home heightened the millennial-to-Gen-Z cultural transition.

Skinny jeans and side parts are out. So too are Hogwarts houses and the term ""doggo."" The frowning face emoji now carries a more sexual meaning than a frustrated one and ""elite"" no longer means excellence but hitting the spot. Y2K fashion has re-entered the trend cycle and a Chanel suit from 1995 is now considered vintage.

Gen Z loves their baggy jeans.

Digital bonding helped many of these new trends take root. Gen Z already digital natives had ample time to scroll on their phones during quarantine. They connected with one another Dorsey said as many underwent the fortifying experience of moving back home during the pandemic at a similar life stage.

At the center of this cultural shift was TikTok which blew up during the pandemic. By September 2020 the social media app grew by 75% expanding into intergenerational use. It signals the growing influence of Gen Z in leading consumer behavior much the same way millennials did with Instagram.

TikTok became the place not just for dance videos but for Gen Z's jests at millennials and exploration of fashion trends from tie-dye loungewear to baggy jeans. They've made their way to the streets explaining why I came out of the pandemic feeling the need to update my wardrobe.

It's all part of growing up

The downfall of millennials as the 'it' generation is symptomatic of the inevitable – getting old. It's the natural evolution of generations with one always superseding another as everyone ages much the same way millennials overtook Gen X as a hot topic around the time social media emerged.

Millennials are having a difficult time reckoning with getting older. As my 29-year-old roommate said when I mentioned I was writing this piece: ""That's so sad!"" followed by a deadpanned ""I'm not into this article.""

I too lamented to my therapist about how my world is going to end when I turn 30 this year. Overly dramatic sure but my peers and I are grappling with a major life transition that we may not be ready for – not the fact that Gen Z is making fun of us.

""It reinforces to many millennials that they themselves are entering a new life stage whether that's marriage or kids or buying houses or seeing friends doing that"" Dorsey said describing it as an uncomfortable adjustment. ""There's this real sense of getting older heightened when the new generation who are now adults is telling you that you're older and outdated.""

Aging comes with societal pressure to settle into major life events like buying a house or having kids. Many millennials feel stressed that we're unable to do so because of all the economic pills we've had to swallow. We're also confronting the fact that our parents are aging too as we worry about their health risks during the pandemic.

The pandemic has forced millennials to grow up. While still young by many measures we're old enough to ponder existential life questions while also questioning past choices – whether a financial regret or our skinny jeans.

The ironic part of millennials' newfound uncoolness at the hands of Gen Z is that the latter doesn't really care about being cool at all. Gen Z may enjoy their time in the limelight for now – until Generation C takes over.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9kYXNzYXVsdC1yYWZhbGUtZ3JvdXBzLWRpZ2l0YWwtdHdpbi10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRvLWJlLXVzZWQtdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC10dXJrZXktZmlmdGgtZ2VuLXRmLXgtZmlnaHRlci1qZXQv0gGFAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2Rhc3NhdWx0LXJhZmFsZS1ncm91cHMtZGlnaXRhbC10d2luLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktdG8tYmUtdXNlZC10by1kZXZlbG9wLXR1cmtleS1maWZ0aC1nZW4tdGYteC1maWdodGVyLWpldC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dassault (Rafale) Group’s ‘Digital Twin Technology’ To Be Used To Develop Turkey Fifth-Gen TF-X Fighter Jet,"One of Turkey’s long-awaited military projects the National Combat Aircraft (MMU) is supposed to be domestically designed as a 5th Generation Stealth Fighter Jet. The aircraft is due to leave the hangar in 2023 and work on it seems to be in full swing.

The main contractor of this project Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) said it has started working with digital twin technology for the design and production of the MMU TF-X (short for Turkish Fighter-Experiment).

Turkey’s Indigenous Fighter Jet

The TF-X is a twin-engine stealth air superiority fighter being developed by the TAI for the Turkish Air Force. It will replace Turkey’s aging fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons. The jet is 19m-long and will have a wingspan of 12m. Its maximum take-off weight (MTOW) is expected to be 27215kg.

While its sleek design and novel features will make it capable of serving air-to-surface roles it is actually primarily designed to fulfill air-to-air combat requirements.

For this it will come armed with a range of new air-to-air missiles from GÖKTUĞ- Turkey’s indigenous air-to-air missile (AAM). The TF-X has a wide selection of guided bombs from the KGK and HGK series that will provide a secondary precision strike capability. The aircraft is meant to excel in an air superiority role.

The jet’s smart cockpit will have features like high-quality audio systems voice recognition and synthetic vision. Graphic interfaces multiple displays digital maps environmental data systems and high-end interconnectivity devices will be a part of the advanced avionics suite onboard.

Turkish defense company Aselsan will supply an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar to the TF-X. This radar alongside the stealth fuselage will ensure superior stealth capability.

The MMU will be unveiled for the first time on March 18 2023.

Multiple Contributors

While TAI is indeed the main contractor of the project the development of TF-X will also see contributions from a variety of local defense industry firms.

Temel Kotil general manager of TAI told Anadolu Agency that the aircraft will have close to 20000 parts whose production will be finished by the end of 2022.

It is now known that the project will have Aselsan for avionics and computer hardware Havelsan and TAI working for software and TAI in partnership with Altınay and a Ukrainian company working for the actuators.

The Information Security Advanced Technologies Research Center (BILGEM) part of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBITAK) is developing the aircraft’s central computer. The power distribution system is being developed by another Turkish company Pavotek.

TAI has also formed a partnership to develop and produce the landing gear for the jet.

Russian Involvement

In August this year Dmitry Shugayev Director of Russia’s Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation had said that Moscow and Ankara were discussing potential joint ventures concerning the latter’s upcoming TF-X jet. He had hinted at Russia rendering technological assistance to Turkey.

In 2018 Russia’s state industrial giant Rostec showed keenness in cooperating with Turkey for this project. Russian manufacturers had announced their readiness to provide engine technology for the new fighter.

The French Role

TAI said that it had started working with digital twin technology for the design and production of the TF-X. For employing the 3DEXPERIENCE PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) platform and aviation industry experience to develop the MMU they made an agreement with French firm Dassault Systemes.

The digital twin technology refers to a digital model of a prominent physical asset. It uses real-time data to boost operations by adjusting to operational changes. The technology can also forecast the future performance of its physical counterpart. It comprises simulation and physics-based modeling sensor and measurement technologies AI and machine learning.

Aerospace companies use digital twins to reduce unplanned downtime of aircraft-related systems (including engines).

Dassault Systèmes had announced in 2018 that it had chosen the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to accelerate the development of the MMU.

The decision came after the Turkish firm’s comprehensive evaluation of solutions available on the market. The deal reflects well on Dassault Systèmes’ 30-year legacy in the aerospace industry.

Defense World had reported in August 2018 that “Turkish Aerospace will use the Winning Program Co-Design to Target Test to Perform Ready for Rate and Build to Operate industry solution experiences based on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to develop its next-generation multirole aircraft from design through production”.

It had said that over 2000 project participants at Turkish Aerospace its partners as well as its suppliers will all collaborate by relying on a single source of data across all digital design simulation engineering manufacturing governance and business analytics applications.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZnMjQ3LmNvbS9teC12cy1hdHYtbGVnZW5kcy1wYy1wczUteGJveC1zZXJpZXMteC1z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MX vs ATV franchise will make its next-gen debut with MX vs ATV: Legends,"The MX vs ATV franchise will make its PS5 and Xbox Series X/S debut with the currently in development MX vs ATV Legends.

In an announcement that must have struck dread into the hearts of millions of children and teenagers the Chinese government recently set out a new policy to restrict online games for those under 18 to just three hours a week.

While unpopular with young people as well as gaming companies it does pose the question whether other countries need to look into the issue of children being increasingly consumed by online gaming.

The online gaming industry is massive. In 2020 the global online gaming market generated approximately $21.1bn in revenue translating to a record 21.9 percent growth compared with the previous year. There are approximately one billion online gamers worldwide of which more than 10 percent are Chinese children.

Heavy incentives

Online games and the platforms that support them are becoming increasingly good at ensuring eyeballs remain glued to screens for as long as possible. They are heavily incentivised because it helps them make money through advertising revenue and in-game services. For example Amazon-owned streaming platform Twitch made more than $100m in advertising revenue alone in the first quarter of 2021 in part through enabling users to engage with 71 million hours of gaming streams daily.

Children who otherwise might be playing outdoors and making real friends learning a skill such as playing an instrument or studying are instead playing addictive online games.

The rapid enhancements in technology have made it all too easy for parents and children alike to rely on the internet for entertainment rather than make the effort to organise physical activities. With social networks now deeply integrated into these games and smartphones enabling instant access to technology children’s social lives are predominantly limited to the various online platforms.

The problem however goes beyond wasting precious time that could be better allocated to making friends doing physical exercise or studying for children. It can cause serious health issues.

Chinese authorities have branded their latest campaign as a war against “electronic drugs” due to the concerns about the addictive nature of online gaming platforms.

The US-based rehabilitation clinic Addiction Center describes how video games trigger the chemical dopamine in the same way addictive drugs can. The World Health Organization recently included gaming addiction as a disorder and estimated that 3-4 percent of video gamers struggle with addiction.

There are potentially tens of millions of people suffering from gaming addiction. People with symptoms of depression are also particularly vulnerable seeing gaming as an escape from their day-to-day struggles.

‘Pay to win’ culture

Many platforms have gambling elements built into their systems so addiction to online gaming can also lead to severe financial implications. Examples include in-game currencies that can be swapped with real money enabling micro-transactions in exchange for “loot boxes” which leads to a “pay to win” culture where gamers can further their progress and add character customisation with money.

Ninety-three percent of all children play video games but more worryingly according to the charity Gamble Aware up to 40 percent of those children opened in-game “loot boxes” containing randomised digital awards.

Hence some children can end up spending more than $100 a month in an attempt to get a specific digital feature such as a new outfit for their avatar. To counter such quasi-gambling the UK government is exploring measures to control gaming micro-transactions the same way it regulates gambling.

Addiction to online gaming does not only affect children adults can get hooked on these platforms too. The Royal Society the UK’s national academy of sciences has published studies showing a “moderate to strong” correlation between adolescents playing games with micro-transactions and then developing a gambling addiction as an adult.

Online gaming forms part of a wider challenge in the modern digital world. Recent technological advancement has enabled us to search for information and services with relative ease whether it is to access healthcare conduct business via online video calls or share and discover gossip on social media platforms through videos photos news and blogs.

It is also intrinsic to our daily routine with many positive features but it means we are now spending most of our hours awake staring at a screen.

Price comparison website Uswitch’s studies show that on average in the UK people are digitally plugged in 6.4 hours a day. The figures are even worse for those born after 1995 known as Gen Z who are consuming digital media for 11 hours a day which is the majority of their waking hours.

Clamping down on gaming

For China the latest clampdown on game time is an escalation of existing attempts to limit gaming for minors which previously had a ceiling of 90 minutes of online playtime during weekdays. Online games will now only be available for children for an hour in the evening on Friday Saturday Sunday and public holidays. China may be unique in having the digital infrastructure and political power to enforce this policy.

Major gaming companies like Tencent have the responsibility to implement the policy including requiring users to provide their real names and age or face the wrath of the Chinese state.

While restricting online games this way would be unthinkable in most countries a wider debate on our relationship with the online world should still be had. In the UK the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) journals suggest that pandemic induced lockdowns have led people to spend 71 percent more time playing online games.

We need to be careful to not exacerbate this problem in the longer term perhaps a digital detox is required. Otherwise the consequence of inaction could be severe especially for those born in the digital age.

Sure my skills are rusty from the long layoff of live music but sometimes it’s pretty easy. Writing about the Psychedelic Furs last night for example wasn’t a tough job because for the most part I knew what I was in store for.

Seeing The Flaming Lips tonight at the new Generac Power Stage was going to be more of a challenge and I expected that in advance. X X

Technically the 9:45 p.m. show on the last night of Summerfest wasn’t the first time I’ve seen this band on the Henry Maier Festival Grounds. That actually happened back on May 29 1995 at New Rock Fest at the old Marcus Amphitheater. All I really remember about that show was that it was short – they had to make way for Duran Duran and the Violent Femmes. I was celebrating my 21st birthday weekend and I knew only one song by the Flaming Lips: “She Don’t Use Jelly” which I discovered on an episode of “Beavis and Butthead.” I had the CD single.

Flash forward to 2021. This psychedelic experimental and hard-to-shoehorn band has now cranked out some 16 studio albums in the last 35 years and while I’ve never heard a Flaming Lips song I didn’t like I couldn’t begin to name more than a handful of their tunes. I was well-aware that they were very critically acclaimed by music people in the know and that their live shows always promised a spectacle. X X X

That’s not an easy way to head into a show to review but I brought along my friend Jon who has seen them many times to help. I listened to as much of their work in the week in advance and I researched their recent set lists. The best I can do is offer you a taste of the experience for if you’re looking for the insight of a Flaming Lips super fan you’ll have to look elsewhere.

Of course I knew their encore “Do You Realize??” from 2002’s “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots” as well as that eponymous song which I think is pretty great. And of course there was “She Don’t Use Jelly” which despite being a pretty fun tune illustrates just how much this band has evolved since 1993.

The rest I was either hearing for one of the first times.

Granted in some ways the music at a Flaming Lips show is just a soundtrack for the entire visual experience which is something I can better describe. X X X

The show was more lightly attended than I expected but even though they started 15 minutes late standing in a bubble Wayne Coyne made sure to point out that he didn’t want to spread Covid to the blissed out crowd. “This is such an amazing place to be … but we’re not going to throw out balloons. That’s just for today.” By the end of the night Coine rotated through multiple bubbles.

In those bubbles with smaller bubbles floating over the crowd the 60-year-old lead singer started with “All The Movies On Quaaludes” and didn’t stop for 70 minutes. More stripped down and less elaborate than their typical sets I’m told there were still confetti cannons shot aplenty as well as a giant white inflatable robot gracing the stage during “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1.” X

Double drum kits and a fuzzed out vocals it all sounded pretty good.

Coyne is the last original member of the band but they sounded great as they floated out a Mylar balloon during “She Don’t Use Jelly.” We all ate it up.

As temperatures dropped at the lakefront to an even cooler 61 degrees by the end of the show I found myself a little bit in awe that the Big Gig even happened. Major kudos to organizers for pulling it off as well being the first venue in Milwaukee to mandate proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test.

It was almost a year ago that The Flaming Lips staged their “bubble concert” in their hometown of Oklahoma City to protect the audience from the skyrocketing Covid cases – now we were unbubbled once again amidst a crowd of fans who have protected themselves and their community and I was writing a review after two years without seeing a live show. Kind of profound at least for me.

And so Coyne who is no stranger to space bubbles put a trippy bow on Summerfest and offered me optimism that next year will probably once again be “normal.” Maybe. Hopefully.

“We’ll be back at Summerfest and will play like crazy” said Coyne. “Live music will combine to defeat the Coronavirus.”

“Please remember to take care of each other” he said toward the end of the 70 minute set.

What a cool weird way to close out a Summerfest even if was more than two months late.

At the beginning of every headlining show on the newly renovated Generac Power Stage there is a quick advertisement and light show before the act comes on stage partially to help showcase the capabilities of the stage’s sound and light system. While it ran on Friday night it wasn’t necessary because Run The Jewels pushed the stage’s capabilities to their limit.

A full set of bleachers welcomed the duo of Killer Mike and El-P though they were ready from the moment that the group’s inflatable logo was blown up and attached to the lighting truss of the Generac stage. Returning Milwaukee ex-pat Kid Cut Up alongside hypeman Jordi Mack aka DJ Madhatter or Jordan Lee of 88Nine Radio Milwaukee did their job of getting the crowd hyped but the mere presence of the duo was enough to get people screaming. With a brief introduction from Killer Mike that Run The Jewels was ready to burn the stage down it was on and there was no looking back.

Friday night’s show was only the second back from the pandemic for the group as they explained that they had been waiting to play out material from 2020’s RTJ4. They did just that running down the first five tracks from the record in order including the single “Ooh La La” which got an extra ovation when the song’s opening piano sample flooded the speakers. It was also a chance for Wisconsin’s own DJ Trademark to step in for the song’s cuts replacing the legendary DJ Premier on the recorded version. RTJ would then jump around their previous works with the crowd bouncing to every bass-heavy album cut.

El-P and Killer Mike are both seasoned veterans on stage so it wasn’t surprising that they had a sense of calm confidence while performing some of their highest energy tracks. The two embody the spirit of the early days of hip hop when performing records live took precedence over just trying to get the crowd to react. Emcees at heart both members were on point Friday night spitting each verse with grins that conveyed they knew the Summerfest crowd was in the palm of their hands. Even a blown out microphone that cut off during Killer Mike’s verse on “36” Chain” had the group unphased with Mike performing as though nothing abnormal was going on.

The end of the night played like what would be the basis of a Run The Jewels greatest hits compilation save for the tracks that would actually send the crowd home. Following “Nobody Speak” arguably the group’s biggest hit they closed the set on “The Ground Below” and “A Few Words for the Firing Squad (Radiation).” The latter of the two closes out RTJ4 and features a lower-tempo track and poignant lyrics a stark contrast to much of the night’s powerful set of heavy beats and hard bars. Run The Jewels have been notoriously outspoken on their political views and while there was some of that present in Friday night’s set they expertly picked their spots to make an impact. An encore consisting of their self-titled theme from their debut put a cap on the night.

Throughout Friday night’s set Run The Jewels never really lost their momentum or the reaction from the Summerfest crowd. In many ways it was a testament to Run The Jewels fans and the albums that the group makes as every song seemed to be known and well received. The set was methodical but not formulaic and it made for a great night overall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vb25taWx3YXVrZWUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3J1bi10aGUtamV3ZWxzLXN1bW1lcmZlc3QtcmV2aWV30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Run the Jewels rattled the rust off with their rocking Summerfest set,"After playing one show – plus one ""get out the vote"" virtual concert – over the past two years hit rap duo Run the Jewels will now perform twice in 24 hours: Friday night at Summerfest followed by Saturday evening headlining at Chicago's Riot Fest. If there was any energy being reserved during round one at the Big Gig though you wouldn't know it from RTJ's rattling and rocking set putting the power into the new Generac Power Stage. X

With an inflatable version of their signature logo – a finger gun and fist aimed at one another – dangling above the stage Killer Mike and El-P giddily came out to the triumphant sounds of ""We are the Champions"" before launching into the booming ""yankee and the brave (ep. 4).""

A gun and fist may have lorded over the stage but it was all love on it between RTJ's brotherly chemistry and their genuine thrill of being back out in the spotlight in front of a raucous bleacher-packing crowd. Before ""ooh la la"" El-P yelled to the audience ""We missed the f*cking shit of y'all"" while Killer Mike in particular grinned throughout the whole night blissfully bouncing in and around the songs. Not even talking about his hometown Atlanta Hawks getting clipped by the Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals could wipe his smile away. (He made sure to tell the Milwaukee crowd he was a lifelong Brett Favre guy at least.) X

Part of their excitement El-P explained to the amped-up crowd was finally being able to play their new tracks off ""RTJ4"" to a live audience. Besides their virtual show last October and a gig at BottleRock in Napa earlier this month their latest work's lived exclusively on the album since its June 2020 release. And Friday night's show felt like they were at long last free the album's first five tracks – the aforementioned ""yankee and the brave (ep. 4)"" and ""ooh la la"" followed by ""out of sight"" ""holy calamaf*ck"" and ""the goonies vs. E.T."" – also serving as the night's first five tracks their repressed energy finally unleashed around a rocking crowd and melting faces like it was the end of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""

While ""RTJ4"" made up almost half of the 19-song setlist Killer Mike and El-P brought out all of the old hits as well for their return to the road. After their opening five-song ""RTJ4"" rundown the duo roared into the grimy pounding beats of ""Blockbuster Night Pt. 1"" and ""Oh My Darling Don't Cry"" off their second album before taking off into the banger ""Legend Has It"" from ""RTJ3."" Add in appearances from ""36"" Chain"" and the self-titled set closer and the only record missing in action Friday night was ""Meow the Jewels"" their remix of ""RTJ2"" ... but with cats. (OK but don't laugh because it actually slaps.) X

A lack of ""All Meow Life"" or ""Meowpurrdy"" aside the show's biggest issues were just knocking some of the technical rust off after almost literally two years stuck on the bench. (Prior to their live debut in Napa on Sept. 4 their last true performance came Sept. 7 2019.) For instance the audience missed out on the first half of Killer Mike's verses on ""36"" Chain"" thanks to a dead mic – thankfully fixed before the end of the throwback track. Perhaps it was just my particular location at the stage but the bass was also dangerously close to overwhelming. The brain-rumbling cavity-rattling levels made for a head-bangingly fun party atmosphere but Killer Mike and El-P's sharp and cutting lyrics were often unfortunately smothered under the mix more than preferred.

Even so Run the Jewels' songs are too pointed to not breakthrough into one's brain no matter the circumstances. (""JU$T"" and ""Lie Cheat Steal"" sliced through in particular on Friday night.) Add in the contagious energy and eager vigor coming from Killer Mike and El-P on stage and no one could be that bothered.

Plus the duo's scorching and propulsive beats were all intact throughout the night. They wrapped up their approximately 75-minute set with the hit combo of the riotous ""Close Your Eyes (And Count to F*ck)"" (sans Zack de la Rocha of course) and the slinky groove of their DJ Shadow collaboration ""Nobody Speak followed by a few more tracks off ""RTJ4"" topped by the driving force of ""a few words for the firing squad (radiation).""

A brief encore of ""Run the Jewels"" called it a night for the Generac Power Stage crowd – but not so much for Killer Mike and El-P who'll do it all again at Riot Fest less than a day later. Have fun Chicago; we certainly did. X

Advances in 3D printing may yet provide a way for it to rapidly build prototype and develop jet engines.

The Chinese defense industrial base is infamous for its tendency to “borrow” from foreign designs particularly in the aerospace industry. Almost the entirety of China’s modern fighter fleet have either borrowed liberally from or directly copied foreign models. The J-10 was reputedly based on the Israeli IAI Lavi and by extension the United States’ General Dynamics F-16; the J-11 is a clone of the Russian Su-27; the JF-17 is a modern development of the Soviet MiG-21; the J-20 bears an uncanny resemblance to the F-22 and finally the J-31 is widely believed to rely heavily on technology appropriated from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Appropriation saves China time and money on research and development allowing it to modernize the PLAAF at a fraction of the cost of its competitors. However the appropriation strategy remains constrained by bottleneck technologies due to lack of testing data and industrial ecology. This problem is starkly illustrated by China’s ongoing difficulty in producing a high-quality indigenous jet engine.

The problem of technology mismatch at its root is that the thief lacks trade secrets and human capital associated with the manufacturing and assembly of a system. At the very least this absence can make the replication of foreign systems a costly and time-consuming process as the thief needs to develop manufacturing procedures from scratch. At worst it can lead to seriously substandard components that reduce the capabilities and reliability of a system. Chinese efforts to reverse engineer certain Russian jet engines during the 1990s and 2000s invariably produced engines with extremely short lifespans and without the power of their Russian counterparts. Even today jet engines remain an obstacle for PLAAF fighter modernization with its early 5th generation prototypes notably underpowered. Further complicating the problem Russia is wary of supplying engines more powerful than the AL-31 used to power its Su-27s. However China has several avenues to work around this.

The most obvious option is simply to build a better indigenous engine. In 2016 China’s 13th Five-year Plan for the National Development of Strategic Emerging Industries emphasized the importance of improving the performance of indigenous jet-engine designs and the further development of the aerospace industry. It appears that there has been at least some success as the latest J-20 prototypes are powered by upgraded WS-10 engines that are supposedly stealthier and more powerful than the AL-31. However the lack of public information regarding China’s indigenous engine programs makes their true quality difficult to ascertain. Early models of the WS-10 used to power Chinese Flankers proved dramatically inferior to the AL-31. While the privately-owned Chengdu Aerospace Superalloy Technology Company (CASTC) has recently made great advances in turbofan technology allowing for hotter more efficient engines the fruits of its breakthrough have yet to reach frontline PLAAF units.

If the private sector proves key to breaking through various technological bottlenecks in elements of aerospace design then political ramifications may follow. Presently state-owned aviation manufacturers are politically ascendant with some state-owned enterprise leaders even granted governorships. If privately owned firms like CASTC produce superior results they may rise in political influence the more established and politically connected state firms could consume them or they could form comprehensive public-private partnerships with state-owned firms while retaining a degree of autonomy. Whatever the case the implications could be profound for the Chinese defense industrial base and national innovation system.

A simpler method is to buy foreign fighters that have advanced engines as was the case with the PLAAF’s purchase of Su-35s from Russia. The Su-35’s AL-41F1S alternatively known as the ALS-117S is an exceptionally powerful thrust-vectoring engine which represents a quantum leap over the AL-31. While China originally expressed interest in the ALS-117 as a stand-alone product Russia’s refusal to export the engine alone necessitated the purchase of the Su-35. Russia insists that extensive IP protections safeguard the ALS-117 from Chinese reverse engineering. However given China’s questionable record of respecting intellectual property it is plausible that they will attempt to reverse-engineer parts of the ALS-117 anyway although this is harder than it sounds. Russian sources claim it is nearly impossible to reach the “heart” of the engine without breaking it. Furthermore China’s previous difficulties with the WS-10 despite ready access to the AL-31 show that access to foreign engine designs does not immediately translate into the ability to produce engines of similar quality. Furthermore disrespecting Russian IP protections it had agreed to honor might restrict China’s access to advanced Russian systems in the future. Finally if the Russians are correct that it is effectively impossible to access the ALS-117’s core without breaking it completely attempts at reverse-engineering it would rob the PLAAF of advanced combat aircraft that would quite obviously be useless without engines. Thus while the PRC may derive short-term advantage from reverse engineering the ALS-117 it risks killing the goose that laid the golden egg. However the grim prognosis for the future of the Russian arms industry may force it to look the other way as losing access to the Chinese market would be a body blow. Russia’s leverage is also shrinking; as China’s technological and industrial base improves the importance of Russian imports continues to decrease. Beijing may feel confident enough in the disparate power differential to call Moscow’s bluff. Yet doing so risks derailing the positive relationship in which the two countries have invested considerable diplomatic capital.

Finally China could use its bourgeoning civilian jet industry as a springboard from which to derive military applications. This certainly has its advantages. A focus on civilian aviation opens up greater opportunities for cooperation with Western firms while opening up new export markets for Chinese aviation technology. For example Germany is interested in purchasing Chinese turbine blades which are said to be superior to German designs in many ways (ironically much of this expertise comes from China gobbling up German companies). Additionally it meets a domestic need as China is the world’s largest market for civilian aircraft. However American and European companies operate under severe restrictions regarding technology transfer undercutting their ability to provide useful information. Additionally political pressure or IP theft could scare away Western aerospace firms just as they are starting to invest in Chinese production. With intellectual property theft already a key point of contention this could further exacerbate declining Sino-American relations and add fuel to the fire of a trade war. The result could damage the very industrial base China is trying to expand and modernize.

Despite these formidable obstacles Chinese advancement in military aviation continues apace and it is unlikely that China will lag behind in engine technology forever. Advances in 3D printing may yet provide a way for it to rapidly build prototype and develop jet engines. However while 3D printing is already used by militaries worldwide to produce parts for aircraft and ships it has yet to produce a modern military-grade turbofan jet engine. Given the inherent complexity of such a task it will likely take several years for such technology to mature enough for widespread implementation. For now it appears that the PRC must make difficult choices if it is to master fighter engine design and thus maximize the effectiveness of its air arm.

Peterson’s Metaflesh: Poems in the Voices of the Monster. Peterson’s first full-length poetry collection is narrated by a gender-fluid Frankenstein creature. This publication follows Peterson’s recent LGBTQ-centered books The PrEP Diaries: A Safe(r) Sex Memoir and the Drag Star! interactive novel-cum-rpg. These books led to Peterson appearing on NPR Money.com and PBS.

Metaflesh combines camp and drag humor gruesome body horror and a modern take on gender and sexuality. The book recasts Shelley’s and Frankenstein’s creature as a film critic watching the movies and commercials in which the monster themself is a character–everything from James Whale’s classic Universal film to General Mills’ Franken Berry cereal. Flash prose pieces and traditional lyric poems exist side-by-side in this book reflecting the piecemeal identity of the creature. Metaflesh ships in paperback and ebook in early October 2021 just in time for Halloween.

After Bart Schoenfeld’s Chevrolet Bolt EV was recalled for the second time he’d had enough.

GM had warned that some of the cars could have a manufacturing defect that might cause them to catch fire. For safety’s sake the automaker recommended Bolt owners restrict their use of the car to avoid straining the batteries and park them away from their homes.

In an electric car if one battery cell has a defect that allows its stored energy to be released in an uncontrolled way that can cause it to heat up. That heat can in turn damage other cells nearby causing them to release their energy as heat too. This can start a chain reaction known as “thermal runaway” leading to a fire. Still electric car fires are rare compared to fires in gasoline powered cars.

So far Chevrolet Bolts have been blamed for 12 fires according to GM.

The restrictions turned owning what had been a very practical electric car into a huge inconvenience Schoenfeld said. GM offered to lend him a different car but it would have been gasoline-powered since GM doesn’t currently sell any electric vehicles but the Bolt. GM once sold a plug-in hybrid called the Volt but that car went out of production in 2019. To Schoenfeld a different GM car wasn’t a viable alternative. So instead GM bought his Bolt back from him.

“I’m very eco-conscious” he said. “I’ve got my solar and my geothermal in my house and I don’t want to burn fossil fuels.”

In a process that took weeks to finally work out Schoenfeld sold his Chevrolet Bolt EV back to GM for a price that was at about $10000 more than he would have gotten simply by trading the car in to a dealer he said though he declined to provide specific numbers.

It’s a solution that many Bolt owners are resorting to according to numerous social media reports and CNN Business interviews.

GM would not say how many vehicles it has bought back from customers. The company said it is deciding whether to buy back individual cars or not on a “case-by-case” basis. Alternatively GM is also offering to exchange the car for another GM vehicle.

Brandon Neider an information technology manager who also owns an auto detailing company in Yonkers New York has also submitted paperwork for a buyback a process he’s been told could take a few weeks given the number of requests.

“I really am not comfortable having this vehicle at this point” Neider said. “I’m not done with the brand but you know these guys don’t even know how long this is going to take to resolve.”

GM first announced a recall of the Chevy Bolt electric vehicles in November 2020 due to fire risk but it didn’t have an immediate fix. In May it announced a software repair but then there were two fires involving Bolts that had received that fix prompting another recall in July of 70000 vehicles. A month later the automaker issued a recall on another 70000 cars.

GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said the company will begin replacing battery modules on Bolt EVs at no charge to the owner once it has confidence that its battery supplier LG Energy Solution is producing defect-free batteries. There is no specific time frame in which that’s expected to happen though he said. NHTSA is also investigating the cause of the fires.

“We don’t have clear solutions yet as we’re investigating the cause of the fire” a spokesperson for LG Energy Solution said.

The LG spokesperson also said that since the issue is still being investigated the company could not comment on whether the root cause was an LG manufacturing issue.

In the meantime GM has recommended owners use their vehicles in ways that minimize stress on the batteries. That entails taking shorter trips and not allowing the batteries to charge too fully or drain too much.

Several Chevrolet Bolt EV owners interviewed for this story some of whom didn’t want their names published because they are still in discussions with the automaker said they loved their electric cars and weren’t upset at GM for the defect.

“You know stuff happens” said one woman who bought her Bolt in 2017. “Things go wrong.”

Although the process took weeks and involved lots of paperwork Schoenfeld said all the customer service people he dealt with were kind understanding and helpful.

Most of the other Bolt EV owners CNN Business spoke with were less sanguine on the customer service issue.

“I was on hold for one hour and 55 minutes listening to that god-awful music” said one man.

One woman in upstate New York who was concerned about the safety of her home in the event the Bolt began burning said GM offered her a 150-foot charging cable that would have allowed her to charge her car far away from her wooden house. But later she said another GM representative told her that no such cord existed. GM confirmed to CNN Business that there is no charging cord that long.

Several people said they are asking for buybacks because they purchased the car expecting it to be able to go a certain distance between charges up to 259 miles for the most recent models.

In announcing the most recent recalls GM recommended people not charge the battery to more 90% of its capacity. They also recommended that people not drain the battery to less than about 70 miles of range. That effectively reduced the driving range of even the longest-range models to about 163 miles according to EPA estimates. In real-world driving Chevrolet Bolts like other vehicles electric or not often don’t achieve their EPA-estimated range.

GM also recommended that people not charge their cars indoors overnight and that they park the cars outdoors immediately after charging. GM also recommended when parking in a garage parking on the top floor or an open deck and parking at least 50 feet away from any other vehicle.

“After every use after I come home in the evening I have get up in the middle of the night to unplug the car” said Schoenfeld.

GM customer service representatives suggested solutions short of selling back the car that also weren’t helpful some people claimed. Two people described being offered rental car reimbursement but they were asked to submit their rental car receipts at the end of each month. That would have meant racking up hundreds of dollars in rental car charges before even requesting repayment. GM did not confirm specifically how it handles rental car reimbursement.

Not all owners are thinking of getting rid of their cars though. Many would rather keep their Bolt abide by GM’s suggested usage limits and wait for the problem to be fixed.

“It seems like a small risk that we were willing to accept until Chevy can replace the battery” said Sally Heaven a Bolt owner in Maryland. “We also don’t have a garage so our car is parked in the driveway.”

For those who decide to request a buyback the process is time consuming and there is a lot of paperwork involved. GM would not explain exactly how it decides which cars to buy back other than to say “We continue to evaluate buyback requests from Bolt EV owners on a case-by-case basis.”

The formula used by GM in calculating a car’s value according to a brochure provided by the automaker involves taking the full amount paid and deducting a small amount for each mile driven plus other things like any purchase incentives that were received from GM and the cost of removing modifications made by the customer. It’s similar to calculations used in Lemon Law settlements said Steve Lehto a Michigan attorney who specializes in auto-related consumer law.

In agreeing to these buyback deals said Lehto GM is probably looking at the Lemon Laws and other warranty-related laws in each state. Every state has such laws but they vary in details and enforcement he said. Even though customers might not specifically invoke the laws they provide a basis for GM to understand what it ultimately could be forced to do if a customer were to push the issue in court.

For now some Bolt owners said they are looking at other electric cars.

Exactly how these SUVs will be different from the standard model isn't being made public but they will use a unique body-on-frame chassis and suspension setup while also using a lot of off-the-shelf parts GM said.

If the State Department is happy with the first batch it will likely place an order for 200 a year for nine years for a total of 1800 units.

You can certainly option up a Chevrolet Suburban to a high sticker price but whatever options and features you throw in you won't be able to match what the U.S. Department of State is spending for 10 purpose-built heavy-duty Suburbans over the next two years. These aren't your standard SUVs of course but ones that use a unique body-on-frame chassis and suspension among other security detail upgrades. Total value of the government development contract: $36.4 million or $3.64 million per Suburban.





Full details of the heavy-duty Suburbans are not being talked about just yet but GM (specifically GM Defense LLC) will use some of the money to develop the new chassis and suspension system which is required to ""support increased government vehicle performance requirements with a higher payload capacity and greater ground vehicle weight."" In other words armor and security components for high-profile government representatives like diplomats.



""Our development contract win speaks to our longstanding legacy of exceeding transportation capabilities and our new HD Suburban will deliver government-specific advanced mobility solutions to meet the needs of [the Diplomatic Security Service]"" said GM Defense president Steve duMont in a statement.



Not everything in the feds' Suburbans will be created new. GM said it will use ""significant"" off-the-shelf parts in the HD Suburban among them the body exterior propulsion interior and brakes. That will leave more of the development money to be spent on fine-tuning the ""advanced manufacturing tools and techniques including fixtureless assembly and flexible fabrication"" that GM said it will use to build these SUVs. GM said these techniques will help make building these kinds of low-volume products more efficient and reduce costs.



Keeping manufacturing costs down might not seem like a big deal when you're making just 10 vehicles with a budget of $36 million but this is likely just the first of many modified Suburbans that the State Department will buy from GM. GM Defense said it will deliver this first batch of vehicles next spring. Then when the development contract is completed around May 2023 the government is expected to put in an order for a fleet of 200 HD Suburbans each year for nine years. At a price significantly lower than $3 million each we taxpayers hope.

It's the sixth leading cause of death among adults in the United States and scientists still don't completely understand the disease according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Thomas Brink known by his family as Tom suffered an early-onset case of Alzheimer's and died in Billings after about seven-years with the disease at the age of 57 in 2018.

""He was in his late 40s to early 50s when he started having some personality changes” said Tamara Nunley Brink's daughter.

MTN News / Mitch Lagge Tamara Nunley Thomas Brink's daughter and president of Genuine Aircraft Hardware Co.

Brink was a successful aircraft mechanic aircraft inspector and was an aviator. He started up his business Genuine Aircraft Hardware Co. in 1984 in Lompoc California selling airplane parts and doing mechanic work.

In California Brink started a family of three kids with his wife Pamela.

""My dad he was frustrated trying to find hardware and so he figured well I can just buy it myself and sell the extra"" Nunley said.

Nunley said the business was Brink's baby and he did genius work with airplane mechanics and the processes to catalogue tens of thousands of parts that hold them together. He compiled a catalog of parts that sits on shelves at aircraft shops around the world referred to in the aviation community as ""The Little Blue Bible"" Nunley said.

""When he passed on it was shocking because he was so young but tragic because he was so young. We all lost someone. Not just me or my mother. We all lost someone amazing. The aviation industry lost someone amazing"" Nunley said.

MTN News / Mitch Lagge Thomas Brink founder of Genuine Aircraft Hardware Co. stands in front of an airplane he fixed up that had a hefty repair bill.

Nunley has been working for the family business her entire adult life and now serves as president of the company.

It was hard to believe the huge presence in their life was beginning to slip away to Alzheimer's Nunley said.

“With him being as young as he was that wasn’t what even crossed our minds at first. You know there’s got to be something else going on he’s in his early 50s there’s no way it’s Alzheimer's. I guess that’s a piece of advice for anyone that is experiencing personality changes. For anyone else experiencing personality changes in their loved ones. Or poor work performance that was out of character. There could be something else going on and there are resources out there to help determine that"" Nunley said.

For Brink the disease started as little things Nunley said. He would misremember details of work meetings or disagree about where a tool was last placed on a family project.

“Different things like that seem innocent at first and mildly frustrating but when you have all those experiences that add up and compound and get worse and worse and you realize that there’s something else going on here. This isn’t just him having a rough day"" Nunley said.

After many difficult decisions at the company much time spent actually finding out the correct diagnosis and seeing too many doctors and specialists to count the family moved to Billings in 2017 to seek better medical care for Brink.

Brink was an avid outdoorsman and loved hunting fishing and hiking. There had always been a plan to move the family and business to Montana but it came with much more unfortunate circumstances Nunley said.

MTN News / Mitch Lagge Family photos of Thomas Brink inside a memorial collage.

Nunley said talking with her father about future outdoor expeditions was often a heart-wrenching technique she used to redirect conversation.

“There was a part of us that thought that could still happen. There was definitely his whole being thought that could still happen. He was going to get better"" Nunley said.

As time went on Brink's condition worsened. Nunley said he eventually became unfit to drive had resistances to change and experienced thoughts that don't make sense or delusions.

""That also was not his personality but he had a lot of odd symptoms. Severe symptoms are common in early-onset (Alzheimers)” Nunley said.

The family's first year in Billings they participated in the Walk to End Alzheimer's and carried a blue flower pinwheel symbolizing a person who has Alzheimers. Similar walks are hosted across the country by the nonprofit group Alzheimer's Association. The group funds care research and advocacy for people with Alzheimer's and served as a resource of information for the Brink family.

“It was a colorful lively hopeful event that he did not understand the gravity of and that is the blessing in a lot of ways. He walked that first year and passed away right before the next event. He didn’t get to join us in body but was there in spirit"" Nunley said.

The Brink family will attend the walk virtually this year Nunley said.

The Walk to End Alzheimer's is scheduled to take place in Billings on Sunday in a hybrid format. People are encouraged to visit the open house from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. at Rocky Mountain College before walking a two-mile route around campus. Or they can register online and walk wherever they feel comfortable. Click here to visit the race registration website.

Even though Thomas Brink is gone Genuine Aircraft Hardware Co. is still around and in a new 10000 square foot location in Billings. The family made the tough choice to relocate to Montana during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The family has started a new memorial wall in the Billings shop to remember Brink's legacy at the company he built from the ground up.

MTN News / Mitch Lagge The first logo for Genuine Aircraft Hardware Co. hangs on the memorial wall for the company's founder Thomas Brink in the Billings shop location. Brink's mother designed the first logo.

“It’s been super crazy and we’ve managed to survive this and our goal is to keep the company alive and to keep his memory alive through the operation of our company. We’re never afraid to tell anyone about him because he was such an amazing person that should be here today"" Nunley said.

The 51-year-old Pose actor was an honoree at The Elizabeth Taylor Ball to End AIDS event (presented by Gilead Sciences) in West Hollywood Park Calif. on Friday. He told PEOPLE at the event that life has been ""freeing"" since opening up about his illness.

""There is a shame component with being Black with being queer with having HIV that is silencing and destructive"" Porter explained. ""I am no more silenced I am no more shamed and I'm ready for whatever comes next.""

The 2021 Emmys nominee said he's received ""wonderful feedback"" from many people who were ""uplifted"" by his story and ""felt seen because of it"" in the months following his announcement.

""I think it's important that those of us who have a platform use our platforms in ways that move difficult conversations forward"" he told PEOPLE ""and that can be transformative in some way and make a change make a difference.""

Porter will strike a similar tone in his upcoming book ""Unprotected: A Memoir"" which he says ""is about healing trauma through my art.""

As for Elizabeth Taylor Porter lauded her courage to become a role model not just for him but for many others worldwide after HIV and AIDS first came into prominence in the 1980s.

""She taught us all how to love unconditionally in the middle of one of the darkest times in American history"" he told PEOPLE. ""It is a profound and humbling honor to be here and to be recognized and to have my voice and my name mentioned in the same breath as the other honorees this evening. It's profound and it's emotional.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci amFAR and National AIDS Policy director Sandra Thurman also received the Elizabeth Taylor Commitment to End AIDS award as fellow honorees.

In May Porter revealed in an essay for The Hollywood Reporter that he first tested positive for HIV in 2007 which he called ""the worst year of [his] life."" The Pose star said shame led him to live with the diagnosis in silence for the next 14 years.

""I was the generation that was supposed to know better and it happened anyway"" Porter wrote. ""I was on the precipice of obscurity for about a decade or so but 2007 was the worst of it. By February I had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. By March I signed bankruptcy papers. And by June I was diagnosed HIV-positive.""

Growing up in the Pentecostal church among a ""very religious family"" Porter said being HIV-positive was considered to be ""God's punishment."" He only informed a select few people of his diagnosis before his public announcement in May.

""I was trying to have a life and a career and I wasn't certain I could if the wrong people knew"" he penned in the essay. ""It would just be another way for people to discriminate against me in an already discriminatory profession.""

Porter said he tried to avoid thinking about being HIV positive as much as possible. ""I tried to block it out. But quarantine [for COVID-19] has taught me a lot. Everybody was required to sit down and shut the f— up.""

During an appearance on The Tonight Show later that month the Like A Boss actor told Jimmy Fallon that the diagnosis weighed ""heavy"" on him after living through the AIDS crisis.

Now that his secret is out in the open however Porter said he felt liberated. ""I lived with the shame of it for a really long time and last week I released that shame I released that trauma and I am a free man honey! Free!"" he told Fallon.

""I've never felt joy like this before"" he continued later adding ""I got some joy now. It really feels good it really feels great.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL21lcmNrLXRvdXRzLWtleXRydWRhLXMtdG5iYy1saWZlLWV4dGVuc2lvbi13aW4tYXMtZmlyc3QtdG8tbWFya2V0LXRlY2VudHJpcS1sZWF2ZXMtcmluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ESMO: Merck touts Keytruda's breast cancer survival win as first-to-market Tecentriq leaves the ring,"With Roche’s Tecentriq out of the picture Merck’s Keytruda is now detailing key data that prove why it deserves a place in newly diagnosed metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

Keytruda used in tandem with chemotherapy cut the risk of death by 27% over chemo alone in previously untreated patients whose tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker at a combined positive score (CPS) of at least 10.

Adding Keytruda helped those patients live an additional 6.9 months or a median of 23 months according to data unveiled at the European Society for Medical Oncology 20201 annual meeting.

Keytruda snagged an accelerated approval in front-line triple-negative breast cancer in November based on results showing it could stave off tumor progression. An FDA green light in July for its use around surgery for early-stage high-risk TNBC converted that conditional nod into a full one.

Just as it failed to move the needle on cancer progression among patients with PD-L1 scores of at least 1—a broader group of patients—Keytruda also failed to show a statistically significant survival benefit in that population. Adding Keytruda only pared down the risk of death by 14% in patients whose PD-L1 scores came in at 1 or above. The median survival time was 7.6 months for the Keytruda-chemo group and 5.6 months for the solo chemo group.

RELATED: Merck's Keytruda scores first-in-class nod in early triple-negative breast cancer despite FDA's prior reluctance

Keytruda’s latest win from the Keynote-355 trial came as Roche made the surprising move to pull Tecentriq’s front-line TNBC indication off its label—even after an FDA advisory committee voted in April to keep that conditional nod in place.

Tecentriq used in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb’s chemo drug Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) was the first immuno-oncology agent to pick up an FDA nod in TNBC. But Tecentriq flopped a later trial alongside the original paclitaxel formulation throwing doubt on that use and prompting a close inspection of that data during the FDA advisory panel meeting.

Keytruda likely played a part in forcing Tecentriq out of the TNBC field. In taking back Tecentriq’s indication in late August Roche said that “due to the recent changes in the treatment landscape the FDA no longer considers it appropriate to maintain the accelerated approval.”

In July Merck revealed that Keytruda used both before and after surgery reduced the risk of disease worsening cancer returning or death by 37% in patients with early-stage nonmetastatic TNBC. And just as Merck successfully convinced the FDA to reverse a previous rejection of that neoadjuvant and adjuvant indication the Keynote-355 trial also reported the now-detailed positive overall survival readout.

RELATED: Roche pulls Tecentriq breast cancer nod after post-approval trial flop

With Tecentriq out of the way Keytruda can have the TNBC immuno-oncology market all to itself for awhile. But as Roche’s chief medical officer Levi Garraway made clear in an earlier statement about the withdrawal the Swiss drugmaker will continue to study Tecentriq in metastatic TNBC. For example the ongoing IMpassion132 trial is testing the PD-L1 inhibitor alongside chemo for patients with early relapsing TNBC.

Merck is committed to continuing to evaluate promising novel therapies in TNBC Vicki Goodman vice president of oncology clinical research at Merck Research Laboratories said in an interview.

Goodman highlighted the New Jersey pharma’s recent tie-up with Seagen on the latter’s LIV-1 antibody-drug conjugate ladiratuzumab vedotin a potential rival to Gilead Sciences’ Trodelvy. Merck and its partner are testing the ADC both as a monotherapy and in combination with Keytruda in TNBC.",,,,,,,,,

Unlike a typical credit card the titanium card with its sleek and minimalist design was rapidly seen as the must-have status symbol for those with an enviable credit rating. However what wasn’t mentioned with the launch of the Apple credit card was what it meant for the future of payments in an era when digital payment services are starting to gain traction across the globe.

Apple’s decision to launch a physical card accompanied by the surge in demand from consumers made it clear that payment cards aren’t likely to disappear anytime soon. Now more than ever the financial sector must respond with products and services that deliver convenience control and speed. They can stay relevant to consumers by enabling secure and easy digital transactions.

Today the payment industry is in a period of fierce competition as challenger banks mobile accounts and digital wallets battle for consumer attention. In the midst of that battle metal payment cards have become the hottest ticket in town aiming to reach high-value and trend-driven consumers.

Satisfying your customers desire for premium quality

Metal cards are currently an indicator of luxury status for high-value accounts – the American Express Centurion (also known as the infamous ‘black card’) was one of the first titanium cards available; however it was invitation only and cost $5000 per year.

Since then these cards have grown in popularity and reduced in cost achieving top-of-wallet status for a wider range of consumers. The sleek design and heavyweight feel are an indicator to customers that they’re getting top-notch service and a bank account with heft – helping banks to stand out from the competition.

Meanwhile their contactless technology allows consumers to pay for goods in a touch-free transaction process that is fast frequent and familiar.

And of course as we’re all doing our bit to move to more sustainable materials those who offer them can also show that they are doing their bit for the planet with a durable alternative.

Security concerns and considerations

Despite the environmental positives flashing a contactless metal card while paying for goods is still a symbol of high-value credit limits and they may be a more visible target of card-present fraud. Contactless cards represented 73% of all card transactions last year and unauthorised financial fraud losses from UK payment cards reached £395.9 million meanwhile card-present fraud is still on the rise.

So while still promoting the ‘cool factor’ if payment providers are to roll contactless metal cards out to the wider market it is important they must also make sure they are providing added security for consumers against potential payment fraud on high-value accounts.

Are biometrics the key to delivering a secure metal card?

Payment providers need to provide a competitive advantage to keep their card offering top of wallet for today’s contactless consumers. Metal cards could be the answer but only if they are trusted and reliable.

To do this payment providers should look to combine contactless technology with fingerprint authorisation to secure credit limits and connect the payment card to the person. When added to payment cards biometric fingerprint authorisation is the key link in the chain of trust providing an unparalleled level of defence for payment transactions. eliminating the incentive for theft or misuse of payment cards.

By incorporating biometric authentication it will also remove the need for PINs and payment limits from desirable metal cards to allow them to deliver a secure convenient and attractive card offering to the consumers of tomorrow.

Fingerprint biometric technology allows providers to secure multiple services in one card including payments transport loyalty schemes and digital ID. This technology will help consumers to tap and go all from their one metal card making the product offerings even more attractive to a younger market.

Building a personal finance plan for the future

It’s no secret that metal cards are fast becoming a selling point for banks and payment providers. Yet it’s important that consumers are confident and secure with these new payment options. Therefore a more sustainable safe and timely solution is required. Payment providers must now look to integrate fingerprint biometric sensors to ensure that metal payment cards remain secure trusted and reliable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL3NlcC8xOC90aGUtc3VyZ2UtaW4tYnV5LW5vdy1wYXktbGF0ZXItYW5kLXdoeS13ZS1zaG91bGQtYmUtd29ycmllZNIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL3NlcC8xOC90aGUtc3VyZ2UtaW4tYnV5LW5vdy1wYXktbGF0ZXItYW5kLXdoeS13ZS1zaG91bGQtYmUtd29ycmllZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The surge in ‘buy now pay later’ – and why we should be worried,"Shoppers tempted by Boohoo’s bestselling satin skater dress are bombarded by options to pay for it using today’s hottest form of consumer credit – “buy now pay later”.The fast-fashion website gives shoppers four ways to pay for the £30 dress in instalments: from three monthly payments of £10 with Klarna to six weekly lots of £5 with Laybuy. Even those trying to buy it outright using a debit or credit card see reminders of “more ways to pay” flash up.

Once a niche form of credit buy now pay later (BNPL) deals have exploded during the pandemic. Labelled by some as “the future of millennial finance” it has gained a foothold among the under-30s and those with tight finances who have welcomed the ability to delay payment for goods typically without interest. But it has also stoked fears that the unregulated financial product is encouraging unsustainable spending and reliance on debt.

Fintech upstarts – such as Clearpay Laybuy and industry leader Klarna – have dominated the burgeoning sector doling out credit to consumers in return for lucrative commission from beauty fashion and furniture retailers. Last week Monzo became one of the first UK banks to begin rolling out a BNPL service to its 5 million-plus customers who can use it for online and in-person purchases at any retailer and secure credit limits of up to £3000 after an affordability check. Rival Revolut confirmed it was “at the early stages” of developing a BNPL feature for Europe.

The largest of the providers Klarna is best known for hiring celebrities such as Snoop Dog and Madonna to advertise its services. The Swedish firm became one of the world’s most valuable fintech companies second only to Stripe after it was valued at nearly $46bn (£33bn) earlier this year. Laybuy The New Zealand-based firm was launched in 2017 but has grown rapidly across the UK and Australia. Purchases are usually spread across six weekly instalments and this can also apply to items bought in store at partner retailers. Laybuy runs hard credit checks on customers and says it rejects a quarter of all the people who apply. Clearpay This Australian company launched in 2014 and entered the UK two years ago. Known as Afterpay in some countries it allows customers to pay in four instalments two weeks apart. Clearpay currently only operates online but is hoping to launch in bricks-and-mortar stores by early 2022. It was acquired by San Francisco-based Square in August in a $49bn all-stock deal. Paypal The American payments giant allows UK shoppers to split their payments into three monthly instalments at the checkout. It announced in August that it was scrapping late fees for missed payments on all BNPL products globally which suggests that shoppers had been put off by providers who charged.

Mainstream banks are jostling for a slice of the action amid predictions that by 2026 Britons will be spending close to £40bn a year by this method. Traditional lenders may have no choice but to join the goldrush: the boom in BNPL risks cannibalising their lucrative credit card businesses.

Last week Goldman Sachs spent $2.2bn (£1.6bn ) to acquire GreenSky a BNPL fintech focused on spreading the cost of home improvement loans rather than retail.

Barclays has said it hopes to extend an existing BNPL venture – which charges interest – and offer credit to Amazon’s UK customers at the checkout. That potential deal is still in the works but whether the lender will stick with traditional BNPL or scrap interest to rival the upstarts is unclear. Barclays is also partnering with a US fintech to offer “financing instalment options” across the pond. There is also speculation that other UK high street banks are eyeing interest-free BNPL with far broader applications.

For retailers the lure of BNPL is simple: customers spend more. “It increases the basket size and it also reduces dropped baskets” said an investor in a BNPL startup. “After a while if everyone uses it you would be a brave as a retailer to take it out. If you’re a director of retailing you would say it’s great. But if you were the chief executive of a retailer and looked at it you would realise it’s a problem.”

Retailers happily pay lenders generous commission in return for those higher sales. The investor said double-digit commission rates were not uncommon in the industry. For lenders handling payments has shifted from a cost centre to a profit centre they said.

“The issue is the checkout button. That’s the hippy crack of the industry. It’s the button where somebody can pay and leave the checkout without spending any money up front.

“People are signing up to a credit agreement and you cannot say they have fully understood the funding if it’s a two-click process. Nobody reads the terms and conditions.”

Gary Rohloff co-founder of Laybuy said it used “hard credit checks” and rejected 25% of applicants to use Laybuy. “We support regulation and done correctly [it] will help raise standards across industry. As more providers enter the market that responsibility message is more vital than ever.”

Lenders who decide to jump in will be doing so without knowing what regulations are coming down the track from the Financial Conduct Authority which is expected to introduce rules for interest-free BNPL products in late 2022 at the earliest. The lack of formal scrutiny has prompted debt campaigners to warn this could be the next Wonga-style scandal to hit the financial sector. The payday lender went bust in 2018.

Sue Anderson of the debt charity StepChange said: “Buy now pay later services don’t give individuals enough time or protection to stop pause and understand the consequences of their purchase. Sometimes this even means people end up using BNPL at the online checkout without actually realising they have signed up.

“Second affordability checks are only used by some BNPL lenders and protections against taking out multiple BNPL loans are lacking. Finally due to a lack of regulation it’s not clear whether these services are treating customers fairly and in a way that is consistent with other credit products.”

Boohoo said the average customer spend per item using BNPL on its website was “relatively low” at £11.96. “Like virtually every other retailer in the UK our website offers a range of payment options to suit the needs of our customers.”

Ronan Dunphy a banking analyst at stockbroker Goodbody said the regulators’ approach will be a critical determinant of how large the market could get.

“BNPL clearly resonates with a large cohort of consumers as evidenced by the rapid growth in the market” he said. “However this growth has taken place in the absence of any regulatory constraints and in an environment where it is not always clear if consumers understand the terms of the products.”

In the UK the use of BNPL nearly quadrupled in 2020 to £2.7bn in transactions according to official data – still a fraction of the £250bn of outstanding consumer credit debt. Between the start of the pandemic and the end of last year 5 million people used a BNPL product an FCA survey found while the consultancy Capital Economics claimed there were “over 10 million users” in 2020.

Analysts at Juniper Research told the Observer that by 2026 spending via BNPL services will hitwas predicted to reach almost $51bn (£37bn) in the UK alone. Globally it predicts spending will reach $995bn in five years’ time almost four times the current figure.

I hope the new BNPL regulation will include checks on a customer’s ability to repay if they are taking instalment plans Jason Wassell Consumer Credit Trade Association

Up until now the focus has mainly been on occasional fashion and beauty purchases and the average amounts borrowed are often relatively small – £65-£75 per transaction according to the FCA.

Some commentators say this has all been fuelled by advertising slogans inviting people to “shop like a queen” and telling them “don’t wait until payday” as well as by influencers on Instagram. But according to Capco a technology and management consultancy that could all change if supermarkets and other essential retailers come on board. The UK has already seen the launch of Flava which calls itself a “buy now pay later online supermarket”. It lets people spread the cost of their grocery shopping and stocks leading brands such as Heinz and Kellogg’s.

BNPL providers are also increasingly partnering with higher-value retailers selling everything from vacuum cleaners and electric guitars to garden furniture and mattresses edging closer to essential items that could lure in more-vulnerable customers without the protection of FCA regulation.

It has caught the attention of regulators and politicians who are becoming increasingly concerned about how easy it is for consumers to buy more than they can afford using BNPL and potentially rack up sizeable debts. Because so much of this market is unregulated critics say some people are able to take out credit that they otherwise would not be able to obtain.

Rivals to the burgeoning industry are also taking note. Short-term lenders including payday lenders that have faced their own regulatory crackdown are concerned that BNPL has made it harder to assess how much debt consumers are actually shouldering and carry out effective affordability checks. The industry has already been stung by a tsunami of compensation claims by customers who say they were mis-sold loans they could not afford: this led to a collapse of a string of payday lenders including Wonga.

“I hope the new BNPL regulation will include checks on a customer’s ability to repay if they are taking instalment plans” said Jason Wassell chief executive of the Consumer Credit Trade Association which represents short-term and payday lenders. “We need increased visibility of this form of borrowing on credit records. BNPL use is currently invisible and means other lenders are making decisions without seeing the whole picture.”

But regulated banks have another concern on the horizon: how BNPL may be diverting income from other revenue streams such as credit cards and traditional loans.

In July the consultancy firm McKinsey said US banks had been slow to respond to the surge in demand for BNPL and so had lost about $8bn to $10bn in annual revenues to fintechs.

“For credit cards in particular there is a major threat from buy now pay later” said Nick Maynard lead analyst at Juniper Research.

In June Klarna launched an app that allows UK users to shop at any online retailer regardless of whether it has partnered with the firm and split the payment into three interest-free instalments – eliminating the need to use a credit card.

Laybuy – which lets people pay in six weekly instalments – recently launched a digital card allowing customers to buy now pay later at selected stores with just a tap of their smartphone instead of using their bank plastic.

McKinsey said the largest BNPL players were steadily building scale with the aim of becoming shopping and banking “super apps” that would enable them to take charge of every aspect of the “purchase journey”. There is already evidence of this happening: Klarna said recently that following a successful test phase it was rolling out current accounts in Germany so people there could “experience the full end-to-end Klarna experience”.

BNPL providers typically claim to provide a more transparent and cheaper alternative to credit cards. Samantha Palmer managing director of Payl8r another BNPL firm said that “millennials don’t want credit cards and don’t like banks” adding that young adults found it hard to get finance because they had not had a chance to build their credit rating.

In the UK PayPal is one of the biggest financial players so far to muscle in on this market. It launched a BNPL service in October 2020 and has unveiled similar services in the US Australia and France. PayPal said last week that globally it had now processed more than $3.5bn (£2.5bn) in payments.

In February this year the government announced that buy now pay later would be regulated by the FCA after it ruled there was “a significant risk” of harm to consumers. Many consumers did not view BNPL as credit so did not apply the same level of scrutiny and checks by providers tended to focus on the risk for the firm rather than how affordable it was for the customer the regulator found.

The move means firms will have to conduct proper affordability checks before lending and ensure customers are treated fairly if they struggle to repay. There have been warnings from some MPs that BNPL could be “the next Wonga waiting to happen”.

It could be some time before this all takes effect. The Treasury’s consultation on BNPL is expected to be published before the end of October and assuming parliament passes legislation the FCA plans to consult on new rules in 2022. Until then there are a lot of £30 dresses to sell.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2Jsb2dzL2RpZ2l0YWwtbWVodGEvdG9wLTUtb25saW5lLXBheW1lbnQtZ2F0ZXdheS1pbi1pbmRpYS_SAV5odHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9ibG9ncy9kaWdpdGFsLW1laHRhL3RvcC01LW9ubGluZS1wYXltZW50LWdhdGV3YXktaW4taW5kaWEv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 5 online payment gateway in India,"Rohit Mehta is an Indian blogger author and entrepreneur.

The impact on certain areas of industry and its ability to continue production has also attracted attention.

This explainer sets out the background to the issue and the action the government is taking to protect the UK’s energy supply industry and consumers.

Natural gas prices have been steadily rising across the globe this year for a number of reasons. This has affected Europe including the UK as well as other countries around the world.

We have a diverse range of gas supply sources with sufficient capacity to more than meet demand. The UK’s gas system continues to operate reliably and we do not anticipate any increased risk of supply emergencies this winter.

Why are there high global gas prices?

The prices that are currently visible reflect the high value being placed on gas at the present time with prices being determined by global supply and demand. They are not necessarily representative of pre-existing contracts and therefore do not apply to all of the gas being consumed in the UK this winter.

Current prices reflect a number of factors including:

as the world comes out of COVID-19 lockdowns and economies reopen we are seeing an uptick in global gas demand this year.

combined with a cold winter (which has an impact on gas demand as gas is often used for heating homes) this has led to a much tighter gas market with less spare capacity

in particular high demand in Asia for Liquified Natural Gas ( LNG ) natural gas transported globally by ship means less LNG than expected has reached Europe

) natural gas transported globally by ship means less than expected has reached Europe some essential maintenance projects rescheduled from 2020 due to coronavirus coincided with necessary scheduled projects in 2021 while weather events in the US have adversely affected their LNG exports to Europe

How are high global gas prices impacting the UK?

The gas market is crucial to the UK’s energy supply because of its significance in heating industry and power generation.

Over 22 million households are connected to the gas grid and in 2020 38% of the UK’s gas demand was used for domestic heating 29% for electricity generation and 11% for industrial and commercial use.

High gas wholesale prices have subsequently driven an increase in wholesale power prices this year.

In recent weeks this trend has been exacerbated by the weather and planned maintenance at some power stations. This has resulted in unusually low margins for this time of year. These factors have combined to cause spikes in wholesale electricity prices with a number of short-term markets trading at or near record levels.

While we are not complacent we do not expect supply emergencies this winter.

Is our gas supply at risk?

The Great Britain (GB) gas system has delivered securely to date and is expected to continue to function effectively with a diverse range of supply sources and sufficient delivery capacity to more than meet demand.

While our largest single source of gas supply continues to be the UK Continental Shelf (approximately 48% of total supply in 2020) the maturity of that source means we have to supplement supply from international markets.

Whilst the diversity of those international sources promotes our energy security by reducing reliance on a particular source the UK – as with other nations – is exposed to global trends in supply and demand which affect the price of gas traded at UK’s market hub (the National Balancing Point).

We have a wide range of supply sources including direct pipelines across the North Sea from Norway to the UK our single biggest source of imports. We are also investing millions into scaling up strong renewable energy capacity and driving down demand for fossil fuels.

GB also has a number of gas storage facilities that act as a source of system flexibility when responding to short-run changes in supply and demand.

What is the government doing on this?

Energy security is an absolute priority for this government. The government works closely with the regulator and gas supply operators to monitor supply and demand.

While wholesale gas prices have increased internationally this year the market continues to balance supply and demand through adjusting the prices at which energy trades take place. We have no reason to suggest this will not continue but will monitor the market.

National Grid Gas has a number of tools at its disposal to mitigate the risk of a gas supply emergency including requesting additional gas supplies be delivered to the National Transmission System. Together with the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy ( BEIS ) National Grid Gas has robust response plans in place in the unlikely event that risk should materialise. Read plans for network gas supply emergencies.

Will this affect energy bills?

The high wholesale gas prices that are currently visible may not be the actual prices being paid by all consumers.

This is because major energy suppliers purchase much of their wholesale supplies many months in advance giving protection to them and their customers from short-term price spikes.

The Energy Price Cap is also in place to protect millions of customers from the sudden increases in global gas prices this winter. Despite the rising costs of wholesale energy the cap still saves 15 million households up to £100 a year.

The current global wholesale gas price situation as set out above could have an effect on companies.

Companies without longer-term contracts may face higher costs but we expect that companies with longer-term contracts in place may have little exposure to the current high wholesale prices. If there were an event where a supplier fails Ofgem would work to ensure that customers are moved to a new supplier so they are not without energy.

How is the government helping poorer households?

Our Energy Price Cap will protect millions of customers from the sudden increases in global gas prices this winter.

We are also supporting low income and fuel poor households with their energy bills in a number of ways which demonstrates the government’s commitment.

This includes through:

the Warm Home Discount which provides eligible households with a £140 discount

in addition Winter Fuel Payments and Cold Weather Payments will help ensure those most vulnerable are better able to heat their homes over the colder months

Vulnerable people and anyone in financial distress during this time should talk to their energy supplier who will be able to discuss personal circumstances and consider options to help including reassessing reducing or pausing payments. Emergency measures have been agreed between government and energy suppliers to support those most in need during the disruption caused by COVID-19 and this agreement remains in place this winter. Read details of the agreement.

As set out in the Energy white paper we plan to extend the Warm Home Discount until 2026 increase it to £150 and help an extra 780000 pensioners and low-income families with their energy bills. With a total of 2.7 million to get support with the vast majority to receive the money back automatically without having to apply as at present.

Cold Weather Payments provide vulnerable households on qualifying benefits with financial support when the weather has been or is forecasted to be unusually cold. £25 is available for eligible households for each 7 day period of very cold weather between 1 November and 31 March."

My time here was awesome. Great people. Great organization. I had a lot of friends that I took with me when I left."" - Lance Lynn

ARLINGTON Texas — Over the past few years the Texas Rangers have struck gold on a few three-year deals for pitchers who were looking for a fresh start elsewhere. But the one the Rangers hit on more than any other was when they signed Lance Lynn to a three-year $30 million contract ahead of the 2019 season.

In two seasons with the Rangers Lynn not only revived his career but took it to a whole new level. Lynn became a Cy Young candidate in both seasons with the Rangers and proved himself to still be a legitimate workhorse that can pitch atop just about any rotation in baseball.

With the Rangers heading for a full-fledged rebuild they opted to cash in on Lynn's value last winter and traded him to the Chicago White Sox for Dane Dunning and Avery Weems.

In his first time visiting Globe Life Field since he left Lynn still appreciates and values his short-yet-impactful time with the Rangers. After all Lynn will forever hold a place in Rangers history as the starting pitcher of the final game at Choctaw Stadium (née The Ballpark in Arlington) and the first game at Globe Life Field earning the win in both.

But despite the Cy Young nominations and the honor of christening a new ballpark there's just one thing that was missing for Lynn.

""I would have loved to win more"" Lynn said in an exclusive interview with InsideTheRangers.com. ""My time here was awesome. Great people. Great organization. I had a lot of friends that I took with me when I left.

""Bobby Wilson and I go way back. We've been able to stay in touch and all that. The pitchers are the big ones I've stayed in touch with so I've texted with Jordan Lyles and [others]. It's good to see everybody. I'm just trying to come in and enjoy the weekend.""

We've seen several former Rangers make their returns to Texas this season. Rougned Odor came back as a member of the New York Yankees and was greeted kindly by the Rangers faithful. Elvis Andrus made his return in June with the Oakland A's and received a welcome only fit for a king.

As Lynn makes his return to Texas with a start on Saturday night on the docket Lynn's just trying to make it as simple as possible.

""It's just another series; another place to go"" Lynn said. ""But when you know the whole staff and everyone here and you get to go back and see people you think very highly of and you enjoyed being around those time are always fun. So when I knew we were coming down here I was obviously looking forward to it.

""I know that the team is a little different personnel-wise than I was with last year. There's some new faces but there's also some guys on the team that I still think very highly of and have good friendships with. So it's fun to come back.""

Of course no conversation with Lance Lynn should go without talking pitching. As Lynn goes into Saturday night's start he carries with him a 2.50 ERA 1.05 WHIP and 4.9 bWAR. He's as formidable a foe on the mound that he was in his two seasons with the Rangers. What's special about Lynn is his ability to throw almost exclusively fastballs (a four-seam two-seam and cutter) in an era where pitchers are using breaking balls and offspeed stuff more than ever.

In his two season with Texas Lynn increased his fastball usage from 87.5 percent in 2019 to 90.5 percent in 2020. This season with a deep Chicago team Lynn is throwing his three fastballs 92.4 percent of the time.

Needless to say Lynn is the best in the game at attacking hitters with a variation of fastballs.

""I think the big thing is hitters aren't comfortable because they don't know which one is coming or which side of the plate"" Lynn explained. ""Hitters are more comfortable when they know you like to throw slow stuff and they know your fastball stays on one side of the plate. You just try to make sure you command the ball on both sides of the plate in and out up and down. If you do that the hitter can't sit on you and they can't get comfortable. That's the main thing: trying to make sure that they've gotta cover all four corners of the strike zone. If you do that you're going to have a good chance to be successful.""

On Saturday night expect a warm reception from the Rangers faithful for Lance Lynn. Even though Globe Life Field will be a comfortable 72 degrees also expect a high dosage of heat.

The move with Arihara before the series finale against the Chicago White Sox cleared a spot on the 40-man roster for the Rangers to reinstate right-hander Mike Foltynewicz from the COVID-related injury list.

Arihara is 2-4 with a 6.64 ERA in 10 starts this season. He has made three starts since returning from the injured list after having surgery in May for an aneurysm in his throwing shoulder. He has made three starts since being activated from the IL on Sept. 1 giving up six runs in four-plus innings Wednesday against Houston.

Texas could assign Arihara outright to the minors if he clears waivers. He could then be invited to spring training as a non-roster player with the chance to compete for a spot in the starting rotation.

The 29-year-old Arihara pitched six years with the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters of Japan's Pacific League before signing a $6.2 million contract with the Rangers last December. He got $3.6 million this season and is due $2.6 million in 2022.

The Rangers also had to pay a $1.2 million posting fee for Arihara.

The Chicago White Sox won 7-2 against the Texas Rangers as they get a series win on the road for the first time this month. It was a great offensive comeback game for the South Siders and a great pitching performance from Lucas Giolito to bring the magic number down to just four.

Righty Jordan Lyles started off the top of the first inning by surrendering a leadoff single to Tim Anderson but that would be all. Lucas Giolito came out strong only allowing a single to Willie Calhoun in the bottom of the inning. Lyles and Giolito both pitched scoreless second and third innings and it wasn’t until the top of the fourth inning where a home run put the White Sox on the board.

Yasmani Grandal for the second day in a row hit a solo shot to get the scoring started at 1-0. Gavin Sheets followed up with a double while Leury García got on base due to a bunt single. After a strikeout by Romy González and wild pitch by Lyles runners were on second and third for César Hernández.

Hernández who has had a great offensive series smashed a two-run single to left to extend the White Sox lead to 3-1.

With two outs Anderson started a rally again with a single followed by a Yoán Moncada walk to load the bases. José Abreu singled to score two runners and extend the lead to 5-0.

Abreu is now tied with Salvador Perez for the MLB lead in RBIs with 113.

After a walk to Grandal Lyles was replaced by Dennis Santana. Lyles went just 3 2⁄ 3 innings with eight hits five funs and three strikeouts.

Giolito pitched a 1-2-3 bottom of the fourth inning and Mike Foltynewicz replaced Santana in the top of the fifth pitching a 1-2-3 inning as well. Giolito got into a bit of trouble in the bottom of the inning as he allowed back-to-back singles to DJ Peters and Yonny Hernández. Giolito got José Trevino to ground into a double play but with two outs Isiah Kiner-Falefa singled to drive in Peters making it 5-1.

After a walk by Giolito in the top of the sixth inning he was replaced by Aaron Bummer. Giolito had a solid day on the mound as he went 5 1⁄ 3 innings with six hits one run and four strikeouts. Bummer finished the sixth clean.

The South Siders added to the scoring in the top of the seventh inning after a leadoff single by Abreu. He advanced to second on a ground out as Gavin Sheets walked. Sheets was replaced by Billy Hamilton at first base and was immediately put to good use.

Who other than Leury Legend to drive in the runners and make it 7-1?

Michael Kopech came in to pitch the seventh where he had a clean inning in a back-to-back night-day pitching appearance.

Mike Wright Jr. was able to pitch today as well as he is in the process of appealing his three-game suspension for “intentionally” hitting Shohei Ohtani.

Wright allowed one run in the bottom of the eighth on a sacrifice fly by Adolis García that had all of us holding our breaths for a moment. Wright came back to close the game in the ninth inning where he struck out a batter and induced two ground outs to end it.

This win was much-needed after the game yesterday and the team is one win closer to clinching a postseason appearance. Cleveland plays a doubleheader tomorrow the White Sox will go to Detroit to play the Tigers so theoretically the magic number could be down to 1 by tomorrow night. Carlos Rodón will get the start against Matt Manning and game time will be at 5:40 p.m. CT.

Enjoy the rest of this beautiful and sports-filled Sunday evening and get ready for a new week of baseball starting tomorrow!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8xOS9jaGljYWdvLXdoaXRlLXNveC1tYW5hZ2Utb25seS0zLWhpdHMtaW4tYS0yLTEtbG9zcy10by10aGUtdGV4YXMtcmFuZ2Vycy10by1rZWVwLXRoZWlyLW1hZ2ljLW51bWJlci1hdC01L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chicago White Sox manage only 3 hits in a 2-1 loss to the Texas Rangers to keep their magic number at 5,"Yoán Moncada nearly had a run-scoring extra-base hit in the top of the seventh inning for the Chicago White Sox.

“I thought it was a homer” Sox acting manager Miguel Cairo said. “I was kind of excited but … it goes like that sometimes.”

Hits were hard to come by for the Sox who lost 2-1 on Saturday in front of 31121 at Globe Life Field.

Five Rangers pitchers limited the Sox to just three hits — a Luis Robert single in the first a Yasmani Grandal home run in the sixth and a Romy González single in the seventh.

“We hit the ball a few times hard” said Cairo who subbed while Tony La Russa served a one-game suspension tied to Mike Wright Jr. throwing at Los Angeles Angels designated hitter Shohei Ohtani on Thursday.

“We didn’t get lucky. We played hard. They just pitched a little better and they got the hit in the right moment and we didn’t capitalize a few times with men on base.”

Rangers right fielder Adolis Garcia left makes a leaping catch on a flyout from the White Sox’s Yoan Moncada during the seventh inning Saturday in Arlington Texas.

The Sox magic number for clinching the American League Central remained at five with the loss and the Cleveland Indians’ 11-3 victory against the New York Yankees.

“We haven’t clinched yet so everyone knows there’s a lot at stake here” Sox starter Lance Lynn said. “We’ve got to play good baseball down the stretch. We’re in a good comfortable lead (in the division) but it would be nice to clinch here soon so we can line things up the way we need to at the end.

“We still have some time to be able to do all that and I like where we’re at.”

Lynn (10-5) was the tough-luck losing pitcher allowing two runs (one earned) on six hits with five strikeouts and two walks in 5? innings.

“He’s a horse” Cairo said. “He was (at) 70 pitches when he came out for the sixth and of course I’m going to let him pitch. I’m glad he’s coming back to be full strength (from right knee inflammation). It was nice to see him pitch really good.”

Lynn said he felt “good” in the 83-pitch outing against his former team. He pitched for the Rangers in 2019 and 2020 before being traded to the Sox during the offseason.

“Whenever you come back to a place you’ve played its always fun” Lynn said. .

“I got up to the pitch count mark and then we’re on our way to the next one so we’re in a good spot heading down the stretch.”

He’ll continue to work on his sinker.

“The command wasn’t where I wanted it to” Lynn said. “I gave up some groundball hits that just got through. But we were able to induce some double plays and some groundball outs too. It’s finding that mix each pitch each quadrant what you want to do and being able to physically get them where you need to.

“We’re in a good spot moving forward and next time I’ll be able to go more pitch-count-wise and go from there.”

Lynn almost got a double play to get out of the fourth without allowing a run but a video review showed that Jonah Heim narrowly beat Leury García’s throw to first. Andy Ibáñez scored on the play to give the Rangers a 1-0 lead.

After Grandal’s home run in the sixth tied it at 1 the Rangers went ahead in the bottom of the inning with an RBI single from pinch hitter DJ Peters against reliever Garrett Crochet.

Moncada almost provided the big hit with González on second for the Sox in the seventh but Adolis García made the game-saving catch. And Rangers second baseman Nick Solak leaped to snag Leury García’s hard liner with runners on first and second for the final out in the eighth.

“We hit balls and they caught it and tomorrow’s another day” Cairo said. “I know they are going to come ready to play.”

Join him won't you?,"Open this photo in gallery: Indigenous advocate author and broadcaster Jesse Wente on Sept. 2.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

Jesse Wente ambles across the grass of a west-end Toronto park black mask dangling from a wrist aviator shades perched on his nose: a portrait of late-summer late-COVID-era ease. About a month earlier I’d asked him to suggest a spot where we could meet to discuss his forthcoming memoir Unreconciled: Family Truth and Indigenous Resistance. It’s a slim volume that lands heavily as Wente who has always been cautious about revealing personal details in public shares sobering stories of his past and connects them to the complicated conflicted feelings he has toward both Canada and himself. I had hoped the location of his choosing and not far from his home might help him feel comfortable.

That was probably expecting too much.

Two days before we met Wente posted a raw disclosure on Facebook. “Depression and anxiety have been my most consistent companions this year” he wrote. “Anxious about my work my life and my place within the community I have worked so hard to be a part of and to serve.” He thanked those who had buoyed him along the way and added: “I finally feel like I’m finding myself again even if my self isn’t exactly the same as it was.”

And so as he settles onto a park bench next to the pool area he acknowledges that even this encounter is flecked with anxiety. “It makes me a little nervous to show so much” he says. Still he’s been in the arts long enough – 11 years as a programmer with the Toronto International Film Festival two decades as a film columnist on CBC Radio newly minted film producer chair of the Canada Council of the Arts and executive director of the Indigenous Screen Office – that he understands the die is now cast. “I’ve been around artists and storytellers long enough to understand that you tell a story but once it’s out in the world it’s sort of not yours anymore. Or it’s still yours but other people will make it their own.”

He says this breezily but there’s an unspoken tension there: People have been projecting their interpretations of Wente onto him since he was a child.

Unreconciled is an attempt to unpack that beginning with the knotty branches of his family tree. His mother’s mother Norma was born in Serpent River First Nation an Ojibwe reserve on the north shore of Lake Huron. She was sent to a nearby residential school where she was cut off from her family and traditions and barred from speaking Ojibwe. At 16 she returned home but no longer felt comfortable there. She moved to Toronto married an army veteran 20 years her senior took a job as a domestic – the only sort of work for which the residential school had prepared her – and later as a hostess at the Albany Club the venerable private club whose founders included Sir John A. Macdonald.

Wente’s father’s side were of stock that patronized those sorts of private clubs: His father Jim moved with his mother and two sisters from Chicago to Toronto in the mid-60s and grew up amid privilege that included a membership in the Royal Canadian Yacht Club. He met Norma’s daughter Connie at Toronto’s Malvern Collegiate; they were free spirits and they married shortly after high school.

Wente his parents and his younger sister Maggie would visit Serpent River a few times a year; though he felt a connection up there to his roots he also felt somewhat alienated. And privilege is insistent: with financial support from his paternal grandparents he attended Crescent School located a brief limo ride from Toronto’s tony Bridle Path neighbourhood where his high school classmates were sons of Canada’s ruling classes. (He learned from them how to adopt a pose of entitlement which would come in handy decades later when he would stride into boardrooms and make demands on behalf of his community.) In time though he began to feel alienated from his fellow students “othered” by them – and not just when in September 1990 as the Oka Crisis lurched into its final month one of them quipped: “Go back to Oka.” (Never mind as Wente points out in the book that he is Ojibwe and the Oka blockade involved Mohawks.)

Even as he resolved to explore his Indigenous identity to understand what it meant to him the outside world would impose its own interpretations of that identity upon him. As a young man he was stopped repeatedly on the streets of Toronto by police gawked at by tourists followed with suspicion in stores. He cut his hair in hopes of gaining some space for himself. “I was sick of being treated as either a threat or a mythological creature with little room in between to just be myself” he writes.

As an Indigenous student attending the University of Toronto he was eligible for federal funding. But he struggled with whether he deserved it. He worried that those in Serpent River “might object on the grounds that I lived in the city that I hadn’t grown up on the rez or faced the conditions and challenges that too often come with life in a First Nations community.”

I tell Wente that the passage reads to me at least as if he is suggesting that to be Indigenous in Canada is to struggle to be downtrodden and that his privileged upbringing somehow made him less Indigenous.

“It’s interesting. I had not thought of it that way” he replies and I wonder for a moment whether I’ve offended him. “I think there is truth to that. Not that that’s actually true in the real world. I think it’s true that in conception Canadians – I shouldn’t say ‘Canadians’ what I should say is ‘Canada’ – prefers its Indians downtrodden” he says. “But it was not my conception that I was less Indigenous because I was privileged it was that I might be [less so] because I didn’t grow up in my community I didn’t know my language I didn’t know my stories.”

I ask him about the implication of my question: that he might have internalized the notion of the downtrodden Indian.

“Oh absolutely I think a whole host of us have internalized all sorts of things just like folks [in Serpent River] have undoubtedly internalized things too” he says. “And you know the book and my increasing understanding of my life and the journey of it is trying to make sense trying to unpack existence colonized existence in 2021 and what that actually means and trying to divest from it as much as you can.

“All I can say is that my understanding my awareness is evolving every moment of every day and I will continue to try to unpack this stuff so that I can – it’s a loaded word – feel comfortable here. Because if there’s a feeling that I would suggest is the most familiar to me it’s discomfort.”

As Wente writes in Unreconciled one of the places where the discomfort finally became too much for him was TIFF. Growing up he had found great comfort in films despite the medium’s own deep history of racism of imposing false and damaging stereotypes onto Indigenous people (and let’s face it many others). But as the only known Indigenous film critic working in North America Wente had brought a unique and vital critical perspective. He joined TIFF as a programmer in 2006 and became the head of its year-round Cinematheque when the festival opened its Lightbox cinema complex in 2010.

In 2017 however TIFF executives asked for his perspective on a trio of films about Indigenous people that were being considered for that year’s fall festival including Hostiles a Western starring Christian Bale as an American soldier who escorts an old Cheyenne enemy (Wes Studi) back home. In a note to his bosses Wente excoriated the film calling it “deeply racist” and “exactly the sort of movie that should no longer be made.”

The film landed a prime spot in that year’s festival. Its gala screening was preceded by an Indigenous land acknowledgement that TIFF had initiated that year part of its reconciliation efforts.

Wente had crafted the wording.

It was all too much. He tendered his resignation.

“I think the point of this section [in the book] as much as the point of the CBC section [in which he discusses episodes in which he felt tokenized] or any of those parts is that they’re not alone. The takeaway for me has been it’s going to be hard for me to be in any colonial space and not be tokenized. That’s just sort of been the experience. Because I think [the institutions] have to put effort to not do it.”

Yet despite those experiences Wente retains a sort of stubborn hope that things can improve a legacy he feels might be inherited from his father whose family saw Canada as a kinder gentler alternative to the United States.

It’s a quiet day here in the park and as we talk – our one-hour appointment stretching beyond the three-hour mark – mothers arrive with their children for a swim in the pool. The joyful yelps of the kids cuts through the buzz saw of cicadas and our own conversation. Wente’s son and daughter now in their teens used to take swimming lessons here and his thoughts turn to the next generation to the possibility of reconciliation to the children of his ancestors who did not come home from their residential schools.

“I think the book sort of suggests that reconciliation is going to be really hard for this place” says Wente inserting an expletive to emphasize the point. “And I think the book also suggests reconciliation for myself has not been all that easy.

“I don’t ever want to say it’s impossible – because the first thing we should be gifting future generations is hope not despair that things are impossible. But I do wonder and I would say this is true of both situations both with myself and with Canada.

“You’re going to be hard pressed to get to reconciliation if you’re not willing to – we’re sitting by a pool – if you’re not willing to jump in the deep end. I’m not sure Canada has truly leapt in. It may be putting a toe in the pool a little bit to figure out what the water feels like.”

I suggest to him that Canada probably believes it’s in the middle of the pool and pleased with its own progress.

“I think you’re not wrong” he acknowledges. “But there are things you cannot hide from and I think Canada has extended an extraordinary effort to hide from some things – to hide them from others but primarily from itself.”

That is why this year’s revelations of the children buried on the grounds of residential schools shook the country to its core: Canada needs to first reconcile with itself learn and grapple with its own malignant history if it has any hope of reconciling with the many first nations that share the land.

We rise from the bench to stretch our legs and as Wente turns around he spots something tracing an arc in the sky. “Look at that hawk” he says a note of awe edging his voice. He is silent for a moment watching the bird swoop and rise on the wind.

“They would say that’s an omen” he says finally. “We’re taught that animals have intention. So when an animal visits you like that you should actually acknowledge it.

“What the hawk is supposed to teach you is to have perspective. Because the hawk flies very high it can see very far. So it’s reminding me that – or should remind you too actually in this moment – that there’s something that you need perspective on. But there’s another element to the teaching which is as high as the hawk flies and as far as it can see it can’t see past the horizon. So there’s limits to what you can actually know and what lays sort of beyond.”

GS,Goldman Sachs,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVld2Fsay5jb20vc3AtNTAwLWZvcmVpZ24tcmV2ZW51ZS11cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S&P 500 Foreign Revenue Increases In 2012,"Goldman Sachs is out with a new report on S&P 500 foreign revenue based on 10K filings for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012. Foreign revenue increase has helped firms boost their top line overall in 2012. The biggest winner according to the report …. energy based companies. A brief summary followed by the full report below:

S&P 500 Foreign Revenue

Uncertain growth in Asia and Europe combined with FX concerns have supported stocks with high US sales relative to firms with high international revenue exposure so far in 2013. Following two weeks of outperformance to start the year our sector neutral equal-weighted basket of 50 S&P 500 stocks with the highest concentration of international sales exposure has lagged our Domestic Sales basket by over 250 bp in 2013. Our basket of stocks with the highest BRICs exposure has lagged the Domestic Sales basket by almost 450 bp.

Consensus expectations for 2013 sales and earnings growth support the recent outperformance of domestically-exposed stocks but 2014 estimates are stronger for firms with higher international exposure. Bottom-up consensus expects the median stock in our Domestic basket will grow 2013 earnings by 9% faster than the 6% expected for the BRICs basket and in line with the International Basket. In 2014 however the International and BRICs baskets are each expected to grow median earnings by 13% compared with 9% for the Domestic Sales basket. All three baskets trade in a one P/E multiple range of each other.

Performance this year has continued a marked shift in investor preference away from foreign-facing stocks. Beginning in 2011 policy and economic risks in Europe and concern over slowing growth in China led investors to seek the relative stability and safety of domestic-facing firms. Despite stretches of outperformance by internationally-exposed stocks in 1Q 2011 and 1Q and 4Q 2012 during the past two years the Domestic basket and S&P 500 have each returned over 35% vs. 20% for the International and BRICs baskets.

Previously investors pursued faster economic growth overseas relative to domestic growth seeking faster sales and earnings growth and hence better returns in firms with a larger percentage of international sales compared with more domesticallyoriented firms. From late 2007 through 2010 the International basket returned +2% vs.

-13% for the Domestic basket and -11% for the S&P 500.

This report updates and rebalances the company constituents in four sector-neutral baskets of US stocks constructed on the basis of geographic revenue exposure:

S&P 500 Foreign Revenue Details:

1. International Sales

50 companies with high non-US sales. The median stock in the basket generates 75% of its revenue outside the US compared with 30% for the median S&P 500 company and 34% for the S&P 500 in aggregate. 9 constituents have changed. The basket has returned 16% YTD compared with 15% for the S&P 500.

2. Domestic Sales 50 companies with the highest concentration of US sales. The median stock generates 100% of its revenue inside the US. 13 constituents have changed. The basket has returned 15% YTD.

3. Western Europe Sales 50 companies with high sales exposure to Western Europe. The median stock in the basket earns 21% of its revenue in Western Europe explicitly 33% in Europe and 66% outside the US. 14 constituents have changed. The basket has returned 23% YTD.

4. BRICs Sales 50 companies with high sales to BRIC countries (Brazil Russia India and China). The median stock earns 31% of its revenue in the BRICs regions and 72% internationally. 12 constituents have changed. The basket has returned 14% YTD.

We analyzed company 10-K filings to determine the total international sales exposure of stocks in the S&P 500. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires companies to disclose any geographic segment contributing 10% or more of revenues. Our screen may miss some foreign revenues that are not divulged due to this limit. Firms have discretion over regional classifications so precision varies by company. We supplement

exposure disclosed in 10-K filings using Goldman Sachs analyst estimates.

Foreign sales accounted for 34% of aggregate revenue for the S&P 500 in 2012 up from 33% in 2011. The median stock reported 30% of sales outside the US. Companies reported that 13% of revenues came from EMEA (Europe Middle East and Africa) with 7% directly attributable to Europe. Approximately 8% of revenues stems from the Asia and Pacific region with 1% disclosed as coming specifically from Japan and 1% from China.

Despite the proximity to the US only 6% of revenues reported was from non-US Americas (Canada and Latin America). The remaining 6% of revenues was foreign but unclassifiable (see Exhibit 1).

Some Apple Card customers eager to get their hands on the latest iPhone 13 were driven to use an alternative form of payment when preorders went live on Friday due to a now resolved iPhone Upgrade Program problem.

Apple's preorder mechanism hit a snag early this morning when an Apple Card issue prevented iPhone Upgrade Program members from completing their iPhone 13 purchase.

The problem was fixed a few hours after preorders went live but not before a number of customers resorted to placing the charge on a different credit card forfeiting Apple Card's 3% Daily Cash benefit. Following complaints posted to various social media platforms it appears that Apple and Goldman Sachs are making the situation right.

AppleInsider can confirm that Apple and its banking partner will honor Apple Card's cash back incentive for customers who used a different card to bypass the iPhone Upgrade Program snafu.

One reader who contacted Goldman about the lost Daily Cash was initially told that the bank was not able to rectify the situation. In a subsequent exchange however Goldman said that any Apple Card holder who was unable to make an iPhone Upgrade Program purchase and consequently turned to a different card will be eligible to receive the 3% Daily Cash.

AppleInsider confirmed the statement with a Goldman Sachs Apple Card representative.

Those impacted by the issue will be sent an email containing details on how to obtain the benefit that can run close to $55 for iPhone Upgrade Program payments on a 1TB iPhone 13 Pro Max. While not yet confirmed Apple Card holders might have to change the credit card on file with Citizens Bank the financial institution handling loans for the iPhone Upgrade Program.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbmV3cy9jaGluYS1kZWZlbmRzLWNsYW1wZG93bi10ZWNoLWZpcm1zLTA0MjEyMTc5MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China defends clampdown on tech firms in a meeting with Wall St execs - Bloomberg News,"People walk along Nanjing Pedestrian Road a main shopping area following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Shanghai

(Reuters) - China's top securities regulator defended their crackdown on various industries in a private meeting with Wall Street executives Bloomberg News reported on Saturday.

Investors' concerns over the regulatory crackdown has led to sharp sell-offs on China's share markets reducing the market capitalisation of some of its largest companies including Alibaba Group Holding Limited.

China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai explained during the meeting that recent actions were taken to strengthen regulations for companies with consumer-facing platforms and improve data privacy and national security the report https://bloom.bg/39iLhKH said citing people familiar with the matter.

The three-hour meeting of the China-U.S. Financial Roundtable on Thursday included the head of the People's Bank of China and executives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc  Citadel and other Wall Street powerhouses Bloomberg reported.

The CSRC could not be immediately reached for a comment.

Goldman Sachs declined to comment while Citadel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Global investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology gaming and private tutoring.

Fang said the regulator's actions in the education and gaming sectors were aimed at reducing anxiety in society according to the report.

Warren Buffett had at least three chances to bail out Lehman Brothers before the investment bank collapsed in September 2008 fueling the global financial crisis. The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO rejected the first two invitations and a technology mix-up meant he didn't get the third one.

Buffett has repeatedly underscored the severity of the situation in the fall of 2008 when investors were pulling billions of dollars out of money-market funds and credit markets were frozen.

It was ""as close to a total meltdown throughout the financial system as you can imagine"" Buffett said at Berkshire's 2008 shareholder meeting. ""We really were looking into the abyss at that time.""

""I describe it as an economic Pearl Harbor"" he told Vice News in 2018 a decade after the financial crisis began.

Lehman CEO Richard Fuld first called Buffett in March 2008 to suggest Berkshire inject several billion dollars into the ailing bank the investor told CNBC in 2018.

Buffett was open to the idea and spent a night in his office scouring hundreds of pages of Lehman's latest financial reports. He jotted down every red flag he spotted and soon had a lengthy list.

""There was clearly a lot of trouble there"" Buffett told The Wall Street Journal in 2018.

""I just saw a lot of things that made me very worried about their financial condition and what would be happening to them under the circumstances that were happening on Wall Street"" the investor told CNBC.

Lehman executives tried their luck again in the weeks before the bank's collapse Reuters reported. However Buffett rejected the overture and dismissed the idea of an investment as ""unrealistic.""

Barclays' president at the time Bob Diamond called Buffett in September 2008. The British bank was looking to buy Lehman and he asked Buffett if Berkshire would insure Lehman's trades until Barclays shareholders could vote on the prospective deal.

Buffett was staying at a hotel at the time and asked Diamond to fax him the details he told CNBC. However the Barclays boss was operating out of the Federal Reserve and couldn't find a fax machine so he left Buffett a voicemail instead. The investor didn't notice and only heard it the following summer when his daughter spotted it and played it for him.

Regardless Buffett told CNBC that he couldn't have offered the sweeping guarantee that Diamond wanted.

""It would have been an unlimited exposure that wouldn't have made sense"" he said especially ""with the whole world falling apart.""

While Berkshire had the cash to swoop in and save Lehman Buffett dismissed the idea that doing so would have prevented the financial crisis. ""I really don't think the world would have changed"" he said.

While Buffett said no to Lehman he noted in his 2010 shareholder letter that Berkshire deployed about $16 billion in the 25 days after the bank filed for bankruptcy on September 15 2008. For example it made vital investments in Goldman Sachs General Electric and other struggling businesses."

The Halliburton Company will collaborate with Energean on three to five well drilling and completions in the Karish North natural gas field located near Israel's disputed maritime border with Lebanon. The gas field is expected to contain about 1.14 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas reserves according to Energean.

""We are excited to build on our strong relationship with Energean and honored to once again be selected to deliver integrated project management services that maximize the value of their offshore Mediterranean wells” said Ahmed Kenawi senior vice president of Europe Eurasia and Sub-Saharan Africa Region at Halliburton. “This campaign will deliver a fully integrated solution using our Halliburton 4.0 digital platform and drilling technologies to optimize well delivery.”

Israel and Lebanon began US-mediated negotiations concerning their maritime border last year although talks hit a bump earlier this year when Lebanon increased its demands with a line extending much further south then their original claims increasing the disputed area from 860 sq.km. to 2300 sq.km which would include at least part of the Karish North field. The proposed Israel-Lebanon maritime border. (credit: Courtesy)

Israel has rejected the extended claims made by Lebanon although Energy Minister Karin Elharrar stated in June that “despite Israel’s strong legal case we are willing to consider creative solutions to bring the matter to a close.”

Israel has become an energy powerhouse in the region in recent years after a number of natural gas fields were discovered in Israeli territorial waters. Israel exports natural gas to both Jordan and Egypt.

In response to the announcement by Halliburton Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati stated on Saturday that ""there is no complacency in this matter nor is there a waiver of Lebanese rights and the United Nations must play its role in deterring Israel and forcing it to stop its repeated violations of Lebanese rights and Lebanon's sovereignty"" according to Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA).

Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri called on Lebanon's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take ""urgent and immediate action in the direction of the UN Security Council (UNSC) and the international community to verify the possibility of a new Israeli attack on Lebanese sovereignty and rights.""

Berri added ""the Israeli entity's undertaking commissions and concluding offshore exploration contracts for Halliburton or other companies in the disputed area at sea represents a violation or even a blow to the framework agreement sponsored by the United States of America and the United Nations.""

The House Speaker also questioned the failure of Total Novatek and Eni companies to begin drilling in Block No. 9 of Lebanese waters of which a small part lies in waters disputed by Israel saying the drilling was supposed to begin months ago.

Amal Mudallali Lebanon's representative to the UN submitted a letter to both UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Ireland's delegate to the UN Geraldine Byrne Nason on the matter calling on the UNSC to ""ensure that the drilling evaluation works are not located in a disputed area between Lebanon and Israel in order to avoid any attack on Lebanon's rights and sovereignty.""

The letter also called to ""prevent any future drilling in the disputed areas and to avoid steps that may pose a threat to international peace and security.""

The Israeli Energy Ministry responded that ""Israel is not drilling in the area in dispute. The drilling that has been taking place for several years is happening under license for Karish and Karish North and they are not at all in the area under dispute.""

Lebanon’s representative to the United Nations Ambassador Amal Mudallali submitted a letter of complaint to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres and the President of the Security Council Geraldine Byrne Nason.

In that letter Lebanon demanded that the Security Council ensures that the Israeli drilling process isn’t located in the disputed area in order to avoid any attack on the rights and sovereignty of Lebanon.

It also called to prevent any future drilling in the disputed area to avoid steps that might pose a threat to international peace and security.

Karish is a natural gas field located 100 km from the Israeli coast about 75 km off the coast of Haifa and that was discovered in July 2013.

Proven gas reserves in the field are estimated at 1.3 trillion cubic feet. Capacitors estimated at the field reach 12.7 million barrels according to Israeli partners in the exploration project and Avner Gas and Oil.

Back in June 2021 Israel challenged Lebanon by announcing the signing of gas exploration agreements in the disputed region unilaterally.

In a few days I’m starting a 10-day trip around Nova Scotia with my family and our first stop is naturally Halifax.

We fly into Halifax before driving to Peggy’s Cove a quick trip through the Northumberland Shore and Eastern Shore and then on to Cape Breton before we head back to Halifax for a few days at the end of the trip.

Halifax is the east coast’s largest city and it’s always felt like the big city to me since I grew up in New Brunswick. I haven’t been there in a number of years now so I’ve been planning to see as much as possible and I’ve got a pretty big list of highlights so far.

There are a lot of things I love about Halifax–from the food and the sea air to the people and views–it’s distinctly got those Nova Scotian vibes. If you’re thinking about visiting Halifax sometime soon since it’s a perfect time to discover Canada and our own backyards I thought I’d share some of the places I’m planning to visit.

First off if you’re looking for a really complete guide to planning a trip to Halifax Discoverhalifaxns.com is a great resource. The site has details on packages attractions food entertainment and events and I’ve been referring to it constantly for information.

The official Nova Scotia tourism site also has a lot of ideas for Halifax.

Booking hotels there were a lot of places to pick from. We considered The Lord Nelson hotel Hampton Inn The Sutton Place and the Prince George but we picked The Halliburton because it’s such a unique place. The hotel took three heritage townhouses and combined them to create 29 rooms and suites including the remarkable-looking Grand Suite.

And beyond the guest rooms The Halliburton also has a very well-reviewed restaurant Stories. Their menu sounds delicious including Faroe Islands salmon duck magret and a list of desserts I can’t wait to try.

Halifax has a lot of character and I love that the city blends modern details with century-old homes and landmarks like The Halliburton.

Looking at restaurants I’ve got a long list of gastro and brew pubs and great places serving amazing food. I won’t list them all but I’m hoping to stop at Tidehouse Brewing Company Agricola Street Brasserie Little Oak Bar The Bicycle Thief and Durty Nelly’s Irish Pub. I could probably spend a week in Halifax and barely make it to all the great restaurants and pubs in the area including Dartmouth.

And aside from how much I’m looking forward to wandering the city harbour and parks there’s a lot to do around the city. The Halifax Citadel was built in 1749 and it’s one of the most instantly recognizable places in the city.

Since 1857 the Citadel sets of the “noon gun” thanks to the 3rd Brigade Royal Artillery and there are guided and ghost tours to get into the history of the iconic site.

Speaking of spirits there are a few opportunities to try local ones of the liquid variety depending on when you’re visiting. Compass Distillers ages three types in the Citadel and during the summer you can visit the barrel room and enjoy a tasting with the Citadel Distilled — Raise Your Spirits experience.

There’s a lot of history in Halifax as one of the cities that was first built up over 270 years ago. The Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 offers a glimpse into what it was like for so many people who first came to the country while the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic looks at the history in the area from the sinking of the Titanic to shipbuilding and the devastating 1917 Halifax explosion.

My family and I are really looking forward to exploring around Pier 21 too along the Halifax Waterfront Boardwalk where there are a lot of shops restaurants and tours you can book.

Since I’m a big fan I’m also hoping to get back and take the Alexander Keith’s Brewery Tour again. The tour offers a look behind-the-scenes with history stories songs and of course a tasting.

There’s also The Discovery Centre the Halifax Museum of Natural History and I’ll be taking a walk down to the Point Pleasant Park and around the Halifax Seaport Farmers’ Market.

Watch for my #VisitNovaScotia posts on Twitter Instagram and Facebook. During the trip I’ll be sharing photos and videos and blog posts with more stories over the coming weeks after the trip.

By Grace Merritt UConn Foundation

Alumni couple Michael and Shari Cantor have two passions: UConn and Greater Hartford.

So when they decided recently to make a gift to UConn they knew they wanted to have a real impact on Greater Hartford by promoting economic development and entrepreneurship there.

Enter Build Hartford a new course that will help UConn students develop entrepreneurial skills and work for a Hartford area start-up they are interested in. Thanks to the Cantors’ gift the course will premiere this spring as part of UConn’s Werth Institute.

“I care deeply about keeping young people that graduate from our universities here in the state” says Michael ’80 (ENG) ’83 JD. “A key way to do that is to have a vibrant start-up community where they all want to work.”

Students will get to work with mentors and the team at the Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation to solve real problems faced by Hartford-area start-ups. As a result these transformative experiences will help educate connect and inspire them to be future leaders and change makers.

“It creates a framework for helping to build the entrepreneurial community of Hartford helping support the talent needs of startups in Hartford” says David Noble managing director of the Werth Institute.

Build Hartford is designed to give more students regardless of their major a taste of entrepreneurship.

“We are always looking for opportunities to expose all different types of students to the entrepreneurial skill set and mind set to be able to accelerate their growth and career trajectories in whatever pathways they choose to pursue” says Tara Watrous the Werth Institute’s head of entrepreneurial transformation.

Shari ’81 (BUS) a UConn trustee and mayor of West Hartford said they wanted to create a program with long-term impact.

“One of the things we want to do is give to something that builds” she says. “We want to really start something. We think this is an initial gift and project that can take off and have a lasting impact.”

In addition to Build Hartford the Cantors’ gift will also support scholarships Hillel human rights and the Students First Fund which provides financial support to students dealing with unanticipated hardships.

“I chair the Student Life Committee on the Board of Trustees and we are also the parents of two UConn graduates” Shari says. “The student experience is something I think about all the time.”

“I know the value of the Students First Fund especially in the last year and a half with the challenges of COVID and so much uncertainty” she says. “Many families are balancing so much and unpredictable expenses can put tremendous stress on them. The Students First Fund is a lifeline that can truly keep a student on track to graduate.”

Both Cantors’ enthusiastic support of UConn also extends to their volunteer work. Besides serving as a trustee Shari a CPA served as president of Hillel and is a member of the UConn School of Business’s Hall of Fame.

Michael serves on the advisory boards for the School of Engineering and the School of Law. He is also on the committee planning the law school’s centennial and was inducted into the engineering school’s hall of fame. Michael is a co-managing partner at Cantor Colburn an intellectual property law firm and has taught at the School of Law for more than 20 years as an adjunct professor. In addition he serves as chairman of the board of Connecticut Innovations the state’s quasi-public venture capital firm.

Besides their volunteer work the Cantors are huge UConn basketball fans and can often be seen in the stands rooting for the Huskies.

“We really do bleed blue” Michael says.

Now a year and a half into the pandemic with few conventions and even less business travel the city is hoping to just hold onto the guest rooms it already has.

“Hotels around the country have been hit hard by the pandemic but the hotels that have been hit the hardest are the ones that rely to a large extent on business travel on conventions and large-scale sporting and entertainment events which is true of Hartford’s hotels” Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said. “Our hotels have been hit especially hard.”

A shake-up in the city’s hospitality industry has been shaping up for months. Most recently the owner of one of downtown’s largest hotels the 392-room Hilton Hartford on Trumbull Street next to the XL Center is exploring other options including converting part of the aging hotel into housing after an unsuccessful effort to sell last year.

Hotels in cities like Hartford — especially large ones like Hilton and the 409-room Marriott Hartford Downtown near the city’s $267 million state taxpayer-backed convention center — are a critical cog in the economic development ecosystem of both the city and the surrounding region. They bring in visitors whose spending ripples through restaurant shops and other businesses.

The hotels also give the city an added edge in attracting conventions and high-profile tournaments such as the first round of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in 2019 when guest rooms are nearby and convenient.

The Marriott Hartford Downtown at left stands adjacent to the Connecticut Convention Center on Columbus Boulevard in downtown Hartford. The Marriott has struggled in the pandemic with few conventions but is newer and in a better competitive position than the Hilton. Both hotels are owned by the Waterford Group.

But hotels — especially larger ones — depend on group bookings from conventions and large-scale events which industry experts say may not recover until late 2023 at the earliest. Business travel another mainstay may never get back to where it was in 2019 as technology has drastically cut back the need to meet face-to-face.

Hospitality troubles

The woes at the Hilton follow on the closure last year of the Homewood Suites on Asylum Street and conversion to the Bond Residences. The new owners of the former Red Lion Hotel on Morgan Street near Dunkin’ Donuts Park plan to convert the entire building into rentals the apartments on the already converted upper floors now 70% leased.

Hospitality troubles are not limited to Hartford. The Red Lion Hotel in Cromwell closed just before the onset of the pandemic and it’s not clear if it will reopen. The Hartford Marriott Farmington closed in May was sold and plans are for converting it to apartments.

It is not a stretch that a portion of the Hilton might be converted to housing because across the country apartment development is one of the strongest commercial real estate sectors alongside warehouse development. Since 2013 apartment development has been a major force in revitalizing Hartford especially in the downtown area and is likely to lead the way out of the pandemic.

Len Wolman chairman and chief executive of The Waterford Group which owns and manages the Hilton and Marriott in downtown Hartford said the pandemic created conditions Wolman has not seen in 40 years in the business.

“There’s never been a time like this when we’ve had no control and we’ve had to take it day-by-day” Wolman said. “It’s been tough sledding. But even in the depths of it we’ve kept these properties open and kept them operating.”

An unpredictable future

Wolman and others said the onset of widespread coronavirus vaccinations this spring brought a new level of comfort to the public giving an encouraging boost to leisure travel this summer. Coupled with that major employers were looking to a return to the office in the fall by employees working at home.

But a more upbeat outlook was relatively short-lived they said. The aggressive COVID-19 delta variant and increasing reports of breakthrough infections by those who had been vaccinated reined in travel and corporate plans for return to the workplace.

The Marriott Hartford Downtown at center stands adjacent to the Connecticut Convention Center at right in downtown Hartford. The convention center has had few bookings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The challenge for what we are seeing now is there’s not a predictability that there was a year ago as we were seeing the vaccines developed” Ginny Kozlowski executive director of the Connecticut Lodging Association said. “We saw a pathway then and now it’s not so clear what that pathway is.”

The hole to climb out of is deep. Occupancy in downtown Hartford hotels for the first seven months of this year was 30.1% compared with the 68.4% for the same period in 2019 according to STR the global hospitality data and analytics company. The analysis is based on the 06103 ZIP code that takes in much of downtown.

The picture however is brighter for the city as a whole. STR reports that for the first seven months of this year occupancy is 50.3% compared with 62.1% for the same time frame in 2019.

State economic development officials say they are keeping an eye on the hospitality industry’s recovery in Hartford and throughout the rest of the state. The state budget for the fiscal year 2022 included $30 million in federal Rescue Plan Act funding for the industry.

The Goodwin Hotel a boutique hotel in downtown Hartford and other smaller independent hotels may play a bigger role as the city comes out of the pandemic.

“DECD is currently monitoring the hospitality industry’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic over the summer and fall of 2021 and will be designing a program to respond to the needs of this industry in early 2022” DECD spokesman James Watson said in an email.

A bigger role for smaller hotels

Smaller hotels — even the 124-room Goodwin Hotel a boutique hotel in the heart of downtown Hartford — appear to be faring better this summer than their larger counterparts. That’s largely because they do not depend heavily on booking large convention groups though they do often get “spillover” bookings as a result of those events.

Randy Salvatore founder and chief executive of Stamford-based RMS Cos. which partnered in the renovation and reopening of The Goodwin in 2017 said in the aftermath of the pandemic smaller boutique hotels may have a larger role to play especially if business travel does not return to levels of 2019.

So even if some rooms were lost at the Hilton there would be the need for fewer hotel rooms in the years ahead said Salvatore who also is developing around Dunkin’ Donuts Park.

The Goodwin Hotel in downtown Hartford reopened in 2017 following renovations. The hotel had been closed for nearly a decade. The hotel’s distinctive terracotta facade was saved from an earlier building that once stood on the property.

“That’s probably the reality not only in Hartford but in markets across the country” Salvatore said.

While it is largely speculation how the convention business will eventually shake out the events could be smaller with some participants attending virtually. Still the need for networking and the social side of conventions isn’t likely to go way.

And this past weekend the annual ConnectiCon convention drew 24000 to the city’s convention center.

There also could be new convention themes like team building that bring together workers who do their jobs remotely and never see each other except on a screen.

Fred Carstensen director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis at UConn said he sees a fundamental shift in the hotel industry from large hotels to boutiques like The Goodwin and a heavier emphasis on leisure travel.

The annual ConnectiCon drew 24000 to the Connecticut Convention Center this past weekend. City hotels benefitted from the event but conventions remain sparse because of the pandemic. The photo is from the 2019 event at the convention center.

“There will be an effort to move in that direction” Carstensen said. “Small boutiques that offer a lot of amenities. But I think we’re going to see a lot of experimentation of trying to find ways of attracting a new clientele.”

Larger hotels still critical

Prior to the pandemic the hotels that were being considered in Hartford — on Lewis Street in a portion of 55 Elm St. along with apartments and on the vacant lot at the southeastern corner of Constitution Plaza — were all boutiques.

“The boutique hotels are a different breed but they are having more success than the corporate hotels” Michael W. Freimuth executive director of the Capital Region Development Authority said.

Freimuth said the problem is figuring out how they might fit into primary bookings for conventions and other large events. Generally when conventioneers book they are looking for hotels with a brand name so they know what they can expect in their lodgings Freimuth said.

Seen from above Pulaski Circle the building at 55 Elm Street (left foreground) was supposed be converted to a mix of apartments and hotel rooms prior to the pandemic. Now the plans call for all apartments with the option to convert some of the rentals to hotel rooms in the future.

Both Bronin the Hartford mayor and Freimuth say they expect large hotels like the Marriott and the Hilton to play key roles in the future even if there are changes at the Hilton.

“Looking long term I do believe that you are going to see a resurgence of convention activity business travel as well as increasing event-related business” Bronin said. “We need to do our best to sustain what we have and keep our eye on the ball long term to ensure there is enough hotel capacity.”

Alright while I can joke and call them “scary” there’s something I do really love about the toys we’re featuring today. They look retro as if they could’ve been found in a toy store back in eighties but instead were found on Instagram in the year 2021.





Check out today’s video below.

Just to reiterate and if it isn’t obvious these figures are no way endorsed by Sony Pictures Ghost Corps Hasbro or anyone connected to the Ghostbusters franchise. Once again 100% bootlegs!

As mentioned in the video the figures come in at an impressive 9″ in height towering above the majority of recent official offerings. They also come complete with removable Proton Packs PKE Meters Ghost Traps and an odour that smells like a raging tire fire. To say I’m conflicted would be pretty accurate.

If you’re looking for something much more higher qualiy and official be sure to check out our recent unboxing showcasing Hasbro’s Real Ghostbusters Kenner Classics Ecto-1 Fearsome Flush and Bug-Eye Ghost.

Sue G. Atkinson

Sue G. Atkinson passed away on Sept. 13 2021 at the age of 80 after a courageous battle with injuries suffered as a result of a car accident in 2012. She endured numerous surgeries rehabilitations and recoveries with the utmost grace and stoicism. Her family will forever be grateful for her love wisdom and quiet strength.

A memorial service for Sue will be held on Thursday Sept. 23 2021 at 1:30 p.m. at St. George's Episcopal Church at 4715 Harding Pike in Belle Meade. A visitation with family will begin at noon at the church.

Sue was born in 1940 in Meridian Mississippi to George R. Golden and Mary Sue E. Golden. Her family later moved to Memphis Tennessee where her father was the first interior designer for Elvis at Graceland.

Her love for Nashville began in the late 1950s when she enrolled in Vanderbilt University where she was known to her friends as ""Sue Rae."" Following graduation she taught Latin and math at John Overton High School. She then joined the development team at Channel 8 now Nashville Public Television where she was instrumental in the growth of the ""Action Auction.""

She discovered her passion for public relations in the late 1970s and over the following three decades became well-known as one of Nashville's pioneering public relations professionals. Her career was filled with visible successes accomplishments and national recognition for her work — but she was equally valued for her behind-the-scenes confidential counsel that often had a more long-lasting positive impact on businesses than public campaigns.

Sue first joined Holder Kennedy where she rose to become the firm's president and worked with the likes of Nissan First American and some of Nashville's biggest companies and top executives.

In 1986 she founded Atkinson Public Relations. In addition to Nissan and First American her clients included the original owners of the Nashville Predators HCA Healthcare and its subsidiary TriStar Health and other companies too numerous to mention. Late in her career Sue helped launch Pinnacle Financial Partners and took immense pride in watching the company grow as a board member.

In 1987 Sue married her soulmate Marvin T. Runyon. There a no words to describe how much two people were destined to be together and in love. Alone they were amazing people. Together they were a force for so much good. Sue's love for Marvin continued every day since he passed in 2004.

Sue will always be remembered for her love of Christmas. She and Marvin always had a 20-foot Christmas tree that she decorated herself. Their Christmas party every year on December 23 was one of Nashville's most memorable parties.

Outside of her busy professional career Sue was very active in the Nashville business and nonprofit community volunteering for dozens of organizations serving on boards committees and chairing events. She was also a member of St. George's Episcopal Church where she took great joy being a member of the ""Loose Canons.""

Sue is survived by her son Brannan Atkinson; daughter-in-law Amy A. Atkinson; and her brother Tom Golden.

Sue was preceded in death by her father her mother and her late husband.

In lieu of flowers Sue's family asks that you make donations to the Nashville Humane Association P.E.N.C.I.L. Foundation or St. George's Episcopal Church.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc29jaWV0eS8yMDIxL3NlcC8xOC9wcml2YXRlLWhvc3BpdGFscy1wcm9maXQtZnJvbS1uaHMtd2FpdGluZy1saXN0cy1hcy1wZW9wbGUtd2l0aG91dC1pbnN1cmFuY2UtcGF5LW91dNIBgwFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc29jaWV0eS8yMDIxL3NlcC8xOC9wcml2YXRlLWhvc3BpdGFscy1wcm9maXQtZnJvbS1uaHMtd2FpdGluZy1saXN0cy1hcy1wZW9wbGUtd2l0aG91dC1pbnN1cmFuY2UtcGF5LW91dA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Private hospitals profit from NHS waiting lists as people without insurance pay out,"When Fabien needed to have a decayed tooth removed in May his dentist told him that he would have to wait up to three years to have it done on the NHS. In disbelief the 27-year-old from Edinburgh rang 50 dental practices but without any luck. He had no choice but to go private. Having lost his job during the pandemic he was on universal credit and had to borrow the £600 from his family.

Fabien is one of a growing number of people without health insurance who are paying for medical treatments out of their own pocket. NHS hospital waiting lists in England have reached record levels hitting 5.6 million this summer as doctors struggle to clear a growing backlog caused by Covid-19. People on modest incomes and even those claiming benefits are turning to private providers for knee or hip replacements cataract removal or even expensive cancer treatment.

This week a survey of 4000 adults commissioned by charity Engage Britain showed more than a fifth had gone private because they could not get the treatment they needed. While support for the NHS remains high a quarter said the wait for treatment for themselves or a loved one had had a serious impact on their mental health.

Roughly 13% of the UK population has some kind of health insurance mostly through their employers. The rest are faced with a stark choice – wait months and even years for badly needed treatment or dig into savings to jump the queue.

“The pandemic will have a long-lasting impact on the self-pay market” says Vernon Baxter managing director of the magazine HealthInvestor UK. “With the NHS under pressure for the foreseeable future the concept of paying out of pocket to expedite treatment will be increasingly commonplace – for those who can afford it.”

Health data firm LaingBuisson has put the value of the annual self-pay market at £1.1bn including cosmetic surgery and says it has grown by 7.1% between 2010 and 2019. That year private hospital groups derived just over 20% of their revenues from self-paying patients. With private hospitals closed to non-NHS patients during the pandemic the statistics were not collected last year but there is every indication they will have jumped dramatically this year.

Last week Spire Healthcare revealed a 47% surge in half-year revenues from self-paying patients to a record £130m which lifted its overall revenues nearly 40% from pre-pandemic levels to £558m.

The second largest private hospital group in the UK with 39 hospitals and eight clinics Spire says the majority of self-paying patients are aged 35 or over and most have a combined household income of more than £50000. As Justin Ash the chief executive says: “It’s by no means the super well-off.” David Hare the chief executive of Independent Healthcare Providers Network the industry body says many people have built up savings over the past 18 months having been unable to travel or dine out and “some want to spend that money to get back full mobility” by having knee or hip surgery. “People are paying for oncology treatment as well” he says.

A similar picture is emerging at Spire’s rivals. The UK arm of US-listed HCA Healthcare which dominates the London market has seen a 25% increase in self-pay hip and knee replacements and other orthopaedic procedures a 20% increase in cardiothoracic ops such as aortic valve replacement and repair and a 30% rise in neuroscience treatments such as injections into joints to treat back head neck shoulder groin or leg pain. People are coming to HCA’s six London hospitals from farther afield than usual particularly from the south and southwest of England where it has recorded between 25% and 35% more self-paying patients.

Britain’s biggest private hospital chain BMI Healthcare declined a request to share numbers for its own hospitals. It is part of the Circle BMI group which now runs 53 hospitals in the UK and is owned by Centene Corporation a publicly listed US healthcare giant.

Company filings show that at BMI the highest-paid director thought to be Karen Prins the chief executive was paid nearly £1.6m for the year to 31 March 2020. The firm did not pay a dividend but the previous year it paid £1.1bn to its then parent GHG.

Baxter says the private health sector in the UK is “really at a fork in the road”. Operators are deciding whether to position themselves as a partner to the NHS or as a competitor.

David Rowland director of the thinktank Centre for Health and the Public Interest says: “There is a big risk that unless government provides adequate funding for the NHS more and more people will be forced to pay privately which in turn will undermine middle-class support for a tax-funded NHS.

“It’s not likely that we will end up with a US-style insurance system. But a two-tier system where the NHS is a residual service for those without the means to pay is a possibility – ultimately these are political choices.”

Rowland says private operators were already trying to “create a new type of health consumer” who pays for their own treatment before the pandemic through TV and social media campaigns. They have sought to make self-pay more attractive by offering fixed-price packages and some hospital groups such as Nuffield Health are offering zero-interest finance. They have also pushed into lucrative cancer treatments which became the biggest single earner for private hospitals in London in 2019 as the Cleveland Clinic and other US brands entered the UK.

After the pandemic public support for the NHS remains high. But the government has imposed a hike in national insurance to bring down waiting lists. With many now paying twice for care – first through their taxes and then from their own pockets – that goodwill cannot be taken for granted.

“I’m not sure if I’m angry or annoyed” says Fabien who is still in debt to his family. “I feel like it’s really unfair that I had to pay for treatment.”

What Are Reese's Called In Canada?

I recently stumbled across a candy conspiracy the likes of which have never been seen.

OK that may be a little dramatic but depending on how much you love Reese's Peanut Butter Cups it might not be dramatic enough.

I don't know how to tell you this but in Canada Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are Reese Peanut Butter Cups.

How long has Canada been getting away with this? They're supposed to be a trusted neighbor yet for untold years they've been hiding a secret.

Why Is Reese's Called Reese In Canada?

Back in the day there was a guy by the name of Harry Burnett Reese who worked as a dairy farmer for another guy by the name of Milton S. Hershey. Reese was so inspired by Mr. Hershey's success he tossed in his milk pail and started his own candy empire.

Back in 2012 Joshua Brown asked Reese's this very question and they provided the answer.

Joshua Brown Via Facebook Joshua Brown Via Facebook loading...

As you see Joshua asked his question back in October of 2012 showing the Canadian version of Reese's clearly isn't some recent development.

In the information age where there's nothing you can't learn and find out about in an instant how is this something most people don't know about?

Now let's talk about this whole ""We're Canada and our Reese come three to a pack because we're better than America"" thing.

In the U.S. we have the traditional two-cup packs and when we're feeling really crazy we can opt for the four-cup package of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.

I don't know about you but when I have decided to go big and get the four-cup pack the fourth one always seems like one too much. Sure I could always just not eat the fourth one and save it later but that's just crazy talk.

When you want a little more than the traditional two-cups but four cups are just a bit too much three cups is honestly just the right amount.

Three Reese's Peanut Butter Cups is definitely the magic number and apparently Canada has been secretly shoving that magic number in our faces for years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlwc3dpY2hzdGFyLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjE5MDQ3ODQubWljcm9zaG9wLXNlbGxpbmctYW1lcmljYW4tY2FuZHktb3BlbnMtaXBzd2ljaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Microshop' selling only American candy opens in Ipswich,"Former Amazon delivery driver Junior Ngoma believes more people in the UK looking for a sugar rush are eager for top US brands such as Hershey's chocolate.

""It is not a seasonal thing and it also not generational - younger people and older people love it.""

The venture - which sells Calypso Dr Pepper Twinkies and more - will be based at the Ipswich Microshops complex in Carr Street.

Mr Ngoma said: ""I'm initially from Essex where indoor markets are popular.

The movie is part of the ‘Welcome to the Blumhouse‘ series of four horror films that will be shown on Amazon Prime in October 2021 the others being Bingo Hell; Black as Night and Madres.

Written and directed by Axelle Carolyn (American Horror Story series; Creepshow series; The Haunting of Bly Manor series; Tales of Halloween segment ‘Grim Grinning Ghost’; Soulmate).

Executive produced by Jason Blum Jeremy Gold Marci Wiseman Lisa Bruce Sandy King and Richard J Bosner.

The Blumhouse TV-Amazon Studios co-production stars Barbara Hershey (Insidious; The Entity) Bruce Davison (We Still Say Grace; Abnormal Attraction; Itsy Bitsy; Along Came the Devil and sequel; Willard) Nicholas Alexander (Down’s Revenge) Jill Larsen Fran Bennett and Katie Amanda Keane

Plot:

When a mild stroke diminishes her ability to care for herself Judith Albright (Barbara Hershey) moves to Golden Sun Manor an assisted living facility with a sterling reputation.

But despite the best efforts of the staff and a budding friendship with fellow senior Roland (Bruce Davidson) strange occurrences and nightmarish visions convince Judith that a sinister presence is haunting the massive estate.

As residents begin to die mysteriously Judith’s frantic warnings are dismissed as fantasy. Even her devoted grandson Josh (Nicholas Alexander) thinks her fears are the result of dementia not demons.

With no one willing to believe her Judith must either escape the confines of the manor or fall victim to the evil that dwells within it.

Reviews:

” …Hershey consistently conveys endearing warmth and wise awareness to keep the movie’s momentum steady even when patient pacing hits ruts in the mud. As expectedly excellent as she is scene after scene of Hershey flinching at shadows and crying wolf to deaf ears does get redundant. Fortunately the film only runs 80 minutes which includes credits so slow spots don’t have leashes long enough to drag extraordinarily far.” Culture Crypt

“Aside from three-dimensional characters I was also impressed with the film’s sharp commentary on the way we as a society worship youth and fear getting older. That’s not a subject I can recall a staggering number of horror films tackling but given that the horror genre is a safe place for us to face our fears I think it’s something more scary flicks should tackle.” Dread Central

“The Manor has a bit of a daft story to it but Ms Hershey is superb in this. It’s silly but entertaining.” DVD Fever

“The Manor plays out like a simplified version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest with an eerily serene Ratched-like overseer and staff questioning rebel Judith’s sanity. Director Axelle Carolyn maintains a pleasingly teasing rhythm so it’s a pity that as the sprightly nursing-home gothic fun winds up it descends into Scooby Dooish over-explication.” The Guardian

“My only real issue with The Manor was that it felt too long. For the first half I was completely on board though. Also I did enjoy the ending so it won on that parameter as well […] For me this horror movie worked because it touched on some of my greatest fears […] the idea of losing your right to be yourself and being treated like a child. Barbara Hershey did a great job at portraying this!” Heaven of Horror

“Barbara Hershey is fantastic as Judith and I was rooting for her to overcome her struggles the entire time. The ending seems completely out of left field but it represents the excellent risk-taking technique of Blumhouse as its finest […] Once the reality of Judith’s hellish scenario is fully revealed it is well worth the wait.” Josh at the Movies

“The Manor is kind of a little silly but entertaining nonetheless. I mean it does make you wonder what would happen in case you lose your marbles after a certain age! I also love all the jump scares in the middle of the night that psychological thrillers are usually famous for – freaky but entertaining.” Leisure Byte

“Despite some flat cinematography and borderline goofy special effects The Manor gives us a distinctive 70-year-old woman as its protagonist and a twisty ending sure to polarize. It and Madres are both a bit half-baked but their foundations are inventive enough to distract from some sloppy construction.” The New York Times

” …an enjoyably lightweight bit of genre viewing with some fun performances by the veteran cast and is better than most of what Carolyn’s ex-husband Neil Marshall has been putting out lately. The Manor will keep you entertained and maybe give you something to think about but you probably won’t remember it by year’s end. Even if you don’t have Alzheimer’s.” Voices from the Balcony

Release:

The Manor will be available for streaming via Amazon Prime on October 8 2021.

Changes Coming In The External Storage Business IBM and Hitachi continued to see a drop in external storage sales as Dell HPE and NetApp revenue grew in the second quarter of 2021 according to research firm IDC. IDC’s quarterly worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue is one of the basic barometers showing the health of the storage business. And for the second calendar quarter of 2021 it shows the industry to be a healthy one. IDC estimated second quarter sales reached $6.93 billion up 9.7 percent over the $6.31 billion estimated for the second quarter 2020 sales. Things look even better in terms of volume where IDC estimated total OEM storage capacity rose 27.9 percent over last year to reach 22.1 exabytes for the quarter. However the IDC worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue list has its limits. The obvious limit is that it includes external storage only and does not include internal storage that companies like Dell and HPE ship with servers or PCs. Even more important the quarterly report does reflect the fact that business are changing how they purchase storage. As CRN noted in its 8 Emerging Data Storage Trends To Watch In 2021 storage decisions are more likely to be made based on what will help companies grow their business and generate profits and not where and how the data is stored. How did the individual vendors do? Click through the slideshow to not only see the IDC numbers but more news and analysis from CRN.

Dell Technologies Dell Technologies’ storage business did very well according to IDC but not so good according to Dell. IDC reported Dell’s second calendar quarter 2021 worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue reached $1.86 billion up a very respectable 10.1 percent over the second quarter of 2020 giving Dell a 26.8-percent share of the total market. However that is at odds with Dell’s own reporting. Dell for its second fiscal quarter 2022 which ended July 30 reported storage revenue of $4 billion down 1 percent year-over-year. The Dell figure however is for all storage including storage sold with its servers as well as Dell’s storage software sales. Jeff Clarke vice chairman and co-COO of the Round Rock Texas-based Dell in reporting the company’s second fiscal quarter 2021 financials said Dell has the broadest storage portfolio in the market with the highest market share in high-end midrange entry-level unstructured object all-flash and software-defined storage. He also said Dell’s midrange storage sales grew 17 percent year over year but that high-end storage sales fell due to the cyclical nature of that product segment. He also called the Dell PowerStore the company’s fastest-growing product it ever launched through its first five quarters.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE had a strong second calendar quarter 2021 in storage with IDC reporting worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue of $756.7 million up 14.7 percent over last year giving HPE a 10.9-percent market share for the quarter. Like Dell the IDC revenue estimation does not include a significant amount of storage sold with its servers and other devices. The IDC numbers don’t do HPE justice. HPE said that storage revenue for its third fiscal quarter 2021 which ended July 31 was $1.2 billion up 4 percent over the prior-year period. The company a 10-percent year-over-year growth in its software-defined storage sales including sales of its Nimble storage technology. Sales of the company’s all-flash storage arrays grew by 30-plus percent over last year led by the HPE Primera line.

NetApp NetApp which a few years ago seemed to be a diminished force in the storage industry continues its march forward from strength to strength. The company had worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue of $685 million giving it a 9.9-percent market share according to IDC. That revenue was up 11.8 percent over last year. Unlike Dell and HPE NetApp is a pure-play storage vendor and ships no servers or other devices with internal storage. The IDC numbers don’t tell the whole story. NetApp for its first fiscal quarter 2022 which ended July 30 reported total revenue of $1.46 billion up 11.9 percent year-over-year. That included product revenue of $730 million. NetApp also reported that its all-flash storage business grew 23 percent over last year. However for NetApp the future is in the cloud. The company has taken the lead among legacy storage vendors in transforming its storage technology to work in public and private clouds allowing customers to seamlessly migrate data between on-premises hybrid cloud and public cloud. That means that the total amount of data managed by NetApp technology increasingly may not be on its own hardware.

Huawei China-based Huawei is the growth leader in storage. IDC estimates Huawei saw second calendar 2021 worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue of $619.5 million which was up a whopping 26.7 percent over last year. At that growth rate it may be a matter of a few quarters before Huawei overtakes NetApp as the third-largest vendor and begin to threaten HPE for the number-two spot. IDC estimates that Huawei has an 8.9-percent market share. Indeed the only thing holding Huawei back is its lack of a U.S. market. Because of alleged ties between the company and the Chinese government the company is effectively shut out of the U.S. which is the world’s biggest storage market. Hitachi Vantara Hitachi which includes Hitachi Vantara came in at fifth place in the worldwide enterprise external OEM storage market with revenue of $338.3 million which IDC was down 4.0 percent over last year. That was enough to give the company a 4.9-percent market share. For Hitachi storage is becoming a smaller part of its business as the company continues to find solid growth in the data analytics data operations IoT and cloud markets. However Hitachi is far from giving up on storage. The company late last year introduced its first midrange all-flash storage arrays and its first storage-as-a-service offering. Much of the company’s storage is targeted at some of the more higher-value offering it brings to clients such as data analytics.

IBM According to IDC IBM’s worldwide enterprise external OEM storage sales took the biggest hit of the top seven vendors falling 36.0 percent over last year to $322.9 million and a 4.7-percent market share. IBM in its second fiscal quarter 2021 financial report didn’t break out its storage sales instead including it along with its mainframe and Power server sales although the company did say storage systems sales fell 7 percent over last year. But looking at IBM’s storage hardware sales is not the best way to understand its storage business. IBM’s storage growth is coming from its software-defined storage sales where margins are high even though revenue is lower than that of complete storage systems.

Pure Storage Pure Storage came in at No. 7 on IDC’s list of top worldwide enterprise external OEM storage sales leaders. IBM estimated Pure Storage’s revenue at $287.4 million up 12 percent over last year giving it a market share of 4.1 percent. Given Pure Storage’s growth rate and the decreasing external storage sales from Hitachi and IBM Pure Storage is likely to soon move up to the number five position. Pure Storage in August said its total revenue for its second fiscal quarter which ended Aug. 1 reached $496.8 million of which $324.9 million was product revenue and $171.9 million subscription services revenue. Pure Storage is similar to rival NetApp in two key areas. First it is a pure play storage vendor and has no server or other hardware which might include internal storage. And the company is also pushing fast into the cloud with such moves as acquiring Kubernetes storage container Portworx and making its storage technology easily consumed in a cloud or as a service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzE4L2Npc2NvLWNhbi13aW4tY2xvdWRzLWdhbWUtdGhyb25lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Cisco can win cloud's 'Game of Thrones',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://siliconangle.com/2021/09/18/cisco-can-win-clouds-game-thrones/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzE4L2Npc2NvLWNhbi13aW4tY2xvdWRzLWdhbWUtdGhyb25lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

It’s nice to see that this hotel has now officially opened on schedule for once (which is rare for new hotel openings).

Hilton’s Roku Kyoto now open

Roku Kyoto is the first Hilton LXR Hotels & Resorts properties in Asia and Hilton’s first property in Kyoto. The hotel is located in the foothills of the Takagamine Sanzan in norther Kyoto. This property is located in the 28.6 acre Shozan Resort Kyoto which is a luxury enclave home to a variety of gardens and tea houses.

Roku Kyoto features 114 guest rooms along with all the amenities you’d expect from restaurants to a spa fitness center and natural hot springs. The hotel’s signature restaurant is TENJIN which is a French restaurant.

Below are some pictures of the property to give you a sense of what to expect (previously we only had renderings so it’s always nice to see “real” pictures).

Redeeming Hilton Honors points at Roku Kyoto

Roku Kyoto has opened as of mid-September 2021. Paid rates at this hotel are steep as you’d expect. Base rooms seem to start at anywhere from $800-1200 per night depending on the season. If you do book a paid rate here I’d recommend doing so through Hilton Impresario so you can receive additional perks.

Best of all you can redeem points here at the rate of 95000 Hilton Honors points per night. This is an exceptional use of points especially if you’re going in peak season.

Hilton Honors elite members get a fifth night free on award redemptions meaning that you could pay 76000 points per night for a standard room over five nights.

Why luxury Hilton additions excite me

I’m always thrilled to see Hilton add more luxury properties especially independent ones like this. Historically one of Hilton Honors’ biggest challenges has been that its luxury footprint was limited though this is an area in which the program has been improving greatly.

There are so many great implications for this with Hilton Honors:

In other words I appreciate the valuable status that can be earned without actually being “loyal” especially when I can use those benefits at luxury properties.

Hilton’s luxury footprint continues to grow including properties like the Waldorf Astoria Los Cabos the Waldorf Astoria Maldives the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills the Waldorf Astoria Monarch Beach Zemi Beach House Oceana Santa Monica Mango House Seychelles the Conrad Abu Dhabi and more.

Mango House Seychelles

Kyoto is an amazing hotel market

Kyoto is an incredible hotel market and the number of luxury hotel options keeps growing. When you combine Japanese hospitality with luxury brands it’s a recipe for great hospitality.

Even though there are already a lot of amazing luxury properties in Kyoto I’m particularly excited about this one. Realistically the two best points hotels in Kyoto are the Ritz-Carlton and Park Hyatt:

The Ritz-Carlton is extremely well regarded but keep in mind that elite perks for Marriott Bonvoy Platinum members and above can be limited at the Ritz-Carlton brand

The Park Hyatt Kyoto is excellent as well but obviously not everyone is a Hyatt loyalist and award space can be tough to come by

So it’s awesome to see a Hilton Honors luxury property open in Kyoto.

Park Hyatt Kyoto

Bottom line

Roku Kyoto is now open and is Hilton’s first LXR property in Asia and Hilton’s first property of any brand in Kyoto. Competition in the Kyoto hotel market is fierce and it’s always hard to know how good a hotel belonging to an independent brand will be. Hopefully we get some firsthand reports of the qualify of this property soon.

At a minimum this hotel is worth being aware of and it could be a great option for anyone looking to earn and redeem points when in Kyoto.

Anyone considering a stay at Roku Kyoto once Japan reopens?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWZyb21hbG91bmdlLmNvbS9oaWx0b24taG9ub3JzLWV4dGVuZHMtc3RhdHVzLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton Honors extends status into 2022 to apply reduced qualification requirements,"Earlier this week Hilton Honors played their cards for how they look at the year 2021 for their loyalty programme members. The Hilton Honors programme will extend status all over again through 2022 as a way to keep its band of loyalty club members to itself for another year going forward.

Hilton Honors extend status into 2022

Hilton Honors have been leading from the front during the pandemic being very upfront about extensions for their members and have done so again for their 118 million Hilton Honors members worldwide. Hilton has notified the following customer-friendly moves in the past week:

Extending status into March 2023: Hilton Honors status earned in 2019 valid for 2020 was extended for 2021 and has been extended for 2022.

Hilton Honors status earned in 2019 valid for 2020 was extended for 2021 and has been extended for 2022. Rollover elite nights earned in 2021: With nights no longer required to retain your status for 2022 the nights stayed/earned in 2021 will be rolled over so that they give you a headstart into earning status for the 2023 membership year.

With nights no longer required to retain your status for 2022 the nights stayed/earned in 2021 will be rolled over so that they give you a headstart into earning status for the 2023 membership year. Reduced requirements to earn elite status in 2022 : Hilton Honors has been very flexible in getting people to earn back status with reduced requirements. For 2022 they announced requirements higher than 2021 but lower than 2019 (by 30%) which was the last membership year run regularly. In 2022 to retain elite tiers into 2023 you will need to dock as follows: Silver Tier: Seven nights Three stays or 17500 base points (as compared to Ten nights Four stays or 25000 points) Gold: Twenty-Eight nights Fourteen stays or 52500 base points (as compared to Forty nights Twenty stays or 75000 points) Diamond: Forty-Two nights Twenty-One stays or 84000 base points (as compared to Sixty nights Forty stays or 120000 points)

: Hilton Honors has been very flexible in getting people to earn back status with reduced requirements. For 2022 they announced requirements higher than 2021 but lower than 2019 (by 30%) which was the last membership year run regularly. In 2022 to retain elite tiers into 2023 you will need to dock as follows: Milestone Bonuses come quicker: For 2022 you get a 10000 points milestone bonus at 30 nights and each additional ten nights thereafter. Not just that you get a 30000 points milestone bonus at 60 nights and the ability to gift Gold status at 40 nights which can be upgraded to Diamond Status at 70 nights.

For 2022 you get a 10000 points milestone bonus at 30 nights and each additional ten nights thereafter. Not just that you get a 30000 points milestone bonus at 60 nights and the ability to gift Gold status at 40 nights which can be upgraded to Diamond Status at 70 nights. Freeze points expiration to at least December 31 2022. Hilton Honors points usually expire after 12 months of inactivity.

All of this clearly indicates what Hilton sees in their biggest market which would be the USA itself about how leisure travel would have tapered off by now and how business travel may or may not return for the rest of the year. In this case Hilton has fired the first shots and will win the loyalty of their customers who might want to not flock over to other programmes because of another free year in the programme with perks handed out to them.

This move does however put other loyalty programmes in a bit of a fix as they might now have to consider the early possibility of considering 2021 as a gone year again and hence would have to extend status all over again into 2022 membership year for their members to keep their business.

Bottomline

Hilton Honors has extended status for their members for 2022 along with a reduced requirement for them to requalify for the 2023 membership year as well. In doing this they hope to keep their flock of Hilton Honors members from leaving and pressure other programmes to decide what they would like to do.

What do you make of Hilton Honors move to retain customer loyalty for another year? Do you think other hotel chains will follow?

Now a year and a half into the pandemic with few conventions and even less business travel the city is hoping to just hold onto the guest rooms it already has.

“Hotels around the country have been hit hard by the pandemic but the hotels that have been hit the hardest are the ones that rely to a large extent on business travel on conventions and large-scale sporting and entertainment events which is true of Hartford’s hotels” Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said. “Our hotels have been hit especially hard.”

A shake-up in the city’s hospitality industry has been shaping up for months. Most recently the owner of one of downtown’s largest hotels the 392-room Hilton Hartford on Trumbull Street next to the XL Center is exploring other options including converting part of the aging hotel into housing after an unsuccessful effort to sell last year.

Hotels in cities like Hartford — especially large ones like Hilton and the 409-room Marriott Hartford Downtown near the city’s $267 million state taxpayer-backed convention center — are a critical cog in the economic development ecosystem of both the city and the surrounding region. They bring in visitors whose spending ripples through restaurant shops and other businesses.

The hotels also give the city an added edge in attracting conventions and high-profile tournaments such as the first round of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in 2019 when guest rooms are nearby and convenient.

The Marriott Hartford Downtown at left stands adjacent to the Connecticut Convention Center on Columbus Boulevard in downtown Hartford. The Marriott has struggled in the pandemic with few conventions but is newer and in a better competitive position than the Hilton. Both hotels are owned by the Waterford Group.

But hotels — especially larger ones — depend on group bookings from conventions and large-scale events which industry experts say may not recover until late 2023 at the earliest. Business travel another mainstay may never get back to where it was in 2019 as technology has drastically cut back the need to meet face-to-face.

Hospitality troubles

The woes at the Hilton follow on the closure last year of the Homewood Suites on Asylum Street and conversion to the Bond Residences. The new owners of the former Red Lion Hotel on Morgan Street near Dunkin’ Donuts Park plan to convert the entire building into rentals the apartments on the already converted upper floors now 70% leased.

Hospitality troubles are not limited to Hartford. The Red Lion Hotel in Cromwell closed just before the onset of the pandemic and it’s not clear if it will reopen. The Hartford Marriott Farmington closed in May was sold and plans are for converting it to apartments.

It is not a stretch that a portion of the Hilton might be converted to housing because across the country apartment development is one of the strongest commercial real estate sectors alongside warehouse development. Since 2013 apartment development has been a major force in revitalizing Hartford especially in the downtown area and is likely to lead the way out of the pandemic.

Len Wolman chairman and chief executive of The Waterford Group which owns and manages the Hilton and Marriott in downtown Hartford said the pandemic created conditions Wolman has not seen in 40 years in the business.

“There’s never been a time like this when we’ve had no control and we’ve had to take it day-by-day” Wolman said. “It’s been tough sledding. But even in the depths of it we’ve kept these properties open and kept them operating.”

An unpredictable future

Wolman and others said the onset of widespread coronavirus vaccinations this spring brought a new level of comfort to the public giving an encouraging boost to leisure travel this summer. Coupled with that major employers were looking to a return to the office in the fall by employees working at home.

But a more upbeat outlook was relatively short-lived they said. The aggressive COVID-19 delta variant and increasing reports of breakthrough infections by those who had been vaccinated reined in travel and corporate plans for return to the workplace.

The Marriott Hartford Downtown at center stands adjacent to the Connecticut Convention Center at right in downtown Hartford. The convention center has had few bookings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The challenge for what we are seeing now is there’s not a predictability that there was a year ago as we were seeing the vaccines developed” Ginny Kozlowski executive director of the Connecticut Lodging Association said. “We saw a pathway then and now it’s not so clear what that pathway is.”

The hole to climb out of is deep. Occupancy in downtown Hartford hotels for the first seven months of this year was 30.1% compared with the 68.4% for the same period in 2019 according to STR the global hospitality data and analytics company. The analysis is based on the 06103 ZIP code that takes in much of downtown.

The picture however is brighter for the city as a whole. STR reports that for the first seven months of this year occupancy is 50.3% compared with 62.1% for the same time frame in 2019.

State economic development officials say they are keeping an eye on the hospitality industry’s recovery in Hartford and throughout the rest of the state. The state budget for the fiscal year 2022 included $30 million in federal Rescue Plan Act funding for the industry.

The Goodwin Hotel a boutique hotel in downtown Hartford and other smaller independent hotels may play a bigger role as the city comes out of the pandemic.

“DECD is currently monitoring the hospitality industry’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic over the summer and fall of 2021 and will be designing a program to respond to the needs of this industry in early 2022” DECD spokesman James Watson said in an email.

A bigger role for smaller hotels

Smaller hotels — even the 124-room Goodwin Hotel a boutique hotel in the heart of downtown Hartford — appear to be faring better this summer than their larger counterparts. That’s largely because they do not depend heavily on booking large convention groups though they do often get “spillover” bookings as a result of those events.

Randy Salvatore founder and chief executive of Stamford-based RMS Cos. which partnered in the renovation and reopening of The Goodwin in 2017 said in the aftermath of the pandemic smaller boutique hotels may have a larger role to play especially if business travel does not return to levels of 2019.

So even if some rooms were lost at the Hilton there would be the need for fewer hotel rooms in the years ahead said Salvatore who also is developing around Dunkin’ Donuts Park.

The Goodwin Hotel in downtown Hartford reopened in 2017 following renovations. The hotel had been closed for nearly a decade. The hotel’s distinctive terracotta facade was saved from an earlier building that once stood on the property.

“That’s probably the reality not only in Hartford but in markets across the country” Salvatore said.

While it is largely speculation how the convention business will eventually shake out the events could be smaller with some participants attending virtually. Still the need for networking and the social side of conventions isn’t likely to go way.

And this past weekend the annual ConnectiCon convention drew 24000 to the city’s convention center.

There also could be new convention themes like team building that bring together workers who do their jobs remotely and never see each other except on a screen.

Fred Carstensen director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis at UConn said he sees a fundamental shift in the hotel industry from large hotels to boutiques like The Goodwin and a heavier emphasis on leisure travel.

The annual ConnectiCon drew 24000 to the Connecticut Convention Center this past weekend. City hotels benefitted from the event but conventions remain sparse because of the pandemic. The photo is from the 2019 event at the convention center.

“There will be an effort to move in that direction” Carstensen said. “Small boutiques that offer a lot of amenities. But I think we’re going to see a lot of experimentation of trying to find ways of attracting a new clientele.”

Larger hotels still critical

Prior to the pandemic the hotels that were being considered in Hartford — on Lewis Street in a portion of 55 Elm St. along with apartments and on the vacant lot at the southeastern corner of Constitution Plaza — were all boutiques.

“The boutique hotels are a different breed but they are having more success than the corporate hotels” Michael W. Freimuth executive director of the Capital Region Development Authority said.

Freimuth said the problem is figuring out how they might fit into primary bookings for conventions and other large events. Generally when conventioneers book they are looking for hotels with a brand name so they know what they can expect in their lodgings Freimuth said.

Seen from above Pulaski Circle the building at 55 Elm Street (left foreground) was supposed be converted to a mix of apartments and hotel rooms prior to the pandemic. Now the plans call for all apartments with the option to convert some of the rentals to hotel rooms in the future.

Both Bronin the Hartford mayor and Freimuth say they expect large hotels like the Marriott and the Hilton to play key roles in the future even if there are changes at the Hilton.

“Looking long term I do believe that you are going to see a resurgence of convention activity business travel as well as increasing event-related business” Bronin said. “We need to do our best to sustain what we have and keep our eye on the ball long term to ensure there is enough hotel capacity.”

Matt Schorr

Do you know anyone in Clarksville who owns a 12-foot tall skeleton?

Do you know anyone who would join multiple Facebook groups mark every calendar and stay up at midnight to be first in line when said skeleton goes up for sale online?

Well now that you’ve read this you do.

We did all those things.

We’re those people.

Home Depot’s 12-Foot Skeleton was a pretty big deal when it lumbered into the shelves last year. Each and every one that landed in stores – no doubt with a MASSIVE thud – sold within moments. Then they became viral sensations as their new owners showed off their creative skills incorporating the big guys into Halloween Thanksgiving and even Christmas decorations.

Remember Charles’ Dickens’ Christmas Carol? The giant skeleton makes a fantastic Ghost of Christmas Future.

So of course we wanted to get our spooky hands on one.

In the past I’ve waited until after Halloween to check spooky decoration inventories hoping to get them at a discount. It worked many times. Half of our yard is the result of post-Halloween-discount bananzas.

This time was different however.

The massive demand and subsequent viralism (is that the right word?) pretty much guaranteed Home Depot’s 12-Foot Skeleton was a collector’s item. In the months that followed the only place I found them was on ebay and other secondhand digital outlets and always at ridiculous markups.

“Home Depot’s going to pull a Disney with this” I told my wife in February.

“What does that mean?”

“Every month Disney releases plush Mickeys or Minnies they tout as collectors’ items only available for a limited time” I explained “and you have to sign onto their website on a certain day and time to be eligible just to buy the things.”

“You think Home Depot will do that with these?”

“Something like it yes.”

And I was right. Like really right. I mean almost down to the exact marketing strategy.

Home Depot announced a launch date for this year’s official edition of giant skeletons (a la the Disney month-specific plush toys) in the summer. Amanda discovered this through a half-dozen 12-Foot Skeleton Facebook Groups she joined.

Yes there are multiple Facebook Groups dedicated to 12-Foot Skeletons.

Like I said we’re those people.

So in the hours before Home Depot launched its Disney-esque Halloween marketing strategy Amanda accessed their website and waited. Every 15 minutes or so she refreshed the screen just in case the skeleton should drop early.

It didn’t.

And while waiting we both fell asleep. Call it the result of getting older or the natural exhaustion of corralling a 5-year-old and a 2-year-old all day.

Or both.

Either way Amanda awoke around 6 AM and refreshed the page to find the big guy ready and waiting. A few clicks later and he was ours.

Then all that was left was waiting.

Following the tracking updates.

Wondering why on earth it went to East Tennessee and Middle Georgia rather than straight here.

But then at last the blessed day arrived. Our skeleton was here. In Clarksville. At Home Depot.

We had to call my parents to help transport it but we collected our newest addition and brought him to his new home.

Yes it’s a he.

And his name is Bruce.

Welcome home Bruce.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2ZhbWlseS1zZWVrcy1hbnN3ZXJzLWluLWh1bnRpbmdvbi1wYXJrLWtpbGxpbmctb2YtMjIteWVhci1vbGQv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9rdGxhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvZmFtaWx5LXNlZWtzLWFuc3dlcnMtaW4taHVudGluZ29uLXBhcmsta2lsbGluZy1vZi0yMi15ZWFyLW9sZC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Family seeks answers in Huntington Park killing of 22-year-old,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://ktla.com/news/local-news/family-seeks-answers-in-huntingon-park-killing-of-22-year-old/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2ZhbWlseS1zZWVrcy1hbnN3ZXJzLWluLWh1bnRpbmdvbi1wYXJrLWtpbGxpbmctb2YtMjIteWVhci1vbGQv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9rdGxhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvZmFtaWx5LXNlZWtzLWFuc3dlcnMtaW4taHVudGluZ29uLXBhcmsta2lsbGluZy1vZi0yMi15ZWFyLW9sZC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1hcnlzdWUuY29tLzEyLWZ0LXRhbGwtaG9tZS1kZXBvdC1za2VsZXRvbi1zZWFzb24tYmFieS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Things We Saw Today: It's 12 Ft.

The warrant alleges that on July 8 41-year-old Melissa Gordon was observed leaving the Winn-Dixie by the store manager without paying for a cart full of groceries. The manager observed Gordon loading the groceries into a SUV. He took a photo of the vehicle and went back into the store and called the police. Officers found the SUV parked across a couple of parking places in an area of the parking lot different from where the manager had observed Gordon with the groceries.

A woman approached the officers and told them that the SUV was hers and that Gordon had asked her for a ride to the Winn-Dixie. Since she also needed to get groceries she took Gordon with her to the store. She told the officers that Gordon asked her for the keys to the vehicle so Gordon could put her groceries in the SUV while the owner finished her shopping.

The officers were unable to locate Gordon that day so the case was turned over to Leesburg police detectives. When taken into custody Tuesday her record showed multiple shoplifting convictions so the charges were upgraded to a felony.

She was booked at the Lake County Jail on $2000 bond."

According to him Covid-19 has had an unprecedented impact on airlines and their customers thereby necessitating the eagerness by the traveling public to visit new places and travel again.

He said “We expect leisure and business travel to accelerate as travel restrictions ease and vaccination rates increase.

“A lot of people are very eager to travel again to visit new places to visit family and friends to do business. We’re eager to accommodate them.”

Preez in an interview with our correspondent noted that connectivity was key in the air travel business.

“It has been tough but we never stopped being optimistic about aviation in Africa which is a crucial market for us” he said.

Reacting to the aviation industry suffering a hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic resulting in shut borders he said “We have adapted by being agile and efficient.

“Naturally we were affected by border closures but even during the worst of the pandemic we never stopped flying to at least 30 destinations.

“Qatar Airways is the largest airline to have flown consistently throughout the pandemic. We operated repatriation flights and flew PPE supplies and ramped our schedule up as soon as it was viable.

“We now operate to more than140 destinations globally. During the worst of the pandemic we constantly evaluated demand and looked for opportunities and even launched new destinations in Africa over the last nine months including most recently Harare in Zimbabwe Lusaka in Zambia Luanda in Angola and Abuja in Nigeria.

“We intend to keep expanding our routes and schedules and we constantly look for partnerships with other airlines to improve our customers’ travel experience.”

According to the Qatar boss the airline prioritises the safety security and good health of air passengers and personnel.

He said “We are fastidious about safety measures and we won’t compromise on them. We also continue to ensure that we lead the way in terms of safety and hygiene measures with new procedures implemented throughout our customers’ journey from check-in to arrival. This year we received the SkyTrax 5-Star COVID-19 Airline Safety Rating.

“In addition to that Qatar Airways was the first global carrier to operate Honeywell’s Ultraviolet Cabin System version 2.0 further advancing its hygiene measures on board.”

Disclosing the airline’s potential expansion into other African countries he said it would examine a number of factors including growth potential carrier operation on a particular route route popularity bilateral agreements with the government of a potential destination and availability of landing slots.

In mid-September 2021 multiple news outlets reported that it was possible to book a stay in Planters' 26-foot vehicle that's shaped like a giant peanut.

You’ll have to be quick because only one fan and a guest will be able to stay in the iconic 26-foot-long peanut on wheels waterfront in Duluth Minn.

In other words the company was asking fans to go to a specific website at the noted time to try book the accommodations — but only one participant would actually be able to go through with the reservation and then that winner would be able to select a guest for the experience. Further details on the competition's rules and criteria were unknown.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Britain’s White Motorcycle Concepts has completed the first trials of its upcoming WMC250EV an electric motorcycle that is being specifically designed to take on land speed records and defy industry conventions.

The bike ridden by company founder Rob White at Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground has completed its comprehensive full system pass off and from here the team will move on to its next testing phase that includes higher-speed runs.

The motorcycle seen here has a low voltage system and an electric motor capable of generating 100 kW (134 hp/135 PS). In its final trim with an 800v power system the team expects the bike to be capable of generating more than 250 kW (335 hp/340 PS).

Read Also: This Aerodynamic Electric Motorcycle Should Exceed 250 MPH

That the team reckons should be good enough to get the finished item all the way up to more than 250 mph (402 km/h). The way it plans to deliver its power though is intriguing. Rather than powering the rear wheel as is usual in motorcycles White Motorcycles Concept has opted for two-wheel drive with two electric motors at the front hub and two at the rear.

This latest round of testing however was less about the drivetrain and more focused on testing the bike’s aerodynamics. The team has opted for an ultra-low drag V-Air design concept which funnels a large duct through the middle of the bike forcing air through it.

The team estimates that this will reduce aero resistance by up to 70 percent when compared to a conventional motorcycle and much of the data collected at the initial tests was to correlate computational fluid dynamics data for the bike.

“We are delighted with the progress made so far with the WMC250EV” said White. “We were encouraged by the great reception the launch of the bike received in June and the high level of interest that the project has gained subsequently. This is a completely bespoke motorcycle so for it to run cleanly straight out of the box is fantastic.

White Motorcycle Concepts expects to be done testing next year and is planning to be ready for a British speed record attempt in early 2022 as well as a higher speed run at Bolivia‘s Salar de Uyuni salt flats next summer.

From there it plans to build road-going versions for customers which will incorporate much of the technology seen in the high-speed test bike. Further details on this will be announced in October.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lcXVpcG1lbnR3b3JsZC5jb20vZXF1aXBtZW50LWV4cGVydHMvYmxvZy8xNTI5MzM3Ni9hZ2NvLWludHJvZHVjZXMtZmVuZHQtaWRlYWwtMTAtaGlnaGVzdC1ocC1jb21iaW5lLWluLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2HSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AGCO introduces Fendt IDEAL 10 highest HP combine in North America,"AGCO Corporation has introduced the new model 10 and 10T Fendt IDEAL combines to North American producers. The IDEAL 10 and 10T deliver maximum engine power of 790 horsepower up to 20 percent more throughput capacity than previous models and harvesting automation that makes operation easier and ensures top grain quality. The combines are designed and built to efficiently harvest more grain in the toughest of harvest conditions Fendt says.

“As AGCO expands its Fendt dealer network and product line in North America we are excited to bring the IDEAL 10 and IDEAL 10T with the TrakRide system and IDEALdrive joystick steering to market for the 2021 harvest seasons” says Kevin Forth AGCO tactical marketing manager for Harvesting. “Our engineers have designed substantially more power and cleaning capacity into the IDEAL 10 without increasing the size of the combine. Add the new IDEALdrive steering and TrakRide in combination on the Model 10T combines and these Class 10 combines will deliver more bushels harvested per day and even easier operation during long days harvesting.”

Harvesting capacity of the IDEAL 10 is up to 20 percent greater than the IDEAL 9 Fendt says due to the increased horsepower of the MAN 16.2-liter engine and a 12 percent increase in separation area. Equipped with wheels or the patented TrakRide system IDEAL is available with 26- 30- or 36-in.-wide rubber tracks.

For even higher cleaning capacity and great throughput the IDEAL 10 offers a re-designed cleaning system compared to Class 8 and 9 models. Fendt says the IDEAL Balance return pans have been optimized to evenly distribute large amounts of material to the cleaning system while keeping the same simple and efficient manner of operation to minimize grain loss and increase grain sample quality.

The rotors in the dual helix processor are each 24 in. in diameter and nearly 16 ft. long almost 2 ft. longer than the nearest competitor. Fendt says the processor generates huge centrifugal force at a much lower speed so the crop remains in the rotor longer which is gentler on grain and straw. In addition operators will spend less time unloading and more time harvesting with the fastest unload rate in the industry 6.0 bu./second with the IDEAL Streamer 6.0 auger as standard equipment the company says.

Additionally AGCO headers to optimize the capacity of the new combine include the 9300 DynaFlex draper heads in 45- and now 50-ft. widths along with the 15-ft. 4300 pickup header and the Command Series 16-row corn head in chopping and non-chopping versions.

All IDEAL combines feature the automated IDEALharvest system which uses a special grain-quality camera and numerous sensors that provide real-time crop-flow visualization and direct the system to change settings and compensate for conditions to achieve the operator’s pre-set harvest strategy the company says. Preferences for minimizing grain damage loss and material other than grain in the bin are set by the operator.

Finally IDEALdrive the first joystick steering system on a combine from a major manufacturer is an option available in 2021 on the IDEAL 10T and all IDEAL TrakRide-equipped combines in North America Fendt says. Eliminating the steering wheel and column gives the operator an unobstructed end-to-end view of the combine header especially the center of the header where the crop enters the feeder house the company says.

With IDEALdrive the left hand steers the combine by moving the joystick left or right with a slight movement of the hand. Fendt says the operator achieves accurate steering with less muscle activity taking strain off wrists forearms shoulders and back during long days in the cab. The steering sensitivity adjusts based on the speed of the machine for optimum control whether the combine is harvesting or in transport mode. Controls typically found on the steering wheel or steering column are now on the joystick at the operator’s fingertips and all other left- and right-hand controls are within easy reach the company says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWljaGFlbGhhcmxleS8yMDIxLzA5LzE5LzIwMjItdG95b3RhLXR1bmRyYS01LXRoaW5ncy15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93LWFib3V0LXRoZS1hbGwtbmV3LXBpY2t1cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Toyota Tundra: 5 Things You Need To Know About The All-New Pickup,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2021/09/19/2022-toyota-tundra-5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-all-new-pickup/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWljaGFlbGhhcmxleS8yMDIxLzA5LzE5LzIwMjItdG95b3RhLXR1bmRyYS01LXRoaW5ncy15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93LWFib3V0LXRoZS1hbGwtbmV3LXBpY2t1cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtcmV2aWV3cy9ocC1zcGVjdHJlLXgzNjAtMTQtcmV2aWV3LTc1MTg1MDMv0gFhaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGVjaC1yZXZpZXdzL2hwLXNwZWN0cmUteDM2MC0xNC1yZXZpZXctNzUxODUwMy9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Spectre x360 14 review: It’s a fashion statement,"The common perception about laptops is that they need to look a certain way. This is primarily because brands like to follow a particular trend and they do everything to convince you to prove their point. I have been reviewing laptops for years and this simplistic approach has been the rage these days in the tech world.

But the simple truth is that we don’t want to come out of our comfort zone and that irritates me. So when I first saw the Spectre x360 it gave me a little hope that we are past the MacBook clone era. This 2-in-1 is a beautiful laptop designed to show off its design.

I replaced my Surface Pro with the Specter x360 14 for a week and here’s my experience with HP’s newest premium Windows notebook.

HP Spectre x360 14 review: Design and aesthetics

I was a big fan of laptops way before I started writing on tech. I use smartphones for calls/WhatsApp messages and social media but I spend most of my time on a laptop. As someone who has an affinity towards design I am automatically drawn towards notebooks that don’t look ordinary. The Spectre x360 marries fashion with tech and you get a glimpse of unique styling and integrative details. There is an element of subtle luxury in the way this notebook has been designed giving users a peek at how tech products are now designed keeping a fashionable lifestyle in mind. This is possibly the most elegant looking laptop I have reviewed in recent times; it’s a fashion notebook.

Made out of CNC-machined aluminum chassis my review unit came in Poseidon Blue colour scheme and Pale Brass accents with gem-cut edges and sharp corners. It is different no doubt about it and for some it might be too flashy. But it’s not the Poseidon Blue that’s attractive it is the impossible thin chassis. This feels like a high-end device and the build quality backs up the design.

The notebook is beautifully made. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express) The notebook is beautifully made. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express)

HP’s four-slash logo adorns the lid while two hinges allow you to use the notebook in different ways including the tent and tablet modes. I think the tent mode is great for watching videos and showing presentations to clients. There’s a satisfying resistance when you close the lid of the notebook.

This laptop is really beautiful to hold use and look at. But one thing is super weird in the notebook — a single USB 3.2 Type-A port on the left edge and two Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports on the right side and one of them is angled at the back right corner. The port is awkwardly placed somehow. It isn’t easily visible to the eyes. You will also find a headphone jack and an SD card reader. The notebook ships with a leather carrying case and HP Tilt Pen which is supposed to magnetically stick to the left edge but never really does. So there is a high chance you might lose the stylus.

HP Spectre x360 14 review: Display and audio

The display on the Spectre x360 14 is gorgeous. It’s a 13.5-inch (3000-by-2000-pixel resolution) OLED multitouch-enabled display (to be exact) and not 14-inches. Anyway its squarer 3:2 aspect (similar to Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets and laptops) gives an expansive view of text and web pages. The OLED panel is very bright and offers a good colour gamut. The display gets really bright peaking at 400 nits. Text and icons look easy on the eyes and there is joy in watching movies on the display. The screen has small bezels (the screen-to-body ratio at 90.33%) with a respectable 720p HD webcam placed above the screen. It also comes with a privacy cover; just press a Fn row key and it covers over the lens. For security the webcam has IR face recognition plus there is also a fingerprint scanner to access Windows Hello logins.

The sound quality is great but not amazing. You get four Bang & Olufsen speakers on the laptop. Although they deliver a clean sound they don’t get particularly loud. They are still better than many laptops that I have recently reviewed.

HP Spectre x360 14 review: keyboard and trackpad

I love typing on this keyboard. Its backlit island-style keyboard is quiet has more travel and there’s plenty of bounce. Generally HP’s Spectre range has the best keyboard on laptops. You will also find a huge trackpad below the keyboard. It’s large but not unnecessarily large. The trackpad is smooth and accurate.

HP Spectre x360 14 review: Performance and battery

This laptop is seriously fast. I got the top-end version featuring an 11th Generation “Tiger Lake” Core i7 -1165G7 processor with Iris Xe integrated graphics 16GB RAM and a 1TB solid-state drive. I was happy with my Surface Pro but the Spectre x360 is notably faster. I did not experience any lag while doing tasks I was supposed to do on a laptop. With these kinds of specifications you can edit videos and photos; plus do web browsing and run a handful of apps. To be clear this machine is not made for content creation or running AAA games. Most photographers or videographers would anyway not buy this notebook. That said it’s a powerful notebook and you can take it to a cafe or work from home.

I think for most people the base variant will be fine. The chassis remains the same but you get an 11th gen Core i5 processor 16GB of memory a 512GB of SSD and a 1080p IPS touch panel. That model is priced on the lower side costing Rs 119999.

The stylus comes inside the box. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express) The stylus comes inside the box. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express)

I got 7 hours of battery (on average) per charge on this notebook. That is respectable for this notebook with these specifications. HP claims the OLED version of the Spectre x360 14 has an estimated battery life of 11.5 hours while the IPS version will last up to 17 hours.

A lot also depends on the screen brightness. Of course the battery life depends on what you plan for a laptop. I am a heavy user and I typically spend my entire day in front of the screen either working web browsing or just chilling listening to music. The notebook also supports fast charging refilling the battery from 0 to 50% in approximately 45 minutes.

HP Spectre x360 14 review: Should you buy it?

I enjoyed using the HP Spectre x360 14. It is not a perfect machine but yes it is damn close to perfect. The idea of a beautifully crafted notebook that also performs well is hard to achieve. A notebook like the Spectre x360 would never come cheap and a lot has to do with how HP’s engineers designed this device. Sure there are many excellent Windows notebooks out in the market but the Spectre x360 14 gets right on many fronts."

They are the companies and institutions that often have tens of thousands of people on their payroll indirectly supporting other businesses with the cash they pay out to their many workers.

Using records and figures from various sources we’ve put together a list of the single biggest employer in each state. To keep things more interesting and diverse we’ve kept the nebulous organizations of simply “state government” and “federal government” off the list because those are actually the biggest employers in nearly every state.

If you think about it you’ll probably know someone who works for the biggest employer in your own state.

Alabama — Redstone Arsenal

You’ll notice a few U.S. military installations on this list as bases around the nation often employ tens of thousands of people at a time. One of them is Alabama’s Redstone Arsenal built in 1941 which is managed by the Army and employs a whopping 60000 people according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The base is located near Huntsville in Madison County. The next biggest employer is the University of Alabama at Birmingham also a public entity but the state’s biggest private-sector employer is the Alabama Power Company with about 5000 workers.

Alaska — Fort Wainwright

The U.S. Army comes out on top again as the biggest employer in our northernmost state. Fort Wainwright located in Fairbanks was built in 1941 and employs a reported 6100 people. When you think of Alaska you probably think of seafood — after ice and the Iditarod maybe — and that connects to the state’s second-biggest employer UniSea Inc. With 5000 employees this massive fishing operation is listed as the top private-sector company in North America’s “last frontier.”

Arizona — Banner Health

According to an exhaustive database compiled by The Arizona Republic in 2019 the hospital network run by Banner Health is easily the biggest employer in the state. Nearly 45000 people were working for the company at that time which helped it top nationwide powerhouses like Walmart Kroger and McDonald’s all of which also hire many Arizonans. The publication reported that the state’s top 100 employers account for about one in five payroll jobs in Arizona.

Arkansas — Walmart

The state of Arkansas is home to several massive companies that were first founded there as modest operations. From Tyson Foods to J.B. Hunt to Dillard’s many Americans work for companies that came out of Arkansas. But the biggest of all those homegrown success stories is Walmart. The company has nearly 48000 workers on its payroll in Arkansas making it the top private workforce there.

California — University of California

Dec 8 2019 Los Angeles / CA / USA – Walmart truck driving on the interstate after the rain; wet asphalt visible

Tech giants like Alphabet (aka Google) Apple and Facebook are big employers across California but they are far from the state’s biggest workplaces. The various branches of the University of California separately occupy 10 spots on the list of the 25 biggest employers in the state according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. When you add up all the employees of the academic giant you get more than 185000 workers across the Golden State easily surpassing Los Angeles Airport’s 45000 workers as the state’s biggest single-company total.

Colorado — Denver International Airport

Major transportation hubs are some of the biggest single-location employers in the nation and Colorado’s Denver International Airport is no different. Roughly 35000 people work at DIA according to the airport which puts it ahead of other major Colorado job creators like Lockheed Martin and HealthOne by a wide margin. The 53 square miles covered by DIA’s property makes the airport larger than the cities of San Francisco Boston and Miami.

Connecticut — Yale New Haven Health System

Hospital systems are among the biggest employers in the United States and more Connecticut residents are employed by Yale New Haven Health System than any other business. More than 22000 people work for the hospital network which paces it ahead of other major companies based there like Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. Praxair and ESPN. What’s more a 2016 Forbes report named Yale New Haven Health as the large employer (at least 5000 workers) where employees were happiest in Connecticut as well.

Delaware — ChristianaCare

The chemical giant DuPont was the largest employer in Delaware for a long time but lost that title in the past few years after downsizing. MBNA was another titan in the state that cut its numbers severely after it was bought out by Bank of America. Meanwhile ChristianaCare a hospital system picked up the slack and maintains a state-leading 12000 workers across Delaware.

Florida — Walmart

It probably won’t surprise you to read that Walt Disney World is reportedly the biggest single-site employer in the United States with more than 77000 people clocking in at the Central Florida resort every day. But it probably would surprise you to know The House of Mouse isn’t the state’s biggest employer overall. That honor belongs to Walmart which employs more than 114000 people across the Sunshine State at an average hourly wage of $15.23 which is well below the state’s overall median hourly wage of $18.07.

Georgia — Emory University

Almost 30000 people in Georgia currently work for Delta Airlines making it the biggest private-sector employer in the entire state. Meanwhile Emory University is the biggest employer overall that isn’t the state government with more than 37000 employees on its payroll across Georgia. Emory’s impact on the economy of the Atlanta region alone is remarkable between the jobs it creates and the thousands of students it houses each year.

Hawaii — The Queen’s Health Systems

As you’d likely expect the single biggest industry across Hawaii is tourism but one hospital network is its biggest job creator. The Queen’s Health Systems has more than 7300 people on its payroll which might sound like a tiny number compared to others on this list but is sizable for a state of fewer than 1.5 million citizens. All those surfing injuries aren’t going to take care of themselves are they?

Healthcare reigns supreme in yet another state. While agriculture and manufacturing have major hiring figures across Idaho St. Luke’s Health System is the state’s single biggest employer. More than 14000 people in the Gem State work for the hospital network according to the Idaho Department of Labor pacing it ahead of Walmart Micron Technology and competitor Saint Alphonsus Health System.

Illinois — Walmart

According to the Illinois Department of Employment Security the industry of healthcare and social assistance employs the most people in the state with more than 800000 people working in that sector as of 2021. Sears was the biggest single employer in Illinois for a long time but long ago lost that mantle making way for Walmart to hold the spot today. According to the retail giant more than 56000 Walmart associates are employed across Illinois making it the single biggest employer that we could find in our research.

Walmart

Indiana — Walmart

Yet another Midwestern state that is dominated by Walmart in terms of its employment figures is Indiana. More than 44000 Hoosiers call Walmart their workplace with 127 stores under the company’s umbrella being operated there as of July 2021. Other major employers include Eli Lilly and Tyson Foods but Walmart reportedly employs more people than any of them.

Iowa — Hy-Vee

It’s somewhat refreshing that Iowa’s biggest employer is a regional supermarket chain that was born in the Hawkeye State. While the University of Iowa claims itself to be the state’s biggest employer with 14000 workers our own math and research find that Hy-Vee should actually hold that title because of the sheer footprint it has across Iowa. Between its corporate headquarters two distribution centers tech office and the more than 150 stores we counted across the state we estimate that roughly 50000 Iowans work for Hy-Vee in some capacity — and that’s a conservative number.

Kansas — Fort Riley

The agriculture industry accounts for a major chunk of the Kansas economy and has the biggest workforce in the state but the U.S. Army’s base at Fort Riley employs more people than any other entity. More than 20000 people work at Fort Riley including service members and civilians. Spirit Aerosystems which is based in Wichita is the biggest private-sector employer in Kansas with 12000 workers expected to be on its payroll by 2024.

Kentucky — UPS

The commonwealth of Kentucky has a very tight race for the title of its biggest employer. While Walmart technically has about 1000 more overall employees in Kentucky than UPS its number includes workers at Sam’s Club stores which is why we’re giving the nod to the shipping giant. UPS and its 29000 workers across the Bluegrass State make up an immense workforce that includes 12000 in Louisville alone.

Louisiana — Walmart

While state government accounts for a reported 57000 jobs in Louisiana we aren’t including them so the honor of the biggest workforce there falls to Walmart. The big-box retailer counts nearly 36000 workers across Louisiana between its flagship and Sam’s Club locations. Other top jobs creators in the state include Willis-Knighton Medical Center and Mistras Group.

Maine — MaineHealth

Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and Walmart combine to employ about 16000 people across Maine but that’s still fewer than the number employed by MaineHealth. The hospital network has at least 18000 employees according to the Maine Department of Labor giving it the biggest workforce in the state. It shouldn’t surprise you when you realize that more than 700 hospitals doctor’s offices labs and assisted-living communities fall under the MaineHealth banner.

Maryland — Fort George G. Meade

While the renowned network of hospitals and institutions under the Johns Hopkins banner employs an impressive 30000 people across Maryland the military is the state’s biggest employer: specifically Fort George G. Meade which is one of the Army’s biggest bases period. Located between Baltimore and Washington Fort Meade has more than 56000 employees on base including civilians and service members.

World-renowned institutions like Harvard University and the University of Massachusetts rank among the biggest employers in the commonwealth but they can’t match its healthcare behemoth. Mass General Brigham recently took a new name in 2019 after previously being known as Partners Healthcare. More than 58000 people in Massachusetts work at Mass General Brigham which is a medical network like some other top employers on this list.

Michigan — General Motors

Automotive production still rules in Michigan — for now at least. If you combine the employees from the University of Michigan and its related Michigan Medicine healthcare banner (roughly 58000 people total) that institution would technically be the biggest employer in Michigan but that seems like cheating. Instead we’re spotlighting General Motors as having the state’s single largest workforce since nearly 47000 people work for the automaker there.

Minnesota — Mayo Clinic

The mighty Minnesota-based Target Corporation employs a reported 31000 people across the state but it’s not the biggest employer there. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester with its 28 Mayo Clinic Health System locations spread across the state is the biggest employer in Minnesota. More than 47000 people reportedly get their paycheck from Mayo Clinic making it quite a formidable workplace.

Mississippi — Ingalls Shipbuilding

An innovative powerhouse Ingalls Shipbuilding is one of the longest-standing large private employers on this list. The company had 11500 workers in Mississippi as of 2021 making it the biggest employer in the state. Ingalls has apparently held that title since 1939 which is remarkable and it looks like the grip won’t be loosening anytime soon. The company recently announced it was looking to add 3000 more employees to its payroll.

Missouri — Walmart

Companies like Boeing and Enterprise Holdings each employ tens of thousands of people across Missouri but neither can touch Walmart’s foothold there. The retail giant counts nearly 44000 residents of Missouri among its workforce making it the single biggest employer in the state. Some reports cite the medical giant BJC Healthcare as Missouri’s biggest employer but with a reported 30000 workers there that’s simply not the case.

Montana — Billings Clinic

Population-wise Montana is one of the smallest states in the nation and that’s why the 10000-plus people reportedly employed by the Billings Clinic is a massive figure there. In addition to being the state’s biggest employer it’s also Montana’s top healthcare supplier. The system also operates in Wyoming but has its biggest presence in Big Sky Country.

Nebraska — University of Nebraska

Omaha’s Offutt Air Force Base is a massive workplace that has 8000 employees but that’s only half of the staff employed by the University of Nebraska. That institution which is comprised of four universities across the state counts 16000 workers among its staff. What’s more the University of Nebraska has been ranked by Forbes as one of the best places to work in the entire state based on a survey of its workers.

Nevada — MGM Resorts

When you think of Nevada your mind has to imagine the bright lights of the Las Vegas Strip so this fact probably doesn’t stun you. MGM Resorts operates 10 properties in Las Vegas including nine casinos making it a monster in the gaming industry. The company reportedly counts 42000 workers among its staff in Nevada giving it the state’s biggest workforce. For comparison’s sake the Nevada state government “only” employs 25000 people.

New Hampshire — Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health

In a state of just over 1.3 million citizens a reported workforce of 8000 people is a sizable one. While Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health also has a major presence across Vermont its biggest footprint is in New Hampshire. The system operates a number of hospitals across the state as well as 24 smaller clinics. Its website boasts that it is the No. 1-rated hospital in New Hampshire as well as the biggest private employer there.

New Jersey — Amazon

For a long time the grocery giant ShopRite was the biggest employer in the Garden State but it recently lost that mantle to Amazon. The retail giant took that title after bringing its presence to more than 40000 employees across New Jersey in 2020. An Amazon spokesperson told ROI-NJ.com that the company has invested $14.5 billion into New Jersey’s economy since 2010.

New Mexico — Presbyterian Healthcare Services

In case you hadn’t noticed medicine is serious business in the U.S. Further proof of this is New Mexico’s Presbyterian Healthcare Services which employs more people than any other private entity across the state. The company counts more than 11000 people among its staff in New Mexico. Nine hospitals across the state are included in Presbyterian’s footprint.

New York — Northwell Health

While New York is home to arguably the most bustling arts and culture scene in the world the state’s single biggest employer is just as typical as it is in many states: a hospital system. Northwell Health says it has more than 76000 employees working across its network of more than 800 care facilities in New York. While the healthcare giant has the title for now it’s been estimated that Amazon could become the state’s biggest employer by 2034 as it seeks to add tens of thousands of new jobs there by then.

North Carolina — University of North Carolina System

When outsiders think of North Carolina basketball at the University of North Carolina probably comes to mind first. That institution and the wide-ranging University of North Carolina System that it’s a part of have a whopping 48000 employees across the state making it the biggest staffer behind state government. A total of 17 institutions are included in the system.

North Dakota — Sanford Health

It’s unique for a company not named Walmart to occupy multiple spots on this list and that’s what Sanford Health can claim. The hospital network stretches across four states but has its biggest presence across North Dakota and South Dakota where it is the biggest employer in each. In North Dakota it’s been reported that Sanford Health employs more than 12000 people.

Kroger The Ohio State University and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base each have an immense workforce in the Buckeye State but the state’s top-rated healthcare giant surpasses them all. The Cleveland Clinic Foundation has nearly 51000 workers on the payroll up sharply from the 37800 employees it reported having in 2009. The system’s flagship location in the heart of Cleveland celebrated its 100th year in business in 2021.

Oklahoma — Walmart

The United States government is actually the single-biggest employer across Oklahoma but Walmart gets the credit when nebulous government entities aren’t included. The retailer cuts checks for more than 33000 people across the state which isn’t far from the 37000 employed by the federal government there. Walmart operates 134 stores in the state 81 of which are supercenters.

Oregon — Intel

Technology rules the workforce in Oregon as Intel has had the title of the state’s largest employer for at least six years. The company says it has about 17000 employees in Oregon ranking it ahead of other major jobs creators like Providence Health System Fred Meyers Stores and Nike. The tech giant operates six campuses in the state and has been operating there since 1974.

Pennsylvania — University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

Hillsboro Oregon USA – October 18 2018: An Intel logo at a corner of JF3 building of Jones Farm campus

Healthcare comes out on top yet again this time in the Keystone State. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (aka UPMC) has an immense presence across Pennsylvania operating 40 hospitals and more than 800 clinics. The company employs a reported 92000 people across the state including a whopping 5000 doctors.

Rhode Island — Lifespan

With just over 1 million citizens between its relatively tight borders the fact that Rhode Island’s biggest employer has 16000 workers there is pretty substantial. Lifespan has been operating in Rhode Island since 1994 and runs six hospitals 40 labs and more than 100 clinics around the state. The military is another major hirer in the coastal state with Naval Station Newport counting roughly 10000 workers among its staff.

South Carolina — Walmart

Rhode Island Hospital Zecchino Pavilion

South Carolina has some serious employers in BMW Boeing and Joint Base Charleston but Walmart tops them all. The company employs more than 34000 people across the state which is about as much as those other three giants combined. There are 122 Walmart stores in South Carolina including 83 supercenters according to the company.

Walmart

South Dakota — Sanford Health

As mentioned previously the Sanford Health system is the biggest employer in both North Dakota and South Dakota. The network’s biggest presence is in South Dakota with its headquarters located in Sioux Falls. It’s unclear exactly how many employees Sanford has in South Dakota alone but the company has an estimated 30000 workers total and it has been widely reported to be the state’s biggest employer.

Tennessee — Walmart

Sanford Health Main Campus Sioux Falls South Dakota USA: 3-2021: Children’s Hospital Castle of Care

Yes Walmart rules the workforce in yet another state. Nissan Shoney’s and Vanderbilt University and its associated hospital are counted among the biggest employers in the state but none can match the big-box store’s staff in Tennessee. According to Walmart it employs nearly 43000 people in the state and operates 150 stores within its borders.

Texas — H-E-B

Texas is yet another state where a retailer has the biggest payroll of all. The San Antonio-based supermarket chain H-E-B counts more than 90000 Texans among its workforce reportedly making it the biggest private employer in the Lone Star State. The chain has more than 300 stores in the state giving it an immense presence there.

Utah — Intermountain Healthcare

The state of Utah has a few large employers ranked in a virtual tie at the top but Intermountain Healthcare just wins the race. The hospital system has more than 20000 employees which ranks it just ahead of the Utah state government and the University of Utah. Interestingly Intermountain was in talks to merge with another major employer on this list Sanford Health until the deal was called off early in 2021.

Vermont — The University of Vermont Health Network

Salt Lake City UT / USA – November 6 2020: Intermountain Primary Children’s Hospital

Frankly we were kind of disappointed to find out that Ben & Jerry’s isn’t the biggest employer in Vermont but what can you do? The fact is that The University of Vermont Health Network employs 8800 people edging out semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries as the state’s biggest staffer. The network is anchored by the flagship UVM Medical Center in Burlington which staffs 1700 nurses and 600 doctors.

Virginia — Walmart

Virginia sees about 46000 of its citizens employed by the combined powers of Huntington Ingalls Industries and Sentara Healthcare but that figure barely surpasses the number employed by Walmart. The retailer has an impressive 45727 workers across Virginia where it operates 149 stores. That figure easily makes the company the biggest staffer in the entire commonwealth.

Washington — Amazon

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a shift at the top of Washington state’s employment rankings. Boeing was the biggest employer in the state until the pandemic hindered the company’s business while doing the opposite for Amazon’s. As a result the online retailer which was born in Washington became the state’s top dog. Amazon counts more than 80000 employees among its workforce in Washington.

West Virginia — WVU Medicine

For nearly two decades Walmart ruled West Virginia as the biggest employer but it was unseated in 2016 by a healthcare titan. WVU Medicine has more than 15000 employees within its network in the state. Other top employers across the state include Kroger Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Lowe’s.

Wisconsin — Advocate Aurora Health

Morgantown WV – 21 January 2021: WVU Medicine covid-19 vaccination center in old mall in Morgantown West Virginia

Another health system this one based in Milwaukee tops another state’s list of the biggest employers. Wisconsin’s Advocate Aurora Health operates 15 hospitals and more than 150 clinics across the state and into northern Illinois. All that care requires 75000 employees to make up its substantial payroll. It’s unclear how many of them work solely in Wisconsin but the company has widely been reported as the state’s biggest private employer.

Photo: Advocate Aurora Health

Wyoming — Walmart

With just 14 stores across the state Walmart’s presence in Wyoming is nowhere near what it is in other parts of the U.S. Still the retailer is counted as the biggest private employer there despite the fact that it has fewer than 5000 workers. Wyoming’s F.E. Warren Air Force Base employs more than 4000 people at a single site but it’s still not quite enough to catch up with Walmart’s payroll in the state.",,,,,,,,,,,,
IBM,IBM,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNybi5jb20vc2xpZGUtc2hvd3Mvc3RvcmFnZS9pYm0taGl0YWNoaS1zZWUtZHJvcC1pbi1leHRlcm5hbC1zdG9yYWdlLXNhbGVzLWFzLWRlbGwtaHBlLXNvYXItaWRj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBM Hitachi See Drop In External Storage Sales As Dell HPE Soar: IDC,"IBM Hitachi See Drop In External Storage Sales As Dell HPE Soar: IDC Dell HPE NetApp Huawei and Pure Storage all showed double-digit growth in worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue according to IDC but the continuing drop in Hitachi and IBM revenue means Pure Storage now at No. 7 could soon take the No. 5 spot.

Changes Coming In The External Storage Business IBM and Hitachi continued to see a drop in external storage sales as Dell HPE and NetApp revenue grew in the second quarter of 2021 according to research firm IDC. IDC’s quarterly worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue is one of the basic barometers showing the health of the storage business. And for the second calendar quarter of 2021 it shows the industry to be a healthy one. IDC estimated second quarter sales reached $6.93 billion up 9.7 percent over the $6.31 billion estimated for the second quarter 2020 sales. Things look even better in terms of volume where IDC estimated total OEM storage capacity rose 27.9 percent over last year to reach 22.1 exabytes for the quarter. However the IDC worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue list has its limits. The obvious limit is that it includes external storage only and does not include internal storage that companies like Dell and HPE ship with servers or PCs. Even more important the quarterly report does reflect the fact that business are changing how they purchase storage. As CRN noted in its 8 Emerging Data Storage Trends To Watch In 2021 storage decisions are more likely to be made based on what will help companies grow their business and generate profits and not where and how the data is stored. How did the individual vendors do? Click through the slideshow to not only see the IDC numbers but more news and analysis from CRN.

Dell Technologies Dell Technologies’ storage business did very well according to IDC but not so good according to Dell. IDC reported Dell’s second calendar quarter 2021 worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue reached $1.86 billion up a very respectable 10.1 percent over the second quarter of 2020 giving Dell a 26.8-percent share of the total market. However that is at odds with Dell’s own reporting. Dell for its second fiscal quarter 2022 which ended July 30 reported storage revenue of $4 billion down 1 percent year-over-year. The Dell figure however is for all storage including storage sold with its servers as well as Dell’s storage software sales. Jeff Clarke vice chairman and co-COO of the Round Rock Texas-based Dell in reporting the company’s second fiscal quarter 2021 financials said Dell has the broadest storage portfolio in the market with the highest market share in high-end midrange entry-level unstructured object all-flash and software-defined storage. He also said Dell’s midrange storage sales grew 17 percent year over year but that high-end storage sales fell due to the cyclical nature of that product segment. He also called the Dell PowerStore the company’s fastest-growing product it ever launched through its first five quarters.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE had a strong second calendar quarter 2021 in storage with IDC reporting worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue of $756.7 million up 14.7 percent over last year giving HPE a 10.9-percent market share for the quarter. Like Dell the IDC revenue estimation does not include a significant amount of storage sold with its servers and other devices. The IDC numbers don’t do HPE justice. HPE said that storage revenue for its third fiscal quarter 2021 which ended July 31 was $1.2 billion up 4 percent over the prior-year period. The company a 10-percent year-over-year growth in its software-defined storage sales including sales of its Nimble storage technology. Sales of the company’s all-flash storage arrays grew by 30-plus percent over last year led by the HPE Primera line.

NetApp NetApp which a few years ago seemed to be a diminished force in the storage industry continues its march forward from strength to strength. The company had worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue of $685 million giving it a 9.9-percent market share according to IDC. That revenue was up 11.8 percent over last year. Unlike Dell and HPE NetApp is a pure-play storage vendor and ships no servers or other devices with internal storage. The IDC numbers don’t tell the whole story. NetApp for its first fiscal quarter 2022 which ended July 30 reported total revenue of $1.46 billion up 11.9 percent year-over-year. That included product revenue of $730 million. NetApp also reported that its all-flash storage business grew 23 percent over last year. However for NetApp the future is in the cloud. The company has taken the lead among legacy storage vendors in transforming its storage technology to work in public and private clouds allowing customers to seamlessly migrate data between on-premises hybrid cloud and public cloud. That means that the total amount of data managed by NetApp technology increasingly may not be on its own hardware.

Huawei China-based Huawei is the growth leader in storage. IDC estimates Huawei saw second calendar 2021 worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue of $619.5 million which was up a whopping 26.7 percent over last year. At that growth rate it may be a matter of a few quarters before Huawei overtakes NetApp as the third-largest vendor and begin to threaten HPE for the number-two spot. IDC estimates that Huawei has an 8.9-percent market share. Indeed the only thing holding Huawei back is its lack of a U.S. market. Because of alleged ties between the company and the Chinese government the company is effectively shut out of the U.S. which is the world’s biggest storage market. Hitachi Vantara Hitachi which includes Hitachi Vantara came in at fifth place in the worldwide enterprise external OEM storage market with revenue of $338.3 million which IDC was down 4.0 percent over last year. That was enough to give the company a 4.9-percent market share. For Hitachi storage is becoming a smaller part of its business as the company continues to find solid growth in the data analytics data operations IoT and cloud markets. However Hitachi is far from giving up on storage. The company late last year introduced its first midrange all-flash storage arrays and its first storage-as-a-service offering. Much of the company’s storage is targeted at some of the more higher-value offering it brings to clients such as data analytics.

IBM According to IDC IBM’s worldwide enterprise external OEM storage sales took the biggest hit of the top seven vendors falling 36.0 percent over last year to $322.9 million and a 4.7-percent market share. IBM in its second fiscal quarter 2021 financial report didn’t break out its storage sales instead including it along with its mainframe and Power server sales although the company did say storage systems sales fell 7 percent over last year. But looking at IBM’s storage hardware sales is not the best way to understand its storage business. IBM’s storage growth is coming from its software-defined storage sales where margins are high even though revenue is lower than that of complete storage systems.

Pure Storage Pure Storage came in at No. 7 on IDC’s list of top worldwide enterprise external OEM storage sales leaders. IBM estimated Pure Storage’s revenue at $287.4 million up 12 percent over last year giving it a market share of 4.1 percent. Given Pure Storage’s growth rate and the decreasing external storage sales from Hitachi and IBM Pure Storage is likely to soon move up to the number five position. Pure Storage in August said its total revenue for its second fiscal quarter which ended Aug. 1 reached $496.8 million of which $324.9 million was product revenue and $171.9 million subscription services revenue. Pure Storage is similar to rival NetApp in two key areas. First it is a pure play storage vendor and has no server or other hardware which might include internal storage. And the company is also pushing fast into the cloud with such moves as acquiring Kubernetes storage container Portworx and making its storage technology easily consumed in a cloud or as a service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ueXRpbWVzL25hbWUvZnJhbmstc3Rlcm4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MjExOTA0MDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FRANK STERN Obituary (2021) - New York NY - New York Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/nytimes/name/frank-stern-obituary?id=21190406 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ueXRpbWVzL25hbWUvZnJhbmstc3Rlcm4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MjExOTA0MDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA5LzE4LzQtc3RvY2tzLXdvcnRoLTEtdHJpbGxpb24tYnktMjAzNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Companies That Could Be Worth $1 Trillion by 2035,"The growth potential in these stocks is too hard to ignore.

Stocks with game-changing growth potential can grow exponentially in a matter of years but among the many companies aggressively pursuing growth today only a handful seem capable of making it through the stock gyrations and hitting the coveted $1 trillion market capitalization by 2035. After all only five companies have made it to the $1 trillion club so far so unless a company is already growing like a weed and has convincing catalysts ahead to sustain that momentum it's hard to make it that far.

To be able to get your hands on a potential trillion-dollar company early in the game is a dizzyingly tempting idea though so I dug deep into the hundreds of stocks with a market capitalization of more than $100 million to see which ones could go that far. I found four stocks that have a really good chance of making it. Read along.

COVID-19 pandemic is a boon for this stock

Many use Visa (V 0.79%) cards but few are aware of the kind of growth the company can enjoy in coming years.

At the recently held Deutsche Bank Technology Conference Visa's CFO Vasant Prabhu highlighted four structural trends triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic that should power up the company's growth:

Acceleration of cash digitization or the use of digital modes of payment instead of cash.

Booming e-commerce particularly cross-border e-commerce as people are buying things online they traditionally bought in stores like groceries and drugs.

Greater adoption of cashless modes of payment by merchants of all sizes as they realize the importance of going online for survival.

Growth in value-added services like data solutions digital security and CyberSource -- an e-commerce card payments management company owned by Visa.

These are all secular trends that Visa knows how to exploit given its dominance in the payments processing space with 3.6 billion cards issued under its name as of the last quarter.

Management has clear-cut plans to grow shareholder wealth: Capture growing consumer payments and value-add markets through acquisitions and new services pay out 20% to 25% of annual earnings per share in dividends and repurchase shares with remaining cash. Visa's attempt to acquire fintech company Plaid may have fallen through on regulatory concerns but it's a fine example of Visa's hunger for growth.

Visa is already a cash-cow machine thanks to a low-capital high-margin core business and it generates operating margins north of 60%. With the pandemic forcing economies to go cashless and online Visa with its market cap of $492 billion should be able to hit $1 trillion long before 2035.

There's more money to be made from this massive trend than you think

I am going to make my boldest $1 trillion contender pick yet: It's a utility with a market cap of $165 billion.

Yes you read that right but I strongly believe NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%) will become the first utility stock in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club by 2035.

NextEra Energy's stock price has risen more than fivefold in 10 years and even more in dividends which have risen every year for more than 25 years. Now if the company could achieve that kind of growth when renewable energy was still in its nascent stage imagine where it could be once countries start working toward their net-zero emission goals. 137 countries have already committed to these goals mostly by 2050.

Statista projects that the global renewable energy market will cross $1 trillion as early as 2027 up from only $613.8 million in 2020. Projections through 2025 from the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2020 report are even more notable:

By 2025 major oil and gas companies' spending on renewables could grow tenfold.

Renewables could account for 95% of the increase in total global power capacity.

Renewables could make up one-third of the world's total electricity led by hydropower solar and wind.

Now consider this: NextEra Energy's subsidiary Energy Resources is already the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and has a backlog of 16.7 gigawatts (GW) which means near-term growth is already built into its portfolio.

To top that NextEra Energy's Florida Power & Light company is a steady cash-flow machine and its affiliate NextEra Energy Partners a steady source of funds. Then there's the opportunity in green hydrogen which alone could be a $12 trillion market by 2050.

There's another reason why NextEra has me excited: Growth via acquisitions. After its failed bid for Duke Energy I'm sure NextEra Energy is on the lookout for the next big merger or acquisition opportunity which could speed up this top renewable energy growth stock's journey to $1 trillion.

This company is beating the best in its game

Customer relationship management (CRM) has emerged as the fastest-growing software market as a rising number of businesses now understand why digitizing customer management is critical to retain and gain customers in an ever-expanding virtual world. These stunning statistics reveal why Salesforce.com's (CRM 0.55%) market cap could easily grow fourfold to $1 trillion well before 2035:

The global CRM market grew by 6% to $69 billion in 2020 according to Gartner.

Salesforce dominated the market with 19.5% share two percentage points higher than the combined market share of SAP  Oracle  Microsoft MSFT 0.59% ) Adobe  according to Statista.

   according to Statista. While SAP's and Oracle's market shares dropped in 2020 Salesforce's market share grew from 18.4% in 2019 to 19.5%.

Salesforce has more than doubled its revenue in the past three years.

Salesforce predicts revenue to cross $50 billion by 2026 from $21.1 billion in fiscal 2021.

Clearly Salesforce has its pulse on the CRM market like none other. Salesforce uses artificial intelligence extensively and its recent acquisition of business messaging platform Slack could be a potential game-changer as Slack competes directly with Microsoft's Teams platform. Slack added a record net new 13000 paid customers and had 169000 total paid customers as of last quarter including biggies like IBM.

As Salesforce is also already profitable its journey toward a $1 trillion market cap should be easier if it can grow sales as projected.

These industries could explode and so could this stock

Sea Limited's (SE -1.64%) market cap has grown at an astounding pace to $189 billion from only about $4.9 billion in October 2017. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results but Sea Limited's market cap growth so far wasn't a fluke: It was backed by exponential growth in revenues and gross profit. And if Sea Limited can continue to make a splash in the two big markets it's targeting nothing can stop its stock from hitting $1 trillion.

Sea Limited's integrated online platform forms the base of its three core businesses:

Entertainment (gaming): Garena.

E-commerce: Shopee.

Digital financials services: SeaMoney.

Here's how each business is faring:

Garena: Quarterly active users (QAUs) and quarterly paying users (QPUs) hit 725.2 million and 92.2 million respectively in second-quarter 2021. QAUs and QPUs were 402.1 million and 35.7 million as of March 30 2020.

Shopee: Gross merchandise value and orders hit $15 billion and $1.4 billion respectively in Q2 2021 from only $6.2 billion and $0.4 billion as of March 30 2020.

SeaMoney: Mobile wallet payment volumes crossed $4.2 billion in Q2 2021 from only $1.1 billion as of March 30 2020.

If anything at all these numbers indicate Sea Limited's growth potential.

Its flagship game Free Fire beat Tencent's (TCEHY -0.15%) PUBG Mobile to become the world's third-most downloaded mobile game in August 2021. Shopee is already the leading e-commerce company in Southeast Asia and Taiwan and is now expanding into Latin America Europe and even India. SeaMoney is growing beyond mobile payments -- it has already won a banking license in Singapore and recently acquired Indonesia's PT Bank.

Remember though Sea Limited's losses are swelling and that's something that may not sit well with some investors. However Sea Limited is a typical growth stock focused on customer and top-line growth and has successfully monetized Garena to reinvest the cash into e-commerce and financial services beyond Southeast Asia. If you believe in the power of these two businesses Sea Limited could be an enormous winner by 2035.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvYWhtZWRhYmFkL2libS1leWVzLWdpZnQtY2l0eS1mb3Itc29mdHdhcmUtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtY2VudHJlL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg2MzI4MTI2LmNtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ahmedabad: IBM eyes GIFT City for software development centre | Ahmedabad News,AHMEDABAD: Global information technology major IBM is scouting for space in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City ( GIFT City ) in Gandhinagar for establishing its software lab. The multinational giant is most likely to take up 1.5 lakh square feet (sq.ft.) space in a phased manner said market sources.IBM Software Labs as part of its expansion in Gujarat is planning to set up a state-of-the-art product engineering design and software development center.Although the company had announced that it was working to establish the proposed centre in Ahmedabad it is also exploring possibilities in GIFT City said sources.“IBM is looking for a space in GIFT City and the company is learnt to have obtained price quotes from the existing developers in GIFT City” sources added.According to the market sources the company is looking at acquiring 1.5 lakh sq feet space in GIFT City in a phased manner with 50000 sq feet likely to be taken up for development in the first phase over the next six months. “However things are at a preliminary stage” sources added.When contacted IBM India stated that the company is extending opportunities to talented people across key cities (beyond the metros) in India for the benefit of its customers.“We are excited that the IBM Software Labs expansion in Gujarat will accelerate the building of skills and digital innovation — providing a strong foundation for the IT/ITeS sector in the state” added IBM India without providing any specific details about its plans in GIFT City. In August IBM India’s managing director Sandip Patel and IBM India Software Labs’ vice-president Gaurav Sharma had met the former chief minister Vijay Rupani and senior state government officials to discuss the expansion of IBM Software Labs’ operations in Gujarat which also included the establishment of product engineering design and software development center in Ahmedabad.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3dvbmRlcmZ1bGVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS90aGlzLTYteWVhci1vbGQtaGFzLXNldC1hLW5ldy1ndWlubmVzcy13b3JsZC1yZWNvcmQtZm9yLWJlY29taW5nLXRoZS13b3JsZHMteW91bmdlc3QtcHJvZ3JhbW1lci_SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93b25kZXJmdWxlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vdGhpcy02LXllYXItb2xkLWhhcy1zZXQtYS1uZXctZ3Vpbm5lc3Mtd29ybGQtcmVjb3JkLWZvci1iZWNvbWluZy10aGUtd29ybGRzLXlvdW5nZXN0LXByb2dyYW1tZXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This 6-Year-Old Has Set A New Guinness World Record For Becoming The World’s Youngest Programmer,"“If we think that we are just trying to solve puzzles coding won’t feel that difficult and you may start enjoying it.” Wise words said by a 6-year old who recently became the World’s youngest Python programmer.

Kautilya Katariya from Northampton UK began studying IBM course materials online during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to utilize time and learn something useful. By November 2020 he had completed five different courses in Python and IBM which included “Foundations of AI” “Python for Data Science” and a course from IBM cognitive class. And just like that he was granted the programming Guinness World Record for the youngest programmer in the world.

When asked about what piqued his interest in programming in the first place Katariya explained “everything pointed… that cool things are either run by a computer programmer or made using programming.” He also gave credit to his parents who helped him along the way by providing him books and educational resources on programming and artificial intelligence. His parents then gave him a laptop and an internet connection to further pursue his studies.

Katariya’s parents also had some sound advice for all the parents. They said that parents should treat coding like any other mental exercise which helps develop logical thinking and problem-solving capabilities in children. This way they would be encouraged to learn more about coding without thinking of it as a difficult subject.

Katariya himself had an important message for his fellow peers and even grown-ups who are pursuing programming as a course. He said “I think computer programming is really fun and is similar to solving puzzles. If we think that we are just trying to solve puzzles coding won’t feel that difficult and you may start enjoying it.” Now what’s stopping you from starting coding?"

However Intel has been embroiled in a patent infringement lawsuit in China since 2018 with a Chinese government-funded R&D lab that asserts the company has violated its FinFET patent. Intel has responded by challenging the validity of the patent but it recently lost its sixth challenge with the China Patent Reexamination Board marking yet another setback for Intel in the case as it looks to avoid a ban on the sale of its 'Core' family of processors in China.



The Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS) filed the lawsuit against Intel in the Beijing High Court in 2018 seeking 200 million yuan (roughly $31 million USD) in damages plus the cost of litigation. More importantly the lawsuit also seeks a ban on the sale of Intel's 'Core' family of chips that it uses for its client products at least until the two parties can come to a licensing agreement.

Intel provided the following statement to Tom's Hardware regarding the latest developments:



""This decision is subject to appeal and Intel looks forward to the courts’ balanced consideration of Intel’s invalidity challenges to the asserted patent.""

IMECAS has also filed two other patent infringement lawsuits against Intel (more below). Intel can't assign a dollar amount to the potential total damages saying ""[...]we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses if any arising from these matters. We dispute IMECAS's claims and intend to vigorously defend against them.""

Intel's latest setback in the FinFET case follows a long string of the company's attempts to bring the Inter Partes patent review process to friendlier climes at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. However the USPTO has refused to hear the case leaving the dispute in the hands of the Chinese patent authorities.

Intel began using FinFET designs with the debut of its third-gen 22nm Ivy Bridge processors back in 2011 and continues to use the tech in its latest products. The dispute centers around the 457 patent (CN 102956457) also known as the ""FinFET patent."" IMECAS also sued Dell China and JingDong Century Information Technology (JD) for infringing the '457 patent but those companies tendered indemnity to Intel.

Intel has encountered some success by challenging the validity of the patent — three of the claims in the patent have been deemed invalid. However eleven of the claims are still enforceable. That means barring any additional successful challenges the infringement lawsuit against Intel will move forward.

IMECAS has expanded its efforts too by suing Intel in two other patent infringement actions related to the sale and manufacturing of its Core i3 processors (CN 102386226 — '226 Patent) this time related to MOSFET technology. These actions also demand injunctions and reimbursement for litigation costs but differ in that IMECAS reserves the right to claim an unspecified amount of damages.

Intel will obviously exhaust all options as it fights the infringement lawsuits but IMECAS has the advantage of being on its home court (quite literally). Additionally according to ICsmart with over 5000 patents filed in China and 500 filed in foreign countries along with 1505 patent licenses in IC technologies IMECAS has plenty of experience with patent law and is a seasoned litigant.

Intel is no stranger to litigation either so we can expect these cases to drag out for quite some time. Challenging the validity of the FinFET patent is among the first steps of the process — Intel and IMECAS will head to court as soon as those attempts have been exhausted. However it appears that Intel is running out of options to challenge the veracity of the patent so this case could either enter the courtroom or see a settlement in the coming months.

Intel's legal department is certainly busy: The company is also in the midst of a long-running series of lawsuits from VLSI that have already seen the company fined $2.18 billion for one case but emerge victorious in another. Intel still has other lawsuits underway with VLSI. According to Intel those suits could cost it $11 billion if it loses the legal battles with VLSI in all states. There are also the pesky lawsuits associated with the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities and the company's 7nm delay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS9kYWlseS1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDkvMTkvYWZ0ZXItYWZnaGFuaXN0YW4tcHVsbG91dC11cy1zZWVrcy1uYXRvLW5hc2luZy1pbnRlbC1wYWN0cy5odG1s0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tL2RhaWx5LW5ld3MvMjAyMS8wOS8xOS9hZnRlci1hZmdoYW5pc3Rhbi1wdWxsb3V0LXVzLXNlZWtzLW5hdG8tbmFzaW5nLWludGVsLXBhY3RzLmh0bWw_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After Afghanistan Pullout US Seeks NATO Basing Intel Pacts,"ATHENS Greece (AP) — Against the backdrop of the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan the top U.S. military officer is meeting in Greece with NATO counterparts this weekend hoping to forge more basing intelligence sharing and other agreements to prevent terrorist groups from regrouping and threatening America and the region.

Army Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the meeting of NATO defense chiefs will focus in part on the way ahead now that all alliance troops have pulled out of Afghanistan and the Taliban are in control.

Milley U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and American intelligence officials have warned that al-Qaida or the Islamic State group could regenerate in Afghanistan and pose a threat to the United States in one year to two years.

The U.S. military has said it can conduct counterterrorism surveillance and if necessary strikes in Afghanistan from “over the horizon” — meaning from assets based in other countries. But they have made it clear that surveillance flights from bases in the Persian Gulf are long and provide limited time in the air over Afghanistan. So they have talked about seeking basing agreements overflight rights and increased intelligence-sharing with nations closer to Afghanistan including some neighbors.

In recent months however U.S. officials have reported little progress in any negotiations on any basing agreements.

Milly said he will be talking to his military counterparts “to see what the possibilities are and then bring them back” to U.S. defense and diplomatic leaders for additional discussions. Then he said officials will see what they can turn into a reality.

“We are going to talk about over the horizon capabilities and where allies think appropriate that they can make a contribution  we’re certainly open to that” Milley told reporters traveling with him to Greece. “There are opportunities where alliance members may choose to work closely with us on these over the horizon capabilities.”

He said allies are concerned about counterterrorism and how to ensure an effective defense against terrorists.

At the opening of the morning session Saturday NATO military leaders made it clear that avoiding a resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan is a key goal for the alliance.

Greece's defense minister Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos told the group that allies must ensure the safety and security of at-risk Afghans who remain in the country and must prevent a humanitarian crisis.

More than 120000 Americans Afghans and others were flown out of Afghanistan during the chaotic and massive airlift operation in the days after Kabul the capital fell to the Taliban. But thousands more were left behind with many fleeing to the borders and seeking help from aid agencies and ad hoc groups struggling to find ways out of the country.

Human rights and refugee groups are urging the European Union to step up its help for people trying to flee Afghanistan. The EU’s asylum agency said that asylum applications by Afghans numbered 7300 in July before the government fell and that was a 21% increase over June. Almost 1200 were unaccompanied minors. More than half of asylum applications by Afghans in Europe are rejected.

“We are going through a period of significant challenges in Afghanistan” said Panagiotopoulos adding that a key risk is the migration flow toward Europe. He said allies need to “provide support to those countries in the immediate neighborhood and must avoid a migration crisis at our borders.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIxL3NlcC8xOC9zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXNpbGljb24tY2hpcHMtY2FyYm9uLWZvb3RwcmludC1jbGltYXRl0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2Vudmlyb25tZW50LzIwMjEvc2VwLzE4L3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2lsaWNvbi1jaGlwcy1jYXJib24tZm9vdHByaW50LWNsaW1hdGU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The computer chip industry has a dirty climate secret,"The semiconductor industry has a problem. Demand is booming for silicon chips which are embedded in everything from smartphones and televisions to wind turbines but it comes at a big cost: a huge carbon footprint.

The industry presents a paradox. Meeting global climate goals will in part rely on semiconductors. They’re integral to electric vehicles solar arrays and wind turbines. But chip manufacturing also contributes to the climate crisis. It requires huge amounts of energy and water – a chip fabrication plant or fab can use millions of gallons of water a day – and creates hazardous waste.

As the semiconductor industry finds itself increasingly under the spotlight it is starting to grapple with its climate impacts. Last week Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company the world’s largest chipmaker which supplies chips to Apple pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The company aims to “broaden our green influence and drive the industry towards low-carbon sustainability” said the TSMC chairman Mark Lui.

But decarbonizing the industry will be a big challenge.

TSMC alone uses almost 5% of all Taiwan’s electricity according to figures from Greenpeace predicted to rise to 7.2% in 2022 and it used about 63m tons of water in 2019. The company’s water use became a controversial topic during Taiwan’s drought this year the country’s worst in a half century which pitted chipmakers against farmers.

In the US a single fab Intel’s 700-acre campus in Ocotillo Arizona produced nearly 15000 tons of waste in the first three months of this year about 60% of it hazardous. It also consumed 927m gallons of fresh water enough to fill about 1400 Olympic swimming pools and used 561m kilowatt-hours of energy.

Chip manufacturing rather than energy consumption or hardware use “accounts for most of the carbon output” from electronics devices the Harvard researcher Udit Gupta and co-authors wrote in a 2020 paper.

A global shortage of high-end chips as the pandemic boosted demand for electronics and Covid outbreaks closed fabs has increased focus on the industry.

In a tight market automakers found themselves at the back of the chip queue far behind much bigger-scale semiconductor customers such as Apple who use the chips to give computing power to their smartphones laptops and other devices. GM halted production in several of its North American factories this month while Toyota said it would cut its carmaking by 40% in September.

In an attempt to increase production many countries are embarking on big programs to boost the industry.

The Chips for America Act proposes $52bn in funding over five years for the US semiconductor industry. The EU has forwarded its own legislation aimed at increasing its share of the global chips market to 20% by 2030. The European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen called it “a matter of tech sovereignty” in her State of the European Union address last week.

These ambitions line up a potential clash with international climate goals. Both the EU and US aim to get halfway to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. And as the semiconductor industry grows so too will its carbon footprint.

However amid pressure from investors and electronics makers keen to report greener supply chains to customers the semiconductor business has been ramping up action on tackling its climate footprint.

“Recently I started seeing our effects on the environment completely come to the forefront” said Sohini Dasgupta principal design engineer at ON Semiconductors.

Two years ago she said the industry “was sitting on the fence in the middle of the pack saying: ‘Yes sustainability is important but we don’t know what to do with it’”. But now she sees movement: “Every day it pops up in our emails what our company’s doing what other companies are doing” she said.

The rise of ethical investing has helped according to Mark Li a semiconductor analyst at the investment firm Bernstein. Fund managers increasingly market “green funds” and investors are asking more questions about companies’ environmental social and governance (ESG) impact. “Over the last three years the voice of ESG investment is much louder than before” Li said. Ultimately this changes how companies behave he added.

Greater availability of renewable energy is helping chipmakers reduce their carbon footprint. Intel made a commitment to source 100% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 as did TSMC but with a deadline of 2050.

Energy consumption accounts for 62% of TSMC’s emissions said a company spokesperson Nina Kao. The company signed a 20-year deal last year with the Danish energy firm Ørsted buying all the energy from a 920-megawatt offshore windfarm Ørsted is building in the Taiwan Strait.

The deal which has been described as the world’s largest corporate renewables purchase agreement has benefits for TSMC said Shashi Barla renewables analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. As well as guaranteeing a clean electricity supply it pays a wholesale cost and removes itself from price shocks “killing two birds with one stone” he said.

TSMC’s actions have the potential to influence the rest of the industry said Clifton Fonstad professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT “other manufacturers are likely to follow its lead”.

As well as switching to renewables chipmakers could also implement efficiencies in fabs said Peter Hanbury a semiconductor manufacturing expert at the management consultancy Bain & Company. A chip fab is basically “a gigantic warehouse with a clean room inside” he said and to cut emissions “the easy part is the facility itself”.

Fabs could be more efficient in regulating air and water temperature humidity and pressure. They could segment warehouses so one production line had high pressure and another lower using less energy than keeping the entire warehouse at a high pressure.

They could capture more data and use machine learning to turn tools off when they weren’t being used said Huili Grace Xing an engineering professor at Cornell University who works on semiconductor materials.

There is also innovation aimed at tackling the worst-polluting materials used in making semiconductors. The chip industry uses different gases during the production process many of which have a significant climate impact.

Chip companies make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost they can afford it Mark Li semiconductor analyst

TSMC said it had implemented scrubbers and other facilities to treat gas emissions. But another route is replacing “dirtier” cleaning gases that clean the delicate tools in semiconductor manufacturing said Michael Pittroff a chemical engineer working on semiconductor gases at Solvay Special Chemicals.

In industrial tests over the last six years with about a half dozen chipmaker clients Pittroff said he and his team had replaced more polluting gases with “cleaner” fluorine with a lower global warming impact.

Other companies target the gases that are used to etch patterns onto and clean the silicon surface of a wafer – the thin piece of material used to make semiconductors. Paris-based industrial gases company Air Liquide for example has come up with a line of alternative etching gases with lower global warming impacts.

But replacing gases will be a challenge: anything that touches the silicon wafer such as an etching gas is really hard to alter once a fab is operating said Hanbury. The process involves a huge amount of precision. Fabs have to place up to 100m transistors on a postage-stamp sized wafer and need to do it perfectly. It takes four to five years for fabs to develop a recipe for this and “once you set it you basically never want to change it” Hanbury said.

Some experts believe chipmakers will start to modify their processes to incorporate greener gases especially if the big players make a move. “If TSMC switches I am sure the others will” said Fonstad. “If TSMC doesn’t then other manufacturers may switch to show they are better than TSMC.”

To some observers of the chip business the determination to clean up the industry seems real. The vast demand for chips at the moment will only help the semiconductor industry embrace sustainability goals said Li.

“They have very good margins and make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost they can afford it. And increasingly customers are willing to pay more for a greener device” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vZGVsbC1zNTE0OGYtb24tNDgtcG9ydC0yNWdiZS02LXBvcnQtMTAwZ2JlLXN3aXRjaC1oYW5kcy1vbi8yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dell S5148F-ON 48-port 25GbE 6-port 100GbE Switch Hands-on,"Dell S5148F-ON Internal Hardware Overview

Inside the switch we have a fairly standard layout with ports the switch chip and its PCB and then the management and power/ cooling.

Here the switch chip is a Cavium XPliant (now Marvell) part. This switch chip sits below this large heatsink.

Here is a look from the other angle. Something to note here is that the airflow management is nowhere near what we are seeing on higher-end 32x400GbE switches these days. For some sense of scale those higher-end 1U switches put all of the port bandwidth of this switch onto just 4.5 ports so as one can imagine the newer generations are also using more power.

Something that is a bit different on this switch is this Celestica board. This appears to be a Celestica OEM switch with Dell customization but we cannot confirm beyond this board other than by looks. This board houses a Microsemi ZL30363 (now Microchip) chip.

This is an IEEE 1588 and synchronous ethernet packet clock and dual-channel network synchronizer. Feel free to look it up a bit more but here is the block diagram for that.

The other side is actually relatively clean. Often on switches we see a number of FPGAs on both sides of the switch PCB but that is not the case here.

Behind and below the main switch PCB we have a board that ties a lot of the other parts of the switch together. This power and cooling PCB has hot-swap connectors for the fans and power supplies. It also has a high-density connector one can see in the upper right of the below image.

This connector is used to connect the management PCB into the system.

Here is the management PCB occupying the space between the power supplies and in front of the fans.

The board itself is the part of the system that runs the Linux-based network operating systems. For those more familiar with servers this is almost like a small embedded server inside the switch.

One can see we have the 16GB mSATA Innodisk SSD. We also have an Actel SmartFusion ARM FPGA/ Arm SoC.

The main CPU compute complex is a quad-core Intel Atom C2000 “Rangeley part”. It is flanked by dual DDR3 SODIMM slots. We have a single 8GB DDR3 SODIMM installed here.

Part of the confusion on this switch may be the quad-core Rangeley processor. This switch from what we can tell was released in early May 2017. Timing matters for the Intel Atom C2000 series. There was a major Intel Atom C2000 series bug (AVR54) that would cause systems over the course of a few years to not boot. Although STH was hit by this bug in firewalls there was a solution in terms of a new silicon C0 stepping that came out to fix this as well as a workaround for chips that were earlier stepping.

Since the Intel Atom C2000 C0 stepping fixing the AVR54 bug was announced in April and the bug was first discovered by Cisco and Intel in 2016 (Intel worked with other partners after that) it is highly likely Dell knew of this bug before the May launch date. This is a case where timing matters and our general sense is that these should be OK even though they have Atom C2000 series parts. The market though largely is scarred from pulling switches and firewalls across dozens of vendors and that has given the C2000 series a bad reputation in secondary markets. We wanted to at least address this since the fixes are often overlooked.

Now for the one feature that was not great for service: the CR2032 battery. This battery sits on the PCB that has the power and fan connectors.

When the management PCB is in place it is largely obscured. This is a $1 service item in a switch that is very hard to get to.

In future generations Dell rectified this placement but it was one of those areas where it just causes one to pause.

Next we are going to look at the software implications of this switch’s hardware.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybWFpbC5uZXdzL2FydHMtaW50ZWwvaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy9ydW1ibGVkLWluLXRoZS1qdW5nbGUtNjA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ali-Foreman Rumble In the Jungle - Arts Intel,"Ken Burns has given us epic documentaries on the Civil War Vietnam and the fighter Jack Johnson. Now he turns his attention to a subject that draws upon all those histories with Muhammad Ali a new documentary (with Sarah Burns and David McMahon) that will air on September 19. Ali would turn have turned 80 on January 17 2022 but there is another Ali-versary—the epic battle in Zaire on October 30 1974 between Ali and George Foreman in what has long been called the “Rumble in the Jungle.” Unlike other artists a great boxer has a brief time in which to paint his harsh masterpieces. For Ali 32 years old at the time Zaire was one of them.

“I have had lizards in my shower slept in a tiny village where elephants walk the single dusty street at night watched beetles fight to the death and seen the crocodiles who live in the River Zaire which flows outside my villa…. And now because it seems to be required of all sportswriters I must judge who will win. It’s a silly tradition but one rigorously followed. I will try the best I can.”

So wrote the Chicago Sun-Times sportswriter Jack Griffin in a dispatch 10 days before the prizefight in Kinshasa Zaire where Ali would stun the world by wresting the heavyweight championship from the undefeated strongman Foreman knocking him out in the eighth round thus becoming only the second man in boxing history to regain the title.

There have always been writers at ringside—James Baldwin sitting between Norman Mailer and Ben Hecht in Chicago in 1962 when Sonny Liston took the championship away from Floyd Patterson. Gay Talese then of The New York Times was also there that night as were Red Smith Jimmy Cannon and Budd Schulberg. Seventeen months later on February 25 1964 Liston would surrender his heavyweight crown to 22-year-old Cassius Clay.

Some 60000 spectators attended (and millions more watched on closed-circuit TV) the fight between the defending heavyweight champion George Foreman and the former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali.

Eight days later accompanied by Malcolm X Clay announced his new name to the world: Muhammad Ali. It was by that name—one of the most common in the Muslim world—that he would arguably become the most recognized controversial and beloved human on the planet.

Ali has been gone for just over five years now though silenced long before that by the Parkinson’s that brought about his death at 74. During his lifetime he showed us there are no neutral corners. One should take a stand on the great issues of the day—war and peace inequality and injustice. His great gifts as both prizefighter and showman made him a citizen of the world though he was vilified and punished for his refusal to fight in the Vietnam War.

That was the greatest test of his character. But no physical challenge was as daunting as the Rumble in the Jungle some 47 years ago.

Zaire would also prove to be a watershed moment for the handful of American writers who accompanied Ali to Africa. Many of them identified with Ali’s comeback. Norman Mailer Hunter S. Thompson and even George Plimpton were thought by some to have passed their prime as writers. They were invested in Ali’s triumph—or possible defeat. Neither Ali nor the writers who left Zaire after the historic fight would ever be the same. This is their story.

More than a Fight

It was more than just a prizefight. Though opinion was fiercely divided only a few years earlier Ali had been one of the most hated men in America. Having been stripped of his heavyweight title in 1967 for refusing induction into the army he had faced prison time and had his boxing license revoked for three and a half years. Despite a record of 61 fights in which he’d lost only 5 and won 37 by knockout Ali had nothing more to lose and the whole world to gain.

It was also the first heavyweight championship bout ever held on the African continent set up by Don King (who would establish his reputation as a big-gate promoter of fights and fighters) along with a British consortium of backers and President Mobutu Sese Seko the cool cruel newly empowered dictator of Zaire in the first flush of that nation’s independence from the Belgians. Mobutu wanted to advertise his country the success of the revolution and himself. He wanted to put Zaire on the map wiping out all traces of its colonial past. The Belgian Congo had become Zaire. (It’s now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.)

The fight was held in a soccer stadium originally built for an Olympics that would never come: Stade du 20 Mai. Some 60000 people thronged there at four o’clock in the morning so the bout could be shown on closed-circuit TV at prime time in the West. Each fighter was promised $5 million and it was advertised as Mobutu’s “gift to the people of Zaire.”

It was also a gift to the slew of American and international sportswriters who flocked to Kinshasa to cover the biggest event in boxing history among them Jerry Izenberg of the Newark Star-Ledger; Dave Anderson of The New York Times; Vic Ziegel of the New York Post; Dick Young of the New York Daily News; Jack Griffin of the Chicago Sun-Times; Newsday’s Bob Waters; freelance writer and publicist Harold Conrad; and Larry Merchant of the New York Post. (Merchant would ultimately be barred for writing unflattering things about Mobutu’s Zaire and had to cover the fight from New York’s Madison Square Garden where it was shown on closed-circuit TV.) A rising young writer Antigua-born Jamaica Kincaid (who would later win praise for her fiction and memoirs) attended a simulcast at the Victoria Theater in Harlem and filed a story for The Village Voice (“The Triumph of Bad and Cool”). “Black boys are bad. They are bad and they are cool” Kincaid wrote. “Last week Muhammad Ali did a few things to show that he was the baddest and the coolest.... He became the only authentic living hero on the face of this planet.”

For the writers this fight would be the defining sporting event of their careers. Most picked the formidable Foreman to win predicting an early knockout victory for the Texas-born 25-year-old with a string of 40 wins and no losses including 37 wins by knockout.

Added to the hard-core sportswriters were what you might call the celebrity writers the marquee names of the New Journalism writing for magazines and for books and for themselves out of their love of the sport and their fascination with Ali and their need to be where the action was: Bill Cardoso Mailer Plimpton and the most outrageous New Journalist of them all Hunter S. Thompson. Budd Schulberg—sportswriter screenwriter of On the Waterfront author of the great boxing novel that became the Humphrey Bogart film The Harder They Fall—was there too with a foot in both the Ali and Foreman camps.

The big event was originally scheduled for September 25 but eight days before the fight Foreman got cut in a sparring session. A number of the sportswriters returned to the States for the five-week postponement but some stayed on in Zaire.

Like Stepping into Heart of Darkness

For those who stayed as Plimpton observed it was as though they had stepped into Joseph Conrad’s unsettling novella Heart of Darkness. In addition to the unrelenting heat there was the boredom of waiting. To pass the time the sportswriters bet on everything—cockroach and lizard contests and even the hyacinths sliding down the river as if it were a horse race at Hialeah. (“No that one’s my hyacinth!”) Thompson became obsessed with the idea that the Nazi war criminal Martin Bormann was hiding in Brazzaville across the river and wanted to rent a plane to go flush him out.

Thompson was still more of a cult figure then with little national reputation and he was at a low point in his life. His first marriage was breaking up. A few nights before leaving for Zaire he’d made a fool of himself in front of a large audience at Duke University having smoked hashish at the airport and downed too much Wild Turkey before his talk.

Plimpton and Thompson had flown to Zaire together but once they arrived Plimpton saw little of the gonzo writer. “He never turned up at the press conferences or the sparring sessions” Plimpton wrote though he saw him often in the Intercontinental Hotel bar sitting under a thatched roof drinking planter’s punch—the perfect libation Thompson believed for the former Belgian Congo. “But he has always seemed very busy—mysterious missions looking this way and that through his big aviator glasses as he rushed through the lobby” Plimpton wrote.

In fact Thompson didn’t seem interested in the fight; he scorned the sportswriters talking shop. “They’re blind” he said and hinted that he had uncovered a huge story bigger than the Ali-Foreman business: that the Republic of the Congo was building a gigantic torpedo it was planning on punting across the river at the heart of Kinshasa. Most of the newspapermen treated Thompson as a kind of kook and gave him wide berth.

Even the older guys were losing their grip. Harold Conrad in his 60s had—like Schulberg—been around boxing and boxers a long time. But he was more comfortable at Toots Shor’s than in Africa and the weirdness the scary boredom of the place started to get to him. Before long he and Cardoso were going out looking for “Bangi Bangi” (smokable hemp); Conrad who had never smoked anything stronger than unfiltered Camels was now getting stoned every morning.

Some writers attributed Ali’s win to his outsmarting Foreman even before the fight began by taking advantage of his popularity among the Zaireans. Ali had been greeted in Africa as a hero the man who had stood up to the American government at the height of the Vietnam War. He was a symbol of Black hope and independence. In fact Izenberg wrote “he turned George Foreman into a white man and I saw it happen.”

Ali’s longtime friend and business manager Gene Kilroy had flown over with the boxer and his entourage landing in Zaire at three o’clock in the morning. “It was pitch-black. And there were dancers and steel drums and a big platform and we came out of the plane and they were yelling out ‘Ali! Ali!’ And Ali said to me ‘Who don’t they like here?’ and I said ‘White people?’ and he said ‘Who else don’t they like here?’ And I said ‘Belgians.’ So they’re yelling ‘Ali’ and he put his fingers over his lips and everyone quieted. Ali said ‘George Foreman’s a Belgian!’ and that’s when they started yelling ‘Ali! Bomaye!’ So I asked our interpreter Kalinga ‘What’s bomaye?’ and he said ‘That means ‘Ali kill him’ in Swahili.’”

On top of that Foreman arrived in Zaire with his German shepherd Dago. “You know when the Belgians came after the Blacks” Kilroy remembers “they would come at them with those dogs. So here comes George Foreman off the plane with a German shepherd and I turned to Muhammad and said ‘Ali we’re home free now.’”

Threatened by Ali?

Ali’s incredible popularity among the Zaireans wasn’t a psychological burden only on Foreman—it also troubled Mobutu. Drew “Bundini” Brown Ali’s flamboyant friend and assistant trainer (after Angelo Dundee) had brought with him 200 T-shirts emblazoned with Ali’s face to sell at the event. Mobutu confiscated them. “They didn’t want any picture out there of Ali” Kilroy believes. “Mobutu’s picture by the way was everywhere—you couldn’t get away from him.” Even the fight posters showing Ali and Foreman carried an image of Mobutu right there alongside the two men. “The people loved Ali. If Ali had said ‘I want to run your country’ the people would have followed him. And that’s no kidding. Mobutu was a little leery of Ali.”

Despite having committed $10 million for the bout—$5 million for each fighter—and rounded up at least 50 or 60 street criminals and hanged them and touted the fight as a great victory for Zaire Mobutu didn’t even show up at ringside. Instead he watched it on closed-circuit TV in the safety of his presidential palace. Larry Merchant thought it was because Mobutu was afraid that if Ali lost the crowds would go wild and he would be killed. Kilroy thought that it was because if Ali won the crowd would go wild crown him leader of Zaire and Mobutu would be killed.

Thompson also failed to make it to the fight. Ralph Steadman Thompson’s friend sidekick and faithful illustrator showed up two days after Thompson and tried to check into the Intercontinental Hotel in Kinshasa only to find that his reservation had been canceled and there were no available rooms. Without a place to sleep he moved into Thompson’s hotel room. “Everyone would come knock knock on the door and a lot of them calling on the phone at all times of the day and the night asking for ‘medicine’” he says. “That’s what they called it. It was Mary Jane marijuana but they would knock and say ‘Hunter can we have some medicine?’”

Even the older guys were losing their grip. The weirdness of Zaire started to get to them and before long they were going out looking for “Bangi Bangi.”

Steadman must have noticed that Thompson didn’t attend the press conferences or any of the sparring sessions. By the weekend before the fight he had a feeling something wasn’t quite right. “It was late Saturday night and somehow I got a premonition and decided to ask Hunter about it. Excuse my language but his exact words were: ‘I’m not going to the fucking fight!’ He had given the tickets away!” Steadman couldn’t believe it. Rolling Stone had sent Thompson and was paying his expenses. Thompson worshipped Ali especially since they were both from Louisville Kentucky. Besides they’d come all the way to Zaire.

Ali landing a right on Foreman.

Whatever Thompson’s reason—his fear of crowds the fact that he was suffering from malaria the potency of the local hemp his belief that the Congolese across the river were going to launch an attack on Kinshasa—he let it be known that he planned to watch the event with Mobutu on closed-circuit TV safe in the presidential palace.

“But” recalled Steadman “that didn’t happen either.”

While everybody else was at the stadium watching the fight Thompson put a few beers and a bottle of Glenfiddich in a bucket of ice and placed it beside the hotel pool. “He still had this big bag the size of a pillow case half full of marijuana” Steadman recalled. “After all the late-night calls for ‘medicine’ there was still half the bag left and he dropped all that marijuana into the pool and then just stood there and watched it swirl down gradually to the filter. He was fixed on it like in a trance. And then he jumped in and just wallowed in it. That’s the precise word: ‘wallowed.’” Thompson lolled there drinking and smoking and “loving the whole meaningless nature of it.”

Steadman ended up seeing the fight the way millions of other sports fans saw it: on television.

Whatever Hunter Thompson’s reason—his fear of crowds the fact that he had malaria the potency of the local hemp his belief that the Congolese were planning to attack Kinshasa—he skipped the fight.

Even though all of Zaire appeared to be for Ali the betting odds were three-to-one against him. “We couldn’t see how it would be possible for Ali to win” Vic Ziegel of the New York Post remembered. “He can’t dance through those big punches of Foreman’s for 15 rounds.”

Izenberg was one of the writers who had picked Ali to win by knockout in the ninth round. “For everybody in the world there’s somebody out there” he recalls “and I thought that somewhere deep within Ali he said to himself ‘I’m the guy for this guy.’” And Izenberg knew that one of Ali’s great advantages was that he was a thinking boxer. He used his considerable intelligence in the ring. At the time Foreman didn’t.

“When you box and you miss a guy with a power punch it takes more out of you than if you hit him” says Izenberg. “You’re punching air. Every muscle everything is going with it. I think he hurt Ali in the first round. I thought he hit him right in the neck. He got to the ropes and he survived the fight. He’s talking to George all the time this is happening: ‘That’s the hardest you can hit? How do you think you can be a champion?’ and Foreman’s getting madder and madder because with Foreman it’s usually boom bang over that’s it.”

Dave Anderson recalled “There was one point and I can’t tell you the round—the fourth or fifth—when he hit Ali and you could tell Ali had really been hit. And then Foreman threw another punch and missed him. And I’ve always thought What would have happened if he had landed that second punch?”

Izenberg saw the moments when “all of a sudden Ali came off the ropes near the end of the eighth round just a couple of steps and he hit him with a short right hand. Ali was so smart. He said ‘I got this sucker. I know what I got to do. And I know just how I’m going to do it.’ And he hits him with a short choppy right then he hits him with a left and he moves him and he hits him again with a right-hand lead which is doing it backwards. And Foreman fell in sections. His ankles fell. Then his kneecaps fell. Then his thighs. He’s such a big man that he went down it was incredible. You could see it coming. It seemed like it took him an hour to fall.”

There’s a photograph of Plimpton and Mailer ringside on their feet wearing looks of sheer astonishment as Foreman fell. In The Fight Mailer describes what happened next: “Like a drunk hoping to get out of bed to go to work Foreman rolled over Foreman started the slow head-agonizing life of all the foundered bulk God somehow gave him and whether he heard the count or no was on his feet a fraction after the count of ten and whipped for when [the referee] Zack Clayton guided him with a hand at his back he walked in docile steps to his corner and did not resist.” His cornerman received him.

“Feel all right?”

“Yeah” said Foreman.

“Well don’t worry. It’s history now.”

The crowd went wild—it was probably just as well that Mobutu was safe in his presidential palace his gold-caged cats restlessly pacing outside. And that’s when the rains came—biblical rains monsoon rains torrential rains. Within minutes the boxers’ dressing rooms were under three feet of water. Just like the night Ali took the heavyweight title away from Sonny Liston back in ’64 and the heavens had opened up. It was over. The rain stopped and the sun came out. The two men had fought through the night. The interpretations alibis explanations analyses and assessments would now begin.

Ali watches as Foreman falls to the canvas following the knockout shot in the eighth round.

One of the most unusual was George Plimpton’s. Jacques the manager of the Intercontinental Hotel had told him that “the word around the Kinshasa betting circles was that Muhammad Ali had been to see the best féticheur in Kinshasa—indeed the same Pygmy that President Mobutu used—and that a considerable sum had been paid for the féticheur to cook up a hex against George Foreman.” Jacques explained to Plimpton that the spell would take the form of a succubus a “beautiful girl with slightly trembling hands” who would brush up against Foreman and grab his hand slowly sapping him of his powers. Plimpton discovered that the Zaireans had been placing small fetish bags of herbs under the boxing ring to affect the outcome of the fight.

Foreman himself would later recall two strange things about that night that he credited with his loss. First the last drink of water he was given before the fight had a strange medicinal taste and he felt it had been tampered with. Secondly in the fourth round he saw someone at ringside who unnerved him a friend of his who was rooting for Ali. “My hurt and disappointment … lessened whatever power I had left. And there wasn’t much of it. I wondered what had happened to my stamina let alone my strength” Foreman wrote in his autobiography By George.

But for Merchant the important thing was that the fight was “an astonishing event. If there were any skeptics still around about Ali as a fighter about Ali’s courage and will … all of that was erased” that night in Zaire.

“A Night of Poetic Justice”

Izenberg agrees: “It was a night of poetic justice.” After the ferocious downpour ended the sportswriters returned to their compound to “write it all down. After all that’s our job. It’s early in the morning. Eleven o’clock or something. And we go down to the river. Dave Anderson was there. A couple of others. There were about seven writers. The diehards. I don’t even know why we did it but we went down to the river and there he is. There was Muhammad staring into the Zaire River. And he’s all alone. Now this guy had just gone eight rounds won the biggest fight of his life far bigger than beating Liston because he didn’t know what he’d done when he beat Liston. He was just a kid a baby. But now he knew. And all we saw was his back. He had a black shirt on a long-sleeved shirt and he’s staring at the river and for one time in our lives seven sportswriters had to just shut the fuck up. We just stood there and watched him. Then he turns around and walks back and he says ‘You’ll never know what this night meant.’”

After his defeat Foreman fell into a blue funk that lasted two years. He fought that fight over again in his head a thousand times even dreamed about it but the outcome never changed.

“Foreman fell in sections. His ankles fell. Then his kneecaps fell. Then his thighs.... You could see it coming. It seemed like it took him an hour to fall.”

“I thought he was at that point in time unbalanced” Larry Merchant says. “He had lost all his bearing as a fighter and as a person. It haunted him. It took years and years for him to make peace with what had happened in Zaire. His fists had always been his answers to life so he was completely disoriented.” Then one night Foreman underwent a religious conversion that took place after a brutal 10 rounds with fighter Jimmy Young which sent Foreman to the hospital.

Izenberg was there in the dressing room after the fight. “He’d tried to baptize himself in the shower. He was dehydrated and hallucinating. At the hospital the doctors thought he might die. Then he started saying he found God. I said to somebody ‘He didn’t find God. Jimmy Young’s left hook found him.’ So he disappears and I don’t hear anything more about him. Then I see a photo in the paper in Marshall Texas. He’s got a bullhorn in one hand and a Bible in the other. He’s preaching in the street.”

Zaire Is Where “Ali Became … the Hero”

As for the writers Mailer would produce a masterpiece out of Zaire The Fight still in print today. After all a certain kind of writer has always been attracted to “the sweet science”—from Lord Byron to Arthur Conan Doyle to Jack London to Ernest Hemingway to Nelson Algren to Joyce Carol Oates. John Buffalo Mailer the youngest of Mailer’s nine children and now a playwright and actor recalls going to the Gramercy Gym since the age of four with his father and a posse of Mailer friends cousins and siblings.

“Boxing was the family sport. It’s about facing your demons your insecurities. A way to claim your manhood” John says one night in Santa Monica where his play Hello Herman is having its West Coast debut. It’s also a good metaphor for writing: “The getting up and slugging away at every page until you get the job done the stamina. I think there was a discipline to boxing that physicalized his mental discipline of writing.” Another thing Mailer loved was the moment after the fight when the two men hug. “After they’ve been through the battle they’re the only two who understand the experience. That’s why boxers are such sweet guys usually and why writers hang with each other.”

As for Hunter Thompson his stamina for writing declined. “After Africa” Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner told the film critic Roger Ebert “he just couldn’t write. He couldn’t put it together.” In failing health Thompson took his own life in 2005 at his home in Woody Creek Colorado. He was given an extravagant $3 million send-off that would have made Mobutu proud. The funeral was organized and funded by his pal Johnny Depp and Thompson’s ashes were shot from a cannon atop a 153-foot-tall tower crowned by a fist holding a peyote button.

George Plimpton went on to co-write two seminal oral biographies—one of the Andy Warhol It Girl Edie Sedgwick and one of Truman Capote—and a book on fireworks one of his passions. He wrote less often about sports after the Ali-Foreman fight. Plimpton died in Manhattan in 2003.

Dave Anderson who died in 2018 and was only the second sportswriter in history to win the Pulitzer Prize lamented “So much happened in Zaire. It’s where Ali became the giant killer the good guy the hero. It’s strange when you [saw] Ali his hands like you’d hold a bird when you were a little kid his face a kind of mask. With Ali out of the picture boxing has lost its thrill. The early 70s—today that looks like a golden era.”

George Foreman’s transformation would have seemed unimaginable 47 years ago. After becoming a lay preacher he became a lovable passionate pitchman for the George Foreman Grills and for a Web site for inventors. Foreman has come to love and respect his former adversary saying recently “He’s the greatest man I’ve ever known. Not the greatest boxer—that’s too small for him. He had a gift. He’s not ‘pretty’ he’s beautiful. Everything America should be Muhammad Ali is.”

In doing so we assert that any social scientific or historical investigation must be careful not to simply amplify the organization’s own historiography and institutional ethos as the WBG has been prolific in creating representations of its influence and work in the health sector. We highlight some of the limitations of each of these domains and consider how a careful use of source material may help address these limitations. As discussed above these domains are overlapping and the same forms of power may be at play across many of them – they are best seen as three categories for understanding the Bank’s discourse and actions with three different objects of study as their lenses. They represent a matrix through which researchers may study the WBG’s position in the evolving global health landscape the ways in which the Bank’s position on different global health concepts – like universal health coverage – have changed over time and how these changes have impacted health priorities and provision in the Global South.

Knowledge-based: shaping health policy knowledge

The first important object of study is the knowledge that the Bank produces about health policy and project implementation. Two of Moon’s [44] forms of power are central to understanding the WBG’s role here: expert or shaping “what others consider to be legitimate knowledge” and discursive or shaping “the language others use to conceptualize frame and thereby define and understand an issue.” The World Bank produces extensive research to help shape country-level health policy and global health initiatives through various means including through what is now known as the Development Research Group (DRG). In its 1998 World Development Report “Knowledge for Development” then-Bank President James Wolfensohn embraced the idea of the Bank as a “Knowledge Bank” in what Broad [9] has argued was a push to reassert the Bank’s legitimacy as its financial influence waned in the mid-1990s. The institution’s discursive and expert power can be seen in the ways that concepts and theories are put forward in the “technical” assistance the Bank provides. Such assistance takes the form of training and policy guidance and it goes hand in hand with both direct lending or participation in global health partnerships and debates in spaces of global health governance including working groups like the Inter-agency and Expert Group for Sustainable Development Goal Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) or events like the United Nations High-Level Meeting (UN HLM) on Universal Health Coverage.

There has been both continuity and change in the Bank’s concepts and theories that have gained purchase or have been rejected in these global governance spaces. For instance the Bank has consistently applied theories of human capital to the health sector since the 1970s; it linked the economic “stock” of healthy individuals to disease control and nutrition during Robert McNamara’s tenure as Bank President in the 1970s [61 78] doubled-down on human resources as a critical contributor to economic growth in the 1980s [5] and recently put forward the human capital index metric [35 66]. Yet its embrace of privatization has been much more punctuated. While the Bank’s 1975 Health Policy Paper and 1980 World Development Report warned against heavy emphasis on cost-benefit analysis user fees and private sector delivery health economists such as David de Ferranti advocated for a more pluralist mix of public insurance and voluntary sector funding in the early 1980s including user fees for public institutions [4 67]. Although user fees have been critiqued by some within the institution [13 33] this pluralistic approach has continued with the Bank’s advocacy of universal health coverage.

Social scientists have shown that while the Bank has made a deep impression on global health health economists and other experts at the Bank often work in coordination with other global health institutions or amplify longstanding health research. Since the 1980s scholars have reflected upon the Bank’s success in infusing languages (and underlying ideologies) of economics into international and global health [3 11 18 32 56]. Others have effectively shown how many of these concepts predated World Bank involvement in global health and that the Bank’s influence must be understood in a longer trajectory of health development [23 73]. Some argue that there has been a shift towards economic knowledge at the expense of other forms of reasoning at the Bank in ways that have marginalized rights-based discourse [58 59] and particular country-specific contexts [43 67] in its policies and program implementation. Further Walker (2019) has highlighted that the Bank’s emphasis on economic management in health has not necessarily been matched by a consistent application of economic tools to health project planning – pointing again to the importance of studying the Bank’s shifting and heterogeneous approaches and disconnects between discourse and practice.

This research domain sits within a larger scholarly conversation about how international organizations’ knowledge production is a key mode of producing and maintaining power in the global governance space. The Bank’s discursive and expert power in shaping economic political social and environmental knowledge extends far beyond its health work and scholars have shown how the Bank has leveraged these forms of power to set itself apart in the international development landscape. These include the Bank’s use of country-level policy and institutional benchmarks as a “governing tool” for asserting authority over both recipients and donors of Bank funds [57] and how the Bank as a “strategic knowledge institution” has promoted “smaller and better government” in its influential knowledge about good governance ([16]:118). Nay [46] shows how alongside the OECD the World Bank has played an institutional role in the “consolidation and perpetuation of the aid donors’ policy doctrine” here by producing knowledge about the concept of the “fragile state” and protecting the concept from “dissent” in the process.

With these cases in mind future social scientific research into the World Bank’s role in shaping policy knowledge and expertise about health should consider two main questions. First which actors are (and are not) involved in producing knowledge at the Bank? In other words whose research agenda drives the Bank-initiated production of knowledge? How involved are local scholars in the production of knowledge relative to more powerful Bank staff and “clients” (like major donors) and whose interests does evidence serve? Second how are the data so produced used? Do they guide health policy-making or are they used post-hoc to justify decisions already made? The latter questions focus on the functional use of estimates like the global burden of disease (GBD) and may be most relevant in the case of performance- or results-based financing as discussed further in the finance section below. This is particularly important because recent research has indicated that the metrics and tools put forward by the Bank are often not used to assess loans due to their irrelevance to complex political negotiations [19].

We recommend that scholars undertake country or programmatic case studies for this research domain. For instance how have in-country WBG officials leveraged global estimates of disease or advocated for local data collection on maternal and child health? Or how have different entities within the WBG defined the concept of “universal health coverage” [70] “right to health” [58] or “gender equality” [60]? What factors influence discourse around these concepts and what influence do they have on in-country population health and/or programmatic outcomes? Such case studies would further enable health development leaders in countries that receive Bank funding to contextualize health policy recommendations and advocate for more country-owned means of knowledge production and to highlight the ways that contextual knowledge can be used in health development policy. These case studies may be best accomplished through discourse analysis and qualitative thematic analysis of documents particularly of archival data at the WBG Archives partner nation archives and key informant interviews. In theory the World Bank could be a strong ally in this advocacy: a strength of the Bank’s country-based model is that it is uniquely placed to promote local capacity for development including championing the in-country production of health data over the use of estimated data [75].

Governance-based: shaping global health governance

Our second recommended research domain is the role of the WBG since the 1980s in changing the nature of health governance at the supranational national and sub-national levels. Here the two most important forms of power are institutional or the “use of rules and decision-making procedures to shape decision-making” and network or the use of “personal relationships with others to shape their thinking and/or action” ([44]:6–7). The Bank is institutionally different from other global health actors like UN agencies (including the WHO) philanthropic organizations and bilateral donors. It is an organization with member states whose votes matter more at the end of the day based on how much money they provide to the institution. Unlike the WHO UNICEF or other global health donors its point of contact on the country level are ministers of finance linking it more closely to those with the funds to back up its policy recommendations. With the diminishing influence of the WHO due to the freezing of its budgets and the rise of earmarked health funding [10 11] the Bank became one of the most important global health financiers in the 1980s although HNP financing has certainly fluctuated in the decades since. However like its insertion into the health policy knowledge world officials at the WBG have introduced new ways of staking a financial claim in the global health landscape. For instance in the push to increase investment from “billions to trillions” the WBG is positioning itself to de-risk private equity; new financing mechanisms include trust funds to finance outbreak response by channeling funding from reinsurance and bond markets [65] impact investments for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and IFC financing for health projects which now include specific budgetary allocations for blended finance [15].

Research is needed that situates the WBG’s influence relative to other global health actors and borrowing countries through two inter-related questions. First to what extent does the WBG’s financial power affect its power to influence health policy at the country level? This question considers the ways that the WBG has influenced countries’ health financing. It also highlights the WBG’s relationship with ministries of finance which is a privileged position in comparison to the WHO’s point of contact on the national level being ministries of health (e.g. [64]). Second it is important to investigate the ways that the WBG has supported both vertical and horizontal programming – through the IDA and the IBRD’s main modalities (project financing and associated policy advice) the IFC’s investments and the MIGA’s risk reduction for investment. That is in what ways has the organization supported attention to single-issue health interventions or vertical approaches like interventions into HIV/AIDS or malaria in comparison to its attention to overall health systems strengthening or horizontal approaches to health development? How has this impacted countries’ overall health system strengthening activities? To what extent has the IFC’s focus on the private sector constrained – or facilitated – the WBG’s ability to invest in primary health care?

To study these questions and situate the Bank within a complex web of global health partners we recommend three methodological approaches. A first approach is to perform network analysis to map the connections formed by the WBG and ministries of finance and health (or other high-ranking cabinet members). This would be best accomplished by performing interview-intensive or ethnographic case studies on the country level in countries that receive Bank funding. A second country-level approach focuses on the congruence between the Bank’s formal country investment plans and the health priorities voiced by client countries. For instance researchers could identify health priorities stated in Bank country-specific five-year action plans; analyze strategic health policy documents from the national government during this time period which are produced with Bank and WHO staff as well as other stakeholders; and perform interviews with national stakeholders and staff from the Bank and other major global health actors to understand the programs that were ultimately implemented during this time period. Such a document and interview-based methodology would allow for a more accurate understanding of how (and whether) the Bank met country and national priorities and what health areas were neglected.

The third approach is to investigate the Bank’s role in vertical health interventions by studying how silos form in global health. This approach could use case studies based on archival research and interviews at Bank headquarters of institutions that were part of the vertical intervention and a few countries that were beneficiaries of the intervention. It would use these case studies to analyze how funding decisions are made for particular health areas (including the evidence used most influential voices and decision-making structure). For example researchers could investigate how the silo for investing in HIV/AIDS interventions developed and why no such silo has developed for intervening on mental health. Focusing on the Bank’s relative role in this prioritization process would allow for a more nuanced understanding of how the Bank has promoted (or not promoted) what it itself calls “health system strengthening.” It could also provide insight into the Bank’s influence on silo formation relative to other major global health agencies or financiers.

Finance-based: shaping health financing mechanisms

Our final proposed research domain puts health financing at its center. The two of Moon’s [44] forms of global governance power that are most important here are economic or the “use of material resources” to shape action and thought and institutional which is described in the section above. While the Bank’s ideological approach to its health financing agenda has changed since it sanctioned direct lending in 1979 it has consistently retained economic power through the sheer quantity of its lending. During the late 1970s and in its 1980 World Development Report the Bank ideologically aligned with the basic needs approach and largely supported the primary health care movement championed by the Alma Ata Declaration [67]. From the early 1980s through the 1990s however concerns about the affordability of universal primary health care drove the WBG and UNICEF towards selective primary health care [12] and the Bank embraced market-based resource allocation through its Structural Adjustment Programs in an attempt secure it [6 52 67]. As part of the Structural Adjustment Program model the Bank embraced user fees at the point of service. The user fee debate has been covered well through case studies which may be best summarized as pointing to their “sustainable inequity” [48] or enabling of some service provision at the deep expense of equitable access (e.g. [21]). Robert and Ridde’s (2013) documentary analysis indicates that the majority of global health actors surveyed from 2005 to 2011 favored either the abolition of user fees or free care at the point of delivery with the Bank as the only actor that still favored both user fees and free care at the point of service.

As it prepared its health financing agenda for the new millennium the WBG’s Operations Evaluation Department (the predecessor to the IEG) argued that “despite an initial focus on government health services the Bank is increasingly focusing on issues of private and nongovernmental organization (NGO) service delivery insurance and regulation” and stated that clients viewed it as a powerful actor for donor coordination [31]. Indeed since 2000 IBRD and IDA have shifted their language toward increasing public expenditure in health and attention to health systems strengthening [68] although the relative growth of the Bank’s trust fund financing for public-private partnerships compared to its core health sector lending indicates that this shift may be somewhat rhetorical [64]. The Bank’s embrace of health system strengthening and UHC have been complicated by the relative rise in power of the IFC and the WBG’s recent renewed interest in insurance as a means to secure universal health coveragee. The relative percentage of health and education within the IFC’s portfolio for instance rose from 2 % in 2007 to 8 % in 2015 and it has championed private health sector commitments for diagnostic chains health insurers information technology and medical education [28]. In 2014 the HNP Global Practice was launched to accelerate progress towards UHC and to build on the WBG’s 2013 Corporate Strategy of “One World Bank Group” embracing public and private solutions. However as pointed -out by the Independent Evaluation Group [29] collaboration between the IBRD/IDA and the IFC may be more rhetoric than reality with a single Global Lead for Harnessing the Private Sector leading coordination activities. The contrast between the WBG’s stated support of UHC and the rise of IFC’s privatized investments in health has attracted surprisingly little scholarly attention.

How have researchers unpacked the financing mechanisms that fuel these financing ideologies? The World Bank’s unique position in the terrain of financial governance because of the size of its health lending portfolio cannot be overstated. Core World Bank funding for the health sector (HNP programs) totaled approximately $17.5 billion from 1985 to 2000 and $60.9 billion from 2000 to 2015 [78]. As Sridhar et al. [64] have documented the theme allocation for HNP funding has changed significantly over time with the largest portion (44%) targeted to reproductive maternal and child health from 1985 to 2000 and the largest portion (34%) going to budgetary support by 2000–2015. Yet the Bank’s reported HNP data is only the “tip of the iceberg” in terms of its involvement in financing mechanisms for projects that impact health.

At least three additional factors contribute to the WBG’s influence on health financing. First regional and global trust funds for health activities have proliferated as financing mechanisms since the 1990s and are largely not captured by HNP financing data. A few studies have analyzed the reasons for the proliferation of trust funds in the 1980s and 1990s especially related to geopolitical forces at the United Nations in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g. [17 72]). However comprehensive thematic analyses of trust funds held at the Bank particularly financial intermediary funds (modalities used to support Global Partnership Programs) and IFC trust funds have not been undertaken. The IEG’s [29] report quantified health sector support to IFC and IBRD/IDA trust funds – which by 2016 supported approximately 29% of all health services projects – but did not perform a deep analysis of financial intermediary funds. These funds are typically used to support national or global public goods often in collaboration with specialized United Nations agencies (particularly the WHO and UNICEF). The Bank is not a passive ""banker"" for most of these Global Partnership Programs [64]. For instance as of 2016 the World Bank Group was represented at the governing body of twenty-two of the twenty-five existing Global Partnership Programs. This has provided the Bank with a distinct influential network of high-level national and international stakeholders [29].

Second the Bank also exerts economic power on the global health agenda through projects that are not technically in the health sector. As examples many HNP projects and trust funds are targeted at humanitarian and sanitation projects in post-conflict states and some long-standing trust funds such as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and the Cities Alliance fund support activities related to food security and slum upgrading [30]. Third health projects can serve as a vehicle for building relationships with the Bank and ""leapfrogging"" into wider lending arrangements (e.g. [34]).

To further unpack the Bank’s economic power and financial influence we identify three main research questions: (1) in what ways has the WBG influenced the way that the “public” and the “private” are conceived in global health (2) to what extent and through what vehicles has it embraced a “selective” approach to primary health care and (3) what types of influence has it exerted through its trust fund infrastructure such as through performance-based financing and its financing of Global Partnership Programs?

The first question can be approached by “following the money.” How much money is allocated to states and the private sector in a country portfolio in a given number of years based on official project and disbursal reports? The Global Health Governance Programme has analyzed Bank financing including trust funds by the IBRD and the IDA for health themes (e.g. [53 68]; Winters et al. 2017 [64]) but scholars have not compared IFC IBRD and IDA country loans and grants in a health-specific context. This comparison of private health investments across the WBG should be investigated with special focus on any associated redistribution of social benefits especially at the national level. Tracking country investments may require archival or document-based research and interviews in member states as the Bank’s main modality is a government loan or grant which may lack full transparency in disbursal reports. It can also be approached by studying the ideological underpinnings of privatization across the Bank. For instance researchers could track the way that states and the market have been discussed by Bank employees and how this has changed over time through oral histories and document analysis. Has the market-orientation of the Bank’s involvement in health in the 1980s and through its 1993 World Development Report been replaced with other conceptualizations of health equity and how do these new visions position health within the Bank’s larger development agenda? Finally research on privatization should focus on the presence or absence of policy coherence between different Bank entities especially between the IBRD the IDA and the IFC.

The second question builds on Structural Adjustment Programs and the Bank’s lack of buy-in to the primary health care movement. This area requires a deeper investigation of the links between UNICEF and the World Bank which have often been closer than the Bank and the WHO (e.g. [76]). In this context ""following the money"" may be complicated due to low transparency of early trust funds at the Bank [79]. A document-based analysis of the Special Grants Program and Development Grant Facility including financial records and memoranda from the WBG Archives may be most effective. This research could be supplemented with oral histories and interview-based methods with both World Bank staff and national staff involved in collaborative global programs.

For the third question it would be productive to perform deeper analyses of the Bank’s performance- and results-based financing programs and Global Partnership Programs. Results-based financing has been used by the Bank over the last twenty years incentivize performance and improve efficiency of service delivery in LMICs [51]. The Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) launched in 2007 and closed for fundraising in 2017 was designed to build and share an evidence base from results-based financing in the health sector and represents the Bank’s newer model of coupling country grants with IDA lending. It has been replaced by the heavily-funded Global Financing Facility in Support of Every Woman Every Child (GFF) which incorporates a similar model of ""catalytic aid"" [27 29]. To critically approach the HRITF and GFF and understand the diffusion of performance-based financing at the global level it may be helpful to begin with critical discourse and documentary analyses. Taking Gautier and Ridde's [20] and Robert and Ridde's [55] analyses of user fee favorability and HRITF politicized evidence respectively as examples sources for this research could include public documents from official websites (both the Bank and participating governments). For projects with Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) available researchers could use Malik and Stone’s [40] coding system to further understand private actors’ potential influence over project evaluation and enforcement of conditionality.

Analyzing the complex influence that the World Bank exerts relative to other global health actors through performance-based financing and Global Partnership Programs may require deeper access to its experts. This can be provided through ethnographic approaches and oral histories such as those conducted by Lie [39] on the World Bank-Uganda partnership. Ethnographies may be most appropriate to disentangle the Bank’s collaborations with the IFC (including at a country level) its financial relationships with ‘clients’ within country portfolios and its influence – and role as a broker – on financial intermediary fund boards.",,,,,,

""Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier."" It's a famous quote admired by Steve Ballmer the former Microsoft CEO turned pro sports owner. ""Colin Powell taught us that"" said Ballmer in a sit-down interview with CNBC. Powell's words relate perfectly to Ballmer's new mission: taking a more significant piece of revenue in the basketball and entertainment market in Los Angeles. On Friday Ballmer broke ground on his new $1.2 billion arena the Intuit Dome. The 18000-seat complex will be vital in helping the Clippers capture underserved sports fans in Los Angeles. Ballmer labels them the ""grinders"" of the city a term used to describe working-class sports fans. Before discussing specifics around the Intuit Dome Ballmer reflected on his time in his post-retirement role as a professional sports owner. Here's what he said he learned about owning the Clippers and how it relates to his business past. It starts with Powell the former Secretary of State under President George W. Bush's administration.

Ballmer's optimism comes through

Ballmer 65 entered a conference room at the Clippers downtown LA office having conducted over four interviews with more on his schedule. The discussion with CNBC lasted a little over 15 minutes covering various topics from the arena and his previous life in business. Powell's words helped explain the optimism around Ballmer's vision for the Clippers starting with the Intuit Dome. ""You have to be optimistic to take on a huge project when you don't start with land"" Ballmer said. ""Putting the land together is quite the circus of legal issues resolutions. We had to buy the Forum as part of that process. You have to keep your optimism."" Ballmer was referring to the $400 million in cash he paid Madison Square Garden Company the previous owner of the Forum. The Lakers played there from 1967-1999 and the building mainly hosts concerts today. Ballmer needed to resolve legal issues with MSG who complained Ballmer's new arena would damage the Forum's income. MSG purchased the Forum for $23.5 million in 2012 and cashed out in 2020 thanks to Ballmer. The Clippers owner also paid the town of Inglewood $66.2 million for the land where Intuit Dome will sit. The Clippers will get some of that back though. Intuit the software company that makes Turbo Tax will pay the team more than $500 million for a 23-year naming rights slot. That deal only enhanced Ballmer's optimism. ""This stadium is about being optimistic about our team"" Ballmer said. ""It's about being optimistic about our fans. Get in the building pump up make energy"" Ballmer added clapping his hands. ""Your energy can feed our team to greater success."" He then laughed when discussing the ""weird small world"" and a key relationship that probably helped land the Clippers a record naming rights agreement. Ballmer flashed back to 1977 when he worked at Procter and Gamble . The person in charge of helping him settle in was Scott Cook who later co-founded Intuit. Asked about one of the lessons he learned at P&G that he stills using today as an NBA owner Ballmer said: ""It's good to make consistent long-term bets. We took that to a whole other level at Microsoft.""

Getting it right

Ballmer's history as CEO of Microsoft had mixed results. But while some will point out that Microsoft missed key tech breakthroughs like the modern smartphone and the search engine Ballmer did help triple Microsoft's sales during his 14-year run as CEO. When discussing his time at Microsoft Ballmer noted the long-term bets made which positioned the company for its current $2.2 trillion market cap. ""There's a reason why Microsoft is the second most valuable company in the world"" Ballmer said. ""We got Windows and Office right. We got our back-end technology right with servers. We got Xbox right and I got my replacement [Satya Nadella] right. Succession is a huge part of it and I left my successor with the infrastructure to go build a cloud business."" Ballmer's optimism shifted back to Intuit Dome comparing the arena's construction to the birth of Apple's top product. ""When I think about this product – our new building – in a way I do liken it to the way Apple thought about the phone"" Ballmer said. ""They didn't try to design the cheapest phone. They didn't go in saying 'Let's build a cheap product because it might sell a higher volume at a lower price.' ""They came in with a premium approach"" he added. ""They came in thinking of new ways to do things. That's what we're doing here. This is a premium building and our fans aren't going to suffer for that.""

Inside Ballmer's newest asset

Throughout sports teams are bracing for a new way to leverage their product especially after pandemic losses. Premium experiences never hurt and the Intuit Dome will offer a one-of-a-kind experience in the NBA. The 18000-seat arena will feature 44000-square feet of LED lights for its halo-shaped video board plus technology that allows fans to purchase concessions and automatically be charged without using cash or cards. In addition the Clippers will leverage four courtside cabanas a concept Ballmer borrowed from the National Football League. ""We're pioneering the feel of end-zone suites"" said Ballmer of the luxury offering. The Intuit Dome will not host hockey games so the building has ""basketball geometry"" meaning it was built specifically to watch basketball games. The Clippers business operations will relocate to the Intuit Dome and the team will also house their practice facility in the arena. The Clippers estimate the Intuit Dome will generate roughly $260 million in annual economic activity for Inglewood including over 7000 full-time and part-time jobs. The Clippers also committed to a $100 million community benefits package. ""It's a big market"" Ballmer said. ""There's plenty of fans that can be fans of the Clippers and Lakers. But we want to tell you who we are. I think there are many folks in LA who identify with this notion of being the underdog the person who strides. It's almost two LA's. It's not all showtime and movie business. Our fans are grinders."" ""I'm optimistic about our team"" added Ballmer. ""I'm optimistic about our team success and that optimism is a force multiplier. In many ways the reason we did this is consistent with that optimism as a force multiplier approach.""

The 18000-seat Intuit Dome is slated to be ready in time for the 2024-25 season.

The team announced an arena-naming agreement with Intuit on Friday without revealing the terms of the deal. CNBC reported it is a 23-year pact worth more than $500m (£364m).

The Los Angeles Times and Sportico pegged the price tag of the arena's construction at $1.8 billion (£1.3b) while ESPN reported it as more than $2 billion (£1.45b).

Clippers owner Steve Ballmer told ESPN regarding the need for the team to have its own home ""We needed to say We're our own guys. We don't play in the same place as the other guys. We're going to have our own identity.'

Last season the Clippers reached the Western Conference finals for the first time in their history losing to the Phoenix Suns 4-2 after star Kawhi Leonard got hurt earlier in the postseason.

Ballmer hopes for bigger and better things at the Intuit Dome which he told ESPN will have more legroom and more toilets than any other NBA arena and where all concession orders will be placed online.

""I feed off of the energy in the building"" Ballmer said. ""But people go away and they get late to games or they don't get back from halftime.

Filgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor drug used to prevent or treat chemotherapy induced neutropenia (lower-than-normal levels of white blood cells).

Investigators conducted a retrospective study of 65372 episodes of filgrastim use from 2014 to 2019 among commercially covered women and men in health care settings across the United States. They sought to evaluate potential savings for use of Zarxio tbo-filgrastim (Granix) and the reference product. Granix is approved in the European Union as a biosimilar but in the United States it is considered a version of filgrastim because its approval did not come through the biosimilar pathway.

Median costs were higher in the outpatient hospital setting compared with the office setting for all 3 filgrastim products the authors wrote in The American Journal of Managed Care® (Table). Additionally after results were adjusted for patient characteristics and geography the investigators found cost savings associated with the biosimilar filgrastim “were limited to the office setting with no savings in the outpatient hospital setting.”

The authors defined an episode as 1 or more filgrastim administrations and fewer than 7 days between administrations. Median costs were adjusted for patient characteristics and geographic differences. The cost of administration was defined as the “sum of out-of-pocket and health plan paid amounts for the drug per date of service.”

In the office setting the median costs of the biosimilar filgrastim administration and tbo-filgrastim administration were $103.61 and $94.07 less than that of reference product administration respectively the investigators said.

There were no cost savings associated with use of the biosimilar in the outpatient hospital setting. The adjusted median cost of biosimilar administration was greater than reference product administration by $20.50 in this setting. In contrast the cost of tbo-filgrastim administration in the outpatient hospital setting was $132.90 less than a reference product administration.

Although previous analyses have found lower costs for the biosimilar filgrastim than for reference filgrastim the authors concluded their data suggest that “site of care can change this calculus reducing savings.”

One possible contributing factor they suggested is the difference in payer payments for outpatient- vs office-based treatment.

""Although patients receive identical drug administrations in office or hospital outpatient settings insurers generally reimburse higher payments to outpatient hospital settings to cover presumed greater overhead costs"" they wrote.

The authors said that despite their findings being limited to commercially covered patients the results suggest that “savings from biosimilar drugs are context specific” although they said it is unknown whether the cost savings for other biosimilar drugs vary similarly by site of care.

“Biosimilars—drugs that are similar in quality safety and efficacy to reference biologic drugs—are intended to increase competition reduce prices and improve patient access to important treatments” they said. They did not speculate on why in the outpatient hospital setting the cost of Zarxio administration was slightly higher on average than reference product administration.

They also did not speculate on why tbo-filgrastim was significantly less costly than reference filgrastim in both the outpatient and office settings but not the biosimilar filgrastim. In addition to Neupogen Zarxio and Granix another filgrastim product is available the biosimilar Nivestym. This was approved and launched in late 2018 which was midway through the study period. Investigators did not review cost data for Nivestym.

Granix was approved in August 2012 and launched in November 2013 and Zarxio in March 2015 and September 2015 respectively.

Bryn Cader Faner stone circle Harlech

This is one of the most spectacular stone circles in Britain but very few people venture up here. It’s actually a burial cairn of a Druid Prince more than 4000 years old. The stones sit proud like a crown of thorns on an ancient trackway that once linked Wales to England lined with more standing stones and cairns. There are also many tarns to explore and bathe in. Llyn Eiddew-bach is my favourite with a cliff for jumping and tracks leading up the mountainside to Moel Ysgyfarnogod or Bare Hill of Hares where incredible views open out over Cardigan Bay.

North Wales once roofed the world and the fascinating remains of hundreds of years of underground industry can still be found if you know where to look. On a spectacular mountain plateau overlooking Llyn Cwmorthin this old mine is most famous for its incline railway and tunnel that pierces through the mountainside visible from miles around.

But this week the new House of Marc Jacobs makes history as the first to launch with the express blessing of the high-fashion designer it was named for.

""It's no longer just a brand it's a house"" Jamari Amour founder of ballroom's House of Marc Jacobs wrote to Instagram Friday. ""Welcome to the Irresistible House of Marc Jacobs.""

According to Amour the house has the blessing of Jacobs himself. Jacobs also has commented on each post about the house's launch writing on one post ""I am honored."" He also posted the announcement of the house's start onto Instagram Stories.

Amour is known to viewers of Legendary as the father of the House of Balmain which won the show's first season. Having started voguing in 2008 the performer has played a significant role in the L.A. ballroom scene. He helped to launch the West Coast chapter of the House of Balmain and presided over it as West Coast father until recently breaking off to form the House of Marc Jacobs. In addition he's performed as a professional dancer for a variety of high-profile gigs including dancing on Lip Sync Battle appearing in Sam Smith's ""Promises"" video and even dancing for the likes of Christina Aguilera and more.

The new house has launched with other former members of the house of Balmain including Gravity who appeared on Legendary.

The house's launch comes as a new generation of houses is emerging within ballroom. Over the past few years other houses like the House of West Gorgeous House of Gucci House of O'Ricci House of Alpha Omega and the House of Moncler have all debuted. Earlier this year Legendary host Dashaun Wesley debuted the House of Basquiat on the show's finale and has been debuting house members as the months go by. They have included Legendary cast members like Carlos formerly of the House of Lanvin as well as Pretty who was a part of the House of Saint Laurent on the series.

In addition it comes as ballroom is in the forefront now more than ever. In 2020 ballroom's Xclusive House of Lanvin teamed up with the namesake fashion brand for a first-ever collaboration. Members of the community have also appeared in ads for fashion brands like Coach as well as Dolce & Gabbana.

Jacobs himself isn't new to the scene. According to a post on Instagram from April in September 1988 he walked a House of Field ball alongside stylist Elizabeth Saltzman.

""One of the most liberating and exhilarating experiences of my life"" he wrote. According to him Angie Xtravaganza then-mother of the House of Xtravaganza named him an honorary member as a result.

That ball is depicted in the documentary Love Is In the Legend which has its world premiere Sunday in New York City.

The custom look comes from Indigenous-owned women-led size-inclusive brand Lesley Hampton which Jacobs was sure to call out in her Instagram Stories — after all we're sure this won't be the last you hear of the label. It's founded with a focus on mental health and promises inclusiveness for customers everywhere.

Devery took her positive fashion influence further by choosing make-you-look-twice earrings from Indi City which is also an Indigenous fashion brand that proudly crafts pieces inspired by the ancestral connection to the land. Jacobs's choice in jewelry was the shop's bestseller the Medicine Florals which come with big acrylic charms that drop to the chest and are actually super lightweight despite their size.

Jacobs rushed for two touchdowns but only 34 yards on 10 carries in the Raiders' 33-27 overtime win over the Baltimore Ravens on Monday night.

Raiders coach Jon Gruden said Peyton Barber who signed with Las Vegas on Sept. 4 would get Jacobs' reps with veteran Kenyan Drake remaining in the team's game plan as a pass-catcher out of the backfield.

""We really like Barber. We think he's a heck of a back"" Gruden said. ""I like the way he runs and catches and picks up blitzes. We're excited about this opportunity to see what we have.""

Barber 27 rushed for 258 yards and four touchdowns on 94 carries in 16 games -- including two starts -- for Washington last season. He had a career-best 871 rushing yards in 16 starts for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2018.

Jacobs meanwhile has a pair of 1000-yard rushing seasons in his first two NFL campaigns but has yet to play a full season because of injury. He missed three games as a rookie when he rushed for 1150 yards and seven touchdowns and averaged 4.8 yards per carry. He missed one game last season when his yards-per-carry average dropped to 3.9 while he ran for 1065 yards and 12 touchdowns.

Last week Jacobs said his practice workload would be reduced to keep him fresh for games."

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3QtZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvai1hbGFuLWplcnJ5LWpvaG5zb24tb2JpdHVhcnktcGl0dHNidXJnaC9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjQwNTEyMDA5MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: J.

Luzardo struggled to a 6.58 ERA over his first five starts and 26 innings before a mild left flexor strain (initially diagnosed as elbow tightness) sent him to the IL so the three-week layoff between starts can hopefully set as a refresh of a tough season to date for the 26-year-old. The returns of Luzardo and Braxton Garrett this weekend will help the injury-riddled Marlins rotation though Edward Cabrera has now also gone down with a shoulder impingement.

Beyond the immediate help that Luzardo will bring to Miami’s pitching staff today’s start figures to reignite the trade rumors that have swirled around the left-hander for months. If Luzardo recaptures his 2021-22 form he would be a very hot commodity at the trade deadline as he is arbitration-controlled through the 2026 season. The Luis Arraez trade has already signaled that the Marlins are in sell mode but while the team pulled the trigger early on that deal Luzardo’s suitors will want to see a larger sample size of healthy and productive starts before moving what would have to be a very substantial trade package to pry him away from Miami.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Chicago City Council is moving forward with Mayor Brandon Johnson's plan to borrow more than a billion dollars to fund an array of economic programs.

The massive 37-year borrowing plan relies on winding down the city's dependency on the controversial tax-increment financing program also know as TIF. I has has been long been criticized as a patchwork and politically based system for funding construction projects around the city.

When a TIF district expires the tax revenues it holds are released back to the city school system and other local governments that levy property taxes in the area.

Officials say they will let enough special taxing districts expire to generate the money needed to repay the debt. But wary financial analysts TIF experts and even some alderpeople have warned that the city will get access to those recurring revenues only if city officials let the districts expire on schedule - which would be a sharp departure from the city's past practice.

Here’s everything you need to know about the final day of Summerfest which includes Guns N' Roses The Flaming Lips Lunay Shiela E and more. Plus here's how you can get in for free today from noon to 7 p.m.

(If you’re looking for the complete 2021 Summerfest daily schedules you can find them here.)

Today at American Family Insurance Amphitheater: Guns N' Roses 7:30 p.m.

For a long time if you saw a Guns N' Roses concert you were watching a band that bared little resemblance to the Guns N' Roses you remembered. That's changed thankfully: Guns N’ Roses have been touring with something resembling the band’s classic lineup. After years of touring with ringers Axl Rose reunited with Slash and Duff McKagan for a huge and lucrative tour in 2016 and they've kept that momentum going on subsequent tours.

Justin Barney’s From The Music Desk Pick: The Flaming Lips @ Generac Power Stage 9:45 p.m.

When I was in high school I went to someone older and wiser than me and I asked “What band puts on the best live show.” The answer was quick and unequivocal “The Flaming Lips.” They happened to be playing Summerfest later that month. But I worked as a dishwasher at The Steakout in Greenfield. My boss let me go early and I showed up in my grimy dish shoes and back-of-house whites smelling like garbage and old fries. That night they started the show by blasting confetti cannons. Wayne Coyne brought out a pair of hands that were half the size of himself that shot lasers into the audience. He rolled out over us in the bubble ball. That old head that I talked to was right. And I haven't missed a Flaming Lips show in MKE since.

Kenny Perez picks: Lunay @ Miller Lite Oasis 10 p.m.

Reggaeton is a Latin music genre that is setting the world a blaze. Streaming numbers for the top Latin acts are well into the hundreds of millions and Lunay is no exception. At the young age of 20 Lunay has garnered the respect of the elder Reggaeton class. Saturday he will be the first ever Reggaeton act to headline the Miller Lite Oasis. Also on the stage is the Milwaukee duo Gego Y Nony Browns Crews and me playing the break. What a way to close out Summerfest; I cannot wait.

Tarik Moody picks: Shiela E @ Johnson Controls World Sound Stage 8 p.m.

Besides having a crush on Sheila since I was in middle school Sheila E is a force to be reckoned with. When I first saw her perform I wanted to learn to play drums. Not only she is a world-class percussionist she collaborated with Prince on one of my favorite songs “The Glamorous Life.”

Milwaukee's first Summerfest with a three-weekend format (but not the last) called it a wrap Saturday night but not before some of the music festival's brightest moments.

Black Pumas

Being a relatively new but celebrated artist can cut two ways with a lengthy disruption like a global pandemic.

The Black Pumas fit both those bills releasing their lauded debut album in the middle of 2019 and being nominated for a best new artist album at the 2020 Grammy Awards — just two months before the world ground to a halt.

A year and a half later the soul and R&B duo of singer Eric Burton and guitarist Adrian Quesada were onstage at the BMO Harris Pavilion on the closing night of a delayed Summerfest 2021. With a large and eager crowd filling most of the amphitheater’s seats the Black Pumas wasted no moments making up for lost time.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

Emerging from the stage’s smoky wings Burton stood at the front of the stage to offer a toast before his stunningly soulful vocals pierced the night on the sultry groove of “Next to You.”

“Swing with me Milwaukee!” he exclaimed. “I see you swaying. Let’s sway all night.”

Part hype man mostly soul man Burton ran to the edge of the stage to elicit screams. On “Old Man” he counted off a side-to-side shuffle that the crowd followed while Queseda picked out the syncopated melody which morphed into a bossa nova two-step.

Two backing vocalists and three musicians added depth to The Black Puma’s already lush vibe. Soon Burton hopped down into the pit and wandered into the crowd as he sang “I want to kick it with you. It’s been far too long!”

Indeed. Milwaukee will be ready to kick it with the Black Pumas anytime.

Scotty McCreery

Ten years ago after auditioning right here in Milwaukee Scotty McCreery won “American Idol” with a deep country voice that recalled the tone and style of Randy Travis. It was an exciting moment for fans of that already classic throwback country sound.

But when you win “Idol” pop sounds call and McCreery did well charting hit singles that largely followed the modern country blueprint. They were successful but never artistically matched McCreery’s promise.

A decade — and a new record label — later and McCreery has found his way back to a sound and ethos closer to the great ""hat"" acts of the 1980s and '90s albeit with a backward-slung baseball hat in place of the cowboy style on his now-goateed babyface.

His headlining set Saturday night at the Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard proved it is a perfect fit.

On “Same Truck” the title track of his new album McCreery strummed an acoustic guitar in front of his talented five-piece band and sang an ode to unity regardless of our diverse backgrounds.

Tracks from 2018’s “Seasons Change” followed a similar path. On “Wherever You Are” McCreery longed for a distant love who is never far away over a brightly rumbling melody.

“We’re in Milwaukee tonight baby!” he yelled. “We’re here together let’s do it!”

A pedal steel moaned over the balance of “holy water and Jim Beam” on “In Between” as McCreery beamed at the crowd. It was a look of an artist who’s gone full circle and found his way home.

— Erik Ernst

Flaming Lips

Dual drummers in green wigs frontman Wayne Coyne in a bubble and screen full of multicolor digital art — that’s a Flaming Lips show.

After a few technical difficulties Saturday night on the Generac Power Stage Coyne gingerly walked out and then jumped into his customary plastic bubble. He followed with a short discourse on the adverse effects that COVID-19 has had on his hometown of Oklahoma City.

But the psychedelic rockers still managed to pull off a magnetic performance. “All We Have Is Now” and “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Part 1” complete with a giant robot set the tone for the mostly relaxed set.

The only real drawback was Coyne having to sometimes pull applause out of the crowd ordering them to “keep screaming” and yelling “It’s Saturday night!” To be fair he was in a bubble; he couldn’t hear anything (a fact he eventually copped to later in the show).

The Flaming Lips were a great ending to Summerfest. The band left everyone elated instead of amped up — the perfect amount of chill for a cool night in September.

Sheila E.

“The Queen of Percussion” (and my '80s crush) Sheila E. filled the Johnson Controls World Sound Stage to the brim. The band was all dressed to par in white the drummer being one of our own from Milwaukee.

Beginning with a cover of the Beatles' “Come Together” Sheila showed her range as a singer before furiously going to to town on her small percussion set at the center of the stage. Later she walked around with the cymbal still on the stand banging it in succession with the band.

The most memorable piece of the show had to be the band solos when Sheila was unafraid to let her band shine. What followed was Sheila drinking wine and using the bottle as an instrument to segue into more jams.

Then there were her solos. You can feel the passion (and the Prince) in her drumming and guitar playing.

Cam

From the sound bleed from other stages to loud chatter from beer-swilling fans Summerfest is not the finest format to really soak in lyrical craftsmanship. Actually in terms of live music options in Milwaukee it may be the very worst.

But once in a rare while there’ll be a songwriter who's so stupendous and an audience that's so in tune that every single heartwrenching or heart-soaring word is given the respect it deserves.

Saturday afternoon at the Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard country artist Cam was that songwriter. And her set was magic.

Cam isn’t exactly an unknown entity; her tragic lovers’ ballad “Burning House” in 2015 was a minor sensation on Music Row. But while great female county singer-songwriters like Kacey Musgraves Maren Morris and Ashley McBryde have become big stars since that time that hasn’t quite happened for Cam.

And yet Cam’s 2020 album “The Otherside” may be an even stronger showcase for her songwriting than her big-label debut.

“When it's quiet I'm quietly sayin' your name/In the silence you're silently hidin' away” Cam sings on “Forgetting You” about a former lovers’ memory that continues to haunt her even as she’s with someone else.

“Our little house feels big and empty/Just me and my shadow here all alone” she sings on “What Goodbye Means” about being on the verge of divorce from a lover you still love. “And I try to keep it the way you left it/Just in case you decide to come home.”

Cam sang these songs Saturday afternoon at Summerfest for a good-sized crowd — consisting of passionate fans and clearly many new listeners — who hung on to every word. And that attentiveness seemed to matter more to her than anything else.

Poi Dog Pondering

Summerfest has been applauded and derided for the something-for-everyone approach implicit in its annual lineup of bands but Poi Dog Pondering exemplified that approach very pleasantly when it played the UScellular Connection Stage Saturday afternoon.

Running a baker’s-dozen lineup including a violinist a percussionist and a couple of horn players (who sometimes played other instruments) Poi Dog Pondering capably switched from an electronic Salt-N-Pepa beat to a folksy simplicity a la John Prine as backed by a tiki-bar band.

The guider rather than the stern leader was constant member Frank Orrall whose breezy enthusiasm smoothed over the tone and genre shifts. After decades of personnel and style changes Orrall actually has created enough PDP music to give something to everyone.

— Jon M. Gilbertson Special to the Journal Sentinel

Thurston Moore

Although the three men who got onto the Generac Power Stage Saturday night were powerful and of course were a trio they were not quite a power trio. Because Thurston Moore the guitarist singer and overseer of the trio has spent decades as a contrarian of rock ’n’ roll expectations.

The drummer Steve Shelley was Moore’s familiar from Sonic Youth a pioneering modern-rock band whose echoes could be heard whenever Moore turned to his amps and got the feedback mojo rolling or found several different intriguing angles on a single chord.

If songs like “Psychic Hearts” deliberately did not deliver traditional rock satisfactions they did have punk feeling and intelligent musicality and Moore’s singing wasn’t far from Lou Reed’s strangely affecting flatness. At 63 he remains creatively spry.

— Jon M. Gilbertson

Turkuaz featuring Jerry Harrison and Adrian Belew

Milwaukee native Jerry Harrison didn’t return to a hometown stage — Summerfest's UScellular Connection Stage — for just any Saturday night thing.

No Harrison was there with Adrian Belew with whom he said he last shared a venue circa 1981 when both were part of Talking Heads albeit with different standings.

They were accompanied by Brooklyn ensemble Turkuaz whose spiky funkiness synced nervily with a revisiting of the 1980 Talking Heads album “Remain in Light” a New Wave outlier. Harrison handled keyboards and rhythm guitar while Belew played six-string solos with the peculiar sense of being a virtuoso who was paradoxically still learning the basics.

Belew and Harrison also revisited the 1979 Talking Heads album “Fear of Music” with Turkuaz brassily expanding songs like “Cities” along with “Remain in Light” songs like “Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)” and the 1977 favorite “Psycho Killer.”

Sure nobody could entirely capture original Heads bandleader David Byrne’s amiably edgy nerdiness but everybody had fun trying.

First spotted by pseudonymous analyst Bit Harington the bullish setup drew its inspirations from Bitcoin’s spectacular bull runs every time after halvings which is when the miner block reward gets cut in half. Analysts perceive the halving as a bullish event which reduced the supply of newly mined BTC.

Harington reminded that Bitcoin’s prices surged by more than 600% after the first two halving events in 2012 and 2016 when measured from a so-called resistance/support (R/S) line as shown in the chart below.

Bitcoin price performance after the first two halving events. Source: BuyBitcoinWorldWide PlanB and Bit Harington

The line represented a barrier during the period of price uptrend. Traders tested it for a breakout multiple times before successfully breaching it to log a new record high. When prices started correcting they eventually bottomed out near the same line.

In 2020–2021 Bitcoin underwent a similar upside trajectory bouncing from below $4000 to rising to above $60000. Again Harington highlighted the $60000 level as the same R/S line that kept trades from logging a clear bullish breakout.

BTW: From this perspective there's a ""Bitcoin double top"" after every halving. It wasn't really obvious after halving 2 (like the obvious double top after halving 1) but you can still see this double top in various indicators. Weekly RSI for example:https://t.co/lopvWPqd3v — Bit Harington (@bitharington) September 19 2021

The analyst hinted that Bitcoin would break above it to soar toward a new record price level.

Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe reacted to Harington’s fractal theory adding that it would lead the Bitcoin prices to the $250000–$350000 range.

He noted however that the massive run-up could also prompt a brutal correction that can push Bitcoin prices back toward $65000 right near Harington’s S/R level of $60000.

This makes a ton of sense and in line with my ideas too.



Somewhere 2017 we are. Heavy breakout to come at a later stage to ~$250-350K and then landing on $65K in the bear market for #Bitcoin. https://t.co/4XX7aDp2rs — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) September 19 2021

Do the fundamentals agree?

Bitcoin skyrocketed after crashing below $4000 in March 2020 primarily due to the global central banks’ loose monetary policies to curb the economic aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cryptocurrency closed the year at around $30000 as retail and institutional investors woke up to its safe-haven narrative against a falling United States dollar and rising inflation fears.

So far in 2021 the price of Bitcoin has topped around $65000 before correcting lower below $50000. At its year-to-date (YTD) low the pair traded for $29301 on the Coinbase exchange. Its losses were led by a sudden ban on all crypto activities in China (including mining) and Elon Musk’s alarming tweets over Bitcoin’s booming carbon footprints.

BTC balance on exchanges drops to fresh lows

The cryptocurrency held prices above $30000 as its reserves across exchanges dropped significantly.

Blockchain data analytics service CryptoQuant reported that Bitcoin’s balances across the crypto trading platforms slipped to around 2.37 million BTC last week its lowest in more than a year.

A decrease in Bitcoin reserves represents traders’ intentions to hold the cryptocurrency instead of trading it for altcoins and fiat currencies.

Bitcoin’ hash rate has nearly recovered

Bitcoin’s recovery from below $30000 to almost $50000 also coincided with its V-shaped hash rate recovery.

For the uninitiated the Bitcoin network’s computation power plunged to 84.79 million terahashes per second (TH/s) in early July from 180.66 million TH/s in late May. The drop surfaced as many miners responded to China’s crypto crackdown by either shutting down their facilities or moving their operations abroad.

But the network recovered more than half of its lost hash rate hitting 136.92 million TH/s on Saturday indicating that China’s direct ban did not have a prolonged effect on Bitcoin’s mining sector.

The venture being JPMorgan's first retail bank overseas will launch a smartphone app initially offering checking accounts on Tuesday September 21. This has also been confirmed by a spokesman for JPMorgan.

Sanoke Viswanathan head of online ventures told the Times and Financial Times newspapers on Friday September 17 that the bank plans to expand lending and investment and expand further in other countries if successful. This invasion started from the European continent.

JPMorgan also followed US rival Goldman Sachs to enter the European market first and has been offering savings accounts to UK consumers since 2018.

US banks are looking to raise profitable but volatile returns in investment banking with more stable retail earnings but facing a competitive market dominated by incumbents including Lloyds Barclays NatWest and HSBC.

They will also be competing against relatively crowded newcomers including Monzo and Starling.

JPMorgan strengthened its UK presence earlier this year by buying digital wealth manager Nutmeg for £700 million aiming to tap into a growing pool of pandemic-era savers.

The mastermind behind the ring was Lori Ann Talens 41 and her husband 43-year-old Pacifico Talens Jr. assisted her. The pair sold counterfeit coupons from April 2017 through May 2020.

Lori Talens pleaded guilty to mail fraud wire fraud and health care fraud and was sentenced Tuesday by a federal judge in Norfolk. Pacifico Talens pleaded guilty to mail fraud and was sentenced to seven years behind bars.

“This massive counterfeit coupon scheme harmed consumers retailers and manufacturers nationwide and the economy at large"" Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Raj Parekh said in a statement from the Department of Justice.

The Talens used Facebook and Telegram to find coupon users and sell them counterfeits according to the statement.

Lori Talens used the online name “MasterChef"" and made counterfeit vouchers that ""were virtually indistinguishable from authentic coupons and were often created with inflated values far in excess of what an authentic coupon would offer in order to receive items from retail for free or for a greatly reduced price"" according to the Department of Justices statement.

Lori Talens shipped the counterfeit coupons using the U.S. Postal Service and accepted payment through online payment methods such as Bitcoin and Paypal. Her husband assisted in shipping the counterfeit coupons and profited from the sales.

However the Talens' scheme unraveled when one of their customers reported them to the Coupon Information Center a coalition dedicated to coupon integrity. The CIC acted as Talens' customer purchased coupons and later confirmed they were counterfeit. The CIC then notified the U.S. Postal Inspection Service which investigated the case.

Federal law enforcement then searched the Talens' residence and found nearly $1 million worth of counterfeit coupons according to the Department of Justice.

“Coupon fraud is not a harmless crime. The FBI investigates these matters aggressively because this kind of fraud ripples through the economy and unfortunately it is the innocent consumer that ultimately pays the price.” said Brian Dugan special agent in charge of the FBI’s Norfolk field office.

The Talens' operation cost paper products maker Kimberly-Clark nearly $9 million and household goods producer Procter & Gamble $2.8 million the DOJ said. Food giant Unilever lost $2.5 million and laundry and cleaning supplies maker Henkel Corporation lost $1.7 million.

Lawyers for both Lori Ann Talens and Pacifico Talens Jr. did not respond for a comment.

Lori Talens is ordered to report to prison no later than Oct. 31.

Over the past decade North Texas has grown by some 1.3 million people to reach a population of just under 7.7 million making it the nation’s fourth-largest metro area based on new figures from the 2020 census.

Rather than building on natural advantages North Texas owes its tremendous growth to railroads interstate highways and airports plus an unusual degree of economic freedom and affordability.

In the second half of the 20th century business leaders built a first-tier transportation network centered on DFW International Airport but also including a premier national hub for ground logistics and a toll-road system that could support rapid outward growth. Thanks to DFW Airport the world’s 12th-largest in passenger numbers travelers can reach every major city in the United States within four hours plus 66 nonstop destinations outside the U.S.

Today Dallas is pulling away economically from the nation’s long-established urban centers because of a distinctive policy orientation: growth-friendly with lighter-touch business regulation and lower taxes than longtime urban centers in the Northeast the Midwest or California.

Only four of the 53 U.S. metros with more than 1 million people outperform D-FW on an SMU Bridwell Institute for Economic Freedom index. The index measures tax levels government spending and labor rules. Likewise only five of these metros have more growth-friendly land-use rules than D-FW based on a data set compiled by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.

D-FW’s location and cost advantages have become powerful magnets for businesses. Already home to the headquarters of well-established companies like Texas Instruments American Airlines Southwest Airlines Kimberly-Clark and D.R. Horton North Texas in recent years has rapidly acquired headquarters for such elite companies as California-based Jacobs Engineering Fluor Toyota Motor North America McKesson Tenet Healthcare CBRE and Charles Schwab.

Bob Pragada chief operating officer of Jacobs which moved to Dallas in 2017 said high living costs particularly for housing made the Los Angeles area increasingly prohibitive for his 55000-employee firm.

“If you’re not a tech company it’s very difficult to be in California” he said in an interview adding that it was getting harder to persuade employees to move there.

According to data from the World Population Review Texas’ cost of living is about 10% below the national average while California’s is about 50% above.

D-FW has also established itself as America’s third-largest financial center. Comerica Charles Schwab and First Foundation moved their headquarters to Dallas in recent years and State Farm and Liberty Mutual have opened large operations in the area.

Recent shifts in domestic migration patterns are reshaping the D-FW area as well as the other large metros of the flourishing Texas Triangle region: Houston San Antonio and Austin. From 2010 to 2020 D-FW saw net inbound migration from elsewhere in the U.S. of more than 500000 more than any other U.S. metro.

As a result North Texas has a more youthful population than most areas. Many of these newcomers come from the coasts and the Midwest. The region received more than 100000 migrants from the Los Angeles New York and Chicago metros between 2012 and 2016 alone.

According to Census Bureau data foreign-born residents made up nearly 21% of North Texas residents age 25 and over with a bachelor’s graduate or professional degree as of 2017; that’s 25% above the national average.

Over the past decade notes demographer Wendell Cox D-FW has expanded its foreign-born population by 30% more than any of the seven U.S. metros with more than 5 million people. Foreign-born populations basically flatlined in New York while dropping in absolute terms in Los Angeles and Chicago.

Immigrants come for opportunity but this is not to say that poverty particularly among newcomers and long-established minorities has not persisted. In contrast to the ethnically diverse suburbs north of the city Dallas continues to have pockets of seemingly insoluble poverty.

At the same time D-FW is struggling with how to create greater economic vitality in its vast left-behind areas especially southern Dallas and southeast Fort Worth where pockets of concentrated poverty remain. As economic energy in the region shifts northward and westward southern Dallas has become what Dallas Citizens Council Chief Executive Kelvin Walker calls a “big gaping economic hole” — “the giant elephant in the room.”

Still North Texas seems poised for future growth. Its economy far more than that of Houston and most other metros is remarkably diversified. Only modestly dependent on the energy sector for example the D-FW economy weathered the effects of declines in oil and natural gas prices in 2014-15 and again in 2019-20.

Collin and Denton counties are likely to see their populations more than double by 2050 and counties still farther north along the Oklahoma border are primed to become large growth engines as well.

America’s most economically and demographically dynamic metros will continue to play leading roles in shaping the nation’s urban geography as they always have. In the first half of the 20th century the place to watch was New York. In the second half it was Los Angeles.

In 21st-century America keep your eyes on Big D.

Paulin a healthcare worker and CUPE member is nipping at the heals of the Liberal incumbent and leading the charge for a strong NDP in New Brunswick. Don has been endorsed by CUPE National President Mark Hancock and CUPE New Brunswick President Steve Drost.

Paulin is challenging the Liberal’s voting record and his actions within his party. Long has often voted for NDP bills that would support Saint John workers but he has failed to push his party to the Left. Touting himself as a constituents’ MP Long’s signs tell us what he stands for: climate change families or just “I stand for you.”

But does he?

This might depend on your view of climate change.

Saint John is home to one of Canada’s largest oil refineries so it is not surprising to find Liberal support for proposals that further the interests of the company—Irving Oil.

Long supported the Trans Mountain pipeline through First Nations territory in BC. That in itself is enough to throw some shade on his climate change bona fides. Regarding the expansion of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project Long told the House of Commons on June 1 2017 “I think that our government should do what any responsible government should do much like the government across the House would also do which is to approve the pipeline. We will support the pipeline and we will do everything in our power to make sure that the pipeline moves forward.”

Building the pipeline however may make it impossible for Canada to meet its climate commitment under the Paris Accords of maintaining global heating to within 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels the maximum level scientists say we can allow without risking a dangerous climate future.

Long also supported Energy East pipeline—as did most of the Saint John establishment. He is also a supporter of controversial Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMRs) which will produce long-lasting nuclear waste which will have to be managed for hundreds of thousands of years if not longer. According to the Nuclear Waste Management Organization a not-for-profit established by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers spent uranium fuel from Canadian reactors will still be almost 100 times more radioactive than naturally occurring uranium 5000 years from now—the entire span of recorded human history.

Despite being seen as a maverick to some in the Liberal Party he has comfortably towed the line drawn by Saint John’s energy establishment.

Paulin by contrast argues that he is more focused on people.

He has complimented Long on his NDP-friendly voting record but has also criticized his silence within his own caucus. According to Paulin Long takes positions for which he does not have the support of his party and he has been unable to change their minds on key issues affecting Saint John.

Paulin says that he would vote along the same lines as Long but he’d have the backing of his party. Long has a lot of power as a Member of Parliament because his government is in office. He could have used his influence to change the position of his caucus colleagues but according to Paulin he hasn’t. About Long “he votes for what’s right but he sits back and allows what’s wrong to continue” said Paulin.

Paulin began his career in finance and accounting but later moved to focus on helping people and devoted himself to a career in healthcare. He is a nurse and has worked in different areas of our healthcare system be it public private acute and currently with our elderly veterans. “It has helped me see people at their most vulnerable and truly see what people need from government and that has taught me the difference between empathy and sympathy” said Paulin.

As home to one of Canada’s largest oil refineries Saint John-Rothesay is a potential source of significant working-class support for the NDP. Paulin says he is focused on helping people not companies.

Paulin is especially concerned for oil and gas workers as we transition our economy towards green jobs. These workers will need retraining to find jobs in the new post-carbon economy: “We need to get buy in from workers we’re looking to train for preferably well-paid union jobs in green jobs.”

Saint John will have choices to make in the upcoming election. With the Conservatives looking to pick up seats in the province the Liberals have long been weary of a strong Left candidate in the NDP. In Don Paulin they appear to have found a strong candidate who is set to show the town just how progressive and pro-worker it really is.

Long was asked for comment on the election but had not returned the NB Media Co-op’s query at the time of publication.

But have the effects of 2020 permanently impacted how people discover shop and engage with the outside world? And what implications will these shifts in consumer trends have for the upcoming holiday season and beyond?

A new data report from Stackla offers insight into these questions and reveals that not only are surges in online shopping here to stay but also that today’s consumers want brands to provide them with more authentic personalized shopping experiences.

The survey of more than 2000 consumers found that 83% of people believe retailers need to provide more authentic shopping experiences and 70% say it’s important for brands to provide them with personalized experiences.

Here's a look at some of the key findings:

UGC offers the authenticity and personalization consumers seek

Despite the amount of budget brands allocate toward professional photography and influencer marketing these days only 19% of consumers find brand-created content to be authentic and a mere 10% say influencer content resonates as authentic with them.

The majority of respondents indicated that user-generated content (UGC) resonates as most authentic with nearly 80% saying UGC highly impacts their purchasing decisions making it 8.7x more impactful than influencer content and 6.6x more influential than branded content in consumers’ eyes​.

And according to online shoppers the global pandemic has only served to amplify the influence of UGC. In fact 56% of consumers say they’re more influenced by social media images and videos when online shopping now than they were before the pandemic.

With online shopping people can’t physically see touch or try on the items they’re considering. They want to know how a jacket fits on someone with a similar body type​ what that shade of lipstick looks like on someone with their skin tone ​or how much space a couch takes up in a living room that has similar dimensions to theirs. UGC offers people an unvarnished and trusted third-party view on these unknown elements helping to bring products to life for them in ways that feel real and relevant.

When asked 72% of consumers said that real customer photos and videos are the content they most want to see on eCommerce sites. Furthermore 80% said they would be more likely to purchase a product from an online store if its website had photos and videos from real customers.

Just how important is UGC to today’s online shoppers?

Important enough that 64% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennials indicated that they’ve left an eCommerce store without purchasing because the site didn’t include customer photos or reviews.

The message from consumers is clear: the presence or lack of UGC can make or break brands especially as we head into the holiday season.

Consumers want to play an active role in creating the brands they love

User-generated content is abundant enough to scale across multiple marketing initiatives and continuously feed brands’ evergreen need for fresh content. Plus using customer content to market to other people doubles as a great customer loyalty strategy.

Not only are most people willing to give brands permission to use their photos in exchange for being featured in their marketing efforts but today’s consumers are actually eager to act as content creators for their favorite brands.

Over 60% of consumers say they would be more loyal to and likely to buy from a brand that invited them to join a customer advocacy community to actively help it create more UGC for the brand.

In short brands that place UGC at the heart of their online experiences will be rewarded by shoppers.

As such brands that want to stay ahead of the competition need to start strategically using UGC to create the authentic commerce experiences today’s shoppers crave. Those that do can boost both sales and trust while also forming more meaningful connections with customers.

Rating: About this rating True

In mid-September 2021 multiple news outlets reported that it was possible to book a stay in Planters' 26-foot vehicle that's shaped like a giant peanut.

The reports were true. On Sept. 14 Hormel Foods which owns the Planters brand announced the following in a press release:

For the first time ever the iconic NUTMOBILE™ vehicle will transform into the nuttiest living quarters that transports you into an overnight immersive PLANTERS® brand experience of course filled with plenty of PLANTERS® brand products for guests to enjoy. The stay also includes a $1500 travel stipend and can-nut miss activities where guests can enjoy the beautiful scenery in Minnesota. The best part? This one-of-a-kind nutty stay is available for $3.59 the cost of a jar of PLANTERS® peanuts. [...] On September 17 at 12 p.m. CDT one fan will be able to book a two-night stay at the INN a NUTshell from October 1 through October 3 by visiting MrPeanutInnANutshell.com. You’ll have to be quick because only one fan and a guest will be able to stay in the iconic 26-foot-long peanut on wheels waterfront in Duluth Minn.

In other words the company was asking fans to go to a specific website at the noted time to try book the accommodations — but only one participant would actually be able to go through with the reservation and then that winner would be able to select a guest for the experience. Further details on the competition's rules and criteria were unknown.

We went to the website before the contest's start and found the below-displayed interior renderings of the so-called ""Nutmobile."" The images show decorations and furniture supposedly inside the vehicle with the ""PLANTERS"" name across them.

Hormel which bought the Planters brand from Kraft Heinz in early 2021 is based in Minnesota. In addition to the above-outlined contest for fans the release said the company was donating money to an organization in the state that aims to protect its natural land and wildlife.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Kroger Bagged Kale

On Thursday September 17 Kroger announced that the previous day they had voluntarily pulled all 16-ounce bags of their Kroger brand bagged kale from shelves. They stated no illnesses had been reported to date but the nation's biggest grocery chain had reason to be concerned about the presence of possible Listeria monocytogenes.

They said the product bears the UPC number 11110-18170 and a best-by date of September 18 2021. Among the areas where Kroger's bagged kale was distributed were Columbus and Toledo Ohio; Knoxville Tennessee; eastern West Virginia; and the states of Georgia Alabama and South Carolina.

Kroger advised customers who purchased this lot of bagged kale to dispose of it return it to your Kroger store for a full refund or call 1-800-KROGERS.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- Najee Harris has been known to make dazzling plays through his football career and fans at Heinz Field got their first glimpse of one of those plays in person on Sunday.

During the first quarter of Sunday's game vs. the Raiders Harris made a stiff-arm move on safety Jonathan Abram.

“It was pretty cool because we were walking to our baggage claim and TJ looks up and says ‘hey there’s my Mom’” said reliever Art Warren another callup Saturday. “‘No way what are you talking about?’ ‘No seriously that’s my Mom.’ That was cool for me to witness that his mom being there for his callup. That was pretty sweet.”

It was a surprise for Friedl who knew his mom was supposed to land around the same time but he didn’t expect to see her at the airport. His mom was wearing his spring training jersey.

“(Warren) saw that jersey he's like 'dude we have to surprise her’” Friedl said. “So I got a really good video of that one. I just randomly tapped her on the shoulder and she turned around and she was shocked.”

Friedl a 26-year-old left-handed hitter made his Major League debut Saturday when he pinch-hit in the eighth inning against Los Angeles Dodgers reliever Joe Kelly. Friedl had an infield pop-out.

When he pinch-hit in the sixth inning Sunday Friedl hit a solo homer for his first big-league hit. His good friend and former roommate Tyler Stephenson gave him a bear hug in the dugout.

Manager David Bell said Friedl will likely receive “some starts” with Winker Akiyama and Tyler Naquin out. Max Schrock a left-handed hitter is already regular starter in left field against right-handed pitching and Friedl is an option for center field along with Delino DeShields and Jose Barrero.

""It's a moment you dream of your whole life"" said Friedl who learned he was headed to the Majors on Friday night. ""Everything just stood still in that moment and I was in complete and utter shock.

""A couple of teammates were waiting outside of Pat Kelly's office and came storming in as soon as he said that and then the rest of my teammates were sitting outside his office waiting to congratulate me. So it was a very special moment with all of those guys.""

Friedl had a .264 batting average and .357 on-base percentage at Triple-A Louisville this year with 15 doubles 12 homers 36 RBI and 59 runs in 113 games. He had 44 walks compared to 65 strikeouts and stole 13 bases in 20 attempts.

FRONT OFFICE MOVE: Reds scouting director Brad Meador was promoted to assistant general manager sources told The Enquirer. He will work with the amateur scouting international scouting and player development departments.

Meador completed his third MLB Draft as the scouting director in July. He’s in his 12th year in the Reds’ organization beginning as an area supervisor in 2009 and he later spent two years as the organization’s Midwest crosschecker.

Before joining the Reds Meador spent 10 years with the University of Cincinnati baseball program as an associate head coach.

The Reds will have a new amateur scouting director after Meador’s promotion.

ART OF PITCHING: Warren activated from the 60-day injured list struck out three of the four batters he faced in the eighth inning Saturday against the Dodgers.

“I was happy with the way I was able to breathe and stay calm” Warren said. “I think the at-bat with Justin Turner stood out for me the most. I fell behind 2-0 and I remember Tucker (Barnhart) and I talking afterward. Give Tucker a lot of credit. We just kind of kept going at Justin Turner – gave up a hit which was fine – I think there was an opportunity there where things can unravel especially after a couple of quick outs in an inning. I’m glad I kind of stayed on the gas there.”

Warren a 28-year-old from Napoleon Ohio was a major part of the bullpen before he suffered an oblique injury right before the All-Star break. He’s allowed three runs and 10 hits in 15 1/3 innings this season (1.76 ERA) striking out 24.

He spent the majority of the last two months rehabbing his injury at the spring training complex in Goodyear Arizona. He made six relief appearances on a rehab assignment with Triple-A Louisville before he was activated from the IL.

LINEUP DECISIONS: Facing left-hander Clayton Kershaw on Sunday Bell stacked the Reds’ lineup with right-handed hitters for the first seven spots in the batting order. He replaced Joey Votto at first base with Tyler Stephenson.

Votto is hitting .213 with a .308 on-base percentage in 156 plate appearances against lefties this year which is lower than Stephenson’s splits versus lefties. He has a .290 batting average and .402 on-base percentage against righties.

“We know how good Kershaw is so we have to do what we have to do to put our best foot forward” Bell said. “Obviously Joey is a part of that lineup always for today there was a couple of factors with Kershaw.”

Barrero made his first start in center field. He played only one inning in the outfield before Sunday’s series finale but he’s worked with outfield coach Jeff Pickler at the position for the past month before batting practice."

(AAPL) IPhone 5S Supply-Demand Cycle May Stumble,"The Apple iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 are making headlines as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fans are anxiously awaiting the next great smartphone. There is no telling when Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will debut the next phone but there are a lot of ideas on when and where it may happen.

Apple 5S supply cycle may not match demand cycle again

It’s predicted that the next iPhone will be announced in September. There was also a Foxconn Technology Co. Ltd. (TPE:2354) hiring spree earlier this year which pointed toward an iPhone release in the latter half of 2013. The price for the iPhone will most likely remain the same as it always has though there is still plenty of speculation that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release a budget-friendly version of the iPhone. Earlier this week KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo added “While shipments forecasts may still grow sharply in 4Q13 we are concerned iPhone 5S may face the same problem as its predecessor namely that by the time supply matures demand will already have waned hurting shipments.”

Apple iPhone 5’s anticipated features

The next iPhone is also predicted to feature the same aluminum design that the iPhone 5 sports but the next generation will feature a slightly larger case. There is a report that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is currently testing larger displays. Some speculate the next iPhone will feature a 4.3 inch display.

The one thing we know about the upcoming iPhone is that it will feature iOS 7. Last month Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled the next generation operating system at the Worldwide Developers Conference and it has some new impressive features such as iTunes Radio revamped Siri personal assistant AirDrop cool filters for the camera enhanced Safari web browser and enhanced App Store.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s upcoming iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 are generating plenty of buzz. Although nothing has been confirmed yet there is speculation that the iPhone 5S will come out this year and the iPhone 6 will come out next year.",,,,,,,,,
LDOS,Leidos,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd2FzaGluZ3RvbnRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvc2l6ZS1zY2FsZS1vbmx5LXBhcnQtb2YtdGhlLXN0b3J5LW9mLXRoZS1uZ2VuLXRyYW5zaXRpb24vMzU5NTY0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Size scale only part of the story of the NGEN transition,"Transitioning a contract from one company to the next is a fact of life in the government market. Companies win contracts from competitors or conversely they lose a contract.

The so-called transition of a contract from the incumbent to the new prime should be considered a core competency of your company.

But what about when it is the biggest contract in the market?

That was what Leidos faced after it won the $7.7 billion Navy Next Generation Network Recompete --Service Management Integration and Transport contract also known as NGEN-R SMIT.

The company took the contract away from Perspecta in February 2020 but then a year of protests followed and it really couldn’t take on the work of the transition until February 2021. And then the customer asked for an accelerated transition of six months versus the original nine.

And it’s important to note that the contract wasn’t just to take over management of the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet though that was by far the biggest piece. Leidos also consolidated OneNet and the Marine Corps Enterprise Network contracts into a single management umbrella.

So the delay and the compressed timeframe was one challenge. And then there are the sheer numbers involved:

1500 locations across the United States and the world

450000 seats

650000 users

73 different IT services

Dan Voce senior vice president and Enterprise & Cyber Solutions operations manager for Leidos said it is the biggest transition the company has undertaken.

Each of those three networks Leidos has taken over are different. OneNet and MCEN were government-owned government-operated. And for those Leidos transitioned the work from government personnel to contractor personnel.

NCMI was managed under the previous NGEN contract and it was government-owned contractor-operated said DJ LeGoff the NGEN program manager.

“It took us a significant amount of time” he said of the NMCI transition. “We have over 600 sessions with the government and the current incumbent to make sure we understood everything that was involved.”

As hard fought and even bitter as the competition for the contract was that all disappeared during the transition. There was no tension he said.

“Everybody was professional and we worked through it” LeGoff said. “It was a three-way collaboration and like I said it was very successful.”

Part of the success stems from Leidos’ ability to hire many Perspecta employees who were working on the previous contract.

“It was very much part of our approach” he said. “There are a lot of good folks who have worked on that program for a long time.”

Leidos wanted to capture what LeGoff called the “tribal knowledge.”

“These are dedicated folks that have worked on the program for their entire careers in some cases” he said. “They want nothing more than to continue working the program and we wanted to leverage that expertise.”

The Leidos executives didn’t disclose how many employees came over but the number was significant and the company has hundreds of people working on NGEN.

Transitions on this scale are not easy so Leidos took a methodical approach that they’ve honed on other large contracts. It starts by partitioning the work. “We took those 73 services and decided which ones had to go first and which one had to wait for a previous service to transition ahead of them” LeGoff said.

They put the transition into three phases and then set deadlines for the transition – June 1 July 1 and Aug. 1.

“We had to have everything in place after phase one that would support phase two and likewise everything after phase two to support phase three” he said.

Another challenge to overcome was that as Leidos took over a service there would be a period of time where Leidos and Perspecta both were in charge of the network and they had to collaborate hence the 600 plus meetings over the six-month transition.

“We all wanted to make sure that in no case did operations suffer” LeGoff said.

Another part of the equation that sometimes gets lost is that Perspecta’s NGEN contract was competed as a lowest-price technically acceptable contract. The Navy wasn’t interested in much innovation under an LPTA scenario.

But when it came time to compete the new NGEN contract the Navy was looking for a path toward innovation and modernization.

“They are interested in things like cloud-enabled services bringing artificial intelligence and machine learning into operations and they want faster response” Voce said. “Those are key objectives of the Navy and we’ll support that with this contract.”

One goal is a flattening of the of network architecture. “Today’s network architecture is very hierarchical very complex” LeGoff said. “There is some beauty to simplicity and that will hopefully increase performance.”

But the day-to-day operations are the top priority. “That is always job one” Voce said. “The second priority are those transformations that will improve the user experience increase automation and drive down manual work but the mission is always number one.”

As challenging as the transition was there was no sigh of relief for the Leidos team when it was completed on Aug. 1.

“The transition was just the warm-up” LeGoff said. “We’re in charge of the network now. We were doing maneuvers for Hurricane Ida in Louisiana and that’ just a public one. There are hundreds that happen every day on a network of this scope and size.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMTkvZWxvbi1tdXNrLW1vY2tzLXByZXNpZGVudC1iaWRlbi1hZnRlci1zcGFjZXgtY29tcGxldGVzLWZpcnN0LWFsbC1jaXZpbGlhbi1taXNzaW9uLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wOS8xOS9lbG9uLW11c2stbW9ja3MtcHJlc2lkZW50LWJpZGVuLWFmdGVyLXNwYWNleC1jb21wbGV0ZXMtZmlyc3QtYWxsLWNpdmlsaWFuLW1pc3Npb24uaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk mocks President Biden after SpaceX completes first all-civilian mission,"One major goal of the Inspiration4 mission was to raise $200 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. It had raised $160.2 million by Saturday. Celebrating after Inspiration4 splashed down Musk pledged to contribute $50 million personally — pushing the campaign's total raised to $210 million.

As CNBC previously reported SpaceX safely returned its Crew Dragon spacecraft from orbit yesterday. The capsule carried the four members of the Inspiration4 mission back to Earth after three days in space.

One of Musk's 60 million followers on the social networking platform Twitter asked him ""The President of the United States has refused to even acknowledge the 4 newest American astronauts who helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for St. Jude. What's your theory on why that is?""

After SpaceX completed a historic private spaceflight on Saturday CEO Elon Musk took a pot shot at President Joe Biden who had yet to remark on the company's and the civilian flight crew's accomplishments.

The White House and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Top NASA officials have congratulated Musk and SpaceX on the Inspiration4 mission. SpaceX competitors acknowledged it too with accolades from Boeing  Lockheed Martin  Blue Origin and Musk's peer and rival Jeff Bezos shared on social media.

This marked the first private SpaceX spaceflight with a non-professional crew. Additionally the mission involved the first Black woman to serve as a spacecraft pilot the youngest American to become an astronaut to date and the first person to fly in space with a prosthesis.

Although Musk recently stated that he ""would prefer to stay out of politics"" his quip on Sunday indicated a willingness to needle the Democratic president and repeat a right-wing taunt about Biden.

During his 2020 campaign former President Donald Trump frequently insulted then-candidate Biden by calling him ""Sleepy Joe.""

More recently Trump sent Biden sarcastic well-wishes ahead of a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June. He said in an e-mailed statement at the time ""Good luck to Biden in dealing with President Putin— don't fall asleep during the meeting and please give him my warmest regards!""

SpaceX generally enjoys a good relationship with the federal government. For example it won a $2.89 billion contract to build NASA's next crewed lunar lander beating out Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Leidos subsidiary Dynetics and SpaceX has flown 10 astronauts to the ISS for NASA to date.

However SpaceX is also under investigation by the Department of Justice after accusations that it discriminated against job applicants based on citizenship status — a probe that began during the Trump administration.

In addition to his responsibilities at SpaceX Musk is concurrently the CEO of electric vehicle makers Tesla . (Tesla is also a supplier to SpaceX.)

In that capacity he recently bemoaned a Biden administration proposal that would allocate an extra $4500 in incentives to buyers of certain new electric light-duty passenger vehicles. One stipulation of the proposal is that electric vehicles should be union-made domestically.

While the company operates a battery factory in Nevada and a vehicle assembly plant in California already with another under construction outside of Austin Texas Tesla is the only major U.S. automaker whose production is not unionized here.

Musk said on Twitter on September 12 of the proposal: ""This is written by Ford/UAW lobbyists as they make their electric car in Mexico. Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers.""

Some people strongly backed the rules thanking the musical artist and theater for prioritizing public health and safety. Others vehemently opposed the policy or questioned the effectiveness of the vaccine.

In response to the fiery online debate the venue posted this:

""While we welcome an open dialogue for sharing of information regarding these shows and policies we do not wish to be a place for increasingly rude and disrespectful comments that are not suited for our family-friendly audience"" the statement read. ""Please let’s all be kind.""

Georgia Paxos executive director of the Canton Palace Theatre said she's also received emails and other feedback since the pandemic requirement was instituted at the request of promoter Live Nation and the Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo tour.

""It's been a mixture of everything"" she said of the reactions. ""Some people are thankful and they expressed support for the idea. Other people are not. You know it's such a charged issue so there's definitely both sides of it.""

'We will do what we have to do to ensure live music continues in our fabulous facility.'

Both Benatar and Todd Rundgren are requiring printed proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 test results to attend the concerts. The policy also applies to all venue staff volunteers stagehands and vendors Paxos said.

A third party will be verifying vaccination cards and/or negative test results outside the Palace Theatre on the day of the Benatar concert.

Rundgren's show is on Oct. 29 at the Palace Theatre.

Refunds for either concert are being handled by the seller of the ticket — either the Palace or Ticketmaster.

""We will do what we have to do to ensure live music continues in our fabulous facility"" Paxos said. ""We appreciate our long-lasting relationship (with Live Nation) that brings some amazing concerts to Canton.""

The Palace Theatre is the latest example of a trend throughout the entertainment industry both inside and outside the area.

In August more than a dozen Northeast Ohio music venues — including several in Akron — banded together to require patrons to show proof of full vaccination or negative COVID-19 test results.

Participating venues include Jilly's Music Room Musica The Rialto Theater The Agora Beachland Ballroom and Tavern Grog Shop and Music Box Supper Club.

In a joint news release the music venues announced the policy and said it was due to both rising COVID-19 cases and because many national touring bands are also requiring similar policies.

Several touring artists also have similar requirements for concerts at Blossom Music Center including Jimmy Buffett on Saturday and Dave Matthews Band on Sept. 29.

'Keeping her audience safe'

For Sunday's Benatar concert Keith Price 62 of Plain Township applauds the decision.

Price said he's fully vaccinated and this will be the first concert he's attended during the pandemic.

""It is all about keeping her audience safe"" he said of Benatar citing a significant spike in local COVID cases since he purchased tickets in July.

According to local health departments for the period covering Sept. 2 to 15 there were 2824 confirmed and probable COVID cases in Stark County a rate of 762 per 100000.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention level of community transmission was considered to be high from Sept. 9 to 15.

What does the COVID policy mean?

For the Benatar concert in Canton the rules are:

All fans must present printed proof of a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours before entry to the venue. Or present printed proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (at least 14 days after the final dose).

Unvaccinated fans under 12 years old will be required to take a COVID-19 diagnostic test within 72 hours prior to the event and will provide proof of negative results prior to entering the venue.

More details on the admittance policies for both the Benatar and Rundgren shows are posted at https://cantonpalacetheatre.org.

The Auricle implements policy

Starting this month The Auricle in downtown Canton began requiring proof of COVID vaccination or a negative COVID test taken within 72 hours of any ticketed show or event.

""It's one of those things where that was the wise and the responsible decision"" said club owner Josh Brewer who noted his staff is vaccinated. ""That's what I've tried to be about the whole pandemic; I wanted to make wise and safe decisions for myself and my patrons and employees and the artists.""

But the decision drew backlash.

""There's been a lot of ruckus and honestly I'd be lying if I said it wasn't hurting us"" Brewer said of The Auricle's bottom line. ""Our calendar is really bare right now because a lot of shows are postponing and artists have canceled because of our regulations.""

However Paul Johnson 37 of Plain Township was among those who expressed support for the COVID concert measures.

""As a pharmacy technician one of my jobs is to promote public health and public safety"" he said.

Johnson said he understands ""burnout and being a little tired over these safety measures.""

However ""we've got to look out for each other"" he added. ""The pandemic is not going away because you're tired or bored with the health and safety measures ...""

And ""one of my dear friends had to be intubated and almost died so this is pretty personal for me"" Price said.

Others derided The Auricle for the policy with one commenter calling such regulations a ""travesty and setback for this country."" Another critic said: ""I guess you guys don't like money.""

Prior to the new rules business had been good at The Auricle Brewer said. Summer concerts included The Reverend Horton Heat Patrick Sweany O-Town and Hawthorne Heights.

The Auricle had been closed during the first 16 months of the pandemic.

""If I was just willy-nilly (and) if I didn't put those regulations out there and was just like ... we're doing shows ... whatever it's at your own risk I'd probably make money and be fine"" Brewer said. ""But that's not what I'm about. I'm more health-focused than I am money-focused.""

Massillon theater and Kent Tusc venue

Not every music and entertainment venue is instituting such a COVID policy.

Buzzbin a downtown Canton music club that regularly hosts rock metal and other acts hasn't posted a COVID check policy on its Facebook page or website. Club operators couldn't be reached for comment.

Susan Stuck executive director of the Lions Lincoln Theatre in downtown Massillon said the venue's performers have not requested vaccination or COVID test policies.

""We are following the guidelines (and requirements) of the health departments"" she said. ""Which right now there is nothing required of us to do. If it changes obviously we'll follow what we're told.""

""We don't have bigger artists"" Stuck said referring to the venue's bookings as a ""little different situation.""

Conducting COVID checks ""would be very difficult"" she said. ""We rely solely on volunteers. We don't have a staff of paid members and we certainly don't have a budget where we can hire anybody.

""Obviously we want to make everything as safe as possible and we want people to come out and enjoy the shows and not have to worry"" Stuck added. ""Some people said they won't go someplace if they have to prove (vaccination or COVID test results) and then some have the opposite opinion and that's why I'm not making that call and we'll do what the health department requires.""

David Mitchell general manager of the Kent State University at Tuscarawas Performing Arts Center in New Philadelphia said the venue currently sets its policy without artist input.

""The only artist at this point who has expressed a vaccine or testing requirement is the Broadway tour of 'Waitress' and that only applies to anyone working backstage"" he said. ""We currently don’t have anyone dictating/requesting that for the audience. Of course … things can always change as we move forward.""

Musicians share thoughts on policy

Jackie Popovec lead singer for The Vindys said the popular Northeast Ohio pop-rock-jazz band has made a conscious effort to try to keep their concerts outdoors this summer.

Following the release of a new album The Vindys have performed at numerous venues including The Auricle and Jackson Amphitheater in Stark County.

The Vindys opened for Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo at MGM Northfield Park Center Stage a day before the duo's Canton show which also features area musician Marc Lee Shannon as the opening performer.

""With the most recent state of the pandemic and the crippling economic effects of the past year the entertainment industry cannot afford to shut down again"" Popovec said. ""We understand and support the decision made by venues to require proof of vaccination or a negative test in order to keep our fans safe.""

Members of The Buffalo Ryders an Akron area-based band that performs in Canton said they understand the issue from multiple perspectives.

""It was pretty powerful to see the coalition of Northeast Ohio venues stand together on this issue"" said Joe Risdon the band's vocalist and guitarist. ""(It) shows how strong of a music community we have.

""The best feeling in the world is playing live in front of a crowd of people"" he added. ""We need it. Whichever side of the issue you fall on you can't deny that our industry was shut down for over a year. Venues are just trying to stay alive. They can't afford to shut down again. If that requires some extra precautions to protect staff musicians and concertgoers then we're all for it.""

Kevin McManus bassist for The Buffalo Ryders said the band has been playing concerts so frequently since the spring ""that really we have been forced to just go with the flow of the climate as it evolves.

""As a band and with respect to Northeast Ohio venues specifically we're working at some places that are requiring vaccination proof or a negative test for everyone including musicians as well as some that are not"" he added. ""For the clubs that are requiring proof we definitely appreciate and support that decision as it just makes a lot of sense to us personally.

""For the clubs that aren't at the present we are just trusting staff and patrons are already being responsible like not being around others if they are feeling sick"" McManus said. ""The scene is at a fluid tricky spot and if things continue to get trickier at least we know there are venues we can work where they are taking such precautions.""

The ""We Can’t Stop"" singer took the stage at the packed house for Summerfest playing to a crowd of about 20000 people in Milwaukee Wis. While pausing in between songs the artist noted that she only recently started performing on stage in front of live crowds again following the pandemic. In a rare moment of vulnerability she revealed to the crowd how difficult she’s finding it to be.

According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Cyrus noted that she told her longtime drummer during the show that she believed she was having a panic attack. Fortunately she managed to pull herself together and take the stage. However she wanted to be honest with her audience about the difficulty she was having.

""Like everyone else for the last year and a half I have been locked away and isolating and it is very stunning to be back in a place that used to feel like second nature. Being on stage used to feel like home and it doesn’t anymore because of how much time I spent at home locked away"" Cyrus explained.

BON JOVI CANCELS TOUR SO CORONAVIRUS REFUNDS CAN BE ISSUED

She added: The pandemic was startling and terrifying and coming out of it is slightly terrifying. So I just wanted to be honest with how I’m feeling.""

In her speech to the crowd Cyrus noted that she feels it’s important to let her fans know what she’s going through and opening up to them on a more personal level — something she believes was a positive change in herself to come out of the pandemic and lockdown.

""The last year kind of removed this divide this curtain and we’re allowing people to see us in our most vulnerable our most isolated our most hurt our most scared states"" Cyrus said. ""And I think that's something really empowering.""

""I think by being honest that makes me less afraid"" she continued. ""I'm getting used to being back on stage but there's nowhere else that I'd rather be.""

CORONAVIRUS MADE 59M AMERICANS LOSE MONEY OVER CANCELED PLANS

Cyrus’ comments highlight the difficult year and a half that has affected the live concert industry not only on artist’s mental health but on the financial stability of venues. At the onset of the pandemic many were completely closed down for an indefinite amount of time. Amid the pandemic some places tried to open at a limited capacity with social distancing and mask guidelines all with varying degrees of success.

In August of 2020 for example Live Nation one of the country’s largest ticket retailers reported $588.1 million in losses in its second quarter. Revenue for three months -- ending in June 30 -- totaled only $74.1 million which marks a shocking 97% drop from the same time last year which saw revenue marks of $3.2 billion.

The Wrap reported at the time that concert revenue specifically took a 95% hit year-over-year for 2020 with just $141.8 million compared to $2.6 billion in 2 019. Live Nation took an $87 million hit from ticketing refunds. However the company noted in its report that 86% of people who bought tickets for shows prior to the shutdown have decided to hold onto them rather than seek a refund demonstrating a level of confidence that fans would return to concerts as soon as its publicly considered safe to do so.

Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott recently made headlines after Jenner revealed that the couple is expecting their second child together on social media. She made the announcement on Sept. 7 with a heart-warming video on Instagram that features their firstborn Stormi Webster.

Jenner famously kept her first pregnancy a secret until after her daughter was born. The two celebrities have mostly kept quiet about the status of their relationship and their growing family. But what do the stars have to say about this couple’s future?

Kylie Jenner is a Leo

According to Famous Birthdays Kylie Jenner was born on Aug. 10 1997. Her date of birth makes her a Leo.

Some of the positive Leo traits include being generous loyal energetic and theatrical. This zodiac sign loves attention and knows just how to get it. It makes sense that Jenner has a career that puts her in the public eye because Leos love the limelight.

A few of the negative Leo qualities are being stubborn selfish and possessive. While Leos are very magnanimous they are also protective of their favorite people and belongings.

Every zodiac sign correlates with one of four natural elements: fire water air or earth. Leo is a fire sign and fire signs are typically passionate hot-headed and vivacious. Her fire element is part of what makes Jenner so sexy and appealing.

Travis Scott is a Taurus

Famous Birthdays tells us that Travis Scott was born on Apr. 30 1992. His date of birth makes him a Taurus.

Among the positive qualities associated with the Taurus zodiac sign are being reliable hard-working and loving. Taureans are very romantic yet their romanticism is balanced by practicality and realism.

Some of the negative Taurus traits are being stubborn gluttonous and materialistic. Taureans are willing to work hard to get the nice things they admire but the more they get the more they want.

Taurus is an earth sign and earth signs are known for being stable logical and serious. Earth signs are extraordinarily diligent and Scott’s hard work is what led to his success as a musician.

Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott are not astrologically compatible

Unfortunately for Jenner and Scott Leo and Taurus are not very romantically compatible.

Earth and fire signs typically don’t mix. In nature fire scorches and destroys the earth while earth can smother a fire and put it out completely. Taurus has a hard time understanding Leo’s passionate nature and temper tantrums while Leo may find Taurus dull and uninspiring.

Every zodiac sign has one of three modalities: cardinal mutable or fixed. The modalities tell us how the signs interact with the world and handle challenges. It’s usually best when two people in a couple have different modalities because it gives them more ways of solving problems together.

Leo and Taurus are both fixed signs and fixed signs are known for being stubborn and slow to take action. They are set in their ways and do not like change or being told to do things differently. When two fixed signs get together they shy away from progress and may find themselves feeling stuck and stagnant.

When it comes to disagreements Leo and Taurus fight like their animal symbols the lion and the bull. They are both strong and hard-headed and they will battle ferociously for dominance.

Based on their sun signs Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott do not have a strong chance of lasting as a romantic couple. They could however be excellent friends and co-parents. They just might be better off with partners who understand and complement them better.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyb2Fkc2hlZXQuY29tLmF1L3N5ZG5leS9ldmVudC9ydXBhdWxzLWRyYWctcmFjZS1kb3duLXVuZGVyLWxpdmUtaG9yZGVybi1wYXZpbGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under Live at Hordern Pavilion,"All your favourite queens from the pop culture phenomenon’s first Aussie and Kiwi series are sashaying around the country with charisma uniqueness nerve and talent.

The aircraft is based on Airbus' A17 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) and is offered as a ""Built in America by Americans for Americans"" solution. The USAF is to acquire 330 tankers under the KC-Y Project.

Compared to the original A330 MRTT the LMXT brings 13 tons more fuel increasing not only the number of aircraft refueled in a mission but also its own autonomy. In addition the jet will also have specific equipment according to the needs of the USAF as well as an open architecture facilitating the integration of systems and other instruments that the US military wants to integrate including the Joint All-Domain Command and Control ( JADC2).

https://youtu.be/EuFTr53cer0

In June the USAF announced that it was seeking tankers based on commercial aircraft and not under development to compete in the KC-Y Program which aims to find a buffer aircraft to operate from the end of delivery of the 179 Boeing KC-46 Pegasus in 2029 and onwards with the start of Project KC-Z which will see the development of an all-new tanker aircraft. The specifications for the KC-Z have not yet been completed.

“Lockheed Martin has a long and successful history of producing aircraft for the United States Air Force and we understand the critical role that tankers play in ensuring the overall success of America's mission” said Greg Ulmer  executive vice president of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. “The LMXT combines proven performance and operator-specific capabilities to meet the Air Force's refueling requirements in support of America's National Defense Strategy.”

Without specifying where Lockheed points out that the new aircraft would be produced in the United States. The portal Flightglobal speculates that this could occur at the Airbus facility in Mobile Alabama where final assembly of the A319 20 and 21 takes place.

The LMXT also features a boom (boom) and fully automated REVO which Airbus developed with the help of the Singapore Air Force which speeds up and makes fuel transfer operations safer. The system is called the A3R.

https://youtu.be/eKZ30lMnl9w

Another important aspect is the MRTT's advanced camera system. On the KC-46 this is one of the systems with the most problems on the new 767-2C-based tanker. Boeing is working to solve it but a solution in the form of a new system should only be incorporated in 2023.

The standard MRTT can already carry more fuel than the KC-46. The LMXT will have a total fuel capacity of 135 tonnes further widening the gap between the two planes. However unlike the Boeing aircraft it does not have its own cargo deck or side cargo door. In addition to REVO missions the KC-46 like the older KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-10 Extender is also used in logistical transport medical evacuation and other operations.

In the past Airbus joined forces with Northrop-Grumman to offer the A330 MRTT to the USAF and initially won the bid. However Boeing filed lawsuits and ended up reverting to its favor.

Today the KC-46 was acquired by the US and the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force but it continues to operate in a limited manner due to the series of problems it has been presenting. The obstacles brought billionaire losses to Boeing. The A330 is in service in France the United Arab Emirates Singapore the United Kingdom South Korea Australia and by the NATO Multinational Refueling Fleet an initiative with the participation of Germany Belgium Norway and the Netherlands. The MRTT is also certified to refuel B-1B C-17 E-3 E-7 F-15 P-8A A-10 F-35A and F-22 aircraft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L3ZpZGVvLXdoZW4tcmFmYWVsLWZpZ2h0ZXItamV0LSVFMiU4MCU5OHNob3QtZG93biVFMiU4MCU5OS1mLTIyLXJhcHRvci0xOTM5MznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video: When a Rafael Fighter Jet 'Shot Down' an F-22 Raptor,"Despite its amazing next-generation features that doesn’t mean that the F-22 Raptor is invincible.

The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor—a single-seat twin-engine all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft—is considered to be one of the most formidable fighter planes known to exist in the world.

“F-22 Raptor has delivered on its promise to provide unprecedented air dominance. The 5th Generation F-22’s unique combination of stealth speed agility and situational awareness combined with lethal long-range air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry makes it the best air dominance fighter in the world” Lockheed Martin’s website reads.

According to EurAsian Times “the fighter aircraft combines a revolutionary leap in technology and capability with reduced support requirements and maintenance costs. …The aircraft’s super-cruise along with its stealth integrated avionics and maneuverability gives its pilots a ‘first-look first-shot first-kill’ ability against enemy aircraft.”

It continued: “The Raptor not only has an inherent precision ground-attack capability but can also carry existing and planned short and medium-range air-to-air missiles in its internal bays. The F-22 also comes with an internal 20-mm cannon and provisions for carrying precision ground attack weapons.”

Not Invincible

Despite these amazing next-generation features that doesn’t mean that the F-22 Raptor is invincible. In fact it was once shot down by a fourth-generation fighter jet—Dassault’s Rafale. Thank goodness it was in a training exercise and not in actual combat.

“While remarkable in its own stead in comparison to the Raptor this French warplane doesn’t appear to be as impressive. It is a versatile ""omnirole"" fighter that can perform all kinds of missions and carry a very wide variety of weapons” the Times’ expert writes.

“However it can only reach a speed of 2 Mach slower than the Raptor’s top speed of 2.25 Mach. The F-22’s rate of climb maneuverability as well as avionics outpace those of the French jet” he continued.

What About the F-35?

With this in mind should Washington also be concerned about the F-35 known to be the most lethal and versatile aircraft of the modern era? Former Defense Secretary James Mattis even called the F-35 aircraft “critical” for America’s air superiority and applauded its ability to integrate seamlessly with allies who have purchased the jet.

“The F-35 serves as the backbone of allied airpower for thirteen nations and counting. Playing a critical role in joint domain operations the fighter brings unprecedented situational awareness information sharing and connectivity to the coalition” Lockheed Martin writes on its website.

The Times’ expert noted that the “F-35 has had more field experience than F-22. Unlike the Raptor which the U.S. refused to export so as to keep this advanced technology to itself the F-35 aircraft has been exported globally and is used by several U.S. allies.”

He continued: “Its unique avionics and stealth capabilities give the fighter an edge over most other warplanes known today. Just like the Raptor the F-35 is likely to have the advantage when it comes to stealth. … The twist though is likely to be in a Within Visual Range (WVR) combat situation. In dogfights the French jet can play to its strength. Rafale’s agility thrust-to-weight ratio and maneuverability are likely to prove lethal to the F-35. This would be a case of history repeating itself for an F-35 vs. Rafale dogfight is likely to be very similar to the exchange that happened between Rafale and the F-22 more than a decade ago.”

Lockheed Martin introduced the LMXT on 17 Sepember 2021 in response to the U.S. Air Force's KC-Y Program as America's next strategic tanker - said to be built in America by Americans for Americans. Lockheed Martins rebranding of the Airbus A330 MRTT aerial refueling tanker and Boeings KC-46A tanker will square off in the US Air Forces KC-Y Bridge Tanker competition for 140-160 orders.LMXT is a trademark of Lockheed Martin Corporation. Filed 24 March 2020 the LMXT covers Aircraft. There are many other entities that use the LMT acronym.

Changes from the baseline A330 MRTT include an upgraded suite of communications for joint all-domain command and control as well as improvements to range and fuel-offload capability. The LMXT a new version of the Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) will be designed to carry up to 271000 lb. of fuel which is 26000 lb. more than the baseline version of the widebody refueler now in service with 13 operators. Its competitor the KC-46 is designed now to carry 212000 lb. of fuel at most.

A decade earlier the KC-46 won the KC-X contract despite a narrower 33000-lb. fuel volume gap with the A330 MRTT. On 29 February 2008 Secretary of the Air Force Michael W. Wynne and Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. Duncan J. McNabb announced the selection of Northrup Grumman as the winner of the KC-X competition for development and procurement of up to 179 tanker aircraft for approximately $35 billion. The initial contract for the newly named KC-45 was for the system design and development of four test aircraft for $1.5 billion. This contract also includes five production options targeted for 64 aircraft at $10.6 billion.

The contract went to EADS a European country. Boeing argued however that it would create about 40000 American jobs here. Obviously with it going to EADS there won't be as many American jobs created. The requirements of the RFP were not such that this was taken into consideration. The RFP had to do with requirements that the warfighter needed and the Air Force balanced the requirements of the warfighter with the best value for the taxpayer relative to how much this system is going to cost and how well it's going to perform.

""The tanker is the number one procurement priority for us right now"" General McNabb said. ""Buying the new KC-45A is a major step forward and another demonstration of our commitment to recapitalizing our Eisenhower-era inventory of these critical national assets. Today is not just important for the Air Force however. It's important for the entire joint military team and important for our coalition partners as well. The KC-45A will revolutionize our ability to employ tankers and will ensure the Air Force's future ability to provide our nation with truly Global Vigilance Reach and Power.""

The KC-45A will provide significantly greater air refueling capabilities than the current fleet of Eisenhower-era KC-135 Stratotankers it will begin replacing. For example it will be able to refuel Air Force and Navy aircraft on every flight. These aircraft have different systems for receiving fuel and today KC-135s must be set up for one or the other before takeoff.

The KC-45A will be equipped for both systems on every flight and also will have connections for wing pods. When wing pods are installed it can refuel two probe-equipped aircraft such as those flown by Navy and many allied aircrews at the same time. The KC-45A can even be refueled in flight by other tankers. The KC-45A also will have defensive systems that allow it to go into dangerous environments that tanker aircrews currently have to avoid. It will also supplement the airlift fleet by carrying cargo passengers and medical patients in a secondary role.

The KC-X source selection used a ""best value"" determination to select a winner based on five factors: mission capability proposal risk past performance cost/price and an integrated fleet air refueling assessment -- performance in a simulated war scenario. These five factors were developed after consulting with industry and were finalized prior to starting the competition. Considered together these grading criteria ensured the Air Force maximized the capability delivered to the warfighter while optimizing the taxpayers' investment.

Air Force officials followed a carefully structured process designed to provide transparency maintain integrity and promote fair competition. Air Force officials met with offerors on numerous occasions to gain a thorough understanding of their proposals and provide feedback on their strengths and weaknesses. Officials also provided insight into government cost estimates throughout the process instead of waiting until the post-decision debrief. The competitors indicated they've been very pleased with the degree of communication.

The evaluation team comprised experts covering a broad spectrum of specialties from acquisition to operations and was hand-picked from across the Air Force and other government agencies. As part of the process Air Force officials provided a written notice to both the selected and not-selected and offer to provide a debrief on their bid proposals. To maintain the integrity of that process officials were unable to provide additional information about the proposals and contract.

But in 2011 the Air Force decision was based on the lowest-price technically acceptable offer. Only if the competing KC-X bids came within 1% on price would other factors such as fuel capacity be considered. Boeings bid price was 10% lower than the Airbus proposal so the difference in fuel volume played no role in the final decision. The Air Force contracted with Boeing in February 2011 to acquire 179 KC-46 tankers to begin recapitalizing the KC-135 Stratotanker fleet.

The Boeing KC-46 program used a $4.4 billion fixed-price incentive (firm target) development contract that provided contractor incentives to control costs and limits the governments liability for increased costs over a certain amount. By March 2021 estimated development costs were $900 million higher than the February 2011 contract award amount about 20% greater than the award amount.

In 2014 the program office in concert with Air Mobility Command officials will begin serious initial requirements work on the second phase known as KC-Y of the three-phase program to replace more of the aging tanker fleet.

Airbus is now well positioned in the competition to win Phase 2 and will take advantage of the difficulties of the KC-46. In December 2018 Lockheed Martin and Airbus signed an MoU to jointly explore opportunities to meet the growing demand for in-flight refuelling for US defence customers.

KC-45 Designation

The Air Force intended to designate its next aerial refueling aircraft the KC-45 regardless of whether Boeing's KC-767 or Northrop Grumman's KC-30 won the KC-X tanker replacement contest. The Air Force approved the designation on 14 November 2006 based on an Air Mobility Command recommendation.

But when the KC-767 finally won the KC-X competition it was given the KC-46 designation so presumably the KC-45 designation remains assigned to the Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) should it ever enter American service.

There were two series of C-planes one beginning in 1924 and ending in 1962 and another one beginning in 1962 and continuing to the present day. The Beechcraft Model 18 or ""Twin Beech"" as it was better known is a 6-11 place twin-engine low-wing conventional-gear aircraft that was manufactured by the Beech Aircraft Corporation of Wichita Kansas. This model saw service during and after World War II in a number of versions including the United States Army Air Forces C-45 Expeditor.

Andreas Parsch reports that ""The C-42 designation was not assigned. There is a very popular small sport plane which is marketed world-wide under the ""C-42"" (or ""C42"") label: the German Comco-Ikarus C-42. A DOD source said unofficially that there was some concern about potential legal issues if C-42 would be used for an MDS and that this number was therefore skipped. The designations C-43 and C-44 were skipped to avoid potential confusion with the existing T/CT-43 and T-44 designators. According to unofficial information from DOD there is an informal policy in effect to avoid duplication of ""well-known"" numbers. However C-45 was not skipped (KC-45A is the official MDS for the KC-X tanker program) and it remains unclear why T-45 should be any less ""well-known"" than T-43 and -44. One possible explanation is that both the T-43 (Boeing 707) and T-44 (Raytheon/Beech King Air) are transport-type airframes (the T-45 is a two-seat jet) and that it was therefore avoided to assign numbers 43 and 44 to other transport aircraft as well."" One authoritative source asserts that the C-43 is the US Coast Guard military version of Canadair CL-641 Challenger but there is no such aircraft.

Savion was 17 when he died unexpectedly Sept. 7.

His parents Fred Lowe and Latasha Sanders brought the Ford F-150 truck that was to be his high school graduation present to the Longmont car show hanging a banner from the truck that people could sign.

“Every parent wants to say their son is great” Fred Lowe said. “To see the affirmation from the community and everybody saying the same thing it’s been amazing. The community has really come out for our boy and let us know they love him and love us.”

Savion was born in Louisiana while his family is originally from a small town in Arkansas. Fred Lowe said they moved to Longmont from Boulder about five years ago adding the outpouring of support after his son’s death proved that Longmont is home.

“I’m just loving the love” he said. “I’ve never felt more at home.”

Family described Savion as a natural protector who fell in love with football at age 4. Along with his love of playing football Savion loved all animals loved to cook and loved music and playing drums. He also loved racing cars motorcycles and “anything and everything fast.”

Multiple Skyline High football players joined head coach Michael Silva at Sunday’s event to support the family. Silva said it’s hard to see the students hurting as they mourn their friend who he described as “bigger than life.”

“We all loved that dude” he said. “Anything we can do to honor and support him that’s what we will do. All we can do is love each other through it.”

Close friend and football teammate Adrian Rabun whose dad suggested the car show fundraiser said Savion lived by the golden rule: “Treat people how you want to be treated.”

“You would smile every time you saw him” he said. “Even if you didn’t know him you felt like you did. He cared about a lot of people.”

He said the support of the close-knit football team as well as seeing a big turnout at the fundraiser is helping as he mourns his friend.

“It feels great to just see how everyone is coming together to remember him and the impact he had on people” he said.

Rabun’s dad Mike Futrell is the vice president of the True Reflections Car Club which organized Sunday’s car show and raffle. Local business owner Dale Katechis who founded Oskar Blues Brewery offered his property for the event after the club learned they couldn’t use the Skyline High parking lot as planned.

More than 70 cars were entered in Sunday’s show.

Longmont’s Ken Mezze brought two cars — a ’69 El Camino featruring a detailed painting of Longmont’s old StarVu drive-in theater and a ’57 Chevy two-door hard top — to the show. He bought the ’57 after graduating high school and he’s restored it twice since then.

“The show is for a good cause” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9zaG9wLXZhYy12YWN1dW0td2lsbGlhbXNwb3J0LWxvd2VzLWNoaW5hLTIwMjEwOTE5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shop-Vac rebounds in Pa. under Chinese ownership after near-death experience,"Sandy Fox assembles a Shop-Vac vacuum cleaner on the company's assembly line in Williamsport Pa. Shop-Vac was left for dead a year ago by its previous owner but it got picked up by GreatStar Tools USA owned by a big Chinese tool maker. GreatStar has gotten Shop-Vac back up and operating in Pennsylvania under American management. Read more

WILLIAMSPORT Pa. — A year ago the founding family of Shop-Vac Corp. left town and abruptly shut down the iconic vacuum company leaving bankers to clean up the mess. Many workers feared that the company would be stripped and scrapped and that production of yet another American brand would be sent overseas.

But something happened on the way to extinction. The bank indeed sold Shop-Vac’s assets to a Chinese company. But the new owner through its subsidiary GreatStar Tools USA decided to keep Shop-Vac’s operations in Williamsport led by new American managers.

More than 200 of the old workers -- about half of the previous Pennsylvania workforce -- were retained or rehired this year. If the company rebounds as hoped the new managers say 100 more could be hired in the next year.

“We’re still in business” said an elated Brian Machmer a 25-year Shop-Vac veteran. He repairs the giant injection molds used to produce plastic canisters hoses and nozzles for wet-dry vacuums which were invented here in north-central Pennsylvania and now occupy places in millions of garages and shops across America. “I plan on finishing my career here” said Machmer 58.

“It’s very positive very exciting” said Robin Keller 42 a product manager who was let go by Shop-Vac last year found another job and then was persuaded to return to his old company in June.

Previous owners left a mess

Keller and others said the new Shop-Vac’s atmosphere is refreshing compared with the gloom of working at a company that had lost its bearings got buried under debt and could not compete.

Everybody knew there was mismanagement under the leadership of Jonathan Miller whose father founded Shop-Vac in 1953. But the company’s secretive leaders said little to the workforce and less to the community.

“It was scary” said Vincent Knauff 59 the engineering lab manager who has worked for Shop-Vac for half of his life. “You were scared to pick up the phone scared to answer a page.” Knauff who was unemployed for more than four months after the closure was announced on Sept. 15 2020 was rehired by the new owners this year.

Chinese owners went with a seasoned executive

GreatStar Tools USA which owns several other American hardware brands including Arrow Fasteners the maker of heavy-duty staple guns hired Charlie Lawrence a veteran marketing and brand management executive to turn around Shop-Vac.

Lawrence 63 grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs and has worked at several firms across the country including the last nine years as president for Workrite Ergonomics a California manufacturer of height-adjustable office accessories.

Lawrence said he and his wife longed to return to Pennsylvania to live near their son a pharmacist in West Norriton when GreatStar recruited him for Shop-Vac. His mission: Rebuild Shop-Vac’s culture and restore harmony with the mighty home-improvement store chains that control the retail market for hardware.

Rebuilding relationships

“A lot of relationships were damaged with our retail and distribution partners” said Lawrence who grew up in Parkesburg Chester County. “We have been spending a large part of our energy rekindling those relationships. Some have been very receptive because our competitors didn’t do a very good job while we were absent.”

Shop-Vac has signed a deal to supply Menards a Midwestern home-improvement chain with 300 outlets. And Lawrence said that the company is close to sealing a deal to be a primary brand at Lowe’s the second-largest national home-improvement chain after Home Depot. Lowe’s had been a key outlet for Shop-Vac before the company closed last year and it also has long-established supply relationships with other GreatStar Tools brands.

Shop-Vac’s pitch to retailers is that because it still produces the larger vacuum units in Pennsylvania it can more quickly fill orders than its major competitors who have moved nearly all production of wet-dry vacuums overseas. Deliveries of imported goods have slowed because of post-pandemic supply-chain congestion and logistics is no longer cheap: The cost to ship a container from China to America has soared to more than $20000 up from $3500 Lawrence said.

“That is putting incredible cost pressure on our competitors” said Lawrence. “It’s also creating empty shelves for the retailers and distributors because the supply is so unreliable. That’s a big advantage for us.”

As a bonus for Williamsport GreatStar is also relocating some manufacturing operations to Shop-Vac from another subsidiary SK Hand Tools a suburban Chicago company GreatStar acquired in July. SK makes premium ratchet wrenches and the kinds of tools that are now produced and used in Shop-Vac’s facility so GreatStar saw synergies in relocating some of its operations from Illinois to Shop-Vac’s sprawling plant.

“Chicago is a little higher-cost market to operate than in Williamsport” said Lawrence.

Business and political leaders in Williamsport who were blindsided by Shop-Vac’s closure are delighted with the company’s revival. They had feared the worst.

Jason Fink president of the Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce said that GreatStar was the only potential Shop-Vac buyer interested in maintaining operations in Williamsport. GreatStar outbid “a couple of U.S.-headquartered vacuum companies that were looking at shipping the brand to Mexico” he said.

When GreatStar announced in December it was buying Shop-Vac for $42 million the prospect of Chinese owners taking over one of Lycoming County’s prized manufacturers was not universally applauded. Amid a polarized political climate in which China is frequently cast as a villain Fink heard much grumbling that the new buyers would surely impose a Chinese work culture or worse dismantle operations and move out.

Fink said GreatStar’s actions speak to a company that is reestablishing local roots. Shop-Vac joined the Chamber of Commerce and reached out to community leaders something the previous owners had shunned.

“Shop-Vac has made a commitment to the Williamsport Area which is very good news” said Williamsport Mayor Derek Slaughter.

Shop-Vac held a two-day sale

Lawrence whose expertise is in marketing said he has changed some practices to send a more positive message to the workers and the community. He converted the old chief executive’s wood-paneled office into a conference room and moved his workspace among the other administrative offices. When he walks on the factory floor workers exchange friendly banter.

In August Shop-Vac held a two-day tent sale at its headquarters to empty its warehouses of odd lots of vacuums that it acquired at a discount from the previous owners. Its very American workforce conducted the sale. Buyers with pickup trucks lined up to buy Shop-Vacs at 40 cents on the dollar and the company sold $160000 in vacuums and filter bags in two days.

“I wanted to say thank you to the community and make sure the community knew we were back in business and we’re here to stay” said Lawrence. Employees told Lawrence the previous managers would never have conducted a similar event. “It’s part of building the culture giving to the community” he said.

A former employee at Shop-Vac sued the previous owners of the company in federal court in June alleging that Shop-Vac Corp. violated the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act by laying off workers without the required 60-day notice. But the current owner Shop-Vac USA LLC is not a party to the lawsuit.

Gary DuBoff the chief executive of GreatStar Tools USA said his company saw the Shop-Vac acquisition as a rare opportunity to acquire a brand so well-known that its name is synonymous with all wet-dry vacs. Though many people doubted him Duboff said GreatStar never considered dismantling the company.

“Once they found out who GreatStar was I don’t think anybody believed that this thing wasn’t going to close down and move to China and that would be the end of it” said DuBoff. “But that was never our plan. We all along wanted to make this more or less a U.S. manufacturing base and to try and bring it back to its former glory.”

DuBoff who grew up in Northeast Philadelphia and got a communications degree from Penn State said he encountered similar concerns four years ago when GreatStar acquired Arrow Fastener in Saddle Brook N.J. where he was president.

At the time GreatStar told him it only wanted to buy the company if the management team the employees and the plant were part of the deal. Under Chinese ownership he said nothing really changed in the way Arrow Fastener operated.

“Basically they said to me `We are not as familiar with operating a business in the United States as we are outside so we are relying on the team’s expertise to continue to run this business successfully’” said DuBoff. “And to their credit they have absolutely adhered to that. We do not have culture clashes because they don’t really operate the day-to-day business.”

GreatStar’s owner

GreatStar Tools USA is owned by Hangzhou GreatStar Industrial Co. Ltd. which describes itself as a leading manufacturer of hand tools in Asia serving markets worldwide. It was founded in 1993 by Qiu Jianping 59 an entrepreneur who has a master’s degree in engineering. Qiu also controls Hangcha Group one of China’s largest suppliers of forklift trucks and parts.

About $974 million or 71% of Hangzhou GreatStar’s $1.4 billion in 2020 sales were made in the United States according to the company’s annual report. Though its shares are traded on the Chinese stock exchange Qiu and his family own a controlling interest. Qui is listed as a multibillionaire by Forbes.

Lawrence said Qiu sometimes sends emails containing broad guidance for the company but is “very much hands-off.”

GreatStar seems to be following what it called a “glocal” approach to the U.S. market in which the parent company takes a global role for strategy and direction but leaves operational decision-making to local managers said Charles J. Skuba professor of the practice at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.

“They seem to be bent on this local management approach to the U.S. market which seems to be pretty smart” said Skuba.

But Skuba also cautioned that the early stages of foreign direct investment “are always the stage of big promises” and that the hand-tool industry does not have huge growth prospects. There likely will be some consolidation and reductions at Shop-Vac as GreatStar optimizes costs among its various operating units.

Lawrence acknowledges that Shop-Vac is unlikely to employ the 400 people who worked in Williamsport before last year nor the 1700 employees worldwide before it closed. GreatStar Tools USA will take over some of the marketing and distribution -- it maintains sales offices near the headquarters of major retailers like Lowe’s Home Depot and Walmart to service its big retail customers.

And Shop-Vac will consolidate operations in Williamsport from three buildings to two and is looking to sell surplus vacant properties it owns in Canton Pa. and in Binghamton N.Y. where the previous owners manufactured motors for its vacuums before relocating that business to Asia several years ago.

Lawrence said Shop-Vac will continue to produce motor assemblies for all of its vacuums in Asia and it will also continue to produce small Shop-Vacs -- under four gallons -- in China or in Vietnam to reduce tariff costs. Those smaller household vacuums sell at a lower profit margin and they can still be produced in Asia at a lower cost.

“The only way we’re going to be able to rebuild this company is to be smart” said Lawrence. “Obviously we’re going to need workers to do that. But we’re going to be more efficient about how we do things.”

The alternatives could be worse according to Skuba the Georgetown business expert:

“It’s much better to be acquired by somebody who wants to expand in the marketplace” he said “than by somebody who’s going to strip you of your assets and reduce overhead.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL21pbm5pZS1mYXllLWxvd2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NjUxODk5MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnie Faye Lowe Obituary (1941 - 2021) - Louisa KY,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/minnie-faye-lowe-obituary?id=6518990 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL21pbm5pZS1mYXllLWxvd2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NjUxODk5MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjEvMDkvMTkvdGltZXNoYXJlLW5pZ2h0bWFyZS1taWxpdGFyeS1uZXdlc3QtdmljdGltLXByZWRhdG9yeS1zYWxlcy1waXRjaC84MzM5OTQwMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Timeshare nightmare: Military newest victim of predatory sales pitch,"Lee Hinkle

Guest columnist

Staff Sgt. Mike Lowe had just returned from a six-month deployment home to his wife Chivon and their 6-month-old child. Chivon is a master sergeant and they were looking for some better life balance.

“We were newly married with a child and we were hard workers” Mike said. “We wanted to make sure we had time for ourselves. This was a good idea to force us to take a yearly vacation.”

“This” was a timeshare. But instead of honoring the Lowes’ military service the salesperson for timeshare operator Wyndham leveraged it as a sales pitch.

“They played off the thing of ‘you deploy and it might be a year or two before you see each other’” Mike recalled. “They said ‘this might be a good opportunity to ensure that you use that valuable time.’”

Preying on a young military family is a new low even for “Timeshare Nightmare” stories. Otherwise the Lowes’ tale sounds too familiar – a manipulative sales pitch accompanied by false promises fine print and fees … lots of fees.

The Lowes’ story is why the Florida Alliance for Consumer and Taxpayers (FACT) has launched a public education campaign against these “Timeshare Nightmares.”

As Florida works to dig out of its economic hole and individual consumers try to get back to some semblance of ‘normal’ the state's overly-aggressive timeshare industry has its fangs out. At FACT we’ve started hearing from more and more Floridians who have been inundated with pitches urging them to spend their hard-earned money on timeshares.

With the industry ramping up its sales efforts it seems like an important time to make sure consumers know to be extremely cautious in dealing with timeshare salespeople so they can avoid this Timeshare Nightmare.

The Lowes ended up losing about $20000 and got virtually nothing in return. Shortly after they signed Wyndham told them the program had changed and they couldn’t use the properties they had signed up for. But a “new” plan – at even greater expense – could provide what they wanted.

It all led to sometimes unbearable stress.

“I can remember going through our bills and just standing in the kitchen” said Chivon her voice trailing off as she remembered the stress. Mike took over: “Mentally and emotionally it put a lot of strain on our marriage.”

Not to mention their careers – with the Lowes struggling to make mortgage payments they worried about bad credit hurting their security clearance and threatening their military status. And then the reality hit that what they signed meant their children would take over the deed – and the ever-increasing fees that came with the program.

“It felt like we were a prisoner to Wyndham” Mike said.

Fortunately the Lowes were able to escape their “timeshare nightmare” with some legal help and countless phone calls. But by then the financial and emotional damage had been done.

What would they tell others being courted with too-good-to-be-true timeshare offers?

Chivon started talking about the fine print and such when Mike interrupted and said simply: “Don’t do it.”

At FACT we call on all “Timeshare Nightmare” offenders to stop these practices which prey on military families and so many others. Learn more about Timeshare Nightmares at timesharenightmare.com

Although the two companies are very different there's some strange similarities.

Most viewers who heard of LulaRoe before watching the Amazon Prime Video documentary LulaRich knew how different Lululemon and LulaRoe are. However others tend to get the two companies mixed up. They sound alike with all of those “L” s and they both sell leggings. You probably have a friend who insists they are the same thing and it turns out that they are more correct than you might think.

‘LulaRich’: Jill Drehmer | Amazon Studios

‘LulaRich’ details how LulaRoe was created differently than Lululemon

The LulaRoe documentary LulaRich details exactly how the company began in 2012 and its downfall beginning around 2017. LulaRoe differs from Lululemon in that there are no brick-and-mortar stores that customers can shop at. Instead LulaRoe is a multi-level marketing company founded by DeAnne Brady and her husband Mark Stidham in 2012. To purchase leggings or other women’s clothing items from LulaRoe a consumer must find a person often called a retailer. LulaRoe does sell its products online; however individual retailers have different patterns and prints. They also primarily use social media for marketing. Each retailer purchases products from LulaRoe at wholesale prices and then marks it up for the consumer. When Brady and Stidham founded the company individuals paid LulaRoe anywhere from $5000 to $10000 to begin selling the products.

LulaRoe and Lululemon have different business models. Chip Wilson founded Lululemon Athletica in 1998 in Vancouver British Columbia. They specialized in yoga pants and yoga wear for women upon creation. However the company expanded to athletic wear and lifestyle apparel and now has an extensive line of men’s clothing also. Lululemon has almost 500 stores where they sell internationally. However it does primarily use social media including Facebook Twitter and Instagram for marketing.

LulaRoe and Lululemon employees and outsiders both compare their company to a cult

As detailed in LulaRich LulaRoe asks its retailers to travel to conferences dress alike and chant “LulaRoe.” The former consultants described how the owners DeAnne and Mark Stidham expected the retailers to keep up an appearance of wealth and confidence. The Amazon Prime LulaRoe documentary displays how retailers felt that they were inside of a cult. At one convention Mark began reading from the book of Mormon.

“Oh my God I’m in a cult” one former LulaRoe designer said in LulaRich.

Similar to LulaRoe Lululemon asks employees to attend seminars within their first year of employment. According to Business Insider the workshops encourage attendees to pursue personal growth. Consumer Search found that Lululemon asks its employees to become “educators” on the new lifestyle they want their customers to achieve. They might help you with a new diet or encourage you to find a new gym. The outlet also found employees think Lululemon targets one specific audience similar to LulaRoe — white women.

“It’s the first time I’ve heard of anyone almost directly using the techniques of cults and applying them to their business” Douglas Atkin author of The Culting of Brands said about Lululemon.

Testimony from previous LulaRoe retailers and former Lululemon employees indicated that they both felt pressured to act and look the same.

Both companies primarily market their products on social media

Although LulaRoe and Lululemon have different business models they both use social media for marketing. Facebook users often scroll across live videos of LulaRoe retailers selling products in their feed. Lululemon encourages its employees to share their fitness and wellness journey through social media.

Although LulaRoe’s leggings are much cheaper than Lululemon’s sometimes $100 leggings the two businesses have some strange similarities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vYXRsYW50YWNpdmljY2lyY2xlLm9yZy8yMDIxLzA5LzE5L2JldGhzaGViYS1yZW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bethsheba Rem,"Bethsheba “Queen Sheba” Rem is running for Atlanta Board of Education District 2.

What is the biggest issue facing your constituents and why are you the best candidate to address it?

The biggest issue facing APS especially in District 2 is the lack of resources. The South Side has been the most consistently underfunded area of our school system. By leveraging the APS Center for Equity and Social Justice and its expertise we can properly fund the classrooms that have been neglected for too long. Fixing this requires an entirely new approach to how resources are distributed equitably to our students and staff. I understand this new approach because I grew up in an under-resourced school district fighting for everything I have. As an activist as a professor and as a leader I will bring that fresh perspective.

The pandemic has brought unique challenges to public schools including mask mandates and hybrid learning. What is a lesson you have learned from these challenges?

I think first we need to give credit to those that steered us through the beginning of an ever changing crisis. No one quite knew what we were facing in the beginning and not only did we adjust the children have done an excellent job of navigating uncertainty. That being said as a board member it would be my job to ensure that there would be as little uncertainty as possible. This means looking hard at hybrid learning being a key part of education but not the answer to all our problems. This means balancing the interests of students and families with the resources available. Most importantly this means increasing the support we give students who may be lacking it at home or outside of the classroom. We need every student to feel safe and valued.

What is the future of virtual learning in APS?

As I pointed out above Virtual and Hybrid learning are an important component of being able to reach students where they are but we cannot rely on it as a one size fits all solution. We need to make sure support is equitable by design to do that we have to look at how students have different levels of access safety and support outside the classroom. As a professor I have experience working with students in a variety of situations and helping build learning modules for that specific student greatly increases success.

Atlanta Public Schools is operating under a recently adopted “equity and social justice” policy. What is your definition of those terms in public education?

This new policy spearheaded by the mission to ensure students thrive by design is a great guide to ensuring all students are educated on the same playing field. I grew up in underserved schools so I take the ideas of equity and social justice very seriously. These things are as personal to me as they are to the APS student who didn’t have lunch or internet access last year. I look forward to using these guiding missions to make sure every student feels full safe and educated.

APS Superintendent Lisa Herring is over a year into a three-year contract that the next Board of Education will have to consider extending or replacing. What is your opinion of Herring’s job performance?

Like I said before I think Superintendent Herring deserves credit for taking on a challenge no one knew how to navigate. I believe that she did her best to make sure student safety came first as well as the safety of the faculty and staff. 1 year is a bit too early into a 3 year contract for me to make a commitment one way or another but I can promise you that I will be watching Dr. Herring’s actions and listening to what the students and families of our district are saying. Leaders don’t operate in a vacuum and I know the students and families of my District can be the experts of their own experience and I look forward to hearing from them.

The Board of Education last year demanded that the Development Authority of Fulton County cease granting tax abatements to developments within the City of Atlanta. Should the board maintain that position and why or why not?

The BOE should absolutely maintain this position as I do. Every single dollar kept from students defunds and strains out resources especially during a pandemic. Many of these developments have been given ample tax breaks from the City of Atlanta in hopes it would bring new business or jobs but our elementary middle and high schools are who lose. As a hardworking Atlantan who pays their taxes I know we need everyone to pay their fare share and pitch in if we are going to build a school system where students succeed by design.

What are some areas of opportunity for the Atlanta City Council to work in partnership with the Atlanta Public Schools superintendent and board?

Atlanta City Council should really work to get on the same page with APS without stepping on toes. I think that increased communication can come from Board members bringing concerns to a more receptive City Council. This might be a way to better balance properties city wide. Take for example the tax abatement issue from above. The Fulton County Development Authority is not the only body in the city that considers tax abatements. As an activist leader I know how to speak and be heard and I know bringing APS and City Council closer together would result in better more equitable resources for our students.

What are some areas of opportunity for the Atlanta Public Schools superintendent and board to work with the mayor and City Council?

The answer to this question is almost the same as to the one above. One big difference is the Mayor has an opportunity to be more involved with our students on a personal level. I know if she were invited to visit with more students and families by APS the board would see more responsiveness from City Hall.

Anything else that you want to share for voters who may be undecided?

As a hard working innovative activist leader my goal is to bring a unique creative approach to bringing a quality education for ALL children in Atlanta Public Schools. This means making sure resources are equitably distributed and students have their needs met before during and after school. Our students will always come first for me because I know what it’s like to learn in an underserved school system.

Group (M) Berhad (KLSE:MRDIY) Is Paying Out A Dividend Of MYR0.01,"Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad (KLSE:MRDIY) will pay a dividend of MYR0.01 on the 21st of June. The dividend yield is 1.8% based on this payment which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry.

View our latest analysis for Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad

Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad's Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings

While yield is important another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. Prior to this announcement Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.

The next year is set to see EPS grow by 36.1%. If the dividend continues along recent trends we estimate the payout ratio will be 22% which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.

Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad's Dividend Has Lacked Consistency

The track record isn't the longest but we are already seeing a bit of instability in the payments. The dividend has gone from an annual total of MYR0.0195 in 2020 to the most recent total annual payment of MYR0.032. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad has grown distributions at a rapid rate despite cutting the dividend at least once in the past. Companies that cut once often cut again so we would be cautious about buying this stock solely for the dividend income.

The Dividend Has Limited Growth Potential

Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad's earnings per share has shrunk at 80% a year over the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. It's not all bad news though as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.

Our Thoughts On Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad's Dividend

Overall it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment but we think that longer term the current level of payment might be unsustainable. In the past the payments have been unstable but over the short term the dividend could be reliable with the company generating enough cash to cover it. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.

It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example we've picked out 1 warning sign for Mr D.I.Y. Group (M) Berhad that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Magical' $1.8M treehouse-like home in the Oakland Hills for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/magical-treehouse-like-home-oakland-hills-19451043.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Still Reigning With $52M-$55M Opening – Saturday Box Office Update,"SATURDAY AM: For those hooked on a theory last weekend that star power no longer works in opening films their concerns are further underscored this weekend as a bunch of no-name apes are driving 20th Century Studios/Disney’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes to what might be the biggest B.O. opening this May of $52M-$55M. This is all fueled by PLFs and Imax screens which are delivering 44% of the weekend’s till. Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits showed that 43% of the moviegoers bought tickets because they love the franchise natch.

We’ll see if a Cannes Premiere this week can lift Furiosa past its current $40M-$50M projection but word of mouth is excellent out of early screenings for the George Miller directed Mad Max: Fury Road prequel. Unlike Disney with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny last Cannes a movie that wasn’t ready for primetime Warners is truly in pole position here to blast Furiosa off.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes posted a very good Friday of $22.2M thanks to late night business which isn’t that far from the first Friday results of Tim Burton’s 2001 version ($24.6M) and ahead of Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M) and pennies lighter than War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M). However the Wes Ball directed version of the 56-year old franchise gets a B Cinemascore and 3 1/2 stars/77% on Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak so hopefully these apes don’t lose their muscle. On a whole 85% of the CinemaScore audience gave Kingdom an A or a B. That’s one of the lowest grades for an Apes movie in the millennium down there with Burton’s which got a B-. Rotten Tomatoes’ audience score has eased to 79%. Still good on Disney for getting this movie opened their first try with the franchise post 20th Century Fox. Despite the audience exits there’s confidence at Disney for the sequel to arrive at the higher end of its projections due to its better-than-expected Friday.

Social media monitor RelishMix detected mixed to positive word of mouth before Kingdom‘s opening. That said on the bright side: “Fans anticipating the sequel seem excited primarily because of one thing — sheer love for the past three films. ‘This looks freaking incredible. I gotta rewatch all the previous ones before this comes out. These movies are so cool.’ The quality of the past films is driving immense interest in this one” ‘This is one of the best franchises ever made. Every movie was awesome. A near-perfect trilogy. I was not expecting a fourth installment but man this looks great!’ Whatever direction the Apes franchise goes next it looks like fans will follow.”

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes saw 64% men turnout with 18-34 year olds repping 57% of the audience with the 25-34 year old segment being the biggest demo at close to a third. Solid diversity demos in 35% Caucasian 27% Latino and Hispanic 22% Black and 9% Asian. Those moviegoers going bananas for this sequel were in the South South Central and West. AMC Burbank is currently the highest grossing theater in the nation with $67K.

The social media universe for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes stands at 331.6M followers across TikTok Facebook X YouTube and Instagram. Compared to other action sci-fi comps Kingdom‘s smu runs 24% above genre norms but below recent pics such as Dune: Part Two (575.7M) and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (508.8M) and even Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (393M).

Ryan Gosling in ‘The Fall Guy’ Universal Pictures

Universal’s second weekend of Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt’s Fall Guy is eyeing $14.4M -48% a very good hold. The second weekend is better than Lost City‘s -51% but a little lighter as that Sandra Bullock-Channing Tatum film posted $14.7M. The pic’s slither out of the gate had more to do with the marketplace and the insider type of movie that it was and less about stars — it was Gosling’s third highest opening of his career. Some were even put off by the mixed genres. “It’s a problem when you’re pushing a romantic comedy and a majority of men show up” sniped one rival studio source.

Elsewhere there’s Briarcliff Entertainment’s comedy satire Not Another Church Movie booked at 1108 theaters which had no P&A spend and is resulting in $120K Friday and a $300K 3-day. Critics didn’t think it was funny at 17% on RT nor did moviegoers at 44%. Johnny Mack wrote and directed the movie which stars Mickey Rouke as the Devil Jamie Foxx as God and Kevin Daniels as Taylor Pharry.

Overall weekend stands at $93.8M which is 27% ahead of last weekend but 7% off from the same frame in May a year ago when the second weekend of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 delivered $62M.

Wes Ball’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes from 20th Century Studios the first Apes release under the Disney empire is looking at $21M-$22M today (which includes previews) for a what is looking like a $52M-$55M opening at 4075 theaters. Tracking saw it around $50M.

Also the opening is in the vicinity of the first and third chapter of the previous millennium trilogy: 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M Friday $54.8M 3-day) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M Friday $56.2M 3-day). RT Audience sentiment is still at 82%.

5.) Godzilla x Kong (WB/Leg) 2531 theaters Fri $700K 3-day $3M -34% Total $192.3M/Wk 7

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/florida-a-m-backs-away-from-dubious-237m-donation-00157234 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The quake’s epicenter was located in Carson in Los Angeles County.

As of about 8:30 p.m. the city of Carson received no reports of earthquake-caused damage though some residents expressed concern about flaring at a nearby Marathon Petroleum refinery.

A spokesperson for Marathon confirmed the flares which are “safety devices” were “functioning as intended” the Los Angeles Times reported.

Though there were no major injuries or damage reported those who felt the earthquake were still shaken.

Carson resident Deshon Harris said the quake shook his car “like crazy.”

“If you can shake a 4000 pound car it’s a problem” Harris said.

Hundreds of reactions poured in after news of the quake was posted to KTLA’s Facebook page with one person calling the temblor “a scary one.”

“I literally heard it coming” the Facebook user wrote. “The house was rumbling for a good 10 seconds.”

Another user doubted that even a preliminary magnitude of 4.4 was high enough saying they believed the quake “was way bigger than that.”

A magnitude 3.0 aftershock struck near Carson at 11:06 p.m. according to the USGS.",,,,,,,,,

This enchanting city offers her fortunate guests a fascinating glimpse into a rich and colourful tapestry of art history and culture.

Nestled on the banks of the Dâmbovița River Bucharest attracts visitors from all over the world keen to experience life in the city known as the ‘Paris of the East’ in the 1900s. The locals are proud of their very own Arc de Triomphe built in 1922 in memory of fallen compatriots lost in WWI and the Romanian Athenaeum building included on the list of European Heritage sites is a very popular venue which presents classical music concerts and is home to the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra.

The Romanian Athenaeum is home to the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra.

For a glimpse of history take a leisurely stroll along Victory Avenue named after the 1877 – 1878 Russo Turkish war when Romania fighting with the Russians gained independence from the Ottoman Empire. The road was originally built with oak beams in 1692 linking Old Princely Court a residence constructed during the rule of Vlad III Dracula in the 15th century to the Mogosoaia Palace a fine example of Romanian Renaissance architecture and once a popular meeting place in the 1930s for prominent politicians and international society.

Make your way to the Lipscani district a meandering maze of streets which reflect an affluent air of a bygone era in the 1400s when blacksmiths furriers and cobblers vied for passing trade on the narrow cobblestone streets. Today the area houses intriguing antique shops and bustling art galleries and with the enticing aroma of the local coffee houses hanging in the air stop for a shot of caffeine and a pastry before continuing your journey.

Head for the rectangular courtyard known as Hanul cu Tei and be prepared to be mesmerised by an abundance of quirky shops again brimming with art and antiques. Even the most resistant will be persuaded to browse for hours and ultimately to part with a substantial sum of Romanian Leu.

The Parliament Palace is one of the city’s most imposing buildings

To view a vast collection of national treasures visit the National Art Museum founded in 1948 to display the royal collection which dates back to the 15th century.

There is also a display of Brancusi sculpture which is a simply magnificent.

For those with a thirst for traditional culture visit the Museum of the Romanian Peasant located on Șoseaua Kiseleff. The museum displays the most wonderful examples of colourful traditional costumes beautiful ceramics and icons and an extensive array of other artefacts associated with Romanian peasant life. During Romania’s Communist era the museum only displayed exhibits representing and approved by the Communist party. Six weeks after the fall of Communism the building reopened with the focus on celebrating Romanian traditional culture and all the artefacts that were associated with Communism were moved to a room in the basement where they can still be viewed.

The Central University Library was founded in 1895

The Museum of Romanian History located within the former postal palace on Calea Victoriei is another popular attraction and displays include expansive collections of artefacts reflecting Romanian history and culture dating back from the contemporary era to prehistoric times.

The credit card company last month froze donations to the Alliance for Global Justice (AFGJ) which provides funding to the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network a group that Israel labeled a terrorist organization earlier this year the Washington Free Beacon first reported.

Israeli officials declared in February that Samidoun a pro-Boycott Divestment Sanctions group that helps free Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons acts abroad on the behalf of the U.S.-designated terrorist group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).

Discover has not said why it severed ties with AFGJ but the decision came after the Zachor Legal Institute pressured the company to do so according to email correspondence shared with Fox News.

Zachor founder Marc Greendorfer praised the move by Discover but slammed other major credit card companies for not following suit.

Mastercard Visa and American Express began blocking donations to Samidoun in January 2020 but they currently still allow donations to AFGJ which lets people donate to Samidoun through its website the Free Beacon noted.

""There are a number of federal laws that prohibit funding for terror connected organizations and we reached out to the four credit card companies (AmEx Visa and MasterCard along with Discover) that had been used by the Alliance for Global Justice for the benefit of Samidoun"" Greendorfer told Fox News in a statement.

""What surprised us is that only Discover seemed to understand the law and the risks it faced for violating the law"" he continued. ""We appreciate that Discover has done the right thing to shut off terror funding in this case but we can’t believe that the other three companies didn’t respond and didn’t apparently shut down funding to Samidoun.""

Teams Competing: Energy Standard London Roar LA Current Tokyo Frog Kings

Omega Live Results

Match 8 of the 2021 ISL regular season features 3 teams that have been in the ISL Final each of the past 2 years as well as season 2 newcomers the Tokyo Frog Kings. Fans can expect this match to feature an exciting fight for 1st between Energy Standard and the London Roar while the LA Current and the Tokyo Frog Kings duke it out for 3rd.

TEAM ROSTERS/DEPTH CHARTS

Butterfly

Energy Standard brings in a strong fly crew with the likes of Chad le Clos Anastasia Shkurkai Maddie Banic and Kregor Zirk. Additionally Helena Bach Rosendahl Mary-Sophie Harvey and Andrey Zhilkin can also step in if needed. London meanwhile roars back with Emma McKeon Marie Wattel Ilaria Bianchi and Laura Lahtinen on the women’s side and Vini Lanza Teppei Morimoto and Dylan Carter on the men’s.

The LA Current doesn’t have as much depth in butterfly but some of the greatest races in ISL history have happened when Tom Shields and le Clos are in the pool together. Tomoe Hvas and Maxime Rooney provide great support for Shields in the fly. On the women’s side Anna Ntountounaki and Helena Gasson have been solid point-scorers this season though neither has fully filled in for Beryl Gastaldello who LA has used in a rather limited capacity so far this season.

The Tokyo Frog Kings have a great group of butterflyers with Aly Tetzloff Leah Gingrich Harriet Jones Daiya Seto and Takeshi Kawamoto their only problem is that their fly group also gets called upon to swim other events spreading them a little thin. For instance expect to see Tetzloff in sprint freestyle and backstroke Gingrich in the 200 and 400 IMs and possibly the 200/400 freestyle and Seto to be in anything from the 400 IM to the 200 breast.

Edge: Energy Standard (women & men)

Backstroke

Energy Standard has arguably the strongest men’s backstroke squad in the league thanks to Evgeny Rylov and Kliment Kolesnikov while Travis Mahoney is a good support player. For the women Georgia Davies Mary-Sophie Harvey and Simona Kubova are all pretty good but they don’t quite stand up on the level of other team’s namely London and Cali. Perhaps Energy’s greatest drawback in backstroke is that Rylov and Kolesnikov are also likely to be called upon in freestyle while other teams like London can use their backstrokers exclusively for backstroke.

The London Roar have an incredible female duo with Minna Atherton and Kira Toussaint while Guilherme Guido Luke Greenbank and Christian Diener create a very strong men’s backstroke crew.

Ingrid Wilm has been a pleasant surprise for the LA Current this season twice breaking the Canadian Record in the 100 backstroke. On the men’s side Apostolos Christou Maxime Rooney and Tomoe Hvas have been left to do the heavy lifting in Ryan Murphy‘s absence and they’ve done pretty well. Kathleen Baker and Abrahm DeVine provide good backstroke support for LA.

The Tokyo Frog Kings benefit greatly from Grigory Tarasevich Richard Bohus and Takeshi Kawamoto on the men’s side. Their women’s backstroke is a little sparse however with Cassie Wild Aly Tetzloff and Paige Madden left to cover events that at least two of them don’t strictly specialize in.

Edge: London Roar (women & men)

Breaststroke

Energy Standard has one of the strongest breaststroke crews in the league with Ilya Shymanovich Felipe Lima and Charlie Swanson on the men’s side as well as Evgenia Chikunova Benedetta Pilato and Jessica Vall on the women’s side. Shymanovich Pilato and Chikunova could win multiple events though London will likely bring them their greatest competition. Annie Lazor and Alia Atkinson are a very strong duo for London though the London men suffer a little without Adam Peaty instead relying on Ross Murdoch and Sam Williamson.

The LA Current probably has the weakest breaststroke roster of the four teams. Julia Sebastian Imogen Clark Anastasia Gorbenko Sarah Franceschi Will Licon and Christopher Rothbauer will need to step it up in order to get any significant points for LA this weekend.

The Tokyo Frog Kings have a strong breaststroke crew with Kanako Watanabe Miranda Tucker Daiya Seto Yasuhiro Koseki and Alessandro Pinzuti and should be able to get some decent points on the board.

Edge: London Roar (women) Energy Standard (men)

Freestyle

Energy Standard is stacked stacked stacked in freestyle. For the men Ben Proud Marco de Tullio Simonas Bilis and Clement Mignon represent true freestyle specialists while other stroke specialists such as le Clos Kolesnikov and Rylov are all extraordinarily capable freestylers as well. On the women’s side Siobhan Haughey Fanny Teijonsalo and Maddie Banic are the true freestyle specialists while Shkurdai Bach Rosendahl and Harvey comprise an excellent support class.

The London Roar also has an incredible freestyle group with Duncan Scott Kyle Chalmers Dylan Carter Kenzo Simons Katsumi Nakamura Zac Incerti and Ed Mildred on the men’s side. London’s female freestylers include Emma McKeon Marie Wattel Kim Busch and Freya Anderson really covering every distance from the 50 to the 400.

The LA Current has a great group of female freestylers also including Abbey Weitzeil Madison Wilson Valentine DuMont and Beryl Gastaldello. The men’s roster is also pretty strong but has not shown as much promise as the women’s has in season 3 except in middle-distance where Fernando Scheffer and Martin Malyutin are two of the best in the league. Ryan Held Maxime Rooney Brett Pinfold and Vladislav Bukhov comprise LA’s male sprint crew and have put together some solid relays this season but comparatively aren’t as strong as Energy or London.

The Tokyo Frog Kings bring in top-end speed with Vladimir Morozov Bowe Becker and Aly Tetzloff and also have Paige Madden and Nandor Nemeth to cover middle-distance. Gabby DeLoof Mallory Comerford Julie Meynen Chihiro Igarashi Pedro Spajari Ivan Girev and Maarten Brzoskowski round out Tokyo’s freestyle crew though of the four teams competing in Match 8 theirs is probably the weakest.

Edge: Energy Standard (women & men)

IM

The London Roar probably has the strongest IM crew of the teams competing in Match 8. Duncan Scott Sydney Pickrem Vini Lanza Christian Diener and Katie Shanahan make for a potent combination of swimmers that can both win their races and place top-5. Essentially London has the top-end talent and the depth in the IMs. The Tokyo Frog Kings can hit back at them hard on the top-end with the likes of Daiya Seto and Yui Ohashi though their support swimmers such as Leah Gingrich and Daniil Pasynkov will need to be on their A-game to score any significant points in the medleys.

Energy Standard has Mary-Sophie Harvey Viktoriya Gunes and Helena Bach Rosendahl on the women’s side and Charlie Swanson Maxim Stupin and Travis Mahoney on the men’s side. All together a formidable roster though the women have significantly out-performed the men this season making the men’s IM one of Energy Standards only weak points.

LA Current has the weakest IM crew of the four teams competing this weekend though Tomoe Hvas and Anastasia Gorbenko have been huge contributors for the Current and are capable of top-3 finishes in the 100 and 200 IMs. Beyond those two Abrahm DeVine Sarah Franceschi and Beryl Gastaldello round out LA’s IM group. Gastaldello is the ISL Record holder in the 100 IM though as mentioned earlier LA has been using her sparingly this season so there’s little certainty what she’ll swim.

Edge: London Roar (women & men)

Relays

Florent Manaudou and Femke Heemskerk return for Energy Standard though as relay-only swimmers. Even so each is capable of big freestyle splits and will likely provide a major boost to Energy’s already stacked relays. Energy Standard is also the odds-on favorite in all three medley relays though London has a chance in the women’s and mixed medley relays. Tokyo is probably weakest in the medley relays while LA’s women’s freestyle relay represents the greatest threat to Energy thanks to Weitzeil and Wilson.

India beat Bahrain 3-2 (25-15 25-23 20-25 23-25 16-14) in the playoff for ninth place.

The GE Sridharan-coached Indian team was dominant in the first two sets but withered in the third and a shift in momentum soon allowed Bahrain to come back into the match at 2-2.

In a hard-fought final set Bahrain led 4-1 early on before India made a comeback and eventually took the match.

Incidentally India had begun their campaign with a straight-sets loss to Bahrain last Sunday. The Indian spikers then went on to lose to Qatar and Japan to finish bottom of Group A and did not progress to the last eight.

Korean kings Vision Strikers finally qualified for their first international LAN and managed to finish in the top half of the table. While Iceland champions Sentinels were expected to launch another assault on the world’s best before falling unceremoniously to Envy.

Colin Young-Wolff Riot Game Sentinels were looking to defend their Masters trophy in Berlin but it was Gambit who took home the hardware this time.

The Kurukuru saw out their FIFA Futsal World Cup campaign with a 4-9 loss to Thailand in Kaunas. A thoroughly entertaining match that saw both teams pull their goalkeepers off the court towards the end.

After the match the entire Solomon Islands team gathered in a circle at the centre of the court. Speaking to Football in Oceania in the mixed zone after the match head coach Vinicius Leite says he told the boys that they’d made their families proud.

“I told them they made everyone proud their relatives and families. We will definitely come back stronger and people will see a different team now that the foundation has been laid. Now we can start developing better players. We want to not be admired but feared by other teams” Vinicius said.

The Solomon Islands are most likely the only team to not have a single proper futsal court in their country. Leite has several times prior talked about the importance of one and there is one on the way set to be finished next year.

“We keep saying we don’t have a venue we don’t have this or that but we decided to come here and we tried our best with the limitations we have. I don’t think any other team face what we face because they all have a futsal court. That’s our biggest issue. It’s not too much to ask just to have a space to train.”

Even though the score got a little bloated in the end there were several times that the Solomons were within striking distance of getting on level terms with the Thai side.

“Before the goals we were chasing the win but it didn’t come. But to be able to score some goals against a well-drilled team shows that we can do it” Leite said.

“We gotta come back home and put together the plan development and execution and in the future we can score many more goals.”

While Leite’s contract runs out after this World Cup in Lithuania he’s hopeful to stay on for another World Cup cycle.

“I hope I did a good enough job to be able to stay with them longer this is not a short-term project. In 2022 they will open their stadium in 2023 we have the Pacific Games and in 2024 there’s another World Cup.”

“It’s a three year plan that I’ve put together. The federation has seen it they agree and hopefully I can be the person in charge and if not they’ll be in great hands” Leite said.

The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcnVzc2VsbC13aWxzb24tY2FsbGVkLW1lLWFzLXNvb24tYXMtaS1nb3QtZHJhZnRlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mason McCormick: Russell Wilson Called Me 'As Soon As I Got Drafted',"To hammer home the point one more time Russell Wilson is embracing all of his new teammates especially the ones tasked with protecting the quarterback. As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields. At 35 years old with a Super Bowl ring Wilson is regarded as a hard-worker who wants to lead and rally the group.

Beyond leadership the unit needs to be more productive an offense that’s flailed and sputtered three seasons running. Talent and skill will be the main reasons why Pittsburgh succeeds or fails but having a tight-knit team where everyone is included from starting quarterback to fourth-round guard is often a hidden factor in how to maximize a group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL25mbC1kcmFmdC1uZXdzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zb3V0aC1kYWtvdGEtc3RhdGUtbWF0dC16aW1tZXIvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0MDUxMDAwMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Mason McCormick contribute to the Steelers' OL in 2024?,

Patricia Stella accepts the Greater Pittston Chamber of Commerce 2021 Outstanding Business of the Year Award on behalf of herself and her son Richard Corbin of Q.S.C.Enterprises/McDonald’s at the chamber’s 101st annual dinner on Aug. 26.

McDonalds Kidder St. owner Patricia Stella donated a check of $500 to Bill Jones president/CEO United Way of Wyoming Valley in 2019.

PITTSTON — During late summer the Greater Pittston Chamber of Commerce (GPCC) announced the 2021 Outstanding Business of the Year Award going to Pat Stella and her son Richard Corbin of Q.S.C. Enterprises/McDonalds.

Stella president of the organization owns and operates nine McDonald’s in Northeastern Pennsylvania.

Growing up in Illinois Pat Stella grew up in a lower-middle income family and had her sights on becoming an educator. Upon receiving her teaching degree she taught for two years before her parents relocated to Northeastern Pennsylvania after purchasing a McDonald’s franchise in Dunmore.

Resigning from teaching was not an easy decision for Stella but when her parents purchased their second McDonald’s franchise she decided it was best to join the family business.

“I just loved working in the business” Stella said. “When I was teaching school I would work at the restaurant on weekends and days off and I just loved it. As they say it’s ketchup in your veins.”

How does a lower-middle income family get into ownership of a McDonald’s restaurant?

“Dad was a tool and die-maker and mom was a secretary for McDonald’s and she did a lot of work with franchise owners and she thought it would be great to own their own business” Stella said. “When my parents paid off their house they bought a duplex and then sold that and bought two duplexes. Eventually they sold both duplexes their house and all the contents in the house to purchase their first McDonald’s restaurant.”

Stella said in 1972 the McDonald’s corporation offered her parents two areas to purchase their first franchise: Minnesota or Pennsylvania. Eventually McDonald’s rescinded the Minnesota offer leaving Pennsylvania the only choice.

According to Stella there were three restaurants to choose from: Hazleton Dunmore or Chambersburg.

After touring all three locations Stella and her parents choose the Dunmore location due to its location next to a highway and its proximity to the Penn State University Dunmore campus.

Stella said she worked at the restaurants from the beginning in the trenches working whenever and wherever needed.

“I was doing fries buns meat you name it I did it” Stella admitted. “Eventually I decided I wanted to be an owner/operator and I went through a program was approved and here I am.”

Stella’s father eventually passed away at the age of 66 after acquiring their fifth restaurant and her mom stepped back from the business elevating Stella into the leadership role.

Eventually Stella acquired several more McDonald’s restaurants totaling nine in all today spread out throughout Northeastern Pennsylvania.

Stella said Q.S.C. Enterprises/McDonald’s with the home office on Market Street Kingston employs approximately 500 people. “QSC stands for quality service cleanliness” Stella said proudly.

According to Dun & Bradstreet Stella’s nine locations (Hamlin Pittston Luzerne Edwardsville Lake Harmony Kidder Street Wilkes-Barre downtown Wilkes-Barre Plains Dunmore) have annual revenue of $15 million.

Stella and her husband of 41 years Joe whom she met on a blind date reside in Laflin and have had a love affair with Greater Pittston. She relocated from Illinois to Clarks Summit in 1972 then finally to Pittston in 1974.

“I first moved to Clarks Summit when I started teaching but when I moved from Clarks Summit to Pittston and that’s when I felt like I was home” Stella said. “I have had so many long-term friends and I just think the people in this area are just fantastic.”

Stella said the pandemic has been a challenge but that she didn’t have to shut down any of her restaurants.

“I have a lot of good kids working for me” Stella said. “We were never closed and our employees came to work every day and thank goodness we had great guidance from McDonald’s getting facemasks gloves and plexiglass windows keeping everyone safe.”

Throughout the years Stella and Q.S.C. Enterprises/McDonald’s has offered their student workers an opportunity for a college scholarship through the Our Choice to Opportunity which offers a $2500 for college students.

Stella said she was proud of her work with the Ronald McDonald House Children’s Charities program. She’s the vice president of the board at the Ronald McDonald House of Scranton.

“We’ve donated to local libraries Marley’s Mission the YMCA of Pittston the YMCA of Wilkes-Barre The United Way and we’ve done a lot with grants” Stella said. “The most recent was donating to the Nurse’s Pantry which makes sure the Wilkes-Barre schools have washing machines and dryers for the children or if they need a pair of pants or shoes.”

The GPCC has always had a special place in Stella’s heart.

“So often I’ve been able to call a fellow chamber member to see if they could help out in this arena or that arena and that part of the chamber has been advantageous” Stella admitted. “The people in the Chamber of Pittston care wholeheartedly about the community and surrounding area.”

Stella at 72 years of age said she’s not interested in retiring because she still loves what she’s doing. She said she’d rather spend time in each restaurant than sit in an office.

“Ownership is like anything else and you’ll have your stressful moments” Stella said. “I think overall I love it I love every day and seriously I have a lot of fun. Retirement is not on the horizon and I still love the fast pace and I love having my son involved.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMTA5LzE4L1dTNjE0NWQ5NWFhMzEwY2RkMzliYzZhNDMzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald innovates new burger for Chinese diners - Chinadaily.com.cn,"By Wang Zhuoqiong | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-09-18 20:19

McDonald's China on Monday launched a new product the Crispy Tofu Burger as part of its monthly Members' Day Creative Menu to attract more customers with local cuisine preferences.

The new product with the tastes of Central China's Hunan region adds tofu a new protein category to McDonald's menu offering a multi-dimensional experience beyond the usual chicken and beef.

The move is to encourage consumers to join the world's leading food chain's membership and create more enjoyable and special benefits the company said.

Every Monday in every month McDonald's members will have exclusive access to a taste of one creative menu that is only available for one day with a limited supply.

Since December McDonald's innovations like the Rice-cake McFlurry and Spicy Wagyu Beef Burger have been popular among its members McDonald's China said.

If you've ever wondered what McDonald's was like several decades ago perhaps you should consider taking a trip back in time - and out into the wilderness - to an abandoned Maccies on an Alaskan former naval base that has remained preserved in time since the early 1990s.

In fact the McDonald's of the past is so well-preserved that it is still advertising promotional 'Dino-Size Fries' as part of a tie-in with Jurassic Park.

The eerie restaurant sits on Adak Island which is just one of the Aleutian Islands.

Thirty years ago it was left completely alone on the island after serving as an outpost for the US Army and Navy during World War II.

One of the pictures from inside the creepy old McDonald's were shared on Twitter and have since been liked more than 18000 times and retweeted 3000 times.

Flickr/MISHAK13

The photograph was captioned: ""Abandoned McDonald's on the remote Alaskan island still has the menu up with Bobby's World and Jurassic Park promos.""

After going viral some folks who remembered the remote restaurant saw the picture and decided to share their memories of the old place.

Amongst them was a Twitter user called @IamStevaland who claimed that his family used to own the abandoned McDonald's before it - and the army base - was closed down.

He explained: ""Created a twitter just to say my parents owned this McDonald's store! We lived on Adak for 5 years and left when the navy base closed down. This is amazing to see!""

According to the Los Angeles Times the abandonment of the naval base was the death knell for the community that surrounded it including the McDonald's.

Some of those other relatives piped up with their own experiences on Adak Island during the restaurant's heyday.

One said: ""Grew up on Kodiak and spent many days on Attu as a kid (Coast Guard). Remember still to this day going to that McDonald's was a big deal for us kids since the other McDonald's was on Kodiak.""

Others have pointed out that the prices at the restaurant are more akin to what we'd see today despite years of inflation.

Flickr/Kim F

That's because - in case you hadn't twigged - this restaurant is in the middle of nowhere and therefore things were more expensive because of the distances involved in getting the things there.

Another person said: ""These were 1990's prices on a SUPER REMOTE ALASKAN ISLAND WHERE EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE 25 years later we're like: 'Hey those are some good prices'. That should scare us...""

Either way it's a cool little glimpse into the past but probably not worth the journey in person given that there's now nothing there.

That aspiration came to pass -- for a time. She earned an education at a prestigious school for left-brainers; served as a ""hidden figure"" in the oil industry; and devoted herself to motherhood for a time before returning to work.

But then she moved to a Southern state that was miles away -- distance and culture-wise -- from her birthplace to become a successful McDonald's franchise owner whose positive influence touched many and a community volunteer with a heart for children.

Morrow has started many a young person onto the road to gainful employment with a simple formula for success.

""I always [told] my employees 'We don't work for McDonald's; we work with these customers. We need to be making sure we're pleasing these customers because these are the people ... that pay your check ... Believe me McDonald's does not pay your check.'""

Because of Morrow's commitment of time talent and treasure to her community she's been named the recipient of the 2021 Woman of the Year in Philanthropy award from the Women's Foundation of Arkansas -- one of three that will be presented at the WFA's Power of the Purse luncheon 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m. Wednesday in-person at the Statehouse Convention Center as well as virtual.

Founded in 1998 the Women's Foundation ""focuses on ensuring economic security for Arkansas women and girls through focused philanthropic investment in their education and economic well-being"" according to its website.

The foundation Morrow feels has come full circle having this year established the Tjuana Byrd Summer Internship Program named for a local lawyer who served as WFA's first Black board president. The program provides an opportunity for college-age women of color pursuing careers in science technology engineering and mathematics fields to gain real-world experience and build professional relationships.

The 2021 summer pilot program involved 14 Arkansas college students. Participating companies each took in several interns for the 10-week program.

""When you think of an internship it's just a job it's an opportunity to work a job"" Morrow says. ""They gave them more than just a job. It was an experience ... The women that they chose were really outstanding. These women are gonna do some really good things.

""And then to go a little further than just the college graduates or the college students is that the Women's Foundation is doing a [Women's Economic Mobility Hub] for ... women to help build support and hopefully get their businesses moving in the right direction."" It began in the summer.

The philanthropy award is given to a woman who's committed to empowering and inspiring women and girls. When Morrow found out she'd be receiving it this year ""I was like shocked"" she says. ""Totally shocked.""

Those who know her were not.

Sarah Catherine Gutierrez chief executive officer of Aptus Financial has known Morrow for about four years through the International Women's Forum of which Morrow is a past president.

""Beverly is the person in a room who has the best laugh tells the best stories and clearly gets so much joy out of being present and in the moment with you"" Gutierrez says. ""She is the first person to recognize everyone else for their accomplishments. ... She has been a successful business owner been integral in development and programming for local organizations and raised four incredibly successful kids.""

And Gutierrez adds ""she is incredibly humble.""

A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN

A hesitant transplant from the North Morrow 70 harbors happy memories of family time while growing up in Brooklyn.

When she was young she wanted to be a doctor -- ""but that wouldn't work because I'm scared of blood"" she says. ""So I figured that wouldn't be a good choice."" But she'd always liked math and science; as early as elementary school she'd participate in math contests.

""People say I'm a daddy's girl. And my dad was very very much so into math and science education overall."" Her father helped her with her homework in the evenings.

After her graduation from Erasmus Hall High School a school that boasted strong math and science programs Morrow headed to Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study chemical engineering. Her class she says ""was the largest Black class at that time"" -- a class of 57 seven of whom were women.

When Morrow went to college marriage was the last thing on her mind. But life had other plans. She met her husband Curtis at MIT; they began dating the second semester of freshman year and were married the day after graduation.

After earning that degree in 1973 Morrow went to work in the oil industry starting out designing refinery equipment at Standard Oil in California. ""One of my first things was to make a tank a C3/C4 tank."" She also worked on skimmers which clean the oil after an oil spill.

Later Morrow moved with her husband to Chicago where her life took a turn. The move took place six weeks after Achilia the first of the Morrows' four children was born. While Curtis Morrow -- holding a new master of business administration degree from Stanford University in California -- was headed to work for Continental Bank his wife was going to work for Amoco doing refinery work once again. She found a sitter about a week before her first day on the job.

But then ""I was like 'I can't leave my child. When I get up in the morning she'll be asleep and then when I come home it'd be just time to feed her and put her to bed.' And I just said 'I just can't do it.' You won't believe how many phone calls I got from people saying 'You went to MIT! How are you just going to stay at home?'

""The day that I went to work I literally was boo-hooing -- not crying; I was literally boo-hooing. By the time I got to work my eyes were red.""

Morrow went to her boss and said she couldn't take the job. ""And they decided to let me work part time."" Once Achilia was about 2 Morrow resumed working full time.

The family grew with the addition of their second daughter Kiisha. When Morrow became pregnant with her third child son Chane she completed a master's degree from Rutgers University in New Brunswick N.J. In 1984 six months before Chane was due to enter kindergarten Morrow took a job with Autodynamics Inc. programming simulation processes for hydrocrackers.

THEN CAME McDONALD'S

Becoming a McDonald's franchise owner ""was totally a Curtis thing"" Morrow says of her husband. ""Curtis ... always said he wanted a McDonald's.""

A chance meeting at a convention in California brought that dream to reality. ""The treasurer for McDonald's was there"" Morrow says. ""They began a conversation and the gentleman was saying that they really were trying to get more Black owner-operators -- which just was up Curtis's alley. So he went through the program and trained and became an approved owner-operator.""

Curtis Morrow didn't want any old McDonald's franchise; he wanted a new store. When a new-store opportunity did arise it arose in Pine Bluff. The Morrows moved there and opened their McDonald's on March 25 1987.

Beverly Morrow felt God was sending her down South a place she'd never lived before for a reason: The McDonald's would be a springboard for her to serve her community.

""But when I got there"" she admits ""I cried for five years.""

The Morrows owned single then multiple McDonald's restaurants under their company TLM (The Lord's McDonald's) Management. They started out with the one in Pine Bluff and remained single-store owners for 10 years.

""I was a very much hands-on owner-operator"" Morrow says. She not only worked at the restaurant she did everything even down to cleaning baseboards and toilets alongside her employees and even watching their children.

""I work with low-income families who many times need that extra boost or a door to be opened and I could always depend on Mrs. Morrow"" says Jeannie H. Epperson executive director of the Housing Authority of the city of Pine Bluff. ""Over the years she has helped so many of our young people with their very first jobs. All I had to do was pick up the phone and explain the situation and she would tell me to send them to her. I could always count on her to provide lunch for any of my youth groups or summer programs especially if we got in a crunch or someone failed to do what they agreed to do.""

It was by God's grace Morrow believes that she was able to be of such help.

""I love to see people prosper so I tried to be there for my employees until they were a little more than employees. They were really like a family.""

'TALK TO THE FRIES'

But the challenges were there too. Operating the restaurant taught her patience and that ""you have to lead by example"" Morrow says. ""I always told the employees 'We don't have the right to get mad at a customer. Customers aren't always right but we don't have the right to retaliate or be mean to a customer.' That was my speech all the time to my employees. I used to say 'If you have to say something about a customer ... and it's not appropriate go in that freezer and talk to the fries. Believe me they won't tell anybody and nobody will hear you. Go talk to the fries."" She recalls having to take her own advice once after being called an ugly name by an angry customer.

A number of former Morrow employees went on to do well and become notable members of society. They include Detria Russell executive director of the Martin Luther King Sr. Community Resources Collaborative in Atlanta who admires Morrow's ""unapologetic expectation of excellence as well as her ability to see the beauty in her own flaws.""

Russell who worked for Morrow while in high school remembers her former employer's high expectations. Standard procedure was to use an ice scoop with a handle to fill a cup with ice. One day Russell took a shortcut and scooped the cup in the ice bin. Morrow she says ""immediately grabbed my hand and gave me the most loving yet firm [rebuke]. I learned that the right way is the only way.""

Over the years the Morrows went on to own two to five McDonald's restaurants at a time in southeast and Central Arkansas. Their last lineup stretched from Otter Creek to Haskell; in the meantime they'd moved to Little Rock.

RISING IN THE RANKS

At the beginning of Morrow's career at McDonald's she really didn't do much with the McDonald's organization because being a mom and working in her stores took all her time.

But once her youngest child Asha was in high school Morrow became a little more active in McDonald's organizational matters -- including membership in the McDonald's Women Owner Network. Her personal philosophy and best practices contributed to her successful leadership of her restaurants and with the network. She won multiple awards.

""I started doing training sessions for the people in our region just because I liked to do it and I like to learn"" Morrow says. When there was a reorganization in the network Morrow was asked to be the profit lead. She received an award for her efforts as well as an award for revamping the network in her region.

the foundation

Morrow's extensive volunteer work culminated in her nomination for the Top 100 Women of Arkansas back in the mid-1990s. These women made up what is now known as the Women's Foundation of Arkansas.

Morrow went on to serve on the foundation board; during her stint Power of the Purse was born. ""It's just thrilling just to see the things that they're doing and that they're focusing on equity"" Morrow says of the organization.

Morrow's volunteer roles also include her role as a Stephen minister through her church St. Mark Baptist. (Stephen Ministries is described as a Christian education organization that produces training and resources on various ministry-related topics according to its website stephenministries.org. Stephen ministers are a team of congregation members in the church equipped ""to provide high-quality one-to-one Christ-centered care to people in the congregation and the community experiencing life difficulties."")

Having built up an extensive board membership resume she currently serves as the first Black board chairwoman for Arkansas Children's Hospital. She especially believes in working with kids because ""that's our future.""

""Everybody thinks that you have to grow up in a certain household with certain surroundings in order to be successful. And I think it's really important for young people to see that you can come out of the ghetto. I grew up in the ghetto. You can come out of the ghetto and make something of yourself ... But sometimes what [kids are] missing is somebody doing that watch. My parents did a watch over me so I knew to do a watch over my kids.""

That watch which included educating her children herself when they were small paid off. Achilia and Asha are physicians. Kiisha is an equity and inclusion professional. Chane now in Atlanta made his name in Arkansas as rapper Epipany aka ""Big Piph"" and is also an educator.

November 1 will make five years that Morrow and her husband have been retired as McDonald's owners. She has more time for exercising reading and traveling with her family in addition to serving organizations like the Women's Foundation which she hopes will go even further in encouraging girls to take on a STEM education like she did.

""In elementary school girls tend to do a lot better than boys in math"" Morrow says. ""Then I think it becomes a social thing why girls tend to come out of STEM because it's not the popular thing to do. It's definitely not the coolest thing to do.

""We want to give these children the opportunity presented to them. Unfortunately too many kids don't have the exposure.""

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

“An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here. Stop. I am in urgent need of one million units of diphtheria antitoxin. Stop. Mail is only form of transportation. Stop.”

Dr. Curtis Welch

This was the desperate radio telegram in January 1925 from Dr. Curtis Welch in Nome Alaska to all the major Alaska towns to territorial governor Scott Bone in Juneau and to the U.S. Public Health Service in Washington D.C. Diphtheria was spreading through the icebound community. Children had already died and the local supply of diphtheria antitoxin had expired the previous summer.

Known as the “Great Race of Mercy” it’s an iconic story of human compassion.

Weather prevented delivery by air so relay teams of sled dogs and their mushers raced against the clock to deliver 300000 units of antitoxin which was produced by Merck legacy company H.K. Mulford. They completed the 674-mile journey over what later became known as the Iditarod Trail in a record-breaking five days and seven hours despite whiteout conditions and temperatures of 50 degrees below zero.

674 miles 5 days 300000 units

Over 130 years of vaccine leadership In 1895 the H.K. Mulford Company began marketing the first commercially available diphtheria antitoxin in the U.S. the very medication that helped avert the diphtheria epidemic in Nome. Today we have a significant presence in vaccine discovery development and distribution in both human and animal health.

Vaccines are not just for children

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider vaccines to be one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century. In the U.S. vaccines are now available for a number of infectious diseases that once routinely affected people. While there are many vaccines available for children it’s important to remember that adults also are susceptible to vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.

Each year in the U.S. thousands of adults suffer complications from these diseases. In low- and middle-income countries the toll is even higher.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA2L2Jpb3RlY2gtbmV3cy1tZXJjay1qdXVsLXBmaXplci1leWVwb2ludC1uYXNhLXNwYXJrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Readout Newsletter: Merck Pfizer EyePoint and more,"Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

A series of articles published by the Wall Street Journal has focused on some of the most difficult issues we grapple with as a company — from content moderation and vaccine misinformation to algorithmic distribution and the well-being of teens. These are serious and complex issues and it is absolutely legitimate for us to be held to account for how we deal with them. But these stories have contained deliberate mischaracterizations of what we are trying to do and conferred egregiously false motives to Facebook’s leadership and employees.

At the heart of this series is an allegation that is just plain false: that Facebook conducts research and then systematically and willfully ignores it if the findings are inconvenient for the company. This impugns the motives and hard work of thousands of researchers policy experts and engineers at Facebook who strive to improve the quality of our products and to understand their wider (positive and negative) impact. It’s a claim which could only be made by cherry-picking selective quotes from individual pieces of leaked material in a way that presents complex and nuanced issues as if there is only ever one right answer.

With any research there will be ideas for improvement that are effective to pursue and ideas where the tradeoffs against other important considerations are worse than the proposed fix. The fact that not every idea that a researcher raises is acted upon doesn’t mean Facebook teams are not continually considering a range of different improvements. At the same time none of these issues can be solved by technology companies alone which is why we work in close partnership with researchers regulators policymakers and others.

But none of that collaborative work is helped by taking a deliberately lop-sided view of the wider facts. For example to suggest that misinformation has somehow overwhelmed our COVID-19 vaccine response ignores the most important fact: that vaccine hesitancy among Facebook’s US users has declined by about 50% since January. The Journal article goes on to discuss at length how pro-vaccine posts are undermined by negative comments once again burying a crucial point: that health organizations continue posting because their own measurements show how their posts on our platforms effectively promote vaccines despite negative comments.

Similarly to suggest that the research community is settled in its view on the intersection between social media and well-being is simply not the case. The truth is that research into the impact social media has on people is still relatively nascent and evolving and social media itself is changing rapidly. Some researchers argue that we need more evidence to understand social media’s impact on people. Each study has limitations and caveats so no single study is going to be conclusive. We need to rely on an ever-growing body of multi-method research and expert input.

What would be really worrisome is if Facebook didn’t do this sort of research in the first place. The reason we do it is to hold up a mirror to ourselves and ask the difficult questions about how people interact at scale with social media. These are often complex problems where there are no easy answers — notwithstanding the wish to reduce them to an attention-grabbing newspaper headline.

Facebook understands the significant responsibility that comes with operating a global platform. We take it seriously and we don’t shy away from scrutiny and criticism. But we fundamentally reject this mischaracterization of our work and impugning of the company’s motives. I wish there were easy answers to these issues and that choices we might make wouldn’t come with difficult trade-offs. That is not the world we live in. We will continue to invest in research into these serious and complex issues. We will continue to ask ourselves the hard questions. And we will continue to improve our products and services as a result.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2dhbWVzL3JlYy1yb29tcy1uaWNrLWZhanQtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LWJ1aWxkaW5nLWEtY3Jvc3MtcGxhdGZvcm0tbWV0YXZlcnNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rec Room's Nick Fajt interview — Building a cross-platform metaverse,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/games/rec-rooms-nick-fajt-interview-building-a-cross-platform-metaverse/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2dhbWVzL3JlYy1yb29tcy1uaWNrLWZhanQtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LWJ1aWxkaW5nLWEtY3Jvc3MtcGxhdGZvcm0tbWV0YXZlcnNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2VhNjUwYmYzLTVlOWItNDUwNy05M2VlLTg5OWNmNzcwYTE4NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LinkedIn may be the nerdiest social network — but its strategy is working,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Now let’s talk about what’s going on with Steve Cohen and the metaverse. Steve Cohen Is Riding The Crypto Wave plays sports memories and traditions.” The newest round of funding for sports-related NFT projects is in — and it’s largest-ever Series A of its kind. Recur the crypto platform owned by the Winklevoss twins raised $50 million at a post-money valuation of $333 million. It’s backed by New York Mets owner Steve Cohen Gary Vaynerchuk Jason Derulo and Gemini. The company develops an NFT platform that connects brands to their fans and enables companies celebrities and athletes to engage with those fans through an NFT experience. Founded by Zach Bruch and digital licensing pioneer Trevor George the company is looking to disrupt the ways in which IP holders are able to monetize their assets. The company has partnered with Veritone to license PAC-12 highlights and NIL rights for the conference’s athletes. Recur will also be partnering with CLC a division of Learfield to license other universities’ rights. The $50 million Series A was led by Digital which is backed by the family office of Steve Cohen. The Mets owner and renowned hedge fund billionaire who inspired the main character for the hit TV show “Billions” has made various forays into blockchain technologies since 2018. 2018: Point72 invests in Autonomous Partners a crypto-based hedge fund.

2021: Cohen hires a Head of Crypto for Point72 Asset Management.

2021: Point72 makes an investment in crypto analytics and news firm Messari.

2021: Cohen personally invests in Radkl a crypto quantitative trading firm.

2021: Cohen invests in Recur through his new blockchain/crypto-based fund Digital. Needless to say Cohen has fully bought in on the thesis that blockchain technologies will have their place in the world — and he’s putting his money where his mouth is. While Cohen’s investments skew heavily toward trading and financial markets the investment in Recur’s NFT market shines a light on a new kind of project. The market has seen three main types of sports-specific blockchain applications: IP Monetization Through NFTs: From leagues monetizing their banks of content to individual players monetizing their name image and likeness NFTs allow for digital ownership of traditionally analog assets. Much of the benefit comes from traceability. In traditional formats these assets took on the form of YouTube videos and trading cards. On the blockchain those same assets become individual collectibles which can be permanently tracked and verified on the blockchain. Leagues and players can now more easily and verifiably turn intangible assets into a form of revenue.

Leagues and players can now more easily and verifiably turn intangible assets into a form of revenue. Digital Ticketing: Similar to IP monetization via NFTs turning tickets into digital assets provides issuers the ability to earn royalties on secondary transactions. Every time a ticket trades on a secondary market the issuer can continue to monetize due to the fact that each transaction is stored on the blockchain. (Think of a permanent digital ledger that stores an infinite number of transactions.) In March Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban hinted at the possibility of the Mavericks offering their tickets as NFTs to capture some of the value of secondary market transactions.

Social Tokens: In the buzz surrounding the transfer of former Barcelona star Lionel Messi to French club PSG you might have seen that part of the deal included a payment in PSG tokens. These tokens are yet another blockchain application we have seen introduced into the sports ecosystem. They represent a hybrid form of currency and alternative asset. On the one hand tokens can be exchanged for goods and services like a regular currency and will increase or decrease in value based on market forces. On the other hand the tokens give holders special privileges like picking the walkout music prior to a game or voting on a new stadium design. So where does Cohen’s investment land in this framework? From my vantage point Recur most comfortably fits in the IP monetization bucket. The ultimate goal of the platform is to create a marketplace where athletes entertainers and corporations alike can generate royalties in perpetuity for their work. But how have these sports IP plays done in the market? Recently not too hot. While NBA Top Shot and Sorare were leaders in the February and March NFT boom — those two months saw sales of $224 million and $208 million respectively — the bubble has since popped for Top Shot. Since the February highs Top Shot has averaged sales of just $45 million. Even during the current bull run on NFTs which has seen more than $5 billion in transaction volume (compared to $342 million in February) NBA Top Shot has lagged behind as sports-related NFTs have been surpassed primarily by art projects and gaming applications. After its initial novelty wore off Top Shot has failed to meaningfully provide its users with applications for their digital assets. This then begs the question: Why did Steve Cohen put his money behind Recur? First it’s important to consider the type of IP that Cohen is investing in. Recur plans to launch in early 2022 a platform called NFTU. This platform will be a first-of-its-kind marketplace for college sports fans to buy and sell highlights from their favorite universities. Try to think of a more rabid fan base than that of top college sports teams. Couldn’t think of any? Me neither. Partnering with conferences such as the PAC-12 allows not only for monetization of sports memories and traditions but will also allow the platform to act as the marketplace for NIL deals to be facilitated through NFTs. Cohen has found the convergence of two of the hottest trends in the market. NIL and NFTs both represent landmark changes in their respective markets. Cohen is investing at the intersection of two tidal waves with the potential to really hit it big if athletes choose to monetize through digital means. Gambling on NFTs has proven lucrative for some and catastrophic for others. Projects have historically succeeded when the user base has a cult-like devotion to the project. Sounds a lot like college football fans to me. Cohen’s bet on the emerging trend in NIL and the thesis that blockchain-based royalties will be a primary monetization channel in the future seems like a good one to me.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVld2Fsay5jb20vbW90b3JvbGEtYW5kLXZlcml6b24tdW52ZWlscy10aHJlZS1uZXctZHJvaWQtcGhvbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Motorola And Verizon Unveils Three New Droid Phones,"Motorola just unveiled three new Droid smartphones including the Droid Ultra (which retails for $199) the Droid Maxx ($299) and the Droid Mini ($99).

These phones are now available for pre-order and will ship on August 20th.

New Motorola Droid phone features

The Droid Ultra features a 5 inch 1080p HD display 2130 mAH battery7.2 MM-thin body f2.4 lens and 10-megapixel camera capable of 1080p video. The Droid Maxx features the similar 5 inch 1080p HD display wireless charging capabilities 32 gigabytes of storage and 3500 mAH battery. The Droid Mini features a 4.3 inch HD S AMOLED Display and wireless charging. The full list of specifications for the Droid Mini has yet to be released.

The Verge added “As Motorola said at the event the Ultra’s main selling point is its thinness while the Maxx yet again promises absurdly strong battery life — up to 48 hours. Despite the huge battery the Maxx is still only 8.5mm thin while the Ultra is even smaller at 7.2mm. The Ultra (and presumably the Maxx) feature a 10-megapixel camera with a f2.4 lens and both phones feature the familiar Kevlar backing that Motorola started introducing with the Droid RAZR nearly two years ago. Strangely enough the new phones re-introduce capacitive buttons below the screen rather than using the on-screen buttons found on last year’s models. As for the displays both devices feature 5-inch 720p screens. We’re a little disappointed with the resolution at that size but on the plus side both screens use OLED technology and doesnot include the Pentile sub-pixel arrangement found on previous Droid RAZR devices.”

Motorola’s new phones should create more interest in Android and more competition for Samsung. It should also provide more competition for Apple. Smartphones are big business and it’s crucial for tech companies to create in-demand products that sell."

Hardly. But For the second week in a row Mac Jones looked the part of a viable NFL quarterback for the Patriots.

This time that was enough for a win as New England extended its win streak against the New York Jets to 11 with a 25-6 win at MetLife Stadium to move to 1-1 on the season.

If Jones was merely a caretaker -- no touchdowns but no interceptions -- his counterpart for the Jets Zach Wilson was a troublemaker. Wilson the second overall pick in April's draft threw four interceptions for New York completing 19 of 33 passes for 210 yards and no touchdowns and a passer rating of 37. He was also sacked four times twice by Josh Uche.

Jones on the other hand flashed more competent quarterback play by finishing 22 of 30 for 186 yards.

James White and Damien Harris each had rushing touchdowns for New England with Nick Folk responsible for the rest of the team's offense by making all four of his field goal attempts -- establishing a new franchise record for consecutive field goals made with 32 in the process. He did miss a PAT however.

Carl Davis and Matt Judon recorded the other two sacks of Wilson for the Patriots. J.C. Jackson had two interceptions -- he leads the NFL in takeaways since the start of the 2019 season with 18 -- and Devin McCourty and Adrian Phillips each picked off Wilson once.

Former Patriots draft pick Braxton Berrios led the Jets in receiving catching seven passes for 73 yards.

The quarterback New York discarded for Wilson Sam Darnold won his second straight start for the Carolina Panthers completing 26 of 38 passes for 305 yards two touchdowns and an interception.

In addition to winning 11 straight games against the Jets overall the Patriots have won 19 of their last 21 matchups against New York -- their lone two losses coming in overtime. The last time the Jets beat the Patriots in regulation was in the 2010 divisional playoffs when New York upset New England at Gillette Stadium 28-21.

The Patriots are back at Gillette Stadium next weekend against the New Orleans Saints at 1 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoYW1lcmljYS5jb20vaG9ub3JlZS9jb25vci1tdXJwaHktOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Conor Murphy,"Conor Murphy is senior vice president and CFO of MetLife’s Latin American operations.

EAST RUTHERFORD NJ—It’s Zach Wilson time again after his impressive debut against the Carolina Panthers in the face of near-impossible odds—especially in the first half. What makes Week 2 of the New York Jets‘ 2021 NFL schedule is that it’s also another rookie’s time.

His name is Mac Jones and he’s coming off an impressive NFL debut as well.

Completing 29 of 39 passes for 281 yards and a touchdown wasn’t good enough for the New England Patriots in Week 1. The upstart Miami Dolphins knocked off Bill Belichick‘s team 17-16.

So both 0-1 teams enter Week 2 in search of their first victory while the Buffalo Bills also seek win No. 1 in Miami when they take on the first place Phins.

Where When

New York Jets (0-1)

MetLife Stadium East Rutherford NJ

It’s your classic 1 p.m. ET East Rutherford NJ game for Week 2. As per the AFC East standings the winner of the contest could be tied atop the division if the Bills defeat the Dolphins (creating a three-way 1-1 tie with the Jets-Pats loser falling to 0-2).

Of course Robert Saleh and the new coaching staff seek that first victory whereas Belichick and company crave their first victory with the new face of the franchise at quarterback.

New York will wear its all-white uniforms as per usual for the regular-season home-opener.

All-time

The Patriots enter the contest holding a 69-54-1 advantage over the Jets all time. The previously mentioned Belichick and Tom Brady did a lot to alter the all-time outlook over the last two decades.

After Sept. 3 2001—the Mo Lewis-Drew Bledsoe affair—New England has won 33 of the last 41 matchups (33-8 record). Despite Brady’s absence a year ago the Patriots have taken the last 10 games.

Injury Report

New York Jets

Jamien Sherwood (LB): Doubtful

Chuma Edoga (T): Questionable

Keelan Cole (WR): Questionable

Jamison Crowder (WR): Questionable

Isaiah Dunn (CB): Questionable

Obviously Mekhi Becton is out for this one as he recovers from a dislocated kneecap. The other usual suspects on IR or PUP are also out: Jarrad Davis Ashtyn Davis Blake Cashman Braden Mann and others.

Rookie Jamien Sherwood is listed as doubtful and isn’t expected to play. Both Keelan Cole and Jamison Crowder are expected to play after missing Week 1.

New England Patriots

Quinn Nordin (K): Out

Kyle Van Noy (LB): Out

Trent Brown (T): Questionable (downgraded to out)

Yodny Cojuste (T): Questionable

Ronnie Perkins (LB): Questionable

Jonnu Smith (TE): Questionable

Stephon Gilmore remains on the PUP list and won’t return until at least midseason. Nonetheless Belichick’s defense played well against Tua Tagovailoa 16 of 27 for 202 yards and a touchdown to an interception.

Offensive tackle Trent Brown will miss the game. New England downgraded him to out on Saturday.

Keys to the Game

Force Mac Jones to win the game

Josh McDaniels ran the ball 30 times against the Dolphins while Mac Jones aired it out 39. Anything they can do to keep it balanced for the rookie quarterback they’ll continue to do moving forward.

Moreover the Pats always love to run the football even in the Brady era.

Damien Harris went for an even 100 yards on 23 carries (4.35 yards per carry). James White carried it four times for 12 yards and caught six balls for 49 yards.

Robert Saleh and Jeff Ulbrich have to do a better job of stopping the run this week. Against Carolina the run defense was surprisingly weak especially inside. As the game got deeper however Foley Fatukasi and company stepped it up.

The Jets have to top the run and force Jones to beat them through the air.

Take what the defense gives you

The Patriots carry the league’s fifth-best defense into the game through one week. New England outgained Miami by a total of 393 yards to 259. Belichick’s defense played tremendously in the season-opener.

While Miami’s offense wasn’t hitting on all cylinders in New England Mike LaFleur needs to capitalize on the film.

The Jets left a lot of yards and points on the table in Carolina—especially in the first quarter. LaFleur understandably looked to establish the run as it’s the nucleus of his scheme. The problem is he ran into loaded boxes with the Panthers’ safeties driving down and the linebackers on their toes.

The rushing attack went nowhere and balance was never reached.

Whatever Belichick does to Wilson pre-snap LaFleur and the Jets offense should take what’s given to them. Force the Pats defense to adjust first and move on from there.

Prediction

New York Jets 26 New England Patriots 30

Expect a competitive game yet another loss. Although Becton will miss the game the Jets’ offensive line played much better when Morgan Moses manned down the right side and George Fant anchored the blindside.

New York’s offensive line should play a lot better and Van Noy’s absence will aid in that performance. Wilson should have a big game with Elijah Moore breaking out for a touchdown and close to a hundred yards.

On the other side of the coin I don’t expect the Jets defense to play well. A better quarterback would have dropped 37 on New York’s defense in Week 1.

The myriad of injuries—especially now at safety with Lamarcus Joyner out—hurt big time. How Marcus Maye’s tag-team partner plays in relief will play a key role.

Much like Wilson Jones should put forth a respectable box score (a couple of touchdowns 225 yards or so with an interception). But the biggest difference will come on the ground as Damien Harris and rookie Rhomondre Stevenson should have big games.

The Jets will make it close and have a shot to win late in the fourth quarter but the four-point lead will prove too much.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMTgva2lzemxhLXRlZGR5LWJyaWRnZXdhdGVyLWRyZXctbG9jay1icm9uY29zLXF1YXJ0ZXJiYWNrL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMTgva2lzemxhLXRlZGR5LWJyaWRnZXdhdGVyLWRyZXctbG9jay1icm9uY29zLXF1YXJ0ZXJiYWNrL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kiszla: Quarterback Teddy Bridgewater has taken ownership of Broncos and Drew Lock isn’t getting team back anytime soon,"This is Teddy Bridgewater’s team. He has taken ownership of the Broncos. And Drew Lock isn’t getting them back anytime soon. Not this year. Maybe never.

While Bridgewater produced magic on the field in his debut with Denver the most significant moment of the team’s season-opening 27-13 victory against the New York Giants might have taken place on the sideline when outside linebacker Von Miller congratulated Teddy B on a job well done and declared: “I ain’t felt that in a while since 18 was here man.”

For more than five years Miller and everyone in Broncos Country have been impatiently waiting for a worthy heir to Peyton Manning who last wore No. 18 for Denver when the team won Super Bowl 50.

“I told Teddy the truth. He definitely has this vibe about him that guys want to play for” said Miller when asked about his conversation with Bridgewater. “Guys believe in Teddy. He’s a veteran in this league. He’s sat behind Drew Brees (in New Orleans). He was on track to win MVP with the Minnesota Vikings so he knows how to do it. He carries himself in a way that people want to play for him and people believe in him.”

Get a glowing endorsement from the Vonster and you’re golden in the Denver locker room. Despite the claims by coach Vic Fangio that the offseason competition between Bridgewater and Lock was a 50-50 proposition it seems more apparent every day that maybe there really was never much doubt which quarterback would be the starter.

The truth often leaks in dribs and drabs until the floodgates open in a moment of candor from Miller. Vonster insisted his kudos for Bridgewater were supposed to be private despite the fact Miller agreed to suit up with a microphone for the road game against the Giants.

“I kind of forgot that I was mic’d up. I don’t like putting stuff out there. That was a moment for me and Teddy but it’s out there” said Miller who meant no disrespect to Lock.

From the jump conventional wisdom touted Bridgewater as the safer and wiser choice to open the season as the starter with the Broncos facing three bad teams (the Giants Jacksonville and the Jets) that would trot out three unproven NFL QBs (Daniel Jones Trevor Lawrence and Zach Wilson) in September.

But barring an injury to Bridgewater it’s difficult to envision him surrendering the starting job to Lock at any point during this season especially after demonstrating against the Giants that he can be more than a solid game manager.

Consider Miller officially wowed by Bridgewater’s 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Albert Okwuegbunam that put the Broncos ahead 17-7 in the third quarter.

“It was a fourth down in the game where he kind of like stuttered and stiffed armed a guy and threw it to ‘Albert O.’ That’s just heart. Nobody can draw it up. No coach on our coaching staff or in the NFL can teach you how to do that” Miller said.

“Teddy had to fight to go out there and win for the football team. Some of the things that he says and some of the things he tells everybody before games …. Me personally I just believe that and I’m a hard guy to just believe everything that everybody says. You can definitely feel it with Teddy. I told Teddy I think that was toward the end of the game. I saw him and I just told him I’m a firm believer in giving people their flowers while they are still here. Teddy he definitely deserves the love for sure.”

Bad quarterback play allows doubt to fester in the one position where there can be no lack of faith by teammates.

For five years Denver lacked a quarterback that had the full trust of the locker room

After Bridgewater was named the starter I believed the debate was far from over and not only anticipated a QB controversy at the first sign of trouble but also fully expected Lock would get a shot to be the leading man in the Denver huddle for at least a half dozen games this season.

But I’m not afraid to admit to being wrong. The Broncos are Bridgewater’s team.

If the Vonster is committed to riding with Teddy B it’s going to be extremely difficult for Fangio to take the job away from him."

Oftentimes Station Casinos is a talking point.

In November 2019 Vice President Kamala Harris then a California senator who was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination told an employee from Palace Station she wouldn’t support a bill that would give Station Casinos parent company Red Rock Resorts a tax break. Harris noted she wrote a letter to CEO Frank Fertitta III expressing that sentiment.

She also said the company should recognize the wishes of its workforce and sign a collective bargaining agreement with the unions for roughly 13000 non-gaming hospitality and restaurant employees at 10 Southern Nevada properties.

“What they’ve been doing at Station Casinos is wrong. I applaud your leadership” Harris told the union members.

The town hall-style meeting with Harris was duplicated by all the top tier Democratic presidential candidates seeking an endorsement from Culinary ahead of the February 2020 Nevada Presidential Caucus. Ultimately the union did not make an endorsement.

But that action did not stop candidates including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg from standing with workers in front of Red Rock’s off-Strip Palms Casino Resort surrounded by the Culinary leadership and members all of whom wore red t-shirts and sweatshirts emblazoned with union’s logo and slogans.

A month after Harris was there another presidential candidate arrived at the union hall to deliver a similar message to workers. Said former Vice President Joe Biden “Folks I promise you one thing. If I end up being your president you will never ever ever have in American history someone who is more pro-labor in The White House than Joe Biden.”

Culinary leaders hoped the statements delivered by the current President and Vice President landed in the offices of Red Rock Resorts and could ultimately lead to ending the long standing labor dispute that has origins going back to 1993 the year Bill Clinton moved into the White House and the Strip saw the mid-December opening of MGM Grand Las Vegas.

D. Taylor whose organized labor career in Las Vegas and nationally has spanned four decades said the hostilities actually heated up in earnest during 2008.

“Still we’ve been back and forth for longer than 12 years” said Taylor the national president of UNITE HERE the New York-based parent of Las Vegas’ Culinary Workers Local 226.

“Our union has a very weird sense of time” said Taylor who held several leadership roles with the Culinary before serving 10 years as secretary-treasurer the local union’s top elected position. “Not many unions would still be at this for more than 12 years.”

The ultimate goal for the Culinary and its affiliated Bartenders Local 165 is to strike a contract with Station Casinos Red Rock’s operating subsidiary.

That objective has been rejected by the gaming company even after the union won six of seven secret-ballot elections administered by the National Labor Relations Board at Station Casinos properties between 2016 and 2019.

The Culinary appealed the results of the election it lost at Red Rock Resort the company’s flagship casino in Summerlin. In July a federal judge in Las Vegas ruled Station Casinos management interfered with the vote at Red Rock by a new incentives and benefits package for employees. The judge ordered the company to negotiate a union contract covering more than 1350 non-gaming employees.

Red Rock Resorts representatives declined to comment other than to provide a statement to The Nevada Independent.

“As we have said previously Station Casinos respectfully disagrees with the district court’s decision granting a temporary injunction and has appealed the ruling” the company said. “The decision which negates the clear vote of the Red Rock team members rejecting the Culinary Union appears to have been based on a misunderstanding of the procedural background and worse appears to have accepted the argument that Red Rock team members and the Red Rock property should be punished because Station Casinos treated its team members too well.

“Station Casinos does not believe it is correct or consistent with the purpose and stated mission of the National Labor Relations Act to punish Station Casinos and its team members for providing best-in-class benefits to team members based on a dubious theory that doing so 'undermines' the union” the company added.

Battle lines drawn

Since the July ruling the long-smoldering dispute rekindled into a bonfire.

Legal proceedings involving Station Casinos and the Culinary Union are weaving their way through the NLRB’s administrative law court and the federal judicial system.

In April the NLRB rejected union decertification efforts at Palace Station and Boulder Station in 2020 saying the company unlawfully encouraged employees to circulate and sign petitions seeking to end union representation.

As part of that case an administrative law judge in August said CEO Frank Fertitta III and his brother company Vice Chairman Lorenzo Fertitta would have to answer questions about allegations that Station Casinos tried to “undercut labor organizing efforts.” The subpoenas were first reported by The Daily Beast and the company is also appealing the order.

“Station Casinos believes that the attempts to depose Frank Fertitta and Lorenzo Fertitta are just another chapter in the Culinary Union’s decades-long campaign of harassment of Station Casinos and its principals this time with the willing assistance of Region 28 of the NLRB” the company said. “To the extent that the Administrative Law Judge requires their testimony they will of course appear.”

During the 2021 Legislature Red Rock opposed the passage of SB386 often referred to as the “Right to Return” bill that guarantees the rights of gaming and tourism industry workers who were laid-off during the pandemic the right to return to their jobs.

Last year after the state’s gaming industry reopened following a 78-day closure due to the pandemic Red Rock kept four properties shuttered – the Fiesta properties in Henderson and North Las Vegas Texas Station in North Las Vegas and the Palms. The casinos have remained closed for the past 16 months and the Palms is in the process of being sold to Southern California’s San Manuel Indian Tribe for $650 million.

Prior to the casino industry’s reopening the company which had been paying its 14000-person workforce wages and benefits throughout the closure said it was laying off 39 percent of its employees.

Gaming representatives and the Culinary Union struck a deal on the right to return legislation in which the Nevada Resort Association took a neutral position because of a split by its membership.

On the development side Red Rock is moving forward on Durango Station a long-planned hotel-casino project in southwest Las Vegas on a 71-acre site bordered by Durango Boulevard and the 215 Beltway. The Spring Valley Town Board approved the project on Sept. 4 and the Clark County Commission meeting as the zoning board is expected to consider the plans on Wednesday although the matter could be delayed.

The Culinary questioned the proximity of the property to neighborhoods and an elementary school. The union also raised questions as to why the company would open a new resort when three of its casinos have remained closed since the shutdown order in March 2020.

“To approve another casino when three are still closed after a year is ludicrous” Taylor said.

The law supports collective bargaining

Updating case studies on the Station Casinos-Culinary dispute is a yearly task for legal experts who believe the casino company will forever reject the union organizing efforts.

“What’s the endgame? One side gives up” said Bill Werner an associate professor at UNLV’s Harrah College of Hospitality and a former casino industry in-house counsel.

“For Station Casinos the end game is the union goes away and their employees don’t want a union anymore” Werner said. “I don’t see that happening because the Culinary is very good at maintaining its momentum.” Labor law scholars say they are not surprised the hostilities have dragged on for more than 20 years.

The Culinary took part in the nation’s longest-ever workers strike over a contract dispute – from Sept. 21 1991 until Feb. 1 1998 – at the Frontier Hotel on the Strip. Workers held out for six years four months and 10 days until the Elardi family sold the casino to billionaire businessman Phil Ruffin who immediately signed a contract with the employees.

“One thing this union has shown is staying power” said Ruben Garcia a professor at UNLV’s Boyd School of Law. He said labor law doesn’t favor management nor the workers. The law supports the collective bargaining practice.

“The law favors a lot of processes and favors a lot of time” Garcia said. “Legally both sides are required to bargain in good faith. But the sides can also appeal. That is what is going on now.”

Garcia said Congress originally wrote the law to encourage collective bargaining and expand the process but he noted the irony that it has taken more than 20 years to get a contract.

“It will be resolved when the appeals process is exhausted. But there isn’t any timetable” Garcia said. Werner said the major problem with labor law is that a company is not legally obligated to agree to a contract.

“They can be charged with refusing to bargain but there is nothing in the law that requires them to even make any concessions in the bargaining” Werner said. “The union’s remedy is to file another charge with NLRB and get another order for them to bargain in good faith. They could just do this forever.”

Kate Bronfenbrenner the director of labor education research at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations in New York said the NLRB can’t force a contract but could add financial penalties.

Bronfenbrenner who has been following the Culinary-Station matter as a case study said the company has “totally underestimated” the union.

“What surprises me is the company believed it could win in theory by using age-old anti-union strategies which are not going to work with this case” Bronfenbrenner said. “This union is more sophisticated and it has both public relations and political power.”

Long dispute and unusual tactics

Informational picket lines have long been a Culinary Union tactic. On numerous occasions between 2012 and 2014 the target was Red Rock Resort where the company’s corporate headquarters is located.

Oftentimes union members would block entrances and streets which resulted in Culinary leadership being led away in wrist restraints. (Las Vegas Metropolitan Police gave the protesters citations; they were not taken to jail.) One year several Culinary workers held a weeklong hunger strike in front of Palace Station. During a late December rally at Red Rock union members delivered a large Christmas stocking containing paper mâché coal.

The tactics have included union-led public information campaigns targeting Station Casinos’ business partners vendors entertainers and convention planners with “Travel Advisory” messages warning of the pending labor dispute.

Ten years ago the Culinary failed in its attempt to disrupt UFC efforts to hold events in New York when the fighting organization was majority-owned by the Fertitta brothers.

In August Station Casinos copied the union’s tactic when more than 100 managers at Palace Station and Boulder Station protested in front of the union’s offices on a Sunday afternoon demanding the Culinary drop its NLRB challenge to reverse a union representation vote at the two properties in which employees rejected representation.

Bronfenbrenner said the Culinary has the support of the Democratic political establishment in Nevada and nationally. She said the company “isn’t playing around with a minor union. They shouldn’t underestimate this union and it’s a union that is not going away.”

The union’s activities haven’t slowed the growth of Red Rock Resorts even as the company went through two-year Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization that was concluded in 2011. At the outset the company had $6 billion in debt. The reorganization plan removed $4 billion of the debt and left the Fertitta family in control but creditors took an ownership stake in the new company.

Two years later Station Casinos went public on the NASDAQ as Red Rock Resorts raising $531.4 million through an initial public offering. Station Casinos became the company’s operating subsidiary.

The Fertitta brothers are separately included on the Forbes Billionaires List tied at No. 1444 with each having a net worth of $2.7 billion. They control more than 40 percent of the casino company.

The beginnings were small

The genesis of the dispute came in 1993 when the Culinary and Bartenders organized employees at the Santa Fe a small locals property on a triangular shaped parcel in northwest Las Vegas bordered by U.S. 95 and Rancho Road. But the union couldn’t land a collective bargaining agreement.

Seven years later owner Paul Lowden sold the Santa Fe to Station Casinos for $205 million.

Station Casinos announced plans to renovate and expand the renamed Santa Fe Station starting in 2001 and rejected the union’s effort to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement covering more than 700 employees. The company said the workforce had to re-apply for their jobs.

Prior to the 2007 bankruptcy filing Station Casinos expanded in Southern Nevada opening the $280 million Green Valley Ranch Resort in 2001 the $925 million Red Rock Resort in 2006 and the $662 million Aliante Station in 2007. The Fertitta family and private equity company Colony Capital took Station Casinos private in a highly leveraged $8.7 billion deal.

In recent weeks Wall Street has given Red Rock Resorts high marks based on a resurging Las Vegas locals casino market where gaming revenues are up more than 16 percent through July when compared with pre-pandemic 2019.

Wells Fargo gaming analyst Daniel Politzer in launching coverage of the company last week put a price target of $62 a share on Red Rock 26 percent higher than last week’s share price.

""After a period of distractions and emerging from the pandemic with a streamlined cost structure we see Red Rock reverting to the tried-and-true Station Casinos playbook: drive strong free cash flow grow Las Vegas locals revenue at existing properties and use its land bank to expand with the market and develop new casino properties” Politzer wrote.

Largely ignored

Beyond the union and the company there is little evidence that Station Casinos customers and the general public have much if any interest in the ongoing labor matter. One long-time gaming industry veteran called the dispute “white noise” and most observers have long since tuned out the distraction.

“To a large extent the investment community has been less focused on Red Rock Resorts’ labor union disputes” Truist Securities gaming analyst Barry Jonas. “Red Rock is seen as offering above-market employee benefits suggesting any disagreement is less about financial implications and perhaps more about control.”

Global Market Advisors partner Brendan Bussmann said the organizing effort has devolved into a dispute that has become deeply personal and there is “mutual disdain” on both sides of the debate.

“I do not think the average consumer or the investor cares about this long-standing battle” Bussmann said. “Consumers will get annoyed if they have a hard time getting into a property. Investors could be hurt by some additional labor costs. But in the end it is not going to change the (impression) of Red Rock Resorts from either point of view.""

The focus is Station Casinos

Throughout the dispute the Culinary negotiated collective bargaining agreements with Strip and downtown casinos in 2002 2007 2013 and 2018. The current contracts expire in 2023.

Taylor said the union hasn’t “ignored” other locals gaming companies as potential organizing targets. Red Rock Resorts is the largest locals gaming operator which follows the union’s strategy be it in organizing employees or dealing with contract negotiations.

“You go after the largest companies first and then the smaller companies” Taylor said. “Station clearly has the most properties in the local market. When it comes to contracts that’s why we deal with MGM (Resorts International) and Caesars (Entertainment) first. They are the biggest and have the most properties.”

Boyd Gaming which operates 28 casinos in 10 states including four casinos in the Las Vegas locals market has contracts with the Culinary at two downtown Las Vegas casinos – Fremont and Main Street Station – and with affiliated unions at IP Biloxi and Sam’s Town Tunica in Mississippi and Blue Chip in Indiana.

Labor experts noted it could be a matter of devoting union resources toward one target.

“Until there is success with Station Casinos it is sort of useless to talk about other properties in the neighborhood market” Taylor said. “They are the biggest.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvTm8tc21va2luZy1pbnNpZGUtYS1jYXNpbm8tS29pLU5hdGlvbi1zLXBsYW5zLTE2NDY5NjI1LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No smoking inside a casino?

His show headlined in Vegas for many years. He hasn’t performed in Vegas In quite a while. Did he retire? What’s the backstory LVA?

A:

Sixty-one-year-old ""master magician"" Lance Burton is enjoying semi-retirement these days.

According to Las Vegas Review-Journal entertainment columnist John Katsilometes he sold his Las Vegas mansion last November for $4 million and moved back to Columbia Kentucky. However he’s keeping his hand in “performing occasional shows across the country” and in England under the guise of Lance Burton & Friends.

Reached at his 100-acre Bluegrass State spread by Katsilometes Burton explained background noise on the call by saying “I’m cleaning the doves’ cages.” (Anyone who can fly a car can multi-task while on the phone.) “Yes they came with me and I never trained them to clean up after themselves.” In addition to doves Burton keeps cows and chickens.

Burton was as good as his word that he would cease playing the Strip after MGM Resorts International closed his eponymous theater in the Monte Carlo (now Park MGM) in September 2010.

At the time Burton said “To me there's something poetic and satisfying about completing a circle. You start out you do your thing and eventually come back.” That “eventual” comeback included making a long-cherished movie project Billy Topit in which a Las Vegas magician who performs at children's birthday parties convinces the woman of his dreams to be his assistant while the local Mob guys try to make him disappear permanently. Burton directed and starred in the 2015 film.

He also did some oft-postponed world traveling for sightseeing purposes. As he explained to Katsilometes “Most entertainers travel the world before they get to Vegas. I did my career backwards. I came to Vegas at 22 and got to go around the world to see new places after my time on the Strip.”

So finished is Burton with Sin City that he even turned down an offer from Caesars Entertainment to headline the Colosseum.

He’s certainly earned the rest having played the Strip nonstop since a 1982 debut in Folies Bergere at the Tropicana. A 28-year run on the Strip is nothing at which to scoff. Burton calculates his tenures at the Trop (nine years) Hacienda (five years) and Monte Carlo (14 years) as adding up to somewhere between 15000 and 16000 shows.

Styling himself a “gentleman farmer” Burton wrote to fans “I never made it a secret that my plan was to retire back to my ancestral home my grandfather’s farm in Kentucky. There is plenty of room for all my animals and maybe a few more. It is quiet and peaceful there. I am looking forward to planting a small garden in the spring and maybe getting a few chickens so I will have fresh eggs for breakfast.” It sounds like he got his wish.

As for the Burton castle in the Black Mountains of Henderson it went from a house of magic to a home of pot. It was bought by Tarek Tabsh co-founder of Oxford Cannabinoid Technologies. Burton came down 10% on the sale initially asking $4.4 million for the custom-built house inspired by classic horror movies. Tabsh acquired a three-story six-bedroom manse and 10 acres of land. Of his Black Mountain aerie Burton told Katsilometes “I wanted this horror-film look. [Architect Colin Summer] loved that idea ran with it and came up with the design on his own. He needed very little direction. It was a beautiful interesting place to look at from the outside very comfortable on the inside. I loved living there.”

And now he loves living the quiet life in Kentucky.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIxLTA5LTE4L2JlaWppbmctcy1iaWctY3JhY2tkb3duLWFycml2ZXMtaW4tbWFjYXUtbmV3LWVjb25vbXktc2F0dXJkYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beijing’s Big Crackdown Arrives in Macau: New Economy Saturday,"Why did this happen?

A wireless device implanted in the arm could be a rapid simple way to control our body’s circadian clock — and that could radically alter how we treat sleeplessness.

Living pharmacy: The device designed to be an implantable chip is called a “living pharmacy” because it would make everything within the body on demand — no trip to the CVS required. Using specially engineered cells which can be triggered by an LED light the chip would make and release a stream of molecules that control your circadian rhythm.

This living pharmacy doesn’t actually exist yet it’s still in early development. HoweverNorthwestern University and DARPA have recently partnered together on a 4.5 year project to bring the blueprint to life.

The device designed to be an implantable chip is called a “living pharmacy” because it would make everything within the body on demand.

The project is designed to help military personnel quickly adjust to new time zones. Prolonged sleep deprivation can lead to cognitive impairments that could result in accidents injuries and even death — all things the military wants to avoid in combat zones.

Why this matters: Of course sleeping pills already exist. But it’s not always convenient to carry pills (especially in combat zones) and many medications like Ambien can have unwanted side effects such as grogginess anxiety and memory loss.

While the military will get first dibs on the living pharmacy if it works for soldiers then anyone who suffers from sleep deprivation — such as medical personnel and first responders — could benefit.

How it would work: The microchip would contain engineered cells. The cells taken from a human donor could be modified to release tiny proteins called peptides when stimulated by a LED light embedded in the chip.

Cells could be modified to release tiny proteins called peptides when stimulated by a LED light embedded in the chip.

These peptides occur naturally in the body and help regulate a person’s circadian rhythm. This device however allows the person to control the timing and dosage of the peptides by turning the LED on and off through an app on a smartphone. The app and microchip would communicate via a battery-powered hub attached to an armband according to the Smithsonian Magazine.

Reprogramming jet lag: If a soldier was traveling from DC to Afghanistan 8.5 hours ahead they would input their arrival time into the app days or weeks prior to the trip. Theoretically the app could then activate the LED in the microchip releasing peptides into the bloodstream. The amount of peptides released would be determined by the person’s biometrics such as their internal body temperature monitored through sensors in the device.

“Anything that your cells can produce you can theoretically engineer cells to produce on demand.” Jonathan Rivnay Northwestern.



The peptides would then be sent to the part of the brain the suprachiasmatic nucleus that regulates the circadian rhythm. This could allow the soldier’s body to begin adapting to the time zone change before they even step on the plane.

“This control system allows us to deliver a peptide of interest on demand directly into the bloodstream” said Jonathan Rivnay principal investigator on the project at Northwestern.

“Anything that your cells can produce you can theoretically engineer cells to produce on demand” he told Neo.Life.

“The kill pill”: There are numerous engineering challenges that lie ahead but the real thorny questions hit on the safety and privacy of the device.

According to the Smithsonian “should anything go wrong” the person wearing the device would “swallow a pill that would kill the cells inside the chip only leaving the rest of their body unaffected.”

Thankfully swallowing a kill pill isn’t the first line of safety measures.

If it proves to be effective this method could change how we treat a whole host of medical issues.

According to the Smithsonian the messages traveling to and from the hub will be encrypted the user will have to somehow verify any command they give the hub and the data will only be stored on the device itself and not in any kind of cloud. Most importantly the implantable device couldn’t be used without the armband: remove it and the implant would become useless.

Beyond sleep: If it proves to be effective this method could change how we treat a whole host of medical issues. For certain illnesses that require a person to take medicine at a certain time each day an implantable device could free them of this scheduling burden which could mean fewer missed doses. It could also mean that more medication could be optimized for timing which is thought to play a role in a patient’s health outcome.

“The classic example is for cancer” Paul Sheehan who’s managing the project at DARPA told Neo.Life. “It is known that the best time to give many cancer treatments is when patients are asleep.”

“But that doesn’t fit in with when the doctors and the nurses are available.”

If we can hack the body to deliver on-demand therapies the possible health benefits are endless.

Demand is booming for silicon chips which are embedded in everything from smartphones and televisions to wind turbines but it comes at a big cost: a huge carbon footprint.

The industry presents a paradox. Meeting global climate goals will in part rely on semiconductors. They’re integral to electric vehicles solar arrays and wind turbines. But chip manufacturing also contributes to the climate crisis. It requires huge amounts of energy and water – a chip fabrication plant or fab can use millions of gallons of water a day – and creates hazardous waste.

As the semiconductor industry finds itself increasingly under the spotlight it is starting to grapple with its climate impacts. Last week Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company the world’s largest chipmaker which supplies chips to Apple pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The company aims to “broaden our green influence and drive the industry towards low-carbon sustainability” said the TSMC chairman Mark Lui.

But decarbonizing the industry will be a big challenge.

TSMC alone uses almost 5% of all Taiwan’s electricity according to figures from Greenpeace predicted to rise to 7.2% in 2022 and it used about 63m tons of water in 2019. The company’s water use became a controversial topic during Taiwan’s drought this year the country’s worst in a half century which pitted chipmakers against farmers.

In the US a single fab Intel’s 700-acre campus in Ocotillo Arizona produced nearly 15000 tons of waste in the first three months of this year about 60% of it hazardous. It also consumed 927m gallons of fresh water enough to fill about 1400 Olympic swimming pools and used 561m kilowatt-hours of energy.

Chip manufacturing rather than energy consumption or hardware use “accounts for most of the carbon output” from electronics devices the Harvard researcher Udit Gupta and co-authors wrote in a 2020 paper.

A global shortage of high-end chips as the pandemic boosted demand for electronics and Covid outbreaks closed fabs has increased focus on the industry.

In a tight market automakers found themselves at the back of the chip queue far behind much bigger-scale semiconductor customers such as Apple who use the chips to give computing power to their smartphones laptops and other devices. GM halted production in several of its North American factories this month while Toyota said it would cut its carmaking by 40% in September.

In an attempt to increase production many countries are embarking on big programs to boost the industry.

The Chips for America Act proposes $52bn in funding over five years for the US semiconductor industry. The EU has forwarded its own legislation aimed at increasing its share of the global chips market to 20% by 2030. The European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen called it “a matter of tech sovereignty” in her State of the European Union address last week.

These ambitions line up a potential clash with international climate goals. Both the EU and US aim to get halfway to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. And as the semiconductor industry grows so too will its carbon footprint.

However amid pressure from investors and electronics makers keen to report greener supply chains to customers the semiconductor business has been ramping up action on tackling its climate footprint.

“Recently I started seeing our effects on the environment completely come to the forefront” said Sohini Dasgupta principal design engineer at ON Semiconductors.

Two years ago she said the industry “was sitting on the fence in the middle of the pack saying: ‘Yes sustainability is important but we don’t know what to do with it’”. But now she sees movement: “Every day it pops up in our emails what our company’s doing what other companies are doing” she said.

The rise of ethical investing has helped according to Mark Li a semiconductor analyst at the investment firm Bernstein. Fund managers increasingly market “green funds” and investors are asking more questions about companies’ environmental social and governance (ESG) impact. “Over the last three years the voice of ESG investment is much louder than before” Li said. Ultimately this changes how companies behave he added.

Greater availability of renewable energy is helping chipmakers reduce their carbon footprint. Intel made a commitment to source 100% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 as did TSMC but with a deadline of 2050.

Energy consumption accounts for 62% of TSMC’s emissions said a company spokesperson Nina Kao. The company signed a 20-year deal last year with the Danish energy firm Ørsted buying all the energy from a 920-megawatt offshore windfarm Ørsted is building in the Taiwan Strait.

The deal which has been described as the world’s largest corporate renewables purchase agreement has benefits for TSMC said Shashi Barla renewables analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. As well as guaranteeing a clean electricity supply it pays a wholesale cost and removes itself from price shocks “killing two birds with one stone” he said.

TSMC’s actions have the potential to influence the rest of the industry said Clifton Fonstad professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT “other manufacturers are likely to follow its lead”.

As well as switching to renewables chipmakers could also implement efficiencies in fabs said Peter Hanbury a semiconductor manufacturing expert at the management consultancy Bain & Company. A chip fab is basically “a gigantic warehouse with a clean room inside” he said and to cut emissions “the easy part is the facility itself”.

Fabs could be more efficient in regulating air and water temperature humidity and pressure. They could segment warehouses so one production line had high pressure and another lower using less energy than keeping the entire warehouse at a high pressure.

They could capture more data and use machine learning to turn tools off when they weren’t being used said Huili Grace Xing an engineering professor at Cornell University who works on semiconductor materials.

There is also innovation aimed at tackling the worst-polluting materials used in making semiconductors. The chip industry uses different gases during the production process many of which have a significant climate impact.

Chip companies make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost they can afford it Mark Li semiconductor analyst

TSMC said it had implemented scrubbers and other facilities to treat gas emissions. But another route is replacing “dirtier” cleaning gases that clean the delicate tools in semiconductor manufacturing said Michael Pittroff a chemical engineer working on semiconductor gases at Solvay Special Chemicals.

In industrial tests over the last six years with about a half dozen chipmaker clients Pittroff said he and his team had replaced more polluting gases with “cleaner” fluorine with a lower global warming impact.

Other companies target the gases that are used to etch patterns onto and clean the silicon surface of a wafer – the thin piece of material used to make semiconductors. Paris-based industrial gases company Air Liquide for example has come up with a line of alternative etching gases with lower global warming impacts.

But replacing gases will be a challenge: anything that touches the silicon wafer such as an etching gas is really hard to alter once a fab is operating said Hanbury. The process involves a huge amount of precision. Fabs have to place up to 100m transistors on a postage-stamp sized wafer and need to do it perfectly. It takes four to five years for fabs to develop a recipe for this and “once you set it you basically never want to change it” Hanbury said.

Some experts believe chipmakers will start to modify their processes to incorporate greener gases especially if the big players make a move. “If TSMC switches I am sure the others will” said Fonstad. “If TSMC doesn’t then other manufacturers may switch to show they are better than TSMC.”

To some observers of the chip business the determination to clean up the industry seems real. The vast demand for chips at the moment will only help the semiconductor industry embrace sustainability goals said Li.

“They have very good margins and make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost they can afford it. And increasingly customers are willing to pay more for a greener device” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy9xdWFkLWNvdW50cmllcy1hZ3JlZS1zZWN1cmUtbWljcm9jaGlwLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbnMtbWVkaWEtMjAyMS0wOS0xOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Quad' countries to agree on secure microchip supply chains-media,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/quad-countries-agree-secure-microchip-supply-chains-media-2021-09-18/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy9xdWFkLWNvdW50cmllcy1hZ3JlZS1zZWN1cmUtbWljcm9jaGlwLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbnMtbWVkaWEtMjAyMS0wOS0xOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

They are the companies and institutions that often have tens of thousands of people on their payroll indirectly supporting other businesses with the cash they pay out to their many workers.

Using records and figures from various sources we’ve put together a list of the single biggest employer in each state. To keep things more interesting and diverse we’ve kept the nebulous organizations of simply “state government” and “federal government” off the list because those are actually the biggest employers in nearly every state.

If you think about it you’ll probably know someone who works for the biggest employer in your own state.

Alabama — Redstone Arsenal

You’ll notice a few U.S. military installations on this list as bases around the nation often employ tens of thousands of people at a time. One of them is Alabama’s Redstone Arsenal built in 1941 which is managed by the Army and employs a whopping 60000 people according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The base is located near Huntsville in Madison County. The next biggest employer is the University of Alabama at Birmingham also a public entity but the state’s biggest private-sector employer is the Alabama Power Company with about 5000 workers.

Alaska — Fort Wainwright

The U.S. Army comes out on top again as the biggest employer in our northernmost state. Fort Wainwright located in Fairbanks was built in 1941 and employs a reported 6100 people. When you think of Alaska you probably think of seafood — after ice and the Iditarod maybe — and that connects to the state’s second-biggest employer UniSea Inc. With 5000 employees this massive fishing operation is listed as the top private-sector company in North America’s “last frontier.”

Arizona — Banner Health

According to an exhaustive database compiled by The Arizona Republic in 2019 the hospital network run by Banner Health is easily the biggest employer in the state. Nearly 45000 people were working for the company at that time which helped it top nationwide powerhouses like Walmart Kroger and McDonald’s all of which also hire many Arizonans. The publication reported that the state’s top 100 employers account for about one in five payroll jobs in Arizona.

Arkansas — Walmart

The state of Arkansas is home to several massive companies that were first founded there as modest operations. From Tyson Foods to J.B. Hunt to Dillard’s many Americans work for companies that came out of Arkansas. But the biggest of all those homegrown success stories is Walmart. The company has nearly 48000 workers on its payroll in Arkansas making it the top private workforce there.

California — University of California

Dec 8 2019 Los Angeles / CA / USA – Walmart truck driving on the interstate after the rain; wet asphalt visible

Tech giants like Alphabet (aka Google) Apple and Facebook are big employers across California but they are far from the state’s biggest workplaces. The various branches of the University of California separately occupy 10 spots on the list of the 25 biggest employers in the state according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. When you add up all the employees of the academic giant you get more than 185000 workers across the Golden State easily surpassing Los Angeles Airport’s 45000 workers as the state’s biggest single-company total.

Colorado — Denver International Airport

Major transportation hubs are some of the biggest single-location employers in the nation and Colorado’s Denver International Airport is no different. Roughly 35000 people work at DIA according to the airport which puts it ahead of other major Colorado job creators like Lockheed Martin and HealthOne by a wide margin. The 53 square miles covered by DIA’s property makes the airport larger than the cities of San Francisco Boston and Miami.

Connecticut — Yale New Haven Health System

Hospital systems are among the biggest employers in the United States and more Connecticut residents are employed by Yale New Haven Health System than any other business. More than 22000 people work for the hospital network which paces it ahead of other major companies based there like Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. Praxair and ESPN. What’s more a 2016 Forbes report named Yale New Haven Health as the large employer (at least 5000 workers) where employees were happiest in Connecticut as well.

Delaware — ChristianaCare

The chemical giant DuPont was the largest employer in Delaware for a long time but lost that title in the past few years after downsizing. MBNA was another titan in the state that cut its numbers severely after it was bought out by Bank of America. Meanwhile ChristianaCare a hospital system picked up the slack and maintains a state-leading 12000 workers across Delaware.

Florida — Walmart

It probably won’t surprise you to read that Walt Disney World is reportedly the biggest single-site employer in the United States with more than 77000 people clocking in at the Central Florida resort every day. But it probably would surprise you to know The House of Mouse isn’t the state’s biggest employer overall. That honor belongs to Walmart which employs more than 114000 people across the Sunshine State at an average hourly wage of $15.23 which is well below the state’s overall median hourly wage of $18.07.

Georgia — Emory University

Almost 30000 people in Georgia currently work for Delta Airlines making it the biggest private-sector employer in the entire state. Meanwhile Emory University is the biggest employer overall that isn’t the state government with more than 37000 employees on its payroll across Georgia. Emory’s impact on the economy of the Atlanta region alone is remarkable between the jobs it creates and the thousands of students it houses each year.

Hawaii — The Queen’s Health Systems

As you’d likely expect the single biggest industry across Hawaii is tourism but one hospital network is its biggest job creator. The Queen’s Health Systems has more than 7300 people on its payroll which might sound like a tiny number compared to others on this list but is sizable for a state of fewer than 1.5 million citizens. All those surfing injuries aren’t going to take care of themselves are they?

Idaho — St. Luke’s Health System

Healthcare reigns supreme in yet another state. While agriculture and manufacturing have major hiring figures across Idaho St. Luke’s Health System is the state’s single biggest employer. More than 14000 people in the Gem State work for the hospital network according to the Idaho Department of Labor pacing it ahead of Walmart Micron Technology and competitor Saint Alphonsus Health System.

Illinois — Walmart

According to the Illinois Department of Employment Security the industry of healthcare and social assistance employs the most people in the state with more than 800000 people working in that sector as of 2021. Sears was the biggest single employer in Illinois for a long time but long ago lost that mantle making way for Walmart to hold the spot today. According to the retail giant more than 56000 Walmart associates are employed across Illinois making it the single biggest employer that we could find in our research.

Walmart

Indiana — Walmart

Yet another Midwestern state that is dominated by Walmart in terms of its employment figures is Indiana. More than 44000 Hoosiers call Walmart their workplace with 127 stores under the company’s umbrella being operated there as of July 2021. Other major employers include Eli Lilly and Tyson Foods but Walmart reportedly employs more people than any of them.

Iowa — Hy-Vee

It’s somewhat refreshing that Iowa’s biggest employer is a regional supermarket chain that was born in the Hawkeye State. While the University of Iowa claims itself to be the state’s biggest employer with 14000 workers our own math and research find that Hy-Vee should actually hold that title because of the sheer footprint it has across Iowa. Between its corporate headquarters two distribution centers tech office and the more than 150 stores we counted across the state we estimate that roughly 50000 Iowans work for Hy-Vee in some capacity — and that’s a conservative number.

Kansas — Fort Riley

The agriculture industry accounts for a major chunk of the Kansas economy and has the biggest workforce in the state but the U.S. Army’s base at Fort Riley employs more people than any other entity. More than 20000 people work at Fort Riley including service members and civilians. Spirit Aerosystems which is based in Wichita is the biggest private-sector employer in Kansas with 12000 workers expected to be on its payroll by 2024.

Kentucky — UPS

The commonwealth of Kentucky has a very tight race for the title of its biggest employer. While Walmart technically has about 1000 more overall employees in Kentucky than UPS its number includes workers at Sam’s Club stores which is why we’re giving the nod to the shipping giant. UPS and its 29000 workers across the Bluegrass State make up an immense workforce that includes 12000 in Louisville alone.

Louisiana — Walmart

While state government accounts for a reported 57000 jobs in Louisiana we aren’t including them so the honor of the biggest workforce there falls to Walmart. The big-box retailer counts nearly 36000 workers across Louisiana between its flagship and Sam’s Club locations. Other top jobs creators in the state include Willis-Knighton Medical Center and Mistras Group.

Maine — MaineHealth

Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and Walmart combine to employ about 16000 people across Maine but that’s still fewer than the number employed by MaineHealth. The hospital network has at least 18000 employees according to the Maine Department of Labor giving it the biggest workforce in the state. It shouldn’t surprise you when you realize that more than 700 hospitals doctor’s offices labs and assisted-living communities fall under the MaineHealth banner.

Maryland — Fort George G. Meade

While the renowned network of hospitals and institutions under the Johns Hopkins banner employs an impressive 30000 people across Maryland the military is the state’s biggest employer: specifically Fort George G. Meade which is one of the Army’s biggest bases period. Located between Baltimore and Washington Fort Meade has more than 56000 employees on base including civilians and service members.

Massachusetts — Mass General Brigham

World-renowned institutions like Harvard University and the University of Massachusetts rank among the biggest employers in the commonwealth but they can’t match its healthcare behemoth. Mass General Brigham recently took a new name in 2019 after previously being known as Partners Healthcare. More than 58000 people in Massachusetts work at Mass General Brigham which is a medical network like some other top employers on this list.

Michigan — General Motors

Automotive production still rules in Michigan — for now at least. If you combine the employees from the University of Michigan and its related Michigan Medicine healthcare banner (roughly 58000 people total) that institution would technically be the biggest employer in Michigan but that seems like cheating. Instead we’re spotlighting General Motors as having the state’s single largest workforce since nearly 47000 people work for the automaker there.

Minnesota — Mayo Clinic

The mighty Minnesota-based Target Corporation employs a reported 31000 people across the state but it’s not the biggest employer there. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester with its 28 Mayo Clinic Health System locations spread across the state is the biggest employer in Minnesota. More than 47000 people reportedly get their paycheck from Mayo Clinic making it quite a formidable workplace.

Mississippi — Ingalls Shipbuilding

An innovative powerhouse Ingalls Shipbuilding is one of the longest-standing large private employers on this list. The company had 11500 workers in Mississippi as of 2021 making it the biggest employer in the state. Ingalls has apparently held that title since 1939 which is remarkable and it looks like the grip won’t be loosening anytime soon. The company recently announced it was looking to add 3000 more employees to its payroll.

Missouri — Walmart

Companies like Boeing and Enterprise Holdings each employ tens of thousands of people across Missouri but neither can touch Walmart’s foothold there. The retail giant counts nearly 44000 residents of Missouri among its workforce making it the single biggest employer in the state. Some reports cite the medical giant BJC Healthcare as Missouri’s biggest employer but with a reported 30000 workers there that’s simply not the case.

Montana — Billings Clinic

Population-wise Montana is one of the smallest states in the nation and that’s why the 10000-plus people reportedly employed by the Billings Clinic is a massive figure there. In addition to being the state’s biggest employer it’s also Montana’s top healthcare supplier. The system also operates in Wyoming but has its biggest presence in Big Sky Country.

Nebraska — University of Nebraska

Omaha’s Offutt Air Force Base is a massive workplace that has 8000 employees but that’s only half of the staff employed by the University of Nebraska. That institution which is comprised of four universities across the state counts 16000 workers among its staff. What’s more the University of Nebraska has been ranked by Forbes as one of the best places to work in the entire state based on a survey of its workers.

Nevada — MGM Resorts

When you think of Nevada your mind has to imagine the bright lights of the Las Vegas Strip so this fact probably doesn’t stun you. MGM Resorts operates 10 properties in Las Vegas including nine casinos making it a monster in the gaming industry. The company reportedly counts 42000 workers among its staff in Nevada giving it the state’s biggest workforce. For comparison’s sake the Nevada state government “only” employs 25000 people.

New Hampshire — Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health

In a state of just over 1.3 million citizens a reported workforce of 8000 people is a sizable one. While Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health also has a major presence across Vermont its biggest footprint is in New Hampshire. The system operates a number of hospitals across the state as well as 24 smaller clinics. Its website boasts that it is the No. 1-rated hospital in New Hampshire as well as the biggest private employer there.

New Jersey — Amazon

For a long time the grocery giant ShopRite was the biggest employer in the Garden State but it recently lost that mantle to Amazon. The retail giant took that title after bringing its presence to more than 40000 employees across New Jersey in 2020. An Amazon spokesperson told ROI-NJ.com that the company has invested $14.5 billion into New Jersey’s economy since 2010.

New Mexico — Presbyterian Healthcare Services

In case you hadn’t noticed medicine is serious business in the U.S. Further proof of this is New Mexico’s Presbyterian Healthcare Services which employs more people than any other private entity across the state. The company counts more than 11000 people among its staff in New Mexico. Nine hospitals across the state are included in Presbyterian’s footprint.

New York — Northwell Health

While New York is home to arguably the most bustling arts and culture scene in the world the state’s single biggest employer is just as typical as it is in many states: a hospital system. Northwell Health says it has more than 76000 employees working across its network of more than 800 care facilities in New York. While the healthcare giant has the title for now it’s been estimated that Amazon could become the state’s biggest employer by 2034 as it seeks to add tens of thousands of new jobs there by then.

North Carolina — University of North Carolina System

When outsiders think of North Carolina basketball at the University of North Carolina probably comes to mind first. That institution and the wide-ranging University of North Carolina System that it’s a part of have a whopping 48000 employees across the state making it the biggest staffer behind state government. A total of 17 institutions are included in the system.

North Dakota — Sanford Health

It’s unique for a company not named Walmart to occupy multiple spots on this list and that’s what Sanford Health can claim. The hospital network stretches across four states but has its biggest presence across North Dakota and South Dakota where it is the biggest employer in each. In North Dakota it’s been reported that Sanford Health employs more than 12000 people.

Kroger The Ohio State University and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base each have an immense workforce in the Buckeye State but the state’s top-rated healthcare giant surpasses them all. The Cleveland Clinic Foundation has nearly 51000 workers on the payroll up sharply from the 37800 employees it reported having in 2009. The system’s flagship location in the heart of Cleveland celebrated its 100th year in business in 2021.

Oklahoma — Walmart

The United States government is actually the single-biggest employer across Oklahoma but Walmart gets the credit when nebulous government entities aren’t included. The retailer cuts checks for more than 33000 people across the state which isn’t far from the 37000 employed by the federal government there. Walmart operates 134 stores in the state 81 of which are supercenters.

Oregon — Intel

Technology rules the workforce in Oregon as Intel has had the title of the state’s largest employer for at least six years. The company says it has about 17000 employees in Oregon ranking it ahead of other major jobs creators like Providence Health System Fred Meyers Stores and Nike. The tech giant operates six campuses in the state and has been operating there since 1974.

Pennsylvania — University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

Hillsboro Oregon USA – October 18 2018: An Intel logo at a corner of JF3 building of Jones Farm campus

Healthcare comes out on top yet again this time in the Keystone State. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (aka UPMC) has an immense presence across Pennsylvania operating 40 hospitals and more than 800 clinics. The company employs a reported 92000 people across the state including a whopping 5000 doctors.

Adobe

Rhode Island — Lifespan

With just over 1 million citizens between its relatively tight borders the fact that Rhode Island’s biggest employer has 16000 workers there is pretty substantial. Lifespan has been operating in Rhode Island since 1994 and runs six hospitals 40 labs and more than 100 clinics around the state. The military is another major hirer in the coastal state with Naval Station Newport counting roughly 10000 workers among its staff.

South Carolina — Walmart

Rhode Island Hospital Zecchino Pavilion

South Carolina has some serious employers in BMW Boeing and Joint Base Charleston but Walmart tops them all. The company employs more than 34000 people across the state which is about as much as those other three giants combined. There are 122 Walmart stores in South Carolina including 83 supercenters according to the company.

Walmart

South Dakota — Sanford Health

As mentioned previously the Sanford Health system is the biggest employer in both North Dakota and South Dakota. The network’s biggest presence is in South Dakota with its headquarters located in Sioux Falls. It’s unclear exactly how many employees Sanford has in South Dakota alone but the company has an estimated 30000 workers total and it has been widely reported to be the state’s biggest employer.

Tennessee — Walmart

Sanford Health Main Campus Sioux Falls South Dakota USA: 3-2021: Children’s Hospital Castle of Care

Yes Walmart rules the workforce in yet another state. Nissan Shoney’s and Vanderbilt University and its associated hospital are counted among the biggest employers in the state but none can match the big-box store’s staff in Tennessee. According to Walmart it employs nearly 43000 people in the state and operates 150 stores within its borders.

Texas — H-E-B

Texas is yet another state where a retailer has the biggest payroll of all. The San Antonio-based supermarket chain H-E-B counts more than 90000 Texans among its workforce reportedly making it the biggest private employer in the Lone Star State. The chain has more than 300 stores in the state giving it an immense presence there.

Utah — Intermountain Healthcare

The state of Utah has a few large employers ranked in a virtual tie at the top but Intermountain Healthcare just wins the race. The hospital system has more than 20000 employees which ranks it just ahead of the Utah state government and the University of Utah. Interestingly Intermountain was in talks to merge with another major employer on this list Sanford Health until the deal was called off early in 2021.

Vermont — The University of Vermont Health Network

Salt Lake City UT / USA – November 6 2020: Intermountain Primary Children’s Hospital

Frankly we were kind of disappointed to find out that Ben & Jerry’s isn’t the biggest employer in Vermont but what can you do? The fact is that The University of Vermont Health Network employs 8800 people edging out semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries as the state’s biggest staffer. The network is anchored by the flagship UVM Medical Center in Burlington which staffs 1700 nurses and 600 doctors.

Virginia — Walmart

Virginia sees about 46000 of its citizens employed by the combined powers of Huntington Ingalls Industries and Sentara Healthcare but that figure barely surpasses the number employed by Walmart. The retailer has an impressive 45727 workers across Virginia where it operates 149 stores. That figure easily makes the company the biggest staffer in the entire commonwealth.

Photo: Walmart

Washington — Amazon

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a shift at the top of Washington state’s employment rankings. Boeing was the biggest employer in the state until the pandemic hindered the company’s business while doing the opposite for Amazon’s. As a result the online retailer which was born in Washington became the state’s top dog. Amazon counts more than 80000 employees among its workforce in Washington.

West Virginia — WVU Medicine

For nearly two decades Walmart ruled West Virginia as the biggest employer but it was unseated in 2016 by a healthcare titan. WVU Medicine has more than 15000 employees within its network in the state. Other top employers across the state include Kroger Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Lowe’s.

Wisconsin — Advocate Aurora Health

Morgantown WV – 21 January 2021: WVU Medicine covid-19 vaccination center in old mall in Morgantown West Virginia

Another health system this one based in Milwaukee tops another state’s list of the biggest employers. Wisconsin’s Advocate Aurora Health operates 15 hospitals and more than 150 clinics across the state and into northern Illinois. All that care requires 75000 employees to make up its substantial payroll. It’s unclear how many of them work solely in Wisconsin but the company has widely been reported as the state’s biggest private employer.

Wyoming — Walmart

With just 14 stores across the state Walmart’s presence in Wyoming is nowhere near what it is in other parts of the U.S. Still the retailer is counted as the biggest private employer there despite the fact that it has fewer than 5000 workers. Wyoming’s F.E. Warren Air Force Base employs more than 4000 people at a single site but it’s still not quite enough to catch up with Walmart’s payroll in the state.",,,

That is why we backed our carbon negative commitment with two financial vehicles that will help us reach our goals — a $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund and a comprehensive carbon fee applied across our entire carbon footprint — enabling us to operate as both an investor and a customer of carbon reduction and removal solutions. But in our work we have learned that the market needs to go even further faster. Such an acceleration will require investments outside of our fee and our fund — donations targeted toward the reduction of the green premium that climate solutions often carry.

That is why today Microsoft is taking on a third role as a donor by announcing a $100 million grant to Breakthrough Energy Catalyst to further accelerate the development of the climate solutions the world needs to reach net-zero. Catalyst a program within the larger Breakthrough Energy network founded by Bill Gates is a new model for public-private sector partnership to help build the foundation of the net-zero economy. The program will initially focus on four key areas for innovation: direct air capture green hydrogen long duration energy storage and sustainable aviation fuel.

Microsoft is already making a range of investments across several of these climate innovation areas – from playing an active role to advance sustainable aviation fuel through purchasing partnerships and alliances to becoming a customer of and investor in a direct air capture facility project via our Climate Innovation Fund. By providing a grant to Catalyst we aim to offer new climate technology funding beyond the scope of our programs that exist today. We recognize that grant capital is a necessary part of early market development to address the green premium and the resulting gap in market adoption of new climate technologies.

Microsoft’s grant with Catalyst joins donations and investments from other leading corporations and together we look forward to others joining the program.

This is the decade of action and those of us who can afford to move faster and go further should. We are making this grant because we know that for Microsoft other corporations and the world to meet our climate goals we need to work together to drive wide-scale growth and innovation.

For more information on the Catalyst program check out Breakthrough Energy’s press release.

Testing it gave me a serious case of déjà vu; its design has barely changed since I first went hands-on with the original in 2017. The most obvious exterior change on my 13-inch review unit — other than being a different shade of blue — is that it comes with a USB-C port instead of a Mini DisplayPort. That’s it.

And yet I still consider this laptop to be near the top of its class. A few quibbles aside it’s one of the easiest to recommend laptops on the market. I don’t think Microsoft can get away with another year of this design but starting at $999 the Surface Laptop 4 is still one of the prettiest most pleasant to use laptops money can buy. Here are some of the reasons why.

It’s still stunning

Sometimes newness for the sake of newness is overrated. As the saying goes; if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. I came into this review preparing a big eye roll at the few changes but every time I switch to the Surface Laptop from other devices I’m testing I can’t help but get a little giddy.

Despite an ‘old’ design by tech standards the Surface Laptop 4 is still one of the prettiest laptops around although I’m admittedly biased toward blue gadgets.

I’m equally biased by the Alcantara material. I don’t care if it can get a little dirtier than metal with your grubby hands. The Ice Blue Alcantara on my model feels luxurious when typing in a way no other laptop feels (the soft-touch finish on the Dell XPS 13 is nice but not quite there). In any case it gets way less dirty than you might expect. Even after several months there’s just a slight hint of wear.

When I think about what I really want Microsoft to change only a few things come to mind. Smaller bezels would be nice especially on a device like this which does not turn into a tablet and doesn’t need the space to have somewhere to grip.

Alternatively keep the bezels but give the Surface Laptop a 360-degree hinge. To be honest I can’t imagine Microsoft doing that but the lack of a tablet mode does significantly limit the utility of the Surface Pen.

Still there are still very few laptops out that match the Surface Laptop on the design front even though they’ve had the time to catch up.

The speakers are great by thin laptop standards

So many mainstream laptops tend to have an annoying bottom-firing speaker design. I don’t like it. It means the sound is inconsistent varying depending on whether you’re using the laptop on your lap your bed or a table. Rarely does it actually sound good.

The Surface Laptop 4 instead fires sound up through the keyboard. That seems like a recipe for disaster but somehow it ends up sounding pretty great by laptop standards anyway.

Granted I didn’t get as technical about it as I do with actual speaker reviews but to my ear it has a balanced warm tonality that is a nice contrast from the usual tinny and/or boomy sound you’ll find in other laptops. I never get it when laptops have various automated EQ presets for things like movies games and music. That’s dumb. Good speakers are just good speakers. You just need to create decent sound without all the gimmicks.

It has a goldilocks display

One of my pet peeves with laptops in this category is that they tend to force you to pick either a 1080p-ish display or a 4K-ish display.

I think 1080p on a 13-inch display is a pixel-fest by modern standards. Some people claim you don’t need higher resolution on a display this size I’ve never seen a 1080P display on anything larger than a tablet that I didn’t think looked fuzzy.

Meanwhile 4K displays many of them OLED tend to eat through battery life like nobody’s business.

For some reason very few laptop manufacturers actually try to strike a balance of resolution that’s the right pixel density for the display size. Apple is one of them and Microsoft is another.

The 13.5″ Surface Laptop 4 comes in at 2256 x 1504 (201 PPI) and it’s just about perfect. I wouldn’t mind a little higher pixel density but it’s just about at the point of diminishing returns. Increasing the resolution further would lead to barely noticeable gains in sharpness while draining more battery.

It also has a 3:2 aspect ratio which is the best aspect ratio.

Mind you it’s not perfect. The display isn’t the brightest or most vibrant you can get but color calibration and contrast is on point and generally competitive with others in this category while striking a better balance on resolution. I also appreciate that whether you choose to save money on a low-end configuration or opt to max out the specs you’re still getting the same great display.

It’s faster than ever

While most of what I mentioned before applies to earlier Surface Laptops the Surface Laptop 4 benefits significantly from its new internals.

The Surface Laptop 3 felt a bit like it lagged behind its competitors in terms of performance especially with the AMD variant that was based on older technology than the competition.

On my Intel Core-i7 equipped review unit with 16GB of RAM it flies through everyday tasks with nary a hiccup and as with all Surface products it is mercifully free from the bloatware that occupies many other devices.

Gaming performance on the Intel model has increased significantly thanks to the Iris Xe GPU but it’s still not a device you buy for huge framerates in AAA title. Still at least you should be able to play most games at lower resolutions and settings.

This isn’t a laptop you get for performing the most intense workloads on the go nor will it stand out tremendously from other laptops with comparable intel or AMD parts. But likewise it won’t be left behind and subjectively it seemed to maintain its performance well over extended usage.

You can pick between Intel and AMD

Microsoft is giving laptop buyers more choice than they usually get in terms of processors. You can choose between several Intel and AMD configurations which gives you significant flexibility based on your budget and your intended usage.

While I didn’t get to test the AMD version of the Surface Laptop 4 benchmarks and user impressions of that model have been far superior to its predecessor. In particular it appears to excel in battery life and multi-threaded performance while the Intel option is better for gaming and has more memory and storage options.

It still has the best keyboard

Keyboards are a personal thing but the Surface Laptop 4 is simply my idea of a perfect laptop keyboard. It’s quiet it’s clicky it’s responsive. It feels nice.

Heck I like it more than many a desktop keyboard I’ve used. It’s better than the one even on the Surface Book 3 too. Coupled with the Alcantara material it’s a writer’s dream.

I love it. As far as I’m concerned Microsoft could keep the keyboard exactly the same on the Surface Laptop 5 and I’d still be happy.

(And the trackpad is pretty neat too — I think the best one you’ll find this side of a MacBook.)

It lasts longer than ever

Microsoft claimed it added an hour and a half to the Surface Book 13’s battery life and indeed it feels like it can get me through a workday more easily than before. Unless I was doing a lot of work in photoshop and lightroom I rarely had to charge the laptop before the end of a workday.

It’s not the longest-lasting laptop I’ve used but it should outlast most 4K laptops out there with barely a visible hit on display quality. It’s the benefit of that ‘goldilocks’ display resolution and careful optimization by Microsoft.

Microsoft claims the Intel version will go for 17 hours which is big old ‘lol no’ from me but 7-10 hours depending on your workload is pretty realistic; I tend to run on high brightness too. Mind you the AMD version should last even longer as it has more careful power management when unplugged. Microsoft claims it’ll last 19 hours so it should get an extra hour or so over the Intel variant.

It’s not the Surface for me but it’s the traditional laptop I recommend the most

As much as I like the Surface Laptop 4 it’s not my daily driver. That honor goes to the Surface Book 3 not just because of the GPU but because for me using the device in tablet mode is essential. I use the stylus for writing notes in OneNote editing photos annotating sheet music solving math problems etc. Plus it’s just nicer to watch movies with the screen pushed forward.

It makes me wish Microsoft would come up with a reasonably priced Surface Laptop that had some kind of 2-in-1 capability. The Surface Book is too expensive for most people and although the Surface Laptop supports does support the Surface Pen it’s very awkward to use in this form factor. There’s usually very little compromise to a flippy hinge — the HP Spectre x360 14 is also one of the nicest laptops I’ve used too convertible or not.

Also because I don’t know where else to put it in this review: I also wouldn’t mind a few more USB-C ports on the next revision.

Still a lot of people just want a plain-old traditional laptop that looks nice feels nice and is generally hassle-free in terms of performance and battery life. Though it’s a little dated by its bezels it’s a testament to the strength of the original design that the Surface Laptop 4 still looks and feels so good. At the end of the day it’s the overall experience that matters not how ‘new’ it is.

The Surface Laptop was never really broken but Microsoft has ‘fixed’ it enough to make it a better buy than ever.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1zc3BhbGVydC5jb20vbmV3cy9wd2MtYnV5cy1hdmFsZXJpc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSSP Acquired: PwC Buys Microsoft Identity Security Provider Avaleris -,"PricewaterhouseCoopers Canada has acquired Avaleris an MSSP that offers Microsoft identity security and cloud services.

After installing the August 2021 patches for Windows e.g. KB5005033 or KB5005031 some users noticed that printing was causing issues on said devices.

According to Microsoft's description affected printers used Point and Print in some environments. These would throw the error message ""Do you trust this printer"" on any print job started from the affected device. Users were prompted to enter administrative credentials every time an application attempted to print or a print client connected to the print server.

Microsoft's analysis of the issue concluded that the issue is caused by a filename conflict.

This is caused by a print driver on the print client and the print server using the same filename but the server has a newer version of the file. When the print client connects to the print server it finds a newer driver file and is prompted to update the drivers on the print client but the file in the package it is offered for installation does not include the later file version.

Microsoft suggests that affected customers install the latest drivers on all printing devices to resolve the issue and to make sure ""where possible"" to use the same print driver version on print clients and print servers.

The issue affects all major versions of Windows that are supported by Microsoft.

Client: Windows 10 version 21H1; Windows 10 version 20H2; Windows 10 version 2004; Windows 10 version 1909; Windows 10 version 1809; Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019; Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2016; Windows 10 version 1607; Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB; Windows 8.1; Windows 7 SP1 Server: Windows Server 2022; Windows Server version 20H2; Windows Server version 2004; Windows Server version 1909; Windows Server version 1809; Windows Server 2019; Windows Server 2016; Windows Server 2012 R2; Windows Server 2012; Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1; Windows Server 2008 SP2

Microsoft published a support page KB5005652 which provides additional information on the issue.

The company changed how print drivers are installed or update as a consequence. Non-administrators can't install or upgrade print drivers using drivers from remote computers or servers without elevation of privilege to administrator.

Microsoft created a new Registry key to restore the old behavior.

Registry location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\PointAndPrint

Dword (32-bit) Value name: RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators

Value data: The default value is 1; this requires administrative privileges to install or update print drivers when using Point and Print. A value of 0 allows non-administrators to install drivers when using Point and Print.



Windows users in Point and Print environments have four options to install print drivers or updates of print drivers according to Microsoft by default:

Provide an administrator username and password when prompted for credentials when attempting to install a printer driver.

Include the necessary printer drivers in the OS image.

Use Microsoft System Center Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager or an equivalent tool to remotely install printer drivers.

Temporarily set RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators to 0 to install printer drivers.

Closing Words

Microsoft released several printing updates this year alone some to address the PrintNightmare vulnerability others to address non-security issues such as printer bluescreen issues.

Most home devices should not be affected by the new issue but another printing related issue exists already after installation of the September 2021 Patch Day updates.

For eight years now Co-Housing Israel (CHI) an NGO registered by the Registrar of Cooperatives in the Trade Ministry has wondered and wandered – from Haifa to Jerusalem from Pardess Hanna to Kfar Saba to Tel Aviv – simultaneously growing the membership creating community and searching the hills and dales for an affordable site on which to build Israel’s first permanent affordable senior co-housing project.

Co-housing means private homes or apartments clustered around a public space. It’s downsizing around shared amenities: a salon big enough for group meals kitchen activity room laundry room and garden. It promises a healthier more active and sustainable life in the retirement years staving off the loneliness that comes with aging.

Our journey begins

Eight years ago as four American-Israeli couples watched their own parents age without a plan they started looking for an affordable cooperative housing model for themselves and friends who want to grow old together.

They discovered the Senior Co-Housing Handbook by architect Charles Durrett who is credited with popularizing the 1970s Scandinavian co-housing model in the US. In the last three decades the number of these private homes with shared public space communities has grown in Europe and North America. According to CoHousing.Org there are some 290 intentional communities in the US many of them started by baby boomers who are now 55 and older.

Many of us in CHI also belong to the generation of baby boomers. We are social and community workers health policy experts urban planners yoga teachers economists psychologists professors teachers writers and more; we live in the north west and east of the country. We also employ an urban architect who has been critical in helping us understand land use regulations and identifying development opportunities.

I was invited by longtime friends to join CHI during its “second wave” of recruitment. It made perfect sense to me and I wanted to grow old with these folks many of whom I have known since my first years in Jerusalem. I signed the membership agreement took a deep breath and paid the dues. I joined the site search and design committee in Jerusalem.

I have also done two stints on the Board as well as regularly cohosting Zoom parlor meetings. Once a month we hold these open orientation meetings where people from all over Israel and many from abroad planning to make aliyah or return to Israel hear a brief summary of the history and current status of Co-Housing in Israel. We then open up the discussion to their questions and concerns like “Is it a problem that I don’t speak Hebrew/English well? Is there anyone in the group without an American accent in Hebrew? I still have a son/daughter at home. Can they live with me in co-housing?”

Looking for a location

Our site search has taken some bizarre turns and twists. We have checked out abandoned buildings in the Jerusalem corridor; in Abu Ghosh (Where the heck are we? Isn’t this a construction site?) to a cooperative renting housing project for students in Haifa (One of the young but sage developers tells us “If you ever want it to happen find private funding. Rely on the government and you won’t get anywhere.”) to derelict hotels crying out for repurposing and TLC to fancy retirement homes willing to give us a whole wing and even let us grow marijuana if we want.

Our site search took us to the offices of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem’s Old City where we sipped Greek coffee and discussed real estate under the watchful eyes of Byzantine icons on the walls and ceilings.

We’ve become savvy in navigating municipal GIS (geographic information system) maps checking land ownership and property deeds.

Our unique chicken and egg dilemma: community building and finding a building at the same time. Typically an economically workable co-housing project needs 20-30 “units.” Potential members (units) often expect the keys to their apartments tomorrow. Contractors need three to five years to complete a project and won’t talk to us unless we can promise those 20-30 units. So what indeed comes first?

Despite our best efforts financing affordable land and partners have not been found. As one member likes to say “we have not yet found the ‘secret sauce’ enabling CHI to increase membership parallel with finding an affordable timely and permanent co-housing solution that will attract new people.”

Over the years our site search team has met with municipal and national authorities. Officials have been enthusiastic about alternative housing for seniors but have not committed resources to help facilitate a pilot project. They wish us success and tell us to close the door on our way out.

We persevere trekking through our own desert but the oasis is often a mirage.

CHI times they are a-changin’

CHI is often invited to speak at academic and economic conferences on healthy aging on senior housing options and other issues facing the elderly population. Both the Hebrew and English-language media are devoting more time to the subject of cooperative and co-housing ventures for senior citizens.

Earlier this year CHI was awarded the $10000 first-place Glickman Prize for work on developing affordable housing solutions for healthy aging in Israel. The Aging Ecosystems Drivers conference which had some 300 participants on Zoom was organized by Aging IL and jointly sponsored by the Joint/Eshel (of the American Joint Distribution Committee) Kaveret (literally beehive a fund manager) Kranot Habituah Leumi (National Insurance pension funds) and Ashoka a nonprofit for social entrepreneurship.

This retired voice of Israel Radio became the face and voice of CHI delivering a 3-minute Zoom pitch in Hebrew to an audience of judges and hundreds of viewers that opened with these words “... Alo shmi Idel v’ani ahad m’millyon. (Hello my name is Idele and I am one of a million.)”

CHI living the dream

Almost two years ago Shikun U’Binui the veteran infrastructure and real estate company and Dira L’Haskir (literally Flat for Rent with a nod to the classic Hebrew children’s story by Levin Kipnis) began promoting long-term rentals in North Talpiot a popular Jerusalem neighborhood. The light went on. It met many of our criteria and was affordable for most of us.

I was one of the five units who decided to take the leap of faith and establish a kind of beachhead – a 21st-century tower and stockade – in Halomot Arnona. I own a flat with a lovely balcony great neighbors 42 steps and no neighbors. I knew that one wrong step or distraction and oops I become a burden to my neighbors and family. I need a stair-free solution as I age.

Within the 330-unit Halomot Arnona complex we co-housing folks live in three adjoining buildings. The rent is stabilized for five years and then renewed with a COL adjustment for another five years. After that who knows?

Halomot Arnona CHI members share pot luck and holiday meals often including the larger Jerusalem CHI community; there’s yoga at sunset once a week. I live among people with whom I’ve built a community; there in times of joy and in times of need especially when the grandkids visit and you don’t have enough toys.

When we moved into the apartments our daily contacts focused on construction issues: backed-up plumbing electricity outages pipes that burst in the middle of Shabbat lunch and why doesn’t the maintenance company answer the emergency line?

Now we co-housers can go days without seeing one another. We stay in touch through a HA WhatsApp group and a second group for the larger Jerusalem co-housing gang.

Even during this pandemic we continue to build and strengthen our community; sharing meals outside playing music and other social activities with the larger Jerusalem group. Prospective new members are invited to events and outdoor events.

A chance sighting from a porch or garden often leads to the impromptu glass of wine or a neighborly catch-up coffee. When we travel we rely on one another to gather our mail and water our plants. If we are working outside our homes then we leave the key for the house cleaner or technician with someone who will be around. When our guests are more observant we may borrow a skillet or pot from a member with a more kosher kitchen. When the oven shorts out during the baking of chocolate cookies we know we can rely on one another to get the cookies done.

We rallied around one of our couples when M broke his leg. We shopped and made meals for them and gave them the support they needed during his hospital stay. The Jerusalem Municipality’s Greater Baka neighborhood council recently granted us access to a community room right under my apartment. We have organized a mid-week “Games Time.” (Some serious Scrabble players here.) There’s a biweekly “Neighbors Play Music” that is also drawing some of our Sabra neighbors.

It is the beginning of our commitment to activities that have a social and environmental impact. Our future plans include a community garden and after-school tutoring for children in the new school year.

We are hopeful the CHI Halomot Arnona group will grow as apartments become available. This is an interim solution giving CHI a place to call home until a planned permanent dwelling place is created.

Pioneers for a third age

During the eight years CHI has experienced attrition. We’ve seen members leave the group for family or financial reasons. Some became discouraged when they understood that it will take many years until CHI has a permanent address.

However CHI through its online parlor meetings and buddy outreach has also welcomed new members including native Hebrew-speakers who want the challenge of creating a new housing model for active healthy aging in an intentional community of kindred spirits.

Those who are joining us understand that changing the landscape for affordable senior co-housing is as one member likes to say “… not a spectator sport. You have to be ready to get down on the field and get dirty.”

It’s endless meetings communications with the government and other agencies and offices. It’s organizing Zoom sessions welcoming potential newcomers being interviewed. Writing articles. The list goes on.

CHI’s membership has mostly come from person-to-person contact new friendships through meetings and activities from which the shared vision statement was authored and signed by us all.

We were worried how COVID-19 would impact CHI’s momentum and community that are the connective tissue of co-housing. What we discovered was that by meeting on Zoom we could actually expand our geographic reach and we now have several members from towns and villages in the North. Another advantage was that participating in meetings with government ministries and municipal authorities was easier to organize online. No one has to look for a parking spot.

There are now around 30 activists in national CHI who live all over the country. New groups have formed in Haifa Pardess Hanna in Mevaseret Zion and in Safed.

There are more than 1000 people following CHI on Facebook. Some 35 newly interested people attended the monthly Hebrew-English Zoom meeting in the first week of August.

A very unscientific but revealing survey done among the 35 participants found that most of the people who were 55+ have moved on an average of six times in the last 20 years. Where do they see themselves in five years? In a co-housing community surrounded by trees.

Our journey to build Israel’s first co-housing project has been as our chairperson says “… a roller-coaster ride of incredible highs and discouraging lows.”

We are pioneers.

The Israelites wandered the vast desert living in temporary dwellings for 40 years until they reached the Promised Land. We the members and supporters of Co-Housing Israel are confident it won’t take us that long.

Experts explain,"Months after emergency use approval both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were given their full stamp by Health Canada — a stamp that came with new names for the vaccines as well.

In a tweet Thursday morning Canada’s health agency announced the new names with Pfizer’s vaccine now being known as “Comirnaty” Moderna’s jab as “Spikevax” and AstraZeneca’s shot would be called “Vaxzevria.”

(3/4) These are only name changes. There are no changes to the vaccines themselves. — Health Canada and PHAC (@GovCanHealth) September 16 2021

“These are only name changes. There are no changes to the vaccines themselves” Health Canada said.

While the full approval means that kids aged 12 and up are now able to receive their shots of Comirnaty or Spikevax the renaming raised some concern over possible confusion people might have with the new “complicated” names — especially during a time when Canada is struggling to increase its vaccine uptake.

Health and vaccine experts tell Global News that the renaming really is just a part of the normal regulatory process that the vaccines have to undergo and that their old names would most likely stick in the long run.

Scott Halperin director of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology and professor at Dalhousie University explained that the renaming was not Health Canada’s choice but rather a branding exercise decided by the vaccine makers themselves.

“So it’s the companies that did it and the condition is that companies are not allowed to market the vaccine or a drug before it’s approved for use” said Halperin.

3:33 Where is Canada heading in its fight against COVID-19?

“Now what happened with COVID vaccines is unusual in that they did not receive full approval they were released for emergency use authorization.”

Halperin pointed to the lack of marketing around COVID-19 vaccines in Canada the last year-and-a-half due to the approval process and that vaccine makers weren’t allowed to name their drugs in Canada without full approval.

“So it’s not that they renamed them. It’s just now their name is allowed to be used publicly” he said.

Health Canada’s full approval stamp comes just weeks after the United States Food and Drug Administration fully passed the Pfizer jab on Aug. 23.

“Based on the longer-term follow-up data that we submitted today’s decision by Health Canada affirms the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine at a time when it is urgently needed” announced Fabien Paquette the vaccines lead for Pfizer Canada on Thursday.

“While a significant number of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated there is still much work to be done as infection and hospitalization rates continue to rise across the country primarily among unvaccinated populations.”

On whether there was concern that the new brand names would change the public’s perception of the shots and influence people’s decision on whether to get a dose Halperin says his guess is that it won’t make much of a difference.

It’s an assumption also shared by infectious diseases specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch who said that he’s still going to call them by their old names.

Yeah nobody cares. I'm still going with Pfizer Moderna & AZ rather than [unpronounceable] the name of a D-division volleyball team and Vaxixkckerkrzvia. — Isaac Bogoch (@BogochIsaac) September 16 2021

In an interview with Global News on Saturday Bogoch said that he doesn’t think people are going to use those brand names.

“They’re hard to say they’re new they’re a bit confusing and I just think people are going to continue with what they already know” he said.

“Since it’s been announced by Health Canada has anyone used any of these names? I heard them once — and I talk about vaccines all the time.”

Bogoch said that the one change that made sense to him and was helpful was the World Health Organization (WHO) naming its variants of concern.

In May the WHO announced it had assigned several key variants of the virus letters of the Greek alphabet such as the B.1.1.7 variant being renamed to the Alpha variant and B.1.617.2 to Delta.

As for the new vaccine brand names Bogoch was confident that it would do little to deter people from getting their vaccines or change the way they would be discussed.

“With the brand names for the vaccines I could be wrong but I don’t think that we’re going to be using this in our day-to-day conversations — both in the field of medicine and also in regular conversation outside of medicine.”

Everything you need to know.,"Despite the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and easy access the U.S. has fallen behind 40 other countries in getting its people fully vaccinated in a pandemic that is still raging.

About 55% of Americans have gotten at least two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or a single shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine according to Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center. That compares with top-ranked Malta which has fully vaccinated 83% of its population. Our Canadian neighbors have a 70% vaccination rate. China is at 72%. The UK is at 66%.

And though the pace of vaccinations rose slightly in August it has trended downward the last two weeks.

Editorial: An appeal to vaccinated Free Press readers

At this rate ""by the end of September the U.S. will have the lowest vaccination level of all prosperous democracies With the largest supply & the biggest head start"" Andy Slavitt who stepped down in June as senior adviser to the White House pandemic response team said in a tweet last week.

Michigan's vaccination rate lags behind the national average with 51.4% of its population now fully vaccinatedCDC data shows.

And that's despite a supply of coronavirus vaccines that is now abundant. Anyone 12 and older who wants a shot can get a shot. All they have to do is go to a local pharmacy or text their ZIP code to 438829 or call 800-232-0233.

Don't have a ride? The government will pay an Uber or Lyft driver to take you there. And in some communities including Detroit health care workers will even make a house call to bring the vaccine to you.

What types of COVID-19 vaccines are available in the U.S.?

There are three different coronavirus vaccines widely available today:

Pfizer: Made in partnership with the German-based biotechnology firm BioNTech this coronavirus vaccine is fully authorized by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for use in Americans ages 16 and older. Adolescents ages 12-15 also are eligible for the Pfizer vaccine under an FDA emergency use authorization. It is given in a series of two doses spread three weeks apart. It is being marketed now under the brand name Comirnaty.

Federal regulators have recommended a third dose for people with immune-suppressing conditions. A decision is expected next week on whether Americans ages 65 and older along with people who are at high risk of severe disease should also take a third dose.

Moderna: Available under an emergency use authorization for Americans 18 and older the Massachusetts-based company has applied for full approval from the FDA for its coronavirus vaccine. It is given in a series of two doses spaced four weeks apart. Federal regulators have recommended a third dose for people with compromised immune systems.

Johnson & Johnson: Available through an FDA emergency use authorization for Americans ages 18 and older the J&J vaccine made by its Belgian-based pharmaceutical branch Janssen Pharmaceuticals is given in a single dose.

The CDC published a study Friday analyzing the effectiveness of all three vaccines in use in the U.S. from March to August when the more contagious delta variant was circulating.

It found the Moderna vaccine was 93% effective at preventing hospitalization and death among U.S. adults who were not immunocompromised. Pfizer's vaccine was 88% effective and J&J's was 71% effective.

How do the COVID-19 vaccines work?

Both Moderna's and Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccines are made with messenger RNA technology. They use a protein that mimics the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It tricks the body into mounting an immune response that will protect a person from the virus.

They do not use the live virus and cannot give a person COVID-19.

The mRNA used to make these vaccines does not affect or interact with a person's DNA or genetic material. It is quickly broken down by the body and eliminated.

The J&J vaccine is different. It is an adenovirus vector vaccine. It uses a modified cold virus that has been stripped of several of its genes. Those genes are replaced with genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus which then triggers an immune response to protect a person from the virus.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine cannot multiply in the body and it cannot give a person COVID-19. It also does not alter a person's DNA.

Is the technology used to develop the mRNA vaccines brand new?

No it's not new.

The technology has been studied and tested for decades including in the development of vaccines for flu Zika rabies and cytomegalovirus. It's just that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines created by Pfizer and Moderna were the first to complete the federal regulatory process and bring an mRNA vaccine to market.

In addition to using mRNA in the production of vaccines the technology also has been used in cancer research to trigger the immune system to attack cancer cells.

What was the approval process like?

The coronavirus vaccines were created and tested using the same process the FDA and CDC require for every vaccine in use in the U.S. today. They were not experimental.

Here is how it worked:

The pharmaceutical companies first had to apply to the FDA for permission to test new vaccines to fight the novel coronavirus. The FDA evaluated those applications and was satisfied the ideas and the technology they planned to use met its standards for quality and safety.

Clinical trials began next.

Each company recruited thousands of volunteers for randomized blinded and controlled trials conducted in a series of phases that expanded at each level to include more people. The trials helped scientists determine whether the vaccines worked what the side effects were and identified the ideal dose.

Data from the clinical trials was then submitted to the FDA and CDC for review. Federal regulators inspected the vaccine manufacturing facilities to ensure that the companies could produce the vaccines reliably and consistently.

Then the companies each had to submit a licensing application asking for permission to distribute and market their vaccines to the public.

The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee made up of an independent panel of expert scientists reviewed all the data and recommended each vaccine for emergency use authorization. The FDA commissioner signed off on the recommendations.

At that stage the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices developed recommendations for the use of each of the vaccines establishing who should get them the number of doses that should be given and how far apart they should be spaced.

After the CDC committee issued guidelines for the vaccines the CDC director approved them. They then could be injected into the arms of Americans.

Pfizer was the first to win an emergency use authorization in mid-December 2020. It was soon followed by Moderna and then Johnson & Johnson in late February.

In August the FDA fully approved the Pfizer vaccine for Americans ages 16 and older. The vaccine remains under emergency use authorization for teens and tweens ages 12-15 and for a third dose for people who are immunocompromised.

An FDA committee recommended Friday that an emergency use authorization be granted for a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for people six months after the second dose if they are ages 65 and older or are at high risk for severe COVID-19 complications because of underlying health conditions such as obesity or diabetes.

The FDA commissioner a CDC committee and CDC director must all agree before that emergency use authorization can be granted. Those steps could come as soon as next week.

Moderna also has applied for full authorization of its vaccine and Johnson & Johnson is expected to apply for full approval soon.

What are the risks?

All three coronavirus vaccines continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring of any vaccines in U.S. history. Both the FDA and the CDC say the benefits of being vaccinated far outweigh the risks.

The most commonly reported side effects for all three vaccines are mild and tend to dissipate within one to two days. They include pain redness and swelling at the injection site fatigue headache muscle or joint pain chills and fever. There also have rarely been reports of severe allergic reactions.

All three vaccines are considered safe and effective in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 but there have been some safety concerns:

JOHNSON & JOHNSON: In April the FDA added a safety warning saying there's an association with rare reports of thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome following vaccination. The condition causes blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets that can be life threatening. Those at highest risk for the complication are women ages 18-49.

A warning also was added in July about a small increased risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome after taking the vaccine. The rare neurological condition causes the body’s immune system to damage nerve cells and can lead to muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.

In August warnings were added that the vaccine also could trigger tinnitus or ringing in the ears diarrhea and vomiting.

PFIZER & MODERNA: In June the CDC vaccine advisory committee reviewed reports of heart inflammation among teens and young adults after they were immunized with either a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices acknowledged there likely is an association with myocarditis and pericarditis among 12- to 39-year-olds following vaccination.

The complication is more likely to occur in boys and young men and the condition is most likely to appear within the first five days after vaccination. Most who developed the heart complication post-vaccination have made full recoveries.

Anyone can report side effects to the federal government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System by calling 800-822-7967 or online at vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html.

Do the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks?

Yes. Unvaccinated people are 4.5 times more likely to be infected with coronavirus compared with fully vaccinated people. They also are over 10 times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 and 11 times more likely to die of the disease said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.

The data comes from a new study of case rates hospitalizations and deaths from the virus among more than 600000 people in 13 states from April 4-July 17 when the highly contagious delta variant was circulating in the U.S.

The study Walensky said ""offers further evidence of the power of vaccination.""

While a very tiny percentage of people have had complications from vaccination 1 in every 500 Americans has died of COVID-19 since the pandemic began. It was the third leading cause of death in the month of August and has now infected more than 41.8 million people and killed more than 668000 in the United States.

The virus also can cause little understood long-term complications that can be disabling and last four or more weeks after the initial infection. Known as long COVID or post-COVID syndrome it can affect every major organ system and can include fatigue pain brain fog difficulty breathing cough or shortness of breath headache heart palpitations dizziness and more.

Scientists know the vaccines work at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Comparatively the risk of serious side effects from any of the vaccines is extremely small.

Among 1 million women ages 18-49 who received the J&J vaccine seven developed blood clots with low platelet count according to the CDC. The incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome among Americans 18 and older who got the J&J vaccine is estimated to be about 1.5 in 100000.

For those who took the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines cases of serious heart inflammation — myocarditis or pericarditis — have been reported at a rate of 12.6 per million people within 21 days after a second dose of a vaccine though some cases have also been reported after the first dose as well.

Anaphylaxis a severe allergic reaction has occurred in 2 to 5 people per 1 million who get a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S.

What are the religious objections to the vaccines?

Very few religions are opposed to COVID-19 vaccines as a matter of doctrine.

Traditionally Christian Scientists have rejected the use of vaccines; most of its members rely on prayer for healing and have sought religious exemptions from vaccine mandates.

However the church issued a statement on its website saying that members ""are free to make their own choices on all life-decisions in obedience to the law including whether or not to vaccinate. These aren’t decisions imposed by their church.""

Some members of the Dutch Reformed Church also oppose vaccines believing they interfere with God's will. But that isn't an absolute either. Some members also view the vaccines as gifts from God according to a review of religious objections to vaccines from Vanderbilt University.

Catholics have some objections too.

In early March Michigan's seven Catholic bishops including Archbishop Allen Vigneron of the Archdiocese of Detroit called the J&J vaccine ""more morally problematic"" than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

That's because J&J ""utilized in the design production development and confirmatory testing a cell line that originated from tissue taken from an aborted baby"" and abortion violates Catholic doctrine.

The bishops urged the state's Catholic faithful to take Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccines instead and to only take the J&J vaccine ""if there are no other alternatives.""

Why isn't natural immunity just as good as a vaccine?

While a person who contracts coronavirus is likely to develop antibodies that should provide some protection from reinfection for at least a little while it's unclear how long that protection will last.

The CDC urges everyone including people who've already had COVID-19 to get vaccinated. The federal agency published a study in August that analyzed coronavirus reinfections from May to June among hundreds of fully vaccinated people and unvaccinated people in Kentucky.

It found that those who were unvaccinated were more than twice as likely to be reinfected with the virus than fully vaccinated people were.

“If you have had COVID-19 before please still get vaccinated” Walensky the CDC director said in a statement. “This study shows you are twice as likely to get infected again if you are unvaccinated. Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others around you especially as the more contagious delta variant spreads around the country.”

If you had the virus and were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma the CDC recommends waiting 90 days before getting a coronavirus vaccine.

Who should get a booster shot?

For now federal regulators have not approved COVID-19 vaccine boosters for the majority of Americans.

However the CDC urges some people to get another shot. Anyone who had a two-dose series of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines who has a moderately to severely compromised immune system should get a third dose the CDC advises.

That's because people who are immunocompromised might not build up the same level of immunity from the vaccines as healthier people.

The recommendation for a booster includes people who:

Are being treated for tumors or cancers of the blood.

Received an organ transplant and are taking immune-suppressing medication.

Received a stem cell transplant in the last two years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system.

Have moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency such as DiGeorge syndrome or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

Have advanced or untreated HIV infection.

Are undergoing treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress immune response.

On Friday the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted to recommend a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for Americans ages 65 and older and for people who have other underlying health conditions that put them at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Those conditions include diabetes and obesity.

The third dose for that population would fall under an emergency use authorization and would be recommended six months after the second Pfizer dose. FDA officials are also considering whether to include in the recommendation that health care workers and other front-liners who are at high occupational risk of exposure to the virus get a third dose.

But there are still some hurdles it has to jump before that recommendation goes into effect. It first must be approved by the FDA director. It also must be reviewed by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices which meets Wednesday.

If the CDC director signs off on the recommendation a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine could win an emergency use authorization as soon as next week for those 65 and older people with underlying health conditions and potentially front-line workers.

Federal authorities also are investigating whether people who took the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines should get another dose but so far no recommendations have been made.

What we don't know

There's so much scientists are still learning about the SARS-CoV-2 virus how to treat it and why it seems to cause severe symptoms in some people but not in others.

Because the virus is mutating every new strain of the virus brings with it new questions and concerns. Some variants like the delta strain are more transmissible than others. Scientists worry that as the virus continues to spread new variants will emerge that could evade the current tests or render the vaccines and treatments ineffective. Such a strain could be deadlier as well.

That's one of several reasons why doctors and health officials urge as many people as possible to get vaccinated. Immunizing more people will reduce the rate of infection and thereby cut the chances the virus has to mutate.

Because the coronavirus vaccines have been on the market for less than a year some people who've yet to get vaccinated say they are concerned about potential long-term effects.

While there aren't studies yet showing their safety over a long period of time the CDC says serious side effects that could cause long-term health problems are extremely unlikely for the COVID-19 vaccines as they are for any vaccine.

That's because side effects from any vaccination are most likely to occur within six weeks after getting a shot the CDC reports.

@StacyBrownMedia

According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention two-dose regimens of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines provided a high level of protection against COVID-19 hospitalizations in a real-world evaluation at 21 U.S. hospitals during the period between March 11 and August 15.

Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech doses were 93 percent and 88 percent respectively whereas the single-dose Janssen [Johnson & Johnson] vaccine had a lower effectiveness rate at 71 percent.

Protection for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine declined four months after vaccination.

Released Friday September 17 the report revealed that individuals vaccinated with the Janssen vaccine also had lower postvaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels than did recipients of mRNA vaccines.

In addition although an immunologic correlate of protection has not been established for COVID-19 vaccines the researchers found that antibody titers after infection and vaccination have been associated with protection.

“These real-world data suggest that the 2-dose Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine regimens provide more protection than does the 1-dose Janssen viral vector vaccine regimen” the researchers wrote.

“Although the Janssen vaccine had lower observed vaccine effectiveness one dose of Janssen vaccine still reduced risk for COVID-19–associated hospitalization by 71 percent.”

The study included 3689 patients.

Overall 2362 (64 percent) were unvaccinated; 476 (12.9 percent) were fully vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine; 738 (20 percent) were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 113 (3.1 percent) were fully vaccinated with the Janssen vaccine.

Among all participants the median age was 58 years 48 percent female 23 percent non-Hispanic Black and 18 percent Hispanic.

Efficacy for the Moderna vaccine was 93 percent at 14 to 120 days (the median equaled 66 days) after receiving the second vaccine dose and 92 percent after 120 days (with the median equaling 141 days).

For Pfizer-BioNTech efficacy stood at 91 percent at 14 to 120 days (the median equaled 69 days) after receiving the second vaccine dose but declined significantly to 77 percent at more than 120 days (the median equaled 143 days).

The postvaccination antibody analysis included 100 healthy volunteers 32 fully vaccinated with Moderna 51 fully vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech and 17 with Janssen.

Antibody levels were higher in participants vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine than those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or the Janssen vaccine.

The report revealed that anti-spike levels in participants vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine did not significantly differ from those in recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech but were considerably higher than levels in participants who received the Janssen.

The report arrives as a U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel reviewed the need for booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine.

The panel also expected to vote on whether the agency should approve additional doses for people 16 and older.

“We will evaluate and see” said Dr. James Hildreth the president and CEO of Meharry Medical College and an FDA panelist deciding on the booster shots.",,,,,,

Kelly on the Lack of Evidence to Support Probiotics for C difficile,"Based on evidence from recent studies and other data there really is no basis to recommend probiotics for individuals with Clostridioides difficile infection said Colleen R. Kelly MD FACG gastroenterologist with Lifespan Physician Group Gastroenterology practice and at the Center for Women’s Gastrointestinal Medicine and associate professor of medicine at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University speaking about updated guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology.

Transcript

What do clinicians and patients need to know about the updated guidelines for Clostridioides difficile infection that discuss probiotics?

Probiotics have been this thing that a lot of us to treat who treat a lot of C diff see people spending a lot of money on and they kind of have in our mind been a lot of magical thinking. We do this without a lot of data. We tell patients we know C diff is because you have too many bad bacteria and not enough good bacteria so let's go to the store and buy these pills with good bacteria. Anything we recommend to patients I just want to make sure we're not snake oil salesmen that we're telling them to go buy something that's going to work. And I think with probiotics I would see patients who came to me after having 3 4 or 5 recurrent C diff infections with a bag of probiotics they're spending $100 or more a month on.

We took a real deep dive into the research to see if probiotics are effective at preventing C diff in the first place. So if you get a course of antibiotics for dental infection or a UTI [urinary tract infection] should you take probiotics along with them to keep yourself from getting C diff or after you already have C diff if you take probiotics along with the C diff treatment or afterwards is your C diff less likely to come back again—so secondary prevention—and we really found that probiotics didn't appear to be effective in either of those situations. There are a few studies here and there but most of the better done studies the prospective randomized controlled trials of probiotics for primary prevention have been negative studies and not shown any benefit over placebo and the few smaller studies that have were a little suspect in terms of methodologies and sample sizes. They had really high rates of C diff in their background placebo-treated populations that really exceeded anything that we see here. And so there really just wasn't anything compelling to show that they helped.

Some people will say “Well even if they don't really help maybe they don't hurt and maybe they make the patient feel proactive like they're doing something for themselves. I think we're actually finding they may hurt. There's been a couple of studies that have shown that probiotics may actually be detrimental to normal recolonization of the gut that the gut flora after a course of antibiotics [probiotics] may disrupt that normal balance. Also patients who are immunocompromised there have been reports of probiotics bacteremia or fungemia particularly in people who are hospitalized. And I have seen people in the hospital who are really sick getting probiotics and that's certainly a situation where we wouldn't want people getting them.

So there's not enough data for benefit and now there's kind of some data that it could be harmful. There’s really no reason we should as doctors and based on the current science be recommending this to patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Workers from other Nabisco bakeries and distribution centers soon joined the strike including those in Chicago; Aurora Colorado; Richmond Virginia; and Norcross Georgia. It attracted national attention.

Cameron Taylor a business agent at Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Local 364 in Portland said Saturday that about 75% of members approved of the agreement which got rid of the new healthcare proposal and maintained the regular overtime schedule for most employees.

“What my members wanted was to hold on to their benefits” Taylor said noting they mostly got what they wanted.

“What the company did get was a weekend crew” he said which he called “a sticking point” with his members.

Still Taylor said he was already in communication with the company’s human resources department and expected workers would be in meetings on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week and then “potentially starting production back up on Thursday.”

Though some Portland employees opposed ratifying the four-year contract calling for better terms it ultimately garnered the necessary support from workers there and at facilities in Aurora Colorado; Richmond Virginia; Chicago Illinois; and Norcross Georgia.

Anthony Shelton president of the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM) confirmed the agreement with Nabisco's parent company Mondelez International in a statement Saturday.

""This has been a long and difficult fight for our striking members their families and our union"" Shelton said. ""Throughout the strike our members displayed tremendous courage grit and determination.""

Cameron Taylor a business agent at BCTGM Local 364 in Portland toldThe Oregonian on Saturday that about 75% of all members approved of the agreement with the snack giant known for Oreo and Chips Ahoy! cookies as well as Ritz and other crackers.

""What my members wanted was to hold on to their benefits"" Taylor said referencing that the deal scraps a new healthcare proposal and allows most workers to maintain their regular overtime schedule. He noted that ""what the company did get was a weekend crew.""

While BCTGM Local 364 vice president Michael Burlingham told the Portland Mercury that he was ""not surprised"" by the vote ""but it's disappointing nonetheless"" both he and Taylor still framed the development as an improvement in conditions for workers.

The strike ""sent a message to all corporations that workers are not going to get pushed around even if these corporations are multi-billion corporations"" said Taylor. ""I think the strike was a success we couldn't accept what the company was stuck on... and we got them to move off of it.""

After the votes were counted Darlene Carpenter a business agent for the union's Local 358 in Virginia told the Richmond Times-Dispatch ""I'm ecstatic.""

""This is a major win"" Carpenter said noting that workers will get a raise each year of the contract higher company match to 401(k) contributions and a $5000 ratification bonus. ""We have been like David who took down Goliath because people stood up for their beliefs.""

Carpenter signaled that workers at her location are equally happy about the outcome adding that ""I just got off the phone with one of the workers and she started crying because she was so ecstatic.""

Glen Walter Mondelez's executive vice president and president of its North America operations said that the company was ""pleased"" to reach an agreement that will ""provide our union-represented colleagues with good wages and competitive benefits while also positioning our U.S. bakeries and sales distribution facilities for future growth and success.""

Amid the celebrations Shelton acknowledged that the ""striking members made enormous sacrifices in order to achieve a quality contract that preserves our union's high standards for wages hours and benefits for current and future Nabisco workers.""

""Their sacrifice will benefit all BCTGM members and working people around the country for years to come"" he continued. ""Those brothers and sisters who walked the picket lines day in and day out are true BCTGM heroes.""

The union leader also expressed gratitude for ""the outpouring of fraternal support and solidarity we received from across the labor movement in the U.S. and around the world.""

""We offer our deepest gratitude to AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler for directing the full resources and power of the AFL-CIO at the federal state and local levels in support of our striking members and our union"" he said. ""This support was critical to the success of the strike.""

""The BCTGM has shown once again that this union will do whatever it takes make any sacrifice take on any employer or adversary"" Shelton added ""in order to preserve the rights and jobs of our members and the standard of living of BCTGM families.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vY2hpY2Fnby5zdW50aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS85LzE5LzIyNjgzMDY3L25hYmlzY28td29ya2Vycy1lbmQtc3RyaWtlLWluLWNoaWNhZ28tb3RoZXItY2l0aWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nabisco workers end strike in Chicago other cities,"Nabisco workers have overwhelmingly ratified a contract to end a strike that started more than a month ago in Portland Oregon and spread to other five locations including a bakery on Chicago’s Southwest Side.

The four-year agreement retroactive to March 1 applies to about 1000 workers in the United States. Nabisco owner Mondelez International said the contract includes a ratification bonus hourly wage increases each year an increased company match for 401(k) accounts and “flexible work schedules” to resolve a contentious issue over required weekend work for busy production lines.

Neither the company nor the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union released the vote count. April Flowers-Lewis a union steward who has been involved in the strike at 7300 S. Kedzie Ave. said the nationwide vote was 590 to 201 in favor of the agreement.

The strike had idled 325 workers at the Chicago plant and another 20 at a distribution site in Addison. Mondelez provided a statement from Executive Vice President Glen Walter who said the new contract continues good wages and benefits while “positioning our U.S. bakeries and sales distribution facilities for future growth and success.”

The company asked Chicago workers to attend meetings Tuesday at a Midway Airport-area hotel to hear about back-to-work procedures. The bakery makes Chips Ahoy Wheat Thins Nutter Butter cookies and belVita breakfast biscuits.

Union President Anthony Shelton said in a statement “The BCTGM’s striking members made enormous sacrifices in order to achieve a quality contract that preserves our union’s high standards for wages hours and benefits for current and future Nabisco workers. Their sacrifice will benefit all BCTGM members and working people around the country for years to come.”

Shelton has said his members were fighting for jobs that support a strong middle class and that other employers were watching closely.

If you've ever been the lucky recipient of a Toblerone then you probably noticed how easy the tasty candy bar is to share. Toblerone candy bars are divided into chocolate triangles that make snapping off a section and handing it to a buddy all the easier. According to the Culture Trip it's widely believed those little chocolate pyramids were inspired by a peak in the Alps known as the Matterhorn while members of the Tobler family for which the bar is named have said the shape was actually inspired by a show at the Parisian music hall Folies Bergère that culminated in a spectacular human triangle created by the dancers.

Beyond the iconic shape of the candy bar itself Toblerones are easily identified by their logo comprising the name in all caps and a mountain shape. But there may be more to that mountain shape than initially meets the eye. As Twitter user @upStephanie pointed out in a post there is actually an outline of an animal inside the logo!

In the tweet @upStephanie wrote about an eye-opening exchange: ""My son had his first Toblerone today. 'What's the bear for?' Me: 'what bear?'"" She concluded ""I was today years old when I found out there's a bear in the Toblerone logo."" Others responded to the message in agreement with messages like ""I had never seen that!!! Your son is brilliant!"" But after learning about the bear's sneaky placement one may wonder why it's there in the first place."

Classic Monsters Cafe Halloween Horror Nights Menu

Food

🆕 Flammkuchen: flatbread topped with crème fraîche caramalized onions Swiss cheese and smoked bacon – $8.99

🆕 Maultaschen (Vegetarian): German lasagna filled with Beyond meat spinach and mushrooms served in vegetable broth with caramelized onions and chives- $7.99

🆕 Reibekuchen: potato pancake with apple sauce crème fraîche pumpernickle crumble and chives – $7.99

🆕 Frankenstein Swirl: black sesame and white swirl ice cream served in a black cocoa waffle cone- $7.99

🆕 Bride of Frankenstein Oreo Mini Cake: layered Oreo petit cake with black and white swirled buttercream – $4.99

*NEW* Flammkuchen – $8.99

flatbread topped with crème fraîche caramelized onions Swiss cheese and smoked bacon

This was the best of all the dishes at Classic Monsters Cafe. The Swiss cheese and bacon had powerful flavors and the creamy sauce complemented them perfectly. We enjoyed it even though it was cold by the time we ate. The Swiss cheese is the headliner here; it ties everything together. We recommend this.

*NEW* Maultaschen (Vegetarian) – $7.99

German lasagna filled with Beyond meat spinach and mushrooms served in vegetable broth with caramelized onions and chives

The mix of Beyond meat and vegetable broth was a nice change from some of the heavier dishes here. The pasta was cooked perfectly though it’s not a traditional Maultaschen. The price point is great as this is a very filling dish. It would be even better on a cooler evening.

*NEW* Reibekuchen – $7.99

potato pancake with apple sauce crème fraîche pumpernickle crumble and chives

This potato dish should have known better than to come to an event famous for Twisted Taters. The potato pancake wasn’t bad but we didn’t like the apple sauce and the sour cream had a strong taste we didn’t care for. Skip this and get yourself a classic Twisted Tater instead.

*NEW* Frankenstein Swirl – $7.99

black sesame and white swirl ice cream served in a black cocoa waffle cone

The black sesame seed and vanilla ice cream go well together. The consistency is a little different than the soft serve you’ll find around the parks. The vanilla flavor was excellent nice and rich and not too creamy or heavy. It’s an interesting combination of flavors and worth trying. We would get it again.

*NEW* Bride of Frankenstein Oreo Mini Cake – $4.99

layered Oreo petit cake with black and white swirled buttercream

This was really good perfect for fans of Oreo desserts. We loved the cake and buttercream frosting. It’s simple and the flavor palette is basic but the execution is great. Plus the presentation is excellent. It’s very photogenic. We would get this again.

Beverages

🆕 Lost Coast Beer Float: Lost Coast Peanut Butter Chocolate Milk Stout vanilla ice cream and whipped cream – $13.99

🆕 Monochrome Monster: non-alcoholic raspberry mocha cold brew creation with Frankenstein Swirl ice cream and whipped cream – 13.99

*NEW* Monochrome Monster – $13.99

Non-alcoholic raspberry mocha cold brew creation with Frankenstein Swirl ice cream and whipped cream

This drink was so awful and so different than the description; we hope it was just made incorrectly. This was more like raspberry iced tea than a cold brew. The artificial raspberry was sickly sweet to where it even overpowered the whipped cream.

It was supposed to have the Frankenstein swirl ice cream at the bottom but ours only had vanilla. We were glad of that however because the black sesame would have just added another layer of flavor confusion. This monster should never have left Dr. Frankenstein’s lab.

Lost Coast Beer Float – $13.99

Lost Coast Peanut Butter Chocolate Milk Stout vanilla ice cream and whipped cream

Believe it or not the beer float was worse than the Monochrome Monster. It was basically beer ice cream and whipped cream. The peanut butter chocolate notes to the stout were lost. If you like heavy beer and dairy together go for it but it made us feel sick after just one sip.

Amazon's rapid expansion means they have a chance to create a better economy for working-class Americans.

It plans to add 125000 more US jobs and to open 100 new facilities in September alone.

The firm's huge hiring plans higher wages and new hubs have the scale that could change the economy for countless Americans.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

While the US continues to grapple with COVID Amazon is busy molding the post-pandemic economy. Early signs and historical precedent suggest it could improve work for millions of Americans.

Amazon employed 950000 US workers as of late June or one in every 153 American workers. It plans to add more than 125000 more payrolls as well as open more than 100 more facilities in September alone. More significantly it plans to pay people more and to create jobs in areas where they are sorely needed.

Amazon's leadership on wages recalls that of Henry Ford's action to lift his minimum wage in 1914 as Insider's Hillary Hoffower and Allana Akhtar previously reported. It's a goal shared by the Biden administration which has repeatedly stressed it wants to build the economy ""from the bottom up and middle out.""

Amazon is his unlikely partner in this effort.

Setting the new wage floor

While the federal minimum wage remains $7.25 an hour the retail titan is setting its own higher minimum.

The company set a $15 minimum wage in 2018 and it quickly prompted other employers to either match this rate or lose workers.

One Miami chef told The Washington Post that higher pay in Amazon warehouses made hiring in a strenuous kitchen more difficult. Larger businesses including Levi's and Under Armour have said Amazon's rates forced them to rethink their own wages. It is borne out in academic studies. Amazon's hike raised average hourly wages by 4.7% at nearby employers according to researchers at the University of California Berkeley and Brandeis University.

That bounce is set to repeat itself with Amazon's latest hiring boom touting an average starting wage of $18. While Democrats failed earlier this year to lift the minimum wage for the first time in 20 years Amazon's expansion is shifting the de-facto floor above the party's $15 target.

""I don't think people appreciate the extent to which Amazon puts a wage floor in a community"" Tum Duy chief economist at SGH Macro Advisors wrote in a Tuesday tweet. ""It's the first thing employers think about when a new Amazon facility arrives in town.""

Building the next-generation 'factory town'

By dramatically expanding its footprint Amazon could form a new kind of ""factory town"" that would further lift the country's working class as Conor Sen an economics columnist at Bloomberg wrote Thursday. ""Maybe these highway warehouse communities with jobs that pay increasingly respectable wages are what the future of the working class looks like.""

The phrase ""factory town"" recalls those that dot Michigan connected to automotive giants Ford General Motors and Chrysler which molded the state in the early 1900s as their factories became economic hubs and birthed new cities. Where the industrial titans brought jobs workers and other businesses followed. Amazon's huge warehouse plans offer a 21st-century parallel.

Data shows Amazon hubs already powering stronger economic growth. In Amazon's top 10 metro areas job creation averaged -0.4% in the three years before the company's entry CNBC reported in 2018 citing Morgan Stanley research. In the three years after its first facilities opened local job growth averaged 1.9%.







Some cities saw even larger jumps. In the Phoenix area job creation rose to 2.5% from -6.3%. The Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario region of California saw growth of -0.8% surge by 8.5% after Amazon opened several warehouses and sorting facilities.

The booms also extended beyond Amazon's own employees. The cities' transportation warehousing and utilities sectors – the last of which includes no Amazon hires – saw job growth outperform by 3.6% according to Morgan Stanley.

To be sure Amazon jobs aren't without their well-publicized downsides. Stories of overworked employees harsh conditions and safety concerns abound. The company has also been accused of quashing a unionization effort.

Amazon has said it aims to improve its working conditions but by sheer force and scale it is putting its thumb on the scale of the blue-collar economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlmcmUuY29tL3N0b3J5LzMwNDk0ODAvaWZyLWF3YXJkcy1ldmVudC1hdC1oYWJlcmRhc2hlcnMtaGFsbC0zdm5ncnFramdw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IFR Awards event at Haberdashers' Hall,"IFR hosted a very belated 2020 awards event in London on September 8 in the courtyard of Haberdashers’ Hall.

The sun shone the champagne flowed and attendees enjoyed the novelty of being at a public event for the first time in many months.

Just as importantly thanks to the generosity of the banking and finance industry £884000 was raised for Save the Children.

IFR’s 2020 Bank of the Year Morgan Stanley led the way with a stunning donation of £600000 – one of the highest individual donations in the history of the IFR Awards.

HRH The Princess Royal Patron of Save the Children presented the Bank of the Year trophy to Clare Woodman the bank’s head of EMEA and CEO of Morgan Stanley International.

IFR would like to thank all those who donated to Save the Children. We are confident that it will do much good especially given the events of the past year or two.

All being well the awards event will revert to the traditional format of a gala dinner at Grosvenor House next year – but a garden party at Haberdashers’ Hall made for a refreshing change.

TVMosaic is a cross-platform solution and is supposed to work on Windows 7 or higher Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit or higher Debian 9.1 64-bit or higher MacOS 10.12 or higher Raspberry Pi (except model 1) and various NAS from Synology QNAP ASUSTOR and NETGEAR.

So in theory that means you could install the TVMosaic server and restore most of the functionality of the commercial solution. However if you’re using the company’s USB tuner Windows will be your only option. Besides the Kodi PVR client other clients include the TVMosaic Android app and TVMosaic iOS and AppleTV apps which we are told will be made open-source soon as well.

Apart from existing users I’m not sure many people will use the TVMosaic CE server even it’s now open-source as several Kodi members already mentioned they had switched to NextPVR or TvHeadEnd after the company folded although other members lamented the lack of support for Acamd and NewCS Smartcard emulators in competing solutions. So only time will tell whether TVMosaic server can grow as a now open-source project. If it does features like DLNA could probably be restored via the miniDLNA project while EPG support might take a bit more work. [TVMosaic CE should already have built-in EPG support it’s just TVadvisor data source that is gone. See comments section]

More than 96 per cent of the cassava farmers access low cassava planting materials from their own fields or from fellow farmers.

Two viral diseases Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMB) and Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) are responsible for low yield and low-quality planting materials perpetuated by the use of virus-infected cuttings.

Cassava is flexible and the slow rate of growth makes it suitable for intercropping especially with maize. Cassava production is carried out all year round lasting an average of 12 months in the field.

The Programme for Education Advocacy Counselling and Economic Empowerment (PEACE) a humanitarian project by the Adventist Relief Agency (Adra) established a functional cassava seed system in northern Uganda among refugee hosting communities for sustainable productivity of cassava in the target project areas.

The aim of the project is to reduce hunger and poverty among refugee hosting communities.

According to Diana Balaba Sande the public relations officer at Adra Uganda quality cassava planting materials are produced in a decentralised manner by farmers groups who accessed clean seed procured from the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI).

Potential farmers groups were identified and trained in technical and business management skills.

Jerry Kiwanuka a livelihoods officer and agronomist with Adra says other activities of training include multiplication of pre-basic and basic seeds; procurement of basic cassava seed for establishment of cassava seed multiplication farms; marketing of the quality planting materials to farmers and cooperatives; and linkages with other institutions to facilitate technical follow up quality control and certification.

Kiwanuka says the system has sustainably driven smallholder farmers in such vulnerable places to access affordable quality planting materials of the improved cassava varieties especially NAROCAS 1.

“The farmers in refugee communities are now willing to pay for certified cassava planting materials as compared to receiving free planting materials” Kiwanuka says.

How the business operates

High-quality cassava cuttings for planting are often in short supply especially in refugee hosting settlements. This implies that farmers require the supply of high-yielding disease-resistant improved cassava varieties. These varieties have the potential to raise the low cassava productivity on farmers’ farms by up to 30-40 tonnes per hectare.

Thus the introduction of improved varieties and agronomic practices into the cassava production system consequently can increase yields per unit area by 40 per cent according to Kiwanuka.

“Basing on findings we found out that a lack of clean planting material was by far the most important problem among cassava farmers” he said. Also accounting to the challenges was low yields slow rates of adoption of the new varieties as well as insufficient quantity of recommended planting materials. Adra recruited 62 farmers groups comprising 1862 farmers as seed multipliers.

One of them is Molekungun Farmer’s Group a host community group in Zone 5 Bidibidi Refugee Settlement Ariwa Sub County Yumbe District.

Chaplain Diima is the chairman of the group. He reveals that they are now making great strides after switching to cassava stem multiplication.

“Our group was approved in March and we planted our first garden as a group in July. It is six acres of clean NAROCAS 1 stakes and we expect to earn a lot of money from selling the stems then ratoons before we harvest the cassava” Diima said.

Molekungun Farmer’s Group is a multifunctional group doing both community-managed savings and crop production. “When we harvest the stems some will be shared among the farmers to get clean planting materials as a benefit. We shall then reinvest into the group savings” Diima says.

Training of farmers in multiplication of cassava stems has facilitated acceptance and adoption of the new varieties among cassava farmers.

But Diima says that stem multiplication has opened opportunities for employment income generation and improved livelihoods for the cassava farmers concerned. “I am hoping to get school fees and upkeep for my children feeding the family and taking care of other needs from the money I will realise from this business” he adds. This is echoed by the rest of the group members who have their own stories to share.

Quality seed dilemma

Planting materials are mainly supplied by Operation Wealth Creation (OWC) and the National Agricultural Advisory Services (Naads). But in some areas there have been delays in distributing approved planting materials to farmers. As a result demand is quite high thereby encouraging active participation of the private sector in the production distribution and marketing of the improved seeds/varieties.

Considering that adoption of improved cassava varieties can be facilitated if they are readily available to farmers farmers groups dealing in cassava stakes as a business are thriving.",,,,,,,,,

Motorola Solutions Inc. CEO Greg Brown aka father of the bridegroom booked Mr. ""24K Magic"" for the event going down at a super swanky hotel in the area and spared no expense. We're told the wedding tab is in the millions.

Bruno of course will get a handsome slice of that ... we're told his performance price tag will hover somewhere between the high six-figure to seven-figure range.

As for the wedding guest list it's unclear how many will attend but the bride and groom are only allowing those who've been vaccinated to witness their ""I Do's"" ... and put their pinky fingers to the moon.

Shares (NASDAQ:TSLA) Than You Might Think,"This article first appeared on Simply Wall St News.

It is hard to compete against Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) especially when it comes to volatility. After setting a new all-time high upon the S&P500 inclusion the stock lost an incredible 40%.

However the recent price action has been very encouraging for bulls. As the stock marches to new highs we will look at the current ownership structure in this article.

See our latest analysis for Tesla.

Latest Developments

Cathie Wood CEO of Ark Invest explained the move to sell 180000 TSLA shares as a cash-raising measure to boost the stake in UiPath (NYSE: PATH). Wood pointed out that TSLA remains the largest holding in her portfolio confirming the bullish stance on the stock.

Meanwhile the company just obtained a patent for laser beam windshield wiper technology. From the current standpoint it is hard to understand why anyone would potentially point a laser toward the driver. Still a proper application of this technology is yet to be understood. In addition Tesla also possesses a patent for electromagnetic wipers.

The problems with automated driving are persistent as the latest Model 3 fatal crash in Florida prompted the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The agency officials have been following the application of autonomous driving technologies already investigating 33 crashes involving Tesla vehicles with partially automated driver-assist systems.

On a more positive note Wedbush Securities issued a positive note claiming that Tesla can get to 900k deliveries in 2021 and 1.3m in 2022. The data below shows that after the first half of 2021 the company still leads the global plug-in EV market.

Wedbush has Tesla as “Outperform” with a price target of US$1000 which would be a new all-time high.

An Ownership Overview

With a market capitalization of US$752b Tesla is relatively large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors too.

Our analysis of the company's ownership below shows that institutions own shares in the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Tesla.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Tesla?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that Tesla does have institutional investors but insiders and the general public still outnumber them.

It's therefore worth looking at Tesla's earnings history below. Of course the future is what matters.

Looking at our data we can see that the largest shareholder is CEO Elon Musk with 17% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile the second and third largest shareholders hold 6.0% and 5.1% of the shares outstanding respectively.

A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.

While studying institutional ownership data for a company makes sense it also makes sense to research analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be helpful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Tesla

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders capturing board members at the very least. Company management runs the business but the CEO will answer the board even if they are a member.

We generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions on some occasions.

It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Tesla Inc. It has a market capitalization of just US$752b and insiders have US$143b worth of shares in their names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.

General Public Ownership

The general public with a 37% stake in the company will not easily be ignored. This size of ownership while considerable may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Next Steps:

It is interesting to look at who exactly owns a company but to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too. For instance we've identified 1 warning sign for Tesla that you should be aware of.

It was initially published in 1896 and since then a significant quantity of important information has continued to be provided about inventories from various firms. This guide explores all about this robust index.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) is one of many indexes used as a gauge for how well an entire market performs at any given time. The index can be helpful because it shows where and how much specific markets have fluctuated in value for days weeks or months. It also allows investors to track their investment performance and compare themselves against others with different portfolios.

History of DJIA

The DJIA is one of the oldest and most well-known stock market indexes in America. Charles Dow the co-founder of the Wall Street Journal created the index back in 1884. Charles Dow composed his first stock average of nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the Customer’s Afternoon Letter a daily two-page financial news bulletin that preceded The Wall Street Journal. By 1900 the index was renamed Dow Jones Industrial Average and included 30 equities divided into two groups: the industrials (comprising 19 members) and the railroads (11).

DJIA expanded beyond transportation stocks with the addition of General Electric (NYSE: GE) in 1901. It joined as one of 11 industrial sector companies added that year due to perceived growth prospects based on earnings per share multiples at a time resulting from significant expansion following consolidation/merger wave among USUS manufacturing businesses during the 1890s – 1910s.

Many significant adjustments occurred throughout the 20th century as many former components combined departed or were relocated.

Using historical data from the DJIA you could get a good idea about what factors affect stocks in general. For example if you saw that oil prices tend to go up when there’s terrible weather somewhere – maybe your portfolio has some exposure to alternative energy research?

DJIA history is a significant indicator of the overall direction of top-level economic activity as measured by leading US industrial corporations whose performance is indicative of changes in business conditions and investment prospects for stock market investors. DJIA value has been included in significant decisions regarding monetary policy that affect global markets such as Federal Reserve rate decision announcements published in advance so financial professionals can monitor new information before public release.

Understanding the Dow Jones Industrial Average

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) sometimes called the “Dow” is a stock market index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States are trading during a standard trading session in the stock market.

The components of DJIA are chosen from leading US companies across different industry groups to reflect their significance within those specific industries and national markets overall.

For a company’s stocks to be added onto or removed from this average they must meet specific requirements including management integrity and liquidity along with shareholder equity over time which helps ensure only established corporations remain included.

Dow Jones Industrial Average Components

The DJIA comprises numerous components that are crucial to the information it provides about how well or poorly the stock market as a whole has performed on any given day.

As of 2021 the Dow Jones Average Index includes the following companies: Apple Inc (NYSE: AAPL) Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE: CRM) Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) Visa Inc (NYSE: V) The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) The American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: HON) Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) The Travelers Companies (NYSE: TRV) Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) Merck & Co. Inc (NYSE: MRK) UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) IBM (NYSE: IBM) 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) The Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) Amgen Inc (NASDAQ: AMGN) Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT) Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA).

DJIA vs the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite

While the basic mission of DJIA S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite is similar the way they go about the task is very different.

Their selection methodology varies. The Dow tracks the value of 30 large companies which tend to be blue-chip firms that are household names. The S&P 500 tends to be broader hoping to have a bigger representation of companies from various sectors and industry groups. And the Nasdaq composite includes only stocks that are trading on the Nasdaq market.

Conclusion

The DJIA has been a historical benchmark for investors to keep in mind when evaluating their stock performance compared to other top companies on the market. However there are many different indices these days and each investor needs to conduct thorough research before placing any investments with a financial adviser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVld2Fsay5jb20vYXBwbGUtaW5jLWFhcGwtbHVyZXMtamF5LWJsYWhuaWstZnJvbS1uaWtlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple Inc. (AAPL) Lures Jay Blahnik From Nike's FuelBand Team,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been rumored to be working on an iWatch for quite some time and last month we began to see rumors about a team taking shape. Now 9 to 5 Mac reports that Jay Blahnik has confirmed his new job at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Apple and the possibility of an iWatch

Of course Blahnik is known for his work on Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE)’s FuelBand so his hiring at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) would suggest that he’s going to work on a similar product for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). We heard hints from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that the company was working on an iWatch or some other wearable computing device which straps to the wrist. He was actually wearing Nike’s FuelBand at the D11 conference earlier this year.

Blahnik’s recent work history

9 to 5 Mac examined some profiles of Blahnik as well as social media posts. His profiles suggest that he travels 40 weeks per year to speak at fitness conferences and provide consulting to companies. They also say he has consulted for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the past for unspecified projects. However this time it appears as if he is actually leaving the fitness industry entirely to focus on his work at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s rumored iWatch is expected to be filled with health sensors and other computing capabilities. With Blahnik’s experience in the fitness industry he could help the company focus on making the iWatch something that changes the wearer’s behavior.

Apple and the smart watch shift

The big question now is whether Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s move into the smart watch industry is coming too late. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (LON:BC94) (KRX:005930) is said to be launching a smart watch in early September. Also analysts have been publishing a variety of views on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s so-called iWatch with some predicting that it will be a tremendous flop while others expecting it to be the company’s next big thing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS90ZWNoLzIxLzA5LzIzMDAzOTYzLzUtY29tZWR5LWljb25zLW5ldGZsaXgtcGFpZC1iaWctbW9uZXktZm9y0gEtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVuemluZ2EuY29tL2FtcC9jb250ZW50LzIzMDAzOTYz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Comedy Icons Netflix Paid Big Money For - Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://www.benzinga.com/tech/21/09/23003963/5-comedy-icons-netflix-paid-big-money-for on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS90ZWNoLzIxLzA5LzIzMDAzOTYzLzUtY29tZWR5LWljb25zLW5ldGZsaXgtcGFpZC1iaWctbW9uZXktZm9y0gEtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVuemluZ2EuY29tL2FtcC9jb250ZW50LzIzMDAzOTYz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVld2Fsay5jb20vYXBwbGUtaW5jLWNoaW5hLW1vYmlsZS1kZWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple Inc. Barriers To China Mobile Deal Disappearing,"Things are looking up for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s ability to cement a deal with China Mobile the world’s largest carrier. Many investors see a deal with the carrier as being an important step in Apple’s ability to gain ground in the rapidly growing market.

Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook met with the chief of China Mobile last month. The two were undoubtedly working toward the long-awaited deal that would give Apple access to 740 million more mobile subscribers.

Apple expected to release low cost iPhone

Lee Chyen Yee and Yimou Lee of Reuters report that one of the key ingredients in a deal between China Mobile and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the long-rumored low cost iPhone. The company is expected to unveil the handset next month.

According to Reuters Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s use of chips made by QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) also give it a leg up in China because those chips will work on China’s networks which are different than those found in other countries. So far the company has not signed a deal with China Mobile because it would have required that the iPhone be redesigned so that it could work on the carrier’s TD-SCDMA 3G technology.

The other big barrier to a deal between the two companies has been China Mobile’s hesitance to pay the large costs associated with subsidizing and marketing the iPhone.

4G licenses could help Apple

Chinese officials are expected to begin handing out 4G licenses by the end of this year and China Mobile could be first in line to receive one of those licenses because of its size. Those licenses are expected to be based on TD-LTE technology which by QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM)’s chips are compatible with. As such it would prevent Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from having to redesign the iPhone so that it would work on the carrier’s network.

Apple’s sales in China slumped by 43 percent in the June quarter compared to the March quarter as mid-range Chinese companies zeroed in on customers on their home turf. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s smartphone market share in the country has been almost cut in half since last year and is now under 5 percent according to research firm Canalys."

Changes Coming In The External Storage Business IBM and Hitachi continued to see a drop in external storage sales as Dell HPE and NetApp revenue grew in the second quarter of 2021 according to research firm IDC. IDC’s quarterly worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue is one of the basic barometers showing the health of the storage business. And for the second calendar quarter of 2021 it shows the industry to be a healthy one. IDC estimated second quarter sales reached $6.93 billion up 9.7 percent over the $6.31 billion estimated for the second quarter 2020 sales. Things look even better in terms of volume where IDC estimated total OEM storage capacity rose 27.9 percent over last year to reach 22.1 exabytes for the quarter. However the IDC worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue list has its limits. The obvious limit is that it includes external storage only and does not include internal storage that companies like Dell and HPE ship with servers or PCs. Even more important the quarterly report does reflect the fact that business are changing how they purchase storage. As CRN noted in its 8 Emerging Data Storage Trends To Watch In 2021 storage decisions are more likely to be made based on what will help companies grow their business and generate profits and not where and how the data is stored. How did the individual vendors do? Click through the slideshow to not only see the IDC numbers but more news and analysis from CRN.

Dell Technologies Dell Technologies’ storage business did very well according to IDC but not so good according to Dell. IDC reported Dell’s second calendar quarter 2021 worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue reached $1.86 billion up a very respectable 10.1 percent over the second quarter of 2020 giving Dell a 26.8-percent share of the total market. However that is at odds with Dell’s own reporting. Dell for its second fiscal quarter 2022 which ended July 30 reported storage revenue of $4 billion down 1 percent year-over-year. The Dell figure however is for all storage including storage sold with its servers as well as Dell’s storage software sales. Jeff Clarke vice chairman and co-COO of the Round Rock Texas-based Dell in reporting the company’s second fiscal quarter 2021 financials said Dell has the broadest storage portfolio in the market with the highest market share in high-end midrange entry-level unstructured object all-flash and software-defined storage. He also said Dell’s midrange storage sales grew 17 percent year over year but that high-end storage sales fell due to the cyclical nature of that product segment. He also called the Dell PowerStore the company’s fastest-growing product it ever launched through its first five quarters.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE had a strong second calendar quarter 2021 in storage with IDC reporting worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue of $756.7 million up 14.7 percent over last year giving HPE a 10.9-percent market share for the quarter. Like Dell the IDC revenue estimation does not include a significant amount of storage sold with its servers and other devices. The IDC numbers don’t do HPE justice. HPE said that storage revenue for its third fiscal quarter 2021 which ended July 31 was $1.2 billion up 4 percent over the prior-year period. The company a 10-percent year-over-year growth in its software-defined storage sales including sales of its Nimble storage technology. Sales of the company’s all-flash storage arrays grew by 30-plus percent over last year led by the HPE Primera line.

NetApp NetApp which a few years ago seemed to be a diminished force in the storage industry continues its march forward from strength to strength. The company had worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue of $685 million giving it a 9.9-percent market share according to IDC. That revenue was up 11.8 percent over last year. Unlike Dell and HPE NetApp is a pure-play storage vendor and ships no servers or other devices with internal storage. The IDC numbers don’t tell the whole story. NetApp for its first fiscal quarter 2022 which ended July 30 reported total revenue of $1.46 billion up 11.9 percent year-over-year. That included product revenue of $730 million. NetApp also reported that its all-flash storage business grew 23 percent over last year. However for NetApp the future is in the cloud. The company has taken the lead among legacy storage vendors in transforming its storage technology to work in public and private clouds allowing customers to seamlessly migrate data between on-premises hybrid cloud and public cloud. That means that the total amount of data managed by NetApp technology increasingly may not be on its own hardware.

Huawei China-based Huawei is the growth leader in storage. IDC estimates Huawei saw second calendar 2021 worldwide enterprise external OEM storage revenue of $619.5 million which was up a whopping 26.7 percent over last year. At that growth rate it may be a matter of a few quarters before Huawei overtakes NetApp as the third-largest vendor and begin to threaten HPE for the number-two spot. IDC estimates that Huawei has an 8.9-percent market share. Indeed the only thing holding Huawei back is its lack of a U.S. market. Because of alleged ties between the company and the Chinese government the company is effectively shut out of the U.S. which is the world’s biggest storage market. Hitachi Vantara Hitachi which includes Hitachi Vantara came in at fifth place in the worldwide enterprise external OEM storage market with revenue of $338.3 million which IDC was down 4.0 percent over last year. That was enough to give the company a 4.9-percent market share. For Hitachi storage is becoming a smaller part of its business as the company continues to find solid growth in the data analytics data operations IoT and cloud markets. However Hitachi is far from giving up on storage. The company late last year introduced its first midrange all-flash storage arrays and its first storage-as-a-service offering. Much of the company’s storage is targeted at some of the more higher-value offering it brings to clients such as data analytics.

IBM According to IDC IBM’s worldwide enterprise external OEM storage sales took the biggest hit of the top seven vendors falling 36.0 percent over last year to $322.9 million and a 4.7-percent market share. IBM in its second fiscal quarter 2021 financial report didn’t break out its storage sales instead including it along with its mainframe and Power server sales although the company did say storage systems sales fell 7 percent over last year. But looking at IBM’s storage hardware sales is not the best way to understand its storage business. IBM’s storage growth is coming from its software-defined storage sales where margins are high even though revenue is lower than that of complete storage systems.

Pure Storage Pure Storage came in at No. 7 on IDC’s list of top worldwide enterprise external OEM storage sales leaders. IBM estimated Pure Storage’s revenue at $287.4 million up 12 percent over last year giving it a market share of 4.1 percent. Given Pure Storage’s growth rate and the decreasing external storage sales from Hitachi and IBM Pure Storage is likely to soon move up to the number five position. Pure Storage in August said its total revenue for its second fiscal quarter which ended Aug. 1 reached $496.8 million of which $324.9 million was product revenue and $171.9 million subscription services revenue. Pure Storage is similar to rival NetApp in two key areas. First it is a pure play storage vendor and has no server or other hardware which might include internal storage. And the company is also pushing fast into the cloud with such moves as acquiring Kubernetes storage container Portworx and making its storage technology easily consumed in a cloud or as a service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vY2FyZWVycy9uZXdzL2VpZ2h0Zm9sZC1haS1pcy1sb29raW5nLXRvLWhpcmUtMzAwLXRlY2hpZXMtZnJvbS1pbmRpYS1hbmQtYWNyb3NzLXRoZS1nbG9iZS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NjI5MDU5MS5jbXPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmluL2NhcmVlcnMvbmV3cy9laWdodGZvbGQtYWktaXMtbG9va2luZy10by1oaXJlLTMwMC10ZWNoaWVzLWZyb20taW5kaWEtYW5kLWFjcm9zcy10aGUtZ2xvYmUvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg2MjkwNTkxLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eightfold.ai is looking to hire 300 techies from India and across the globe,"The company currently serves more than 100 clients including Dolby Tata Communications NetApp Booking.com TriNet.

Not only did Netflix take home the most Emmys for the year but it did so while winning more than double the total number of awards of its nearest competition. HBO and HBO Max by comparison won 19 awards in total. Netflix also more than doubled its total wins from last year when it won 21 statuettes.

Netflix came into the Primetime Emmys with 34 wins from the Creative Arts Emmys. The streamer then picked up a further 10 awards including wins for Gillian Anderson Olivia Colman and Josh O’Connor for their roles in “The Crown” and for Ewan McGregor for best actor in a limited series for his starring role in “Halston.” “The Crown” also won for best drama series as well as best directing and writing for a drama series. The drama about the British Royal Family won 11 Emmys in total tying Netflix’s “The Queen’s Gambit” for the most wins for an individual program for the year. The chess drama starring Anya Taylor-Joy won the coveted best limited series award to close out the telecast.

Netflix has been vying for the biggest Emmy haul since it broke into the awards race years ago. It has been runner up to HBO a number of times and came closest to beating the premium cabler when the two tied with 23 wins each in 2018.

Read the full winners list here.

Perennial favorite HBO was no slouch however. The premium cabler along with its streaming partner HBO Max started out the night with 10 awards from the Creative Arts Emmys. “Hacks” and “Mare of Easttown” both picked up multiple wins including best actress in a comedy series for “Hacks” star Jean Smart and best actress in a limited series for Kate Winslet in “Mare of Easttown.” Elsewhere Michaela Cole won the award for best writing for a limited series for “I May Destroy You.”

Disney Plus picked up only one win at the Primetime Emmys with “Hamilton” winning for best pre-recorded variety special. The streamer did win more total awards than it did last year however. Disney Plus won 14 awards total in 2021 up from eight in 2020. Apple TV Plus likewise saw its fortunes improve year over year winning 10 total Emmys thanks in large part to comedy “Ted Lasso.” The show not only won best comedy series but also nabbed wins in three comedy acting categories — best actor (Jason Sudeikis) best supporting actress (Hannah Waddingham) and best supporting actor (Brett Goldstein). Apple TV Plus had just one win in 2020.

Fellow streamers Amazon and Hulu did not fare as well with both getting shut out this year. Amazon had won four Emmys last year while Hulu had one win in 2020.

HBO and HBO Max led all nominees this year with a combined 130 nominations followed closely by Netflix with 129. Disney Plus was third with 71 nominations in total.

“The Crown” and “The Mandalorian” tied for the most nominations for a program this year with 24 each. “WandaVision” was next with 23 followed by “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Saturday Night Live” with 21 “Ted Lasso” with 20 “Lovecraft Country and “The Queen’s Gambit” with 18 and “Mare of Easttown” with 16.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdHlwaWNhbC1uZXRmbGl4LXVzZXItc3Vic2NyaWJlci1kZW1vZ3JhcGhpYy1taWxsZW5uaWFsLWFnZS1wb2xpdGljYWwtdmlld3MtaW5jb21lLTIwMjEtOdIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdHlwaWNhbC1uZXRmbGl4LXVzZXItc3Vic2NyaWJlci1kZW1vZ3JhcGhpYy1taWxsZW5uaWFsLWFnZS1wb2xpdGljYWwtdmlld3MtaW5jb21lLTIwMjEtOT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the Typical Netflix user: Age political views income,"Daniel Reinhardt/picture alliance via Getty Images



Netflix has 74 million subscribers in the US and Canada.

Its typical user is a woman who lives in the US suburbs and has some or no college education.

The average user is also more likely to identify as liberal or a moderate not republican.

Netflix is arguably the most ubiquitous streaming service with 74 million subscribers in North America.

It appeals to viewers of all walks of life but data from analytics firm Morning Consult shows there's a typical subscriber to the world's most popular streaming platform.

Netflix's average user is a millennial who earns less than $50000 a year according to US data prepared for Insider from the firm's global research platform Morning Consult Brand Intelligence. Over half a million Americans responded to the survey between June and September.

The average Netflix user is more likely to be female but only barely. And 68% of Netflix subscribers have some or no college education – about 33% have at least a bachelor's degree.

They also tend to live in the suburbs and politically identify as either a Liberal or a Moderate – just 34% of Netflix users that answered the survey said they were conservatives. Morning Consult also surveyed Americans who don't use Netflix and found that they are more likely to be republicans rather than liberals or moderates.

Morning Consult compared the data to that of the average US citizen per Census data and came to an interesting conclusion.

""The profile of a Netflix user actually looks very similar to the profile of the everyday American"" Joanna Piacenza who leads industry intelligence at Morning Consult told Insider.

For example the data shows that 68% of Netflix users don't have a bachelor's degree compared to the 69% of US adults that also don't according to Census data. And 15% of Americans have an income exceeding $100000 – 17% of Netflix users are in the same economic position.

Netflix has focused on diversifying its content offering to appeal to children teens and adults with genres ranging from action and horror to family-friendly.

The streaming platform's big draws include ""Bridgerton"" and ""The Witcher"" shows that people can watch only on Netflix. But the company's competitors like HBO Max and Disney+ have taken a similar approach which has attracted new viewers and helped the newer streamers catch up to Netflix in the market.

Netflix is no longer the only fish in the sea.

Officially you can only change your region on Netflix if you move but you can work around this by using a VPN.

The content available on Netflix differs by region so for example what is offered on Netflix U.S. varies from what is offered on Netflix UK.

Using a VPN will trick Netflix into thinking you're in a different country and you'll be able to access the content of that country. A VPN is a virtual private network that routes your internet activity through the VPN's own servers so your IP address will be the country of your choice.

How to change Netflix region:

1. Make sure you have an active Netflix account

2. Decide whether you want to pay for a VPN or use a free Netflix VPN

Both get the job done but paid VPNs tend to be faster and are available in more locations. Free VPNs often don't ask you to sign up for them so they can help you maintain anonymity but they also may sell your data and be bundled with spyware. If you're lost on what VPN to choose check out Mashable's roundup of the best VPNs.

3. Subscribe to a VPN service and download it to your Mac or PC

4. You can also do this on your phone/tablet.

5. Open your VPN and pick your territory

We'll show you how to do this using PIA as an example.

On iOS it is pretty self explanatory. Open up the VPN and either select ""VPN Server"" and choose from the VPN servers offered or select from the ""Quick Connect"" options.

A green dot appears next to the lock icon when you're connected to the VPN.

6. Open Netflix and choose what to watch from the new selection

Enjoy exploring the world's Netflix content.

Often Netflix will attempt to block VPNs by banning their IP address so you may run into some difficulty. PIA for example has specific servers labeled ""Streaming"" so you may want to try those out first.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGF1bHRhc3NpLzIwMjEvMDkvMTkvc2V4LWVkdWNhdGlvbi1zZWFzb24tMy10b3BzLW5ldGZsaXgtc28td2lsbC1zZWFzb24tNC1iZS1ncmVlbmxpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Sex Education' Season 3 Tops Netflix So Will Season 4 Be Greenlit?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/09/19/sex-education-season-3-tops-netflix-so-will-season-4-be-greenlit/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGF1bHRhc3NpLzIwMjEvMDkvMTkvc2V4LWVkdWNhdGlvbi1zZWFzb24tMy10b3BzLW5ldGZsaXgtc28td2lsbC1zZWFzb24tNC1iZS1ncmVlbmxpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZXNzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3ZpZXcvbm9uYS1nYXByaW5kYXNodmlsaS1zdWVzLW5ldGZsaXgtdGhlLXF1ZWVucy1nYW1iaXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nona Gaprindashvili Sues Netflix For Alleged Defamation In 'The Queen's Gambit',"Nona Gaprindashvili Sues Netflix For Alleged Defamation In 'The Queen's Gambit'

GM Nona Gaprindashvili has filed a lawsuit against Netflix for ""false light invasion of privacy"" and defamation after a line in the hit series The Queen's Gambit erroneously suggested that she was playing only against women.

The fifth women's world chess champion seeks over five million dollars in damages for what the suit claims is a ""devastating falsehood undermining and degrading her accomplishments before an audience of many millions.""

The lawsuit is about a line in the last episode of the highly successful series that won two Golden Globes earlier this year and that is expected to win several prizes at the 2021 Emmy Awards on Sunday.

While the main protagonist is playing a tournament in Moscow a commentator says: ""The only unusual thing about her really is her sex and even that’s not unique in Russia. There's Nona Gaprindashvili but she’s the female world champion and has never faced men.""

This however is far from the truth and even somewhat ironic. The now 80-year-old Gaprindashvili who still plays in senior tournaments is in fact the first female player ever to gain the ""general"" grandmaster title which she achieved in 1978. In addition to holding the women's world champion title for 16 years (1962-1978) the Georgian chess legend often played in open tournaments as well and faced many men including three world champions: GMs Mikhail Tal Boris Spassky and Viswanathan Anand.

In its coverage of the lawsuit The New York Times mentions that a headline of one of their articles from 1968 reads ""Chess: Miss Gaprindashvili Beats 7 Men in a Strong Tourney.""

The newspaper quotes Gaprindashvili speaking in Georgian in a recent video interview arranged by her lawyers that was translated to English by her grandson: “They were trying to do this fictional character who was blazing the trail for other women when in reality I had already blazed the trail and inspired generations.... It was an insulting experience. This is my entire life that has been crossed out as though it is not important.""

Interestingly the 1983 novel The Queen's Gambit by Walter Tevis on which the series was largely based does not state that Gaprindashvili had never faced men. In fact the book reads: ""There was Nona Gaprindashvili not up to the level of this tournament but a player who had met all these Russian Grandmasters many times before.""

The lawsuit's 25-page complaint available online here claims that Beth Harmon's character ""plainly draws on"" Gaprindashvili's achievements: ""Harmon is in many respects an Americanized and fictionalized version of the real-life female Georgian prodigy who was the first to break gender barriers in international chess in the 1960s by competing with and defeating top male players.""

The Queen's Gambit was watched by over 62 million households in just the first month after its release. Partly because of this big success the suit claims that the line she had ""never faced men"" causes professional harm to Gaprindashvili:

""The false statements have caused Gaprindashvili personal humiliation distress and anguish as well as damages to her profits and earnings and her ongoing capacity to engage in her professional livelihood in the world of chess. She has thus suffered 'special damages' in the form of pecuniary losses and lost business opportunities of no less than $75000 and general and damages [sic] of no less than $5000000 all to be to be [sic] established at trial.

The producer of the series has provided the following statement: ""Netflix has only the utmost respect for Ms. Gaprindashvili and her illustrious career but we believe this claim has no merit and will vigorously defend the case."""

He has signed a global commentary deal with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. A nightly talkshow will be central to the plans of a new venture talkTV which is to be launched “early next year”. Morgan’s show will also air on Fox Nation a streaming spinoff from Fox News in the US and Sky News in Australia making him a daily presence on three continents. He can also be enjoyed – or avoided – in print where a twice-weekly column will appear in the Sun and the New York Post and in a book deal with Murdoch’s HarperCollins publishers.

Morgan who stagily stormed off the set of Good Morning Britain in March will seemingly no longer be “silenced” by “cancel culture”. He will instead be given global amplification as part of a new battle for the small but economically significant audiences for right-leaning news. The media village gossip is part of a much larger pattern of change affecting all mainstream newsrooms and challenging how broadcasters think about bias opinion news and their own presenters. It is also part of a testing of the generational tensions within journalism where the hunger for diversity and broader representation is creating economic opportunities for those mining the often older whiter righter and richer demographic.

The talkTV venture is clearly a personal project of Rupert Murdoch who turned 90 this year and it reassembles his dream team of the News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks and Morgan – both once rising stars on the pages of Murdoch tabloids. The project is tinged with the sense of a last hurrah: Fleetwood Hack going on the road or indeed an old firm of bank robbers getting together for one last job.

The project does feel strangely old-fashioned in a world where the subscription newsletter service Substack backed by venture-capital millions has been siphoning commentators with large followings. Stories of how a successful Substackers can pull in $1m a year have unsettled columnists and the emerging world of even higher rewards for talking heads on streaming platforms such as YouTube creates as much intrigue as incredulity.

The question for talkTV is therefore whether a mainstream media dinosaur gatekeeper such as News UK can compete with the multiplatform rightwing bloviators with low production costs who are steadily gnawing away at core audiences. As Fox News in the US has demonstrated combining the leverage of legacy with the costs and reach of technology platforms has proved highly successful for companies who are unconcerned with reflecting a diversity of opinion or have a famously tenuous relationship with the truth.

It is also significant that News UK not so long ago ruled out producing a fully fledged TV channel suggesting it was “not commercially viable”. The arrangements and formats of talkTV have yet to be finalised – it will be reportedly be available to be streamed on smart TVs and as a traditional channel. In News Corp’s global results announcement in August its chief executive Robert Thomson attributed a very upbeat picture for the media divisions to global content deals signed with Facebook and Google: “These deals which are confidential will add revenue annually into nine figures and are a profoundly positive sign of the ongoing transformation of the news landscape.”

The unveiling of the Morgan/Murdoch vehicle follows a series of disasters at GB News the rightwing news channel launched in June that has been beset by technical and editorial issues. Their own star defection from mainstream media Andrew Neil left after an amateurish launch made the station a laughing stock. It has been reported that Neil was locked in a legal battle with the channel as he tried to extricate himself from the mess. It is tempting to speculate that Neil was aware of the shadow moves by Murdoch and his key executive Brooks to recruit Morgan and launch a rival to GB News though whether this played any part in his desire to leave is uncertain. Just as the Conservative party under Boris Johnson moved rightwards to squeeze out Brexiteer threats so Nigel Farage and his beer garden of followers on GB News may find themselves outflanked by the more professional talkTV.

Mainstream news broadcasting which is constrained in the UK by Ofcom from having an explicitly political lens to its coverage lurches along in a sea of social media interest optimised for emotion and outrage. The hard expensive work of reporting the news has always suffered in relation to the cheaper business of discussing the news. Facebook one of the most successful advertising companies in history has suffered a series of recent embarrassments on the public relations front (uncovered by Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal) with its content moderation reportedly goes easy on individuals with large followings. Despite outrage at its real-world political effects Facebook’s lightly moderated publishing strategy remains fundamentally unaltered – because it is wildly wildly profitable.

In this sense the arrival of talkTV says as much about Murdoch’s keenly opportunistic business instincts as it does about ideology and culture wars – or indeed his own desire to have something else to watch amid pandemic TV bingeing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA5LTE5L2JyaXRhaW4tZG9lc24tdC1oYXZlLXRvLXdvcnJ5LWFib3V0LWdiLW5ld3MtYW5kLWFudGktd29rZS10dtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Britain Doesn't Have to Worry About Anti-Woke TV,"Why did this happen?

From the air it resembles one of the many HS2 construction sites dotted across southern England.

But this huge compound on the fringe of the Cotswolds is the site of what is set to become one of the most expensive properties in the country.

And like many grand designs it also seems to come with a spiralling budget.

The sprawling development will become home to media mogul Rupert Murdoch's second daughter Elisabeth and her husband Keith Tyson at a cost believed to be in the tens of millions.

The proposed plans show it will become the perfect place to entertain guests.

It will have an indoor zinc-clad swimming pool spa tennis court three terraces two dining rooms a double-height entrance hall and nine bedrooms – each with their own bathroom.

A vast basement dubbed a 'bunker' by one local will house a cinema gallery and plant room while the house will have enough parking for 15 cars. There will also be a studio for Mr Tyson – the Turner Prize-winning artist – in a wooded area and formal fruit flower and vegetable gardens.

The site is already screened by mature trees on all boundaries.

Miss Murdoch 53 made £151million a decade ago when she sold her TV production company Shine – which makes hit shows including the BBC's MasterChef – to her father's company News Corp.

Now worth around £1.2billion after the sale of her father's 21st Century Fox to Disney Miss Murdoch is known for throwing extravagant New Year's Eve gatherings.

One local said: 'This [construction] has obviously altered feelings in the village but people with money like to spend it.

'We have lived with them digging out this basement the towering cranes and the lorries. We just have to get on with it. Elisabeth Murdoch can be quite distant but from time to time she will ask if there's anything she can do for the village. We could have worse neighbours.'

The resident added: 'The last I heard the estimated construction cost was heading towards £100million but that was some time ago now. As far as I'm aware Elisabeth has bought two other properties in the vicinity too.' Miss Murdoch and Mr Tyson 52 are thought to be staying at one of those properties as the work is done.

One local said: 'This [construction] has obviously altered feelings in the village but people with money like to spend it'

Another man who regularly passes the site for which the land alone is worth an estimated £10million said: 'The builders wouldn't talk about who owned it but they did say they were digging eight metres down for a basement.

'It's a staggering build – the place will be like something out of Dallas when it's finished.'

It is understood construction staff have signed a contract agreeing not to talk publicly about the development or who owns the site which will retain a existing gatehouse as staff accommodation.

When the Mail visited last week security guards were manning access points to the compound with staff quick to approach anybody who pulled up outside.

Miss Murdoch married Mr Tyson her third husband in Oxfordshire in 2017. Planning consent for the new home was granted in January 2019 with plans for a basement approved three months later.

Elisabeth Murdoch hugs her father Rupert as they watch the racing at Cheltenham Horse Racing Festival on March 18 2010

Last year an application to enlarge the basement was granted with a revised plan for the main house being given the green light this January.

Planning applications concerning an associated estate yard ground source heat pumps gardens and landscape design remain under consideration.

Britain's biggest home is thought to be owned by Phones4U billionaire John Caudwell a mega mansion in Mayfair worth £250million.

So there’s only one thing to do.

When Tanya admits she’s planning to jettison the bulk of her plantar box/steering wheel/intercom combo Georgia is outraged.

“That’s why we did boring shelves. That was never going win us the challenge but it’s going to look good in our room” she points out.

And it’s a fair point.

But Tanya has a fair one too.

Shelley Craft watched on by Scott Cam is the one who told her and Vito to break their piece apart to make it less offensive.

“That was her suggestion” Tanya says. Ronnie and Georgia are sceptical and even Mark and Mitch who were also advised to demolish their steering wheel/lantern/plywood display board agree they should probably leave it as is in the the interest of fairness.

Tanya flounces off saying “Gucci gang out” for which she should be permanently disqualified alone leaving Georgia stewing.

But like most Block cheating scandals other than the one of a fortnight ago this one fizzles into nothing possibly because Ronnie and Georgia win anyway.

Shaynna Blaze says their $24680 bedroom is “my favourite room on The Block so far” with its soaring ceiling pin striped wallpaper sky lights and mix and match colour scheme.

They also love the widened and lengthened redone walk-in robe which cost them the win in master bedroom week.

Shaynna gives them a perfect 10 and the other judges 9.5 each giving them a final score of 29 out of 30.

Unlucky second place getters are Kirsty and Jesse who badly needed to win to complete their mammoth house.

Their $19855 girl’s bedroom has double doors out to a patio a padded bench seat under bench storage and a floral wallpaper feature wall. And the judges also love their redone master bedroom with a change in paint bedside tables and bedding.

‘Old-fashioned public toilet’ — Block room slammed

Darren tips them as possible overall Block winners if they can just manage to finish their gigantic home adding “but I’d be vomiting with anxiety if I was them”.

Mark and Mitch’s charming $22461 gender neutral jungle themed kid’s room features bunk beds plus a trundle jungle wallpaper a beautifully styled wardrobe and the clever ability to switch it easily to an adult’s room.

Even their intact design piece gets the thumbs up.

The judges also like the fact their redone first bedroom now has more room thanks to the bed being downsized to a double a new pendant and a colour scheme with more pizazz.

Tanya and Vito thought this week was their best chance to finally score a win but while Neale Whitaker loves their $15220 kid’s room with custom built-in bunks featuring a king single on top and double below and terrazzo wallpaper Shaynna is less enamoured.

“I don’t love it like you” she says. “It feels cold there’s so many sharp edges and hard surfaces.”

The judges also note the fact the bunks are built in — which would mean a complete renovation to convert it to an adult’s room.

But judges all like the retiled bathroom with those baby-poo brown tiles gone replaced with white tempered square versions.

This week it’s Josh and Luke who really cop a pasting to the point it’s impossible not to feel sorry for them.

Other than the small matter of the cheating scandal for which they apologised more genuinely than Tanya and Vito they seem like decent fellows and it’s hard to watch them being ground down week after week.

Their $17248 bedroom has a strip lit wardrobe that Shaynna likens to a giant bar fridge and a Laminex wall panel that they’ve offset which none of the judges love. Neale can’t put his finger on why but he hates it.

“I do not know which house this bedroom belongs in. It doesn’t have any reference point to any other bedroom in this house” he says.

“They’re not delivering to the level this house has to be delivered.”

And the judges equally hate their redone bathroom. The boys have added a timber screen to section off the toilet and put a wooden bath mat on the floor but other than the merciful removal of the bath cheese it’s not much different.

“They are sticking a finger up at the judges” Neale claims.

And on that at least the twins agree.

“It was a bit of an up yours” Josh says.

He has signed a global commentary deal with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. A nightly talkshow will be central to the plans of a new venture talkTV which is to be launched “early next year”. Morgan’s show will also air on Fox Nation a streaming spinoff from Fox News in the US and Sky News in Australia making him a daily presence on three continents. He can also be enjoyed – or avoided – in print where a twice-weekly column will appear in the Sun and the New York Post and in a book deal with Murdoch’s HarperCollins publishers.

Morgan who stagily stormed off the set of Good Morning Britain in March will seemingly no longer be “silenced” by “cancel culture”. He will instead be given global amplification as part of a new battle for the small but economically significant audiences for right-leaning news. The media village gossip is part of a much larger pattern of change affecting all mainstream newsrooms and challenging how broadcasters think about bias opinion news and their own presenters. It is also part of a testing of the generational tensions within journalism where the hunger for diversity and broader representation is creating economic opportunities for those mining the often older whiter righter and richer demographic.

The talkTV venture is clearly a personal project of Rupert Murdoch who turned 90 this year and it reassembles his dream team of the News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks and Morgan – both once rising stars on the pages of Murdoch tabloids. The project is tinged with the sense of a last hurrah: Fleetwood Hack going on the road or indeed an old firm of bank robbers getting together for one last job.

The project does feel strangely old-fashioned in a world where the subscription newsletter service Substack backed by venture-capital millions has been siphoning commentators with large followings. Stories of how a successful Substackers can pull in $1m a year have unsettled columnists and the emerging world of even higher rewards for talking heads on streaming platforms such as YouTube creates as much intrigue as incredulity.

The question for talkTV is therefore whether a mainstream media dinosaur gatekeeper such as News UK can compete with the multiplatform rightwing bloviators with low production costs who are steadily gnawing away at core audiences. As Fox News in the US has demonstrated combining the leverage of legacy with the costs and reach of technology platforms has proved highly successful for companies who are unconcerned with reflecting a diversity of opinion or have a famously tenuous relationship with the truth.

It is also significant that News UK not so long ago ruled out producing a fully fledged TV channel suggesting it was “not commercially viable”. The arrangements and formats of talkTV have yet to be finalised – it will be reportedly be available to be streamed on smart TVs and as a traditional channel. In News Corp’s global results announcement in August its chief executive Robert Thomson attributed a very upbeat picture for the media divisions to global content deals signed with Facebook and Google: “These deals which are confidential will add revenue annually into nine figures and are a profoundly positive sign of the ongoing transformation of the news landscape.”

The unveiling of the Morgan/Murdoch vehicle follows a series of disasters at GB News the rightwing news channel launched in June that has been beset by technical and editorial issues. Their own star defection from mainstream media Andrew Neil left after an amateurish launch made the station a laughing stock. It has been reported that Neil was locked in a legal battle with the channel as he tried to extricate himself from the mess. It is tempting to speculate that Neil was aware of the shadow moves by Murdoch and his key executive Brooks to recruit Morgan and launch a rival to GB News though whether this played any part in his desire to leave is uncertain. Just as the Conservative party under Boris Johnson moved rightwards to squeeze out Brexiteer threats so Nigel Farage and his beer garden of followers on GB News may find themselves outflanked by the more professional talkTV.

Mainstream news broadcasting which is constrained in the UK by Ofcom from having an explicitly political lens to its coverage lurches along in a sea of social media interest optimised for emotion and outrage. The hard expensive work of reporting the news has always suffered in relation to the cheaper business of discussing the news. Facebook one of the most successful advertising companies in history has suffered a series of recent embarrassments on the public relations front (uncovered by Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal) with its content moderation reportedly goes easy on individuals with large followings. Despite outrage at its real-world political effects Facebook’s lightly moderated publishing strategy remains fundamentally unaltered – because it is wildly wildly profitable.

In this sense the arrival of talkTV says as much about Murdoch’s keenly opportunistic business instincts as it does about ideology and culture wars – or indeed his own desire to have something else to watch amid pandemic TV bingeing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA5LTE5L2JyaXRhaW4tZG9lc24tdC1oYXZlLXRvLXdvcnJ5LWFib3V0LWdiLW5ld3MtYW5kLWFudGktd29rZS10dtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Britain Doesn't Have to Worry About Anti-Woke TV,"Why did this happen?

From the air it resembles one of the many HS2 construction sites dotted across southern England.

But this huge compound on the fringe of the Cotswolds is the site of what is set to become one of the most expensive properties in the country.

And like many grand designs it also seems to come with a spiralling budget.

The sprawling development will become home to media mogul Rupert Murdoch's second daughter Elisabeth and her husband Keith Tyson at a cost believed to be in the tens of millions.

The proposed plans show it will become the perfect place to entertain guests.

It will have an indoor zinc-clad swimming pool spa tennis court three terraces two dining rooms a double-height entrance hall and nine bedrooms – each with their own bathroom.

A vast basement dubbed a 'bunker' by one local will house a cinema gallery and plant room while the house will have enough parking for 15 cars. There will also be a studio for Mr Tyson – the Turner Prize-winning artist – in a wooded area and formal fruit flower and vegetable gardens.

The site is already screened by mature trees on all boundaries.

Miss Murdoch 53 made £151million a decade ago when she sold her TV production company Shine – which makes hit shows including the BBC's MasterChef – to her father's company News Corp.

Now worth around £1.2billion after the sale of her father's 21st Century Fox to Disney Miss Murdoch is known for throwing extravagant New Year's Eve gatherings.

One local said: 'This [construction] has obviously altered feelings in the village but people with money like to spend it.

'We have lived with them digging out this basement the towering cranes and the lorries. We just have to get on with it. Elisabeth Murdoch can be quite distant but from time to time she will ask if there's anything she can do for the village. We could have worse neighbours.'

The resident added: 'The last I heard the estimated construction cost was heading towards £100million but that was some time ago now. As far as I'm aware Elisabeth has bought two other properties in the vicinity too.' Miss Murdoch and Mr Tyson 52 are thought to be staying at one of those properties as the work is done.

One local said: 'This [construction] has obviously altered feelings in the village but people with money like to spend it'

Another man who regularly passes the site for which the land alone is worth an estimated £10million said: 'The builders wouldn't talk about who owned it but they did say they were digging eight metres down for a basement.

'It's a staggering build – the place will be like something out of Dallas when it's finished.'

It is understood construction staff have signed a contract agreeing not to talk publicly about the development or who owns the site which will retain a existing gatehouse as staff accommodation.

When the Mail visited last week security guards were manning access points to the compound with staff quick to approach anybody who pulled up outside.

Miss Murdoch married Mr Tyson her third husband in Oxfordshire in 2017. Planning consent for the new home was granted in January 2019 with plans for a basement approved three months later.

Elisabeth Murdoch hugs her father Rupert as they watch the racing at Cheltenham Horse Racing Festival on March 18 2010

Last year an application to enlarge the basement was granted with a revised plan for the main house being given the green light this January.

Planning applications concerning an associated estate yard ground source heat pumps gardens and landscape design remain under consideration.

Britain's biggest home is thought to be owned by Phones4U billionaire John Caudwell a mega mansion in Mayfair worth £250million.

A spokesman for Miss Murdoch declined to comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvdGhlLWJsb2NrLTIwMjEtZXBpc29kZS0yNS1iZWRyb29tLXJldmVhbC10d2lucy1hcmUtc3RpY2tpbmctdGhlaXItZmluZ2VyLXVwLWF0LXRoZS1qdWRnZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Block 2021 episode 25 bedroom reveal: Twins are 'sticking their finger up at the judges' - realestate.com.au,"Is there anyone more competitive than Ronnie and Georgia?

Georgia has wind of the fact some teams are going to substantially change their dreadful challenge pieces to ensure they aren’t marked down for having an eyesore in their rooms.

“Strategically we pared ours right back to suit the space. I don’t think you should be able to completely change what you’ve created” she says.

What made Vito storm off The Block

So there’s only one thing to do.

“God love her she’s going to call a meeting” Mitch says.

When Tanya admits she’s planning to jettison the bulk of her plantar box/steering wheel/intercom combo Georgia is outraged.

“That’s why we did boring shelves. That was never going win us the challenge but it’s going to look good in our room” she points out.

And it’s a fair point.

But Tanya has a fair one too.

Shelley Craft watched on by Scott Cam is the one who told her and Vito to break their piece apart to make it less offensive.

“That was her suggestion” Tanya says. Ronnie and Georgia are sceptical and even Mark and Mitch who were also advised to demolish their steering wheel/lantern/plywood display board agree they should probably leave it as is in the the interest of fairness.

Tanya flounces off saying “Gucci gang out” for which she should be permanently disqualified alone leaving Georgia stewing.

But like most Block cheating scandals other than the one of a fortnight ago this one fizzles into nothing possibly because Ronnie and Georgia win anyway.

Shaynna Blaze says their $24680 bedroom is “my favourite room on The Block so far” with its soaring ceiling pin striped wallpaper sky lights and mix and match colour scheme.

They also love the widened and lengthened redone walk-in robe which cost them the win in master bedroom week.

Shaynna gives them a perfect 10 and the other judges 9.5 each giving them a final score of 29 out of 30.

Unlucky second place getters are Kirsty and Jesse who badly needed to win to complete their mammoth house.

Their $19855 girl’s bedroom has double doors out to a patio a padded bench seat under bench storage and a floral wallpaper feature wall. And the judges also love their redone master bedroom with a change in paint bedside tables and bedding.

Stocks with game-changing growth potential can grow exponentially in a matter of years but among the many companies aggressively pursuing growth today only a handful seem capable of making it through the stock gyrations and hitting the coveted $1 trillion market capitalization by 2035. After all only five companies have made it to the $1 trillion club so far so unless a company is already growing like a weed and has convincing catalysts ahead to sustain that momentum it's hard to make it that far.

To be able to get your hands on a potential trillion-dollar company early in the game is a dizzyingly tempting idea though so I dug deep into the hundreds of stocks with a market capitalization of more than $100 million to see which ones could go that far. I found four stocks that have a really good chance of making it. Read along.

COVID-19 pandemic is a boon for this stock

Many use Visa (V 0.79%) cards but few are aware of the kind of growth the company can enjoy in coming years.

At the recently held Deutsche Bank Technology Conference Visa's CFO Vasant Prabhu highlighted four structural trends triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic that should power up the company's growth:

Acceleration of cash digitization or the use of digital modes of payment instead of cash.

Booming e-commerce particularly cross-border e-commerce as people are buying things online they traditionally bought in stores like groceries and drugs.

Greater adoption of cashless modes of payment by merchants of all sizes as they realize the importance of going online for survival.

Growth in value-added services like data solutions digital security and CyberSource -- an e-commerce card payments management company owned by Visa.

These are all secular trends that Visa knows how to exploit given its dominance in the payments processing space with 3.6 billion cards issued under its name as of the last quarter.

Management has clear-cut plans to grow shareholder wealth: Capture growing consumer payments and value-add markets through acquisitions and new services pay out 20% to 25% of annual earnings per share in dividends and repurchase shares with remaining cash. Visa's attempt to acquire fintech company Plaid may have fallen through on regulatory concerns but it's a fine example of Visa's hunger for growth.

Visa is already a cash-cow machine thanks to a low-capital high-margin core business and it generates operating margins north of 60%. With the pandemic forcing economies to go cashless and online Visa with its market cap of $492 billion should be able to hit $1 trillion long before 2035.

There's more money to be made from this massive trend than you think

I am going to make my boldest $1 trillion contender pick yet: It's a utility with a market cap of $165 billion.

Yes you read that right but I strongly believe NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%) will become the first utility stock in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club by 2035.

NextEra Energy's stock price has risen more than fivefold in 10 years and even more in dividends which have risen every year for more than 25 years. Now if the company could achieve that kind of growth when renewable energy was still in its nascent stage imagine where it could be once countries start working toward their net-zero emission goals. 137 countries have already committed to these goals mostly by 2050.

Statista projects that the global renewable energy market will cross $1 trillion as early as 2027 up from only $613.8 million in 2020. Projections through 2025 from the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2020 report are even more notable:

By 2025 major oil and gas companies' spending on renewables could grow tenfold.

Renewables could account for 95% of the increase in total global power capacity.

Renewables could make up one-third of the world's total electricity led by hydropower solar and wind.

Now consider this: NextEra Energy's subsidiary Energy Resources is already the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and has a backlog of 16.7 gigawatts (GW) which means near-term growth is already built into its portfolio.

To top that NextEra Energy's Florida Power & Light company is a steady cash-flow machine and its affiliate NextEra Energy Partners a steady source of funds. Then there's the opportunity in green hydrogen which alone could be a $12 trillion market by 2050.

There's another reason why NextEra has me excited: Growth via acquisitions. After its failed bid for Duke Energy I'm sure NextEra Energy is on the lookout for the next big merger or acquisition opportunity which could speed up this top renewable energy growth stock's journey to $1 trillion.

This company is beating the best in its game

Customer relationship management (CRM) has emerged as the fastest-growing software market as a rising number of businesses now understand why digitizing customer management is critical to retain and gain customers in an ever-expanding virtual world. These stunning statistics reveal why Salesforce.com's (CRM 0.55%) market cap could easily grow fourfold to $1 trillion well before 2035:

The global CRM market grew by 6% to $69 billion in 2020 according to Gartner.

Salesforce dominated the market with 19.5% share two percentage points higher than the combined market share of SAP  Oracle  Microsoft MSFT 0.59% ) Adobe  according to Statista.

   according to Statista. While SAP's and Oracle's market shares dropped in 2020 Salesforce's market share grew from 18.4% in 2019 to 19.5%.

Salesforce has more than doubled its revenue in the past three years.

Salesforce predicts revenue to cross $50 billion by 2026 from $21.1 billion in fiscal 2021.

Clearly Salesforce has its pulse on the CRM market like none other. Salesforce uses artificial intelligence extensively and its recent acquisition of business messaging platform Slack could be a potential game-changer as Slack competes directly with Microsoft's Teams platform. Slack added a record net new 13000 paid customers and had 169000 total paid customers as of last quarter including biggies like IBM.

As Salesforce is also already profitable its journey toward a $1 trillion market cap should be easier if it can grow sales as projected.

These industries could explode and so could this stock

Sea Limited's (SE -1.64%) market cap has grown at an astounding pace to $189 billion from only about $4.9 billion in October 2017. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results but Sea Limited's market cap growth so far wasn't a fluke: It was backed by exponential growth in revenues and gross profit. And if Sea Limited can continue to make a splash in the two big markets it's targeting nothing can stop its stock from hitting $1 trillion.

Sea Limited's integrated online platform forms the base of its three core businesses:

Entertainment (gaming): Garena.

E-commerce: Shopee.

Digital financials services: SeaMoney.

Here's how each business is faring:

Garena: Quarterly active users (QAUs) and quarterly paying users (QPUs) hit 725.2 million and 92.2 million respectively in second-quarter 2021. QAUs and QPUs were 402.1 million and 35.7 million as of March 30 2020.

Shopee: Gross merchandise value and orders hit $15 billion and $1.4 billion respectively in Q2 2021 from only $6.2 billion and $0.4 billion as of March 30 2020.

SeaMoney: Mobile wallet payment volumes crossed $4.2 billion in Q2 2021 from only $1.1 billion as of March 30 2020.

If anything at all these numbers indicate Sea Limited's growth potential.

Its flagship game Free Fire beat Tencent's (TCEHY -0.15%) PUBG Mobile to become the world's third-most downloaded mobile game in August 2021. Shopee is already the leading e-commerce company in Southeast Asia and Taiwan and is now expanding into Latin America Europe and even India. SeaMoney is growing beyond mobile payments -- it has already won a banking license in Singapore and recently acquired Indonesia's PT Bank.

Remember though Sea Limited's losses are swelling and that's something that may not sit well with some investors. However Sea Limited is a typical growth stock focused on customer and top-line growth and has successfully monetized Garena to reinvest the cash into e-commerce and financial services beyond Southeast Asia. If you believe in the power of these two businesses Sea Limited could be an enormous winner by 2035.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The companies as well as an NHS service are among a string of household names whose ads appear to have helped fund websites that host false and outlandish claims for example that powerful people secretly engineered the pandemic or that vaccines have caused thousands of deaths.

Analysis of nearly 60 sites performed by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and shared with the Observer found that ads were placed through the “opaque” digital advertising market which is forecast to be worth more than $455bn (£387bn) this year.

Digital advertising is delivered through a complex networks of tech companies including Google that match online data about people with available advertising space and then sell access to web users as they browse.

Experts said the design of this digital advertising architecture means that major brands and their customers may have been unwittingly funding Covid-19 misinformation.

Dr Augustine Fou an independent ad fraud researcher and former employee of advertising agency Omnicom said the system of bidding on ads means these sites get mixed in with other more benign ones.

“Because they now have a source of funding they can not only survive but also proliferate” he said. “And that’s why we’re seeing this huge problem. Because of the lack of transparency … the companies and organisations buying the ads could be unaware that their marketing is appearing on – and potentially funding – these sources of misinformation.

Ads for Amazon services were found on more than 30 sites that carried fake news ranging from Covid conspiracy theories involving Bill Gates to claims that mRNA vaccines are “toxic”.

An NHS diabetes website was promoted alongside articles by a well-known anti-vaccine activist and the false claim that you cannot catch a virus.

“We know the ad ecosystem is incredibly opaque” says Raegan MacDonald from Mozilla which makes the Firefox internet browser. “It’s almost like we’re not supposed to look under the hood. Because if you do you find this mess.”

MacDonald warns that the system is being “weaponised” and potentially putting public health at risk. “What I really hope is that this will be a sort of last straw for the brands” she said.

The bureau examined sites that host misinformation and also carry ads using a combination of manual checking by researchers in the US and UK and automated systems that “crawl” sites to record what happens when someone visits them.

The pages were identified with help from the Global Disinformation Index with ad analysis provided by Rocky Moss the co-founder and chief executive of ad quality platform Deepsee.io and Braedon Vickers who has built a search platform called Well-Known.

Many of the companies that arrange digital advertising are little known outside the industry which is dominated by Google. Analysis by Moss using Deepsee’s crawlers – which simulate a person visiting web pages – found ads delivered by Google for almost 30 big brands each appearing on two or more misinformation websites.

The most common were for Amazon Pharmacy the drugstore run by the online retail giant which itself has become a major player in digital advertising. Ads for Amazon Pharmacy which is not available in the UK accounted for more than 1% of 42000 recorded by the “crawlers” and were found on more than 30 of the misinformation sites.

Google didn’t address the presence of ads it delivered on sites identified by the bureau but said it took appropriate action against breaches of policies on misinformation including cutting off publishers’ ability to make money from specific pages or their entire sites following repeated breaches.

“Protecting consumers and the credible businesses operating on our platforms is a priority for us” a Google spokesperson told the bureau.

After Amazon Pharmacy the next most-featured advertisers were computer manufacturer Lenovo which appeared on 11 sites and US bank Discover. Lenovo said: “Like many companies today Lenovo uses the Google AdSense platform to serve digital adverts to consumers across the internet. With any kind of digital advertising we give clear guidance to our media partners and agencies on what is acceptable for our brand. Lenovo does not approve the placement of ads placed on Covid-19 misinformation websites and does not condone the content it appeared next to and we’ll will work with our media partners to review our existing protection systems.”

Ads for Nike Honda US pharmacy chain Walgreens and eBay were also among those recorded on multiple misinformation-spreading sites. British fashion firms Ted Baker and Asos and the auction house Sotheby’s also appeared on multiple sites.

Xyla Health & Wellbeing which runs the NHS diabetes prevention programme said it had acted to stop its messages appearing on the sites.

The US Department of Veterans Affairs was promoted on two sites one of which wrongly described mRNA vaccines as “the genetic modification injection” and claimed they made people more likely to catch Covid. The other site repeated the false claim that the coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu.

A spokesperson for American Honda said: “We are currently working to determine how our advertising may have appeared on the websites in question. We would never support Covid misinformation or knowingly allow our advertising on such websites. Honda strongly encourages our associates to become fully vaccinated and has conducted free vaccine clinics at our operations to make that possible.”

A spokesperson for Ted Baker said: “The location of these adverts is driven by the Google Display Network. We can confirm that we have worked with Google to resolve this issue and that our adverts will not appear on these specific sites in the future.”

Asos is understood to have added the misinformation sites to its banned list. A spokesperson said: “Like most other brands we regularly review the websites that our ads appear on and have stringent requirements and processes in place to ensure that those websites align with our values and those of our customers.

“The available tools however will not always flag some smaller or newer sites. Where this happens whenever an issue is brought to our attention we take immediate action to ensure our ads are removed as we have done in this case.”

The other companies either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment.

Advertising experts said companies should work harder to monitor where their ads appear and could not simply claim ignorance.

Fou the independent ad fraud researcher said companies buying adverts online should not trust the agencies that buy ad space for them and should instead conduct regular investigations.

“All these middlemen they’re intermediaries ... so any dollar that flows through their platforms they make more money” Fou says. “They don’t have an incentive to cut down […] on the brand safety issues. In fact they have every incentive to let it through.”

He said the scale of the online ad market means that even a tiny fraction of the total spending amounts to “significant money for the bad guys”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJ1cmVhdWludmVzdGlnYXRlcy5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTA5LTE4L2JpZy1icmFuZHMtYWR2ZXJ0aXNpbmctZnVlbGxpbmctY292aWQtbWlzaW5mb3JtYXRpb24td2Vic2l0ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Financing fake news: Nike…,"The most common were for Amazon Pharmacy the drugstore run by the online retail giant which itself has become a major player in digital advertising.

The next most-featured advertisers were PC maker Lenovo which appeared on 11 sites and US bank Discover. Ads for the UK-based auctioneer Sotheby’s Honda US pharmacy chain Walgreens and eBay were also among those recorded on multiple misinformation-spreading sites.

""Protecting consumers and the credible businesses operating on our platforms is a priority for us” a Google spokesperson told the Bureau.

Taking responsibility

The companies that place ads on behalf of brands and other organisations often promote “brand safety” systems and services that should stop them from appearing on sites promoting unsavoury content. Other companies working in the area specialise in add-on services designed to provide an extra layer of protection. The Bureau’s investigation suggests that these systems are not functioning as well as they claim.

Of all the organisations contacted by the Bureau about their ads appearing on misinformation sites only the Department of Veterans Affairs said that it knew which sites its ads appear on.

A spokesperson for Ted Baker said: “The location of the adverts relates to the Google Display Network which means that they are specific to each individual user. We are working with Google to look into this matter.”

Fou the independent ad fraud researcher says the industry has traditionally defended itself by claiming that only a fraction of advertising money can mistakenly go to sources of dangerous content on the web. But the scale of the online ad market means that even a tiny fraction of the total spending amounts to “significant money for the bad guys”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25iYS1uaWtlLWJsYXplci1taWQtNzV0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBA x Nike Blazer Mid Portland Trail Blazers DD8025-101 Release Date - SBD,"Nike will be including the Blazer Mid to take part of celebrating the NBA’s 75th Anniversary also known as the Diamond Anniversary this fall.

While it’s always a fiercely contested event this year’s edition is even more enticing with the inclusion of the greatest villain the sport has ever seen.

Yes in a game where players are considered “colorful” simply for wearing a bright pair of trousers Californian Bryson DeChambeau’s behavior on and off the course has positioned him as the most controversial golf pro in recent memory.

The No. 9 player in the world has ruffled feathers by publicly refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine and getting into skirmishes with fans and on-green cameramen.

“None of us are perfect” Mike Schy DeChambeau’s coach told The Post.

It was announced in July that longtime Bryson caddie Tim Tucker had quit just before DeChambeau was to defend his title at the Rocket Mortgage Classic — reportedly because of verbal abuse from the golfer.

While DeChambeau denied a falling out Tucker told Golf.com: “We’ve had a very intense relationship where he works a lot of hours. It was a little bit of me not being 100 percent healthy and happy.”

In the final round at the BMW Championship in late August DeChambeau even berated his playing partner — and soon-to-be Ryder Cup teammate — Patrick Cantlay for walking when DeChambeau was playing. The pair endured a marathon playoff for the title before Cant­lay finally won leaving a pouty DeChambeau to ignore the media jump in a car and leave the course all before his opponent lifted the trophy.

And then there is DeChambeau’s biggest rival Ryder Cup teammate Brooks Koepka.

What started out as a debate about DeChambeau’s pace of play reached new levels at the PGA Championship at Kiawah Island SC when DeChambeau interrupted a Golf Channel interview with Koepka — leading the latter to call him out for his “bulls–t” in front of the cameras.

After that fans started heckling DeChambeau during play yelling out “Brooksie!” (Koepka then offered to send a beer to anyone who got kicked out for doing so.) It got so bad that when someone did it at the BMW Championship last month Dechambeau snapped roaring: “You know what? Get the f–k out!”

PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan has now decreed that anyone caught shouting “Brooksie” will be expelled from the course.

“Bryson is just different. Here’s this kid who swings the club weirdly . . . and because of the way his brain functions he acts a little differently too” Coach Schy said.

“And then to top it off he wears a stupid flat cap. Combine all those things and you’re a big target.”

Whatever it is DeChambeau rubs other pros the wrong way.

English Ryder Cup star Ian Poulter tweeted that DeChambeau is “not my cup of tea” while Poulter compatriot Eddie Pepperell was less diplomatic labeling him a “single-minded twit.”

PFA Tour pro Brendon Todd meanwhile called the 28-year-old DeChambeau a “nut” in a tweet since deleted.

Former European Ryder Cup player and captain Mark James was more generous telling The Post: “I think Bryson is a massive talent but too many of the things he says and does are an attempt to promulgate a public image.”

Schy meanwhile told The Post the controversy is as much about the mannered golf world as it is about DeChambeau’s eccentricities and temper.

“Golf is a conservative sport and people don’t really embrace change. I literally have parents that come to me and say ‘You’re not going to teach my kid the way you teach Bryson are you?’ ” Schy said. “I mean why? The guy’s a major winner.”

Dubbed “The Scientist” DeChambeau takes an obsessive data-driven approach to golf. Not only are his irons all the same length (unlike every other player’s) but he used to float his golf balls in Epsom salts in an effort to determine their exact center of gravity. When he plays he likes to know the barometric pressure in the atmosphere and even the sap content of the grass being used on the golf course.

“I have to chase down the most scientifically efficient way to get the golf ball in the hole” DeChambeau — who majored in physics in college — has said.

He grew up in California’s Central Valley town of Clovis one of two sons of a sales-rep mom and a dad who was a PGA player-turned-golf-shop manager.

Schy met DeChambeau when the player was just 7 years old and started coaching him five years later. “I hate to say we were perfect for each other” he said. “My coaching environment is much more like a science project that’s really gone terribly wrong for the most part.”

DeChambeau played golf at Southern Methodist University winning the NCAA individual championship in 2015. That same year he joined the PGA Tour as an amateur turning pro in 2016. He began climbing in the standings earning a $1.2 million prize in 2018 when he won the Shriners Open.

During the COVID lockdowns of 2020 DeChambeau reinvented himself putting on 40 pounds — much of it muscle. Now looking like a superhero he’s smashing the ball farther than anyone else: averaging around 323 yards for his drives significantly ahead of the PGA Tour average of 295 yards.

Bryson is just different. And then to top it off he wears a stupid flat cap. DeChambeau’s coach Mike Schy

“Like anything he does he’s a maniac. When you watch him work out he’s in beast mode” said Schy. “When he told me he was going to start bulking up I was all for it as long as it was structured and supervised.

“But Bryson’s main concern was the cost of going to see his trainer. He said ‘It’s $400 an hour and I have to fly [to Colorado] to see him.’ Fast forward three years and he now flies there private.”

Yet DeChambeau is also one of the tour’s slowest players which is the game’s cardinal sin. At the 2019 Northern Trust Open for example he was widely criticized for taking more than two minutes to hit a putt that was no more than eight feet.

DeChambeau — who has been romantically linked to medical student Sophia Bertolami — doesn’t care. In fact he thrives on it.

“Y’all can say whatever you want but we’re having a f–king awesome time” he said in an August 2019 Snapchat rant. “So screw all y’all haters no big deal. I still love you all even though you hate me.”

Schy said very few people ever see the real ­DeChambeau.

“When he’s back home and he’s hanging out with the kids at my facility that’s the real Bryson” he explains. “You can see he gravitates toward the kids that are a little different like the super-smart ones who just seem to speak his language. It’s not Bryson the superstar or major winner then. It’s just Bryson the goofball.”

Anxiety is high ahead of the Ryder Cup as DeChambeau is set to partner with Cantlay — the man who infuriated him over the summer — and be on the team with his chief rival Koepka.

Chief among US team captain Steve Stricker’s concerns is that DeChambeau’s polarizing presence will affect the Americans’ ability to match the team spirit of the Europeans — which has carried the latter to seven victories in the last nine Ryder Cups.

Golf Digest recently reported that Stricker had taken the six players who had qualified for the team — including Koepka and DeChambeau — out for dinner. It was an effort to ease simmering tensions between the two and foster team spirit. “It was a good dinner.

We enjoyed it and it was fun” Koepka later said.

But did he and DeChambeau speak about their spat?

“No” he replied before repeating himself a little ominously. “No.”

Perversely the two are Schy’s dream pairing for the two-on-two matches. “There aren’t many people more patriotic than Bryson but it would take some nerve from Steve Stricker to pair Bryson and Brooks Koepka. Personally though I think it would be awesome” Schy said.

Mike Harris editor of Golf Monthly magazine argues that it’s all good for the game.

“DeChambeau has undoubtedly put himself in the firing line with fans media and other players . . . but it’s my view that the negative reaction is actually out of proportion to ‘the crime’ of being different and having an opinion” Harris said. “Golf badly needs characters who innovate and move the needle.

A terminally ill Co Antrim man is determined to spend what time he has left raising awareness of his debilitating condition.

Tony Devlin a prominent Ballymena businessman was diagnosed with incurable pulmonary fibrosis in 2019.

Life expectancy following a diagnosis is three to five years.

He told the Belfast Telegraph that unlike cancer his illness rarely gets any attention and victims often suffer in silence.

“I initially went to the doctor in 2016 with a very persistent cough” said the 75-year-old.

“Then I had a few tests but it wasn’t until I had a biopsy that it was confirmed.”

He added: “I’d never heard of ‘idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis’ (IPF) until I was told I had it.”

In Northern Ireland there are some 1200 people living with this condition and around 300 people are diagnosed every year.

Due to the debilitating nature of this disease sufferers will eventually require 24hr oxygen in their homes to help support their breathing and other vital organs.

The condition affects mainly people aged between 50 to 70 and predominantly men.

Mr Devlin who has two daughters in their 40s Sharon and Jo said he has received “great support” from his GP and consultant as well as from the pulmonary fibrosis nurse who looks after the support group he now belongs to.

“No one knows what causes it” he said.

“The experts have found out that it runs in some families so they suspect it may be a faulty gene.

“They’re doing some research into it but a big problem is that there’s very little money being spent on that research.”

Mr Devlin said his journey has been made more bearable because of the support from his family neighbours and medical professionals.

“My IPF support group — the only one in Northern Ireland — is invaluable” he said.

“It was co-founded by Tom McMillan whose wife has suffers from the condition.

“Covid has helped it in a way because we’ve started to have Zoom meetings.

“There are currently around 100 members of the group but I’m sure there are more people with the disease out there.”

Although the term IPF is normally not known among the general population it is more common than many cancers including leukaemia and ovarian cancer.

The condition is progressive debilitating and totally life changing. And because there is no cure very difficult to come to terms with.

Mr Devlin told how he suffers from an “awful shortness of breath” as well as low energy levels.

“You just can’t do what you did before” he said.

“If I’m out walking I have to take a portable cylinder of oxygen out with me.

“There’s no travelling any more that’s gone. I haven’t been abroad for years.”

“Mornings aren’t good for me. I have a cough and bring up a lot of mucus so we don’t plan anything for them.”

But the grandfather-of-four — Katie (16) Rachel (14) Hannah (10) and Mikey (9) — who isn’t on any medication said he “just gets on” as best he can. “There are a couple of drugs that will slow the progression of it but they can’t be prescribed until you fall below 80% of your lung capacity” Mr Devlin said.

“And then if you fall below 50% they take it off you.

“It’s like having cancer but they tell you it’s ‘not bad enough’.

“The message is: come back if it gets worse and we’ll do something for you...” Although he knows he can’t be cured Mr Devlin who has never smoked said he doesn’t let it get him down.

“I’ve got my wife Elizabeth and a good family around me along with friends and neighbours” he said.

“I’m determined to hang on as long as I can. When you’re diagnosed they give you three to five years. I said I’ll take the five years.”

He said the “worst part of it” is the cough.

“I’m very conscious of that” he said. When I was going out more before Covid I was very conscious of people looking at me when I was coughing.

“The cough disgusts me so I imagine it puts other people off as well. It really embarrasses me.

“In the past some people even asked me if I used to be a big smoker.”

Mr Devlin who owned several fruit and vegetable shops prior to his retirement said he wanted to speak out as September is Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Month.

“I know there is no hierarchy among illnesses or disease but pulmonary fibrosis seems to be well down the pecking order so it’s to try and inform people better” he said.

“It’s also to advise people to join the group.

“The people in it are very positive.

“We’re not waiting for God.”

Spokesman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) Hakeem Baba-Ahmed has said heaven will not fall if a northerner is elected the next Nigerian President.

Maintaining that northerners are not second-class citizens he said the north will not accept to serve as a second fiddle in 2023 when the region has the population to go to clinch the first position.

He said this while delivering a keynote address at the maiden Maitama Sule Leadership Lecture Series organised by the students wing of Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria at the weekend.

He said “The North is not for sale and northerners will surprise those waiting for them to queue up in 2023 and be given money in exchange for their votes.”

He said anyone who does not want a northerner as President should leave the country if one emerges.

He also charged the students to be proud of who they are challenging them not to accept being treated as second-class citizens in their own country.

“We will lead Nigeria the way we have led Nigeria before whether we are President or Vice President we will lead Nigeria. We have the majority of the votes and the democracy says vote whom you want.

“Why should we accept second class position when we know we can buy form and contest for first class and we will win?

“Why does anybody need to threaten us and intimidate us? We will get that power but be humble because power comes from God. We inherited leadership being honest is not being stupid.

“There are Nigerians who believe that because the economy of the North is being crumbled; we are running away from insecurity we are politically vulnerable they think they can buy us for 2023 but they are making a mistake.

“We are ready for this; we will consider every economic adversity challenge we will fix the Northern economy and we are the only one who can fix this Northern economy. For that reason we are not for sale. We are in the process of rebuilding the North and we will rebuild the North from 2023.”

Baba-Ahmed said whether the north holds power in 2023 or not anybody who wants to break up in this country will say so as they were just looking for excuses.

He also charged the youths to be active in politics.

“Don’t accept second class status because you are a northerner. No northerner is a second-class citizen in this country. If we want to support a southerner we will support a southerner because that will be in our own interest and we can decide for ourselves.”

Also speaking a Commissioner in the Police Service Commission (PSC) Hajia Naja’atu Bala Muhammad urged the youths to stop being intellectually lazy and selling their rights to leadership for peanuts.

Earlier the lecturer at the event Dr. Riyahuddeen Zubair Maitama who spoke on “Ethical Reorientation for Positive Attitudinal Change: An Urgent National Imperative” called for urgent ethical reorientation for positive attitudinal change among Nigerians both the governors and the governed especially the youth on whose shoulder the future of the country rests.",,,,,,

PALMDALE Calif.—Twenty-eight years after introducing Global Hawk to the world executives of Northrop Grumman and its wholly-owned Scaled Composites design and fabrication partner invited a group of aviation writers to its Air Force Plant 42 production center for a preview of some next big things in the world of crewed and uncrewed air warfare.

A global media release from Northrop Grumman headquarters at mid-morning announced that the company successfully demonstrated a data link for connecting aircraft in highly contested airspace for long-range command and control through an open architecture network.

The statement termed the experiment as a critical milestone in the evolution of a distributed multi-domain battle management command and control architecture that maintains decision superiority for the U.S. military and allies.

“Northrop Grumman technologies built on advanced low size weight and power electronics enable integrated and secure communications across domains supporting the Department of Defense’s JADC2 strategy” said Tom Pieronek chief technology officer and vice president research and technology. He said “Northrop Grumman remains committed to delivering capabilities that maintain strategic advantage for the U.S. and its allies across all domains and against all adversaries.”

The flight demonstration is the first integration of a new mission-specific military transceiver multi-level security data switches and open architecture wide-area networking utilizing commercial technology into the observe orient decide and act loop – the decision-making chain for threat engagements.

Terming it a key step toward harnessing the power of a network into critical domains for national security missions the company said the flight demonstration linked the Scaled Composites Proteus a High-Altitude Long-Endurance research aircraft with a Firebird an unmanned air vehicle with the capability to be flown manned through an advanced line-of-sight data link with low probability of intercept/low probability of detection characteristics that includes anti-jam properties.

The aircraft established a link and performed a simulated Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Mission in which battlefield commanders get relevant planning information from decoded communications intercepting plans strategies and resources connected back to a cloud-based 5G network testbed through a novel prototype multi-level security switch.

In short the Northrop Grumman test demonstrated that the technology allows uncrewed aircraft to gather information regarding the enemy by observing their behavior and tracking movements thereby allowing commanders to stay three steps ahead of the enemy while easily and securely sharing mission-critical data across air land sea and space to speed up decision timelines and maintain a strategic advantage in an age of data-driven conflict.

Ultimately however that real-time intelligence-gathering and secure transmission software depends on having the mix of robust and survivable flying hardware to penetrate a full range of environments from benign to fiercely hostile. And therein lies the challenge of having enough of the right kind of aircraft to affordably meet constantly changing mission demands. The logical and now technologically feasible and affordable solution NG executives point out is producing aircraft that have the flexibility to be quickly transformed to meet the necessary mission parameters and the additional capability to be optionally piloted vehicles.

And yes they do have those capabilities in existing airframes that can be converted from crewed to remotely piloted or autonomously operated and back again in hours and minutes or no more than a day or two and by a pair of technicians using simple hand tools. Such planes already exist at Northrop Grumman. As reporters dismounted the vans on the ramp outside a Site 7 hangar they were greeted with a low-level fly-by of an all-composites-built N-401 — piloted in this case. Inside the hangar was a twin sibling with the human element removed extending both its range and payload.

The show-and-tell segment was brought to the world by Northrop Grumman’s friendly and mutually beneficial courtship and acquisition of Mojave Air and Space Port’s legendary Scaled Composites.

In early 2009 Northrop executive Rick Crooks floated the idea of building a pilot-optional airplane to Scaled. Calling it Model 355 Scaled delivered Firebird a composites creation that made its first flight 12 months later and demonstrating its capabilities to collect intelligence from multiple sources in incredibly sneaky fashion just eight months later. Firebird was unveiled in public on May 9 2011.

Thus began a 2007 corporate acquisition that more closely resembled a courtship wedding and a happily so far family life in which Northrop Grumman already a major shareholder acquired Scaled Composites outright but with provisions to protect the strategies facilities and organizational culture that made Scaled Composites a leader in productivity world famous and a magnet for some of the most brilliant aerospace designers and engineers. Founder Burt Rutan remained as senior manager for Scaled until he retired in 2011. Long time senior executive Cory Bird became president of Scaled in April 2019.

Bird says the people at Scaled also celebrate the emotional paycheck that comes when they make impossible things possible.

Northrop Grumman recently announced that the new Next Generation Electronic Warfare (NGEW) system was tested for the first time joined the AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) at Exercise Northern Lightning demonstrating the full interoperability of the two systems in a realistic and contested electromagnetic spectrum environment. The company used one of their flying testbeds a CRJ-700 equipped with NGEW and a SABR radar inside an F-16’s nosecone.

“When an EW system and a radar are able to work together fully as demonstrated with NGEW and SABR pilots can take advantage of capability without compromise” said James Conroy vice president navigation targeting and survivability Northrop Grumman. “With the radio frequency (RF) spectrum becoming increasingly contested this critical set of capabilities will support the F-16 for many years to come.”

According to Northrop Grumman NGEW and SABR demonstrated full pulse-to-pulse multi-function interoperability in a contested operational environment. With SABR successfully engaging multiple air and ground targets NGEW detected and identified a range of advanced threats employing advanced jamming techniques capable of defeating those threats when required.

The company worked alongside the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron the Operational Flight Program Combined Test Force and the F-16 system program office to test the new EW suite which includes a new Digital Radar Warning Receiver state of the art antennas and processors and a digital frequency memory internal jammer. “During Northern Lightning we gained valuable insight on NGEW capabilities and obtained over 170 test points against both air and ground emitters” said Lt. Col. Stephen Graham F-16 electronic warfare test director OFP CTF. “We are one step closer to installing the first NGEW suite on an Eglin F-16 in less than one year.”

Northern Lightning set the right environment to demonstrate NGEW’s compatibility with the Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar while identifying jamming threats across the Radio Frequency spectrum. In fact during the exercise the two systems faced a high-density radio frequency environment generated by the Joint Threat Emitters of the Volk Field Combat Readiness Training Center. These threat emitters allowed Northern Lightning participants to fly missions under conditions representative of near-peer electromagnetic spectrum environments.

NGEW leverages an open-systems ultra-wideband architecture providing the instantaneous bandwidth needed to defeat modern threats. As RF threats continue to proliferate effective electronic warfare systems are urgently needed to keep pilots safe and ensure mission success. “There is a strong push to improve Electronic Protection for the F-16 against modern adversaries” said Lt. Col. Graham. “NL21 allowed for both an RF dense environment while permitting targeted testing before during and after LFE fights.”

The Air Force awarded a contract to Northrop Grumman in late 2020 for the development of NGEW with the goal of equipping as many as 450 F-16s if the testing is successful. An interesting point added by Northrop Grumman is that the EW suite being developed for the Viper (as the F-16 is nicknamed by its crews) is part of a product line of electronic warfare capabilities that can be adapted to protect virtually any platform which shares a common technology baseline with the already known AC/MC-130J Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM).

Another interesting aspect pulse-to-pulse interoperability of NGEW with the F-16’s newly acquired APG-83 radar which has been declared fully operational with the Air National Guard in October 2020. While not better specified this should mean that the two systems are interoperable without generating significant interferences and maybe coupled together the AESA radar and the new EW suite could provide some additional advanced capabilities that would not be available with a mechanical radar.

Exercise Northern Lightning was also the right occasion to introduce the latest F-16 software in a Large Force Exercise “graduating” the F-16 Mission Modular Computer M7.3 which hosts the new software for the jet. The next step will be releasing the software to the Combat Air Forces where the F-16 fleet as a whole will receive an update in its avionics and weapons system with enhanced capabilities to improve air-to-air capabilities and targeting accuracy enabling new combat capabilities.

“The F-16 is rapidly improving its combat capability to stay relevant in a near-peer fight and the dedication of the F-16 test community is evident in accelerating change to the CAF” said Capt Michael Mclain chief of standardization and evaluation at the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron. The F-16 testing also saw the integration of Lockheed Martin’s Legion Pod equipped with Infrared Search and Tracking System technology.

“We were able to achieve what usually takes three to six months of testing in a matter of weeks” said Lt Col. Jeremy Castor F-16 sensors program manager OFP CTF. “This has all to do with the collaboration that took place between the Lockheed Martin team and the operators out in the field who would test the infrared search and track technology during every sortie then retract the data and re-program the pod to better equip the warfighter in our combat scenarios.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGVjaG5ld3MuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8wOS8xOC9ub3J0aHJvcC1ncnVtbWFucy1sZW8tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXRvLXJldm9sdXRpb25pemUtcG9zaXRpb25pbmctbmF2aWdhdGlvbi1hbmQtdGltaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northrop Grumman's LEO satellite to revolutionize positioning navigation and timing,"Northrop Grumman has been awarded a contract under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Blackjack program for Phase 2 development of an advanced software-defined positioning navigation and timing payload with options to build units destined for space flight.

The U.S. Navy test-fired two unarmed Trident II missiles off the coast of Cape Canaveral on Friday dubbing the launches a successful test of the operational readiness of the weapons system.

The missiles were fired from the USS Wyoming an Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine homeported at Kings Bay Ga. as the 134-member crew prepares for deployment.

Although Navy officials said the launch was unrelated to ongoing world events the tests of the missiles come as tensions with the Chinese and the United States' Pacific allies continue to escalate. The tests however are scheduled years in advance the Navy reported.

The missiles first deployed in 1990 and equipped with the capability of delivering multiple nuclear warheads were fired over the Atlantic where they landed in the ocean Navy officials reported.

“The Demonstration and Shakedown Operation test and others like these underscore our readiness and capability for 21st Century Strategic Deterrence” said Rear Adm. Thomas E. Ishee director of global operations for the U.S. Strategic Command in a prepared Navy statement.

“(Submarine) crews undergo constant training and regularly planned testing to ensure the weapons systems remain ready and reliable. The sailors and support element who make up the silent service prove every day they are capable and prepared to protect America and its allies"" Ishee said.

The area off Cape Canaveral along with the Space Coast has seen occasionally seaborne missile launches and other military testing offshore. The Navy did not say just how far out to sea the launches took place Friday.

The Wyoming — which has 24 missile tubes — had also been upgraded with a 27-month-long upgrade and engineered refueling overhaul Navy officials reported.

The Trident II missiles part of what the military describes as the U.S. nuclear deterrent strategy also underwent mechanical reviews to minimize the impact of aging. In February the Navy held four similar launches along the Florida coast to test Trident II’s readiness.

“(Friday’s) test demonstrates the unmatched reliability of our sea-based nuclear deterrent which is made possible by a dedicated team of military civilian and industry partners who bring expertise and dedication to the mission that is truly extraordinary” said Vice Adm. Johnny R. Wolfe director of the Navy’s Strategic Systems Programs in the prepared Navy statement.

Wolfe added that “this same team is now developing the next generation of the Trident Strategic Weapon System which will extend our sea-based strategic deterrent through 2084.”

The Navy is buying 38 MQ-8Cs at a cost of around $20 million apiece.

Here's What You Need to Remember: It’s hard to overstate how exciting Task Force Saber and the MQ-8C testing are for advocates of a new fleet design for U.S. maritime forces.

The U.S. Navy has begun testing its latest drone helicopter with its newest sea-base ship. The trial could lead to the base vessels deploying with mixed fleets of manned and unmanned helicopters.

That’s right. Robot-helicopter carriers.

A Northrop Grumman MQ-8C Fire Scout robo-copter in mid-April 2020 completed “interface testing” on USS Hershel Williams.

Williams which commissioned in March 2020 is the second of three Expeditionary Sea Base ships in the U.S. fleet.

The ESBs are huge floating outposts. 785 feet long and displacing 90000 tons of water they can accommodate hundreds of special operations forces mine-warfare crews drone-operators and other specialists along with these troops’ boats helicopters and drones.

The MQ-8C is an unmanned version of the Bell 407 helicopter. The Navy is buying 38 MQ-8Cs at a cost of around $20 million apiece.

The Navy originally developed the MQ-8 as a robotic strike vehicle for the fleet’s Littoral Combat Ships. LCSs and other smaller warships have deployed with the smaller MQ-8B version of the unmanned copter but the Navy wasn’t entirely pleased.

The LCS in particular proved too small efficiently to support an armed robot. An LCS has just one weapons magazine for all the vessel’s weapons as well as the weapons for its embarked aircraft. The Navy decided it was best to load up the MQ-8C with sensors and data-links and use it as an aerial scout spotting targets for other ships and aircraft to attack.

Indeed the Navy is leaning toward embarking manned helicopters about the ESBs for armed missions.

The Navy in March 2020 combined its sea-base ship USS Lewis B. Puller a destroyer some patrol boats and U.S. Army AH-64E Apache gunship helicopters to form Task Force Saber.

The task force was in the Persian Gulf practicing tactics for destroying enemy boats. The exercise clearly also was a show of force targeting Iran whose large force of gun- and rocket-armed speedboats poses a serious threat to naval and commercial vessels in the Gulf.

“The operations which are designed to enhance the capabilities of U.S. forces to respond to surface threats have involved Puller performing as a landing base platform for the Apaches while Cyclone-class patrol-coastal ships select simulated targets for them to engage. The guided-missile destroyer USS Paul Hamilton also participated in the joint operations” the Navy stated.

Parsing that statement it’s clear that the fleet has devised a new and potentially capable ship-mix that could be a preview of future deployments. Now add MQ-8Cs to the mix. The unmanned copters could help the patrol boats spot targets. The Apaches would swoop in to destroy them.

It’s hard to overstate how exciting Task Force Saber and the MQ-8C testing are for advocates of a new fleet design for U.S. maritime forces.

The Navy and U.S. Marine Corps both recognize the need to deploy their people ships and aircraft in new ways in order to combat both the irregular threat from Iranian forces and the conventional threat from an increasingly well-armed China—all while operating within flat overall budgets.

Need a big piece of art to spice up your living room? We have just the thing. This factory-built 1:1 scale model of a Porsche 919 Hybrid LMP1 race car is coming up for auction in October via RM Sotheby's. It could be your only chance to own such an accurate representation of the car that dominated Le Mans from 2015 to 2017.

Porsche built a total of 13 full-scale 919 replicas for display and promotional purposes according to RM Sotheby's. The bodies are made from fiberglass and sit on a steel frame but still use real Michelin racing slicks to roll around. The 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder hybrid drivetrain from the real 919 is absent from this car meaning you'll have to push it by hand to get it anywhere.

RM says Porsche used original CAD modeling data from the design team to build these models which is why they look so real. This particular example uses a Porsche Intelligent Design livery similar to the one used on the 919 driven to overall victory in 2015 by Earl Bamber Nick Tandy and Nico Hülkenberg.

The 1:1 scale model shown above is set to be auctioned off by RM Sotheby's at its Open Roads event in Miami happening October 6-13 2021. The auction house doesn't list a price range but considering it was built by the factory and only 13 exist we're betting it won't be cheap.

The so-called mini-mill will combine two electric arc furnaces which primarily use steel scrap and are far more energy-efficient than traditional integrated plants that are fed by coal. The company expects to begin construction in the first half of 2022 and start producing in 2024.

The steel giant's board has authorized an exploratory site selection process for the location of the mini-mill according to the statement. Potential locations include Alabama and Arkansas where U.S. Steel has existing EAF operations as well as greenfield sites.

U.S. Steel Corp. Chief Executive Officer David Burritt told The Wall Street Journal that the site hasn't been selected but that Arkansas and Alabama are being considered.

U.S. Steel is the relatively new owner of Big River Steel which in 2013 helped sustain and grow the steel industry in Arkansas and more specifically in Mississippi County when it built a $1.3 billion ""flex mill"" near Osceola that employs more than 500. About 15 months later it announced plans for a $1.2 billion expansion.

""We welcome the opportunity to compete for business expansion projects statewide that will lead to more high-paying jobs for Arkansans"" Chelsea O'Kelley a spokeswoman for the Arkansas Economic Development Commission said Friday. ""However per agency protocol we do not comment on specific projects.""

Clif Chitwood director of the Mississippi County Economic Development Commission said ""Like my friends at the AEDC always say we can neither confirm nor deny. Mississippi County has proven to be a hospitable and profitable place for steel production for two decades and we want to continue doing that.""

About 3000 people in the county are directly employed by steel producers such as Nucor Corp. which began its Mississippi County operations in 1988 and U.S. Steel. At least 1200 more are employed by other steel-related businesses and suppliers.

Chitwood estimated that 40% of the workers directly employed by the mills are residents of Mississippi County. ""Almost 100% of the jobs that supply the mills and jobs with all the steel-affiliated companies and businesses are held by residents here"" Chitwood said.

U.S. Steel's announcement comes as domestic futures prices for steel have more than tripled in the past year. The plan to build a new mill is the latest sign that steelmakers are growing more comfortable that higher prices will persist.

While the production increase has produced a windfall for domestic suppliers it's driving up the cost of everything from automobiles to wind turbines to kitchen appliances as the world recovers from the pandemic.

The company also estimated that it would report record earnings for the third quarter on the back of the strong prices which will allow it to reduce debt.

The benefits of higher prices are being felt across the industry. Earlier Thursday Nucor Inc. the largest U.S. steelmaker said it expects record earnings through the end of the year and Steel Dynamics Inc. on Wednesday forecast fourth-quarter earnings to be stronger than its previous guidance.

U.S. Steel characterized the planned mill expected to produce 3 million tons of flat-rolled steel products as part of the efforts to achieve its 2030 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 20% according to the statement.

But this recent discovery is painting the 3060 a bit differently which could mean major implications involving Team Green.

According to WCCFTech a host of NVIDIA RTX 3060 cards have been spotted sporting a different GPU die: GA104 instead of the original GA106 Ampere chips.

This discovery was made by a man named Matthew Smith who works as the GPU database editor for the computer hardware site TechPowerUp.

The GA104 is a higher-tier chip than the original GA106 of the first-edition RTX 3060s. It's actually the die that's found in the RTX 3060 Ti and the RTX 3070 according to TechPowerUp.

However this doesn't mean that any 3060 with the GA104 is faster than any base 3060 equipped with the GA106 chip.

Even if the chip in these ""new"" RTX 3060s is technically of a higher tier it will still sport the same specs as base cards: 3584 CUDA cores 12 GB of GDDR6 VRAM and a 192-bit bus.

What this could mean is that NVIDIA has an extra supply of GA104 dies.

These chips might be a bit defective--too defective to be put in a 3070 or 3060 Ti for instance.

Buying these GA104-equipped NVIDIA RTX 3060s won't net you 3060 Ti or 3070 performance but they could theoretically be more stable than the lower-end GA106.

For instance overclocks and boost clocks might be maintained better due to the unconstrained nature of the higher-tier chip.

Various reports are saying that NVIDIA is repurposing these chips because allegedly the supply of GA106 dies have become a bit constrained lately. This is still likely a direct effect of the worldwide GPU shortage but repurposing defective chips is actually quite common in the tech space.

NVIDIA Repurposing GPU Dies? What Is This About?

As mentioned earlier repurposing GPU (and even CPU) dies isn't new in the tech world. NVIDIA might've been forced to do so because of supply constraints and it's actually a great thing that they're not just turning the defective chips to e-waste.

This process is known as ""binning.""

NVIDIA is not the first and only semiconductor company to do this: AMD and Intel also do it on the regular with their products.

According to Tom's Hardware binning involves categorizing silicon (in this case GPU dies) by quality and overall performance as soon as they're out of the factory assembly line.

NVIDIA makes sure that their GPU dies are designed and made to meet a certain performance standard. But specific situations can actually give a chip less-than-expected performance.

If it doesn't meet the expectations it gets ""binned"" and sold as a lower-tier product.

Intel often does this with their CPUs.

For instance an i7 chip may come out with two defective cores out of eight. To not let it go to waste Intel will then fully disable the two non-functional cores and sell the defective 8-core i7 as a fully functional 6-core i5.

These ""new"" NVIDIA RTX 3060s are still perfectly fine to get even if they're technically ""defective"" 3060 Tis/3070s. So don't worry about getting ripped off.

The announcement came a few hours ago during the developer's latest ESO Live stream where Zenimax detailed the upcoming Deadlands zone DLC and the base Update 32. With this new patch Elder Scrolls Online will receive DLSS support which will be useful for the lower end RTX graphics cards to get better performance; however the high-end GeForce RTX GPUs have already run Elder Scrolls Online at a very high frame rate since the latest optimization patch and they'll now be able to use NVIDIA DLAA instead. This is essentially DLSS minus the upscaling part which means it'll be focused entirely on quality instead of performance.

Creative Director Rich Lambert said:

While we were working on adding NVIDIA DLSS we also worked with them on some new tech that we're going to be the first game that's ever done this before. This is debuting their new tech which is called NVIDIA DLAA. It's the same kind of concept you won't get a performance boost out of this but what you get is absolutely incredible anti-aliasing. It's unbelievable it's crazy how good it is.

Alex Tardif Zenimax Online's Lead Graphics Engineer (whom we recently interviewed) explained on Twitter:

https://twitter.com/longbool/status/1438973491437527040

https://twitter.com/longbool/status/1438973492620312578

This sounds like it would be a great option for any game that already runs at a high frame rate. Unfortunately we didn't get any preview for NVIDIA DLAA from the ESO Live stream but the feature should be available soon on Elder Scrolls Online's Public Test Server. We'll certainly check it out as soon as possible and capture some footage.

Beyond this exciting announcement Zenimax also announced a series of quality-of-life features coming to the game with Update 32 chiefly the Armory which is going to allow players to easily swap character build loadouts including skills attributes equipment and Champion Points.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9lbGRlci1zY3JvbGxzLW9ubGluZS1nZXRzLW52aWRpYS1kbGFhLWRlZXAtbGVhcm5pbmctYW50aS1hbGlhc2luZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elder Scrolls Online gets NVIDIA DLAA (Deep Learning Anti Aliasing),"NVIDIA DLAA to improve image quality in older games

Elder Scrolls Online which debuted in 2014 does not require a very powerful GPU. This is a massive online multiplayer that can successfully be played at high settings and resolution with upper mid-range GPUs. The graphics cards such as RTX 3080 can easily run the game at 4K with 120+ FPS. This is why some users may not want to enable upscaling technology which by principle renders the game at lower resolution.

This is where ESO developers came up with the idea of adopting NVIDIA DLSS but without an upscaling component. This essentially means running DLSS at native resolution and claiming the benefits of smooth edges thanks to AI-powered antialiasing technology.

Alex Tardif who is a Lead Graphics Engineer at ZeniMax Online Studios says that DLAA may require more power and thus not be as fast as Temporal AntiAliasing (TAA) but the end result is better.

What was not stated though is whether DLAA works on non-RTX cards which lack Tensor core acceleration. Otherwise this technology would only serve as an image quality improvement not as a performance booster.

Zenimax unveiled the news during their recent ESO live stream where we found more information out about the upcoming Deadlands zone DLC with base Update 32. The new patch will add DLSS to The Elder Scrolls Online which will help out lower-end GPUs and those chasing 120FPS+ but what about high-end GPUs that want visual quality?

Where DLSS upscales the resolution DLAA will offer ""incredible anti-aliasing"". ESO Creative Director Rich Lambert explains: ""While we were working on adding NVIDIA DLSS we also worked with them on some new tech that we're going to be the first game that's ever done this before.

Zenimax Online Lead Graphics Engineer Alex Tardif explained in greater detail on Twitter: ""We are adding a new option for NVIDIA DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) using their DL technology but without the upscaling component at full resolution for some fantastic AA quality. On RTX cards people run ESO at high fps already so a pure AA option works well!""

He continued: ""Huge thanks to the team at NVIDIA for humoring and then supporting us releasing this when we brought up and tested this hijacking of their DLSS tech into its own thing. It's not something every game would need but for ESO it just made sense.

During Zenimax’s livestream presentation on updates for The Elder Scrolls Online the company made an interesting announcement about a new NVIDIA technology - Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing (DLAA). The new anti-aliasing tech will debut in The Elder Scrolls Online and builds on DLSS’s AI-powered approach minus the upscaling focusing entirely on image quality instead.

During the livestream event ESO’s Creative Director Rich Lambert had this to say about DLAA: “What you get is absolutely incredible anti-aliasing. It's unbelievable it's crazy how good it is.”

While details about DLAA are scarce on the ground the Zenimax presentation makes it likely that fundamentally we’re looking at DLSS running at native resolution. DLSS works by comparing frames rendered at a sub-native resolution to a “ground truth” training sample with 64x supersampling. This means that reconstructed DLSS images especially in Quality Mode already offer high-quality AA since the image is reconstructed from a supersampled reference point. With DLAA it’s likely that we’re looking at something similar except that the AI algorithm has a full-resolution base image to work with meaning even better image quality.

This means that DLAA would be a great fit in games like Doom: Eternal Necromunda: Hired Gun and ESO where framerates without DLSS/DLAA are already very high. DLAA could then up image quality without the massive performance hit of brute-force techniques like sparse-grid supersampling.

Houston-based WaterBridge Holdings announced the deal Sept. 10 that saw the company enter a 15-year produced water management agreement for all of oil producer Colgate’s acreage in the Delaware Basin on the Texas side of the shale play in Reeves and Ward counties.

Included in the acquisition were 10 water handling facilities for midstream operations able to handle about 100000 barrels per day along with about 50 miles of pipelines to move produced water throughout the basin west Texas shares with southeast New Mexico.

The acreage Colgate acquired from the Oxy deal joined assets previously acquired by Colgate from Luxe Energy meaning a total of 86100 operated acres of produced water assets will be managed by WaterBridge for Colgate.

After the transaction closes WaterBridge will have a total of 600000 acres operated for 20 oil and gas producers throughout the Delaware Basin and the western side of the greater Permian Basin which spans from the Carlsbad area in New Mexico to Midland Texas.

Basin-wide WaterBridge has the capacity to handle 2.1 million barrels per day for reuse and 959 miles of pipelines to redeliver water from 97 facilities.

“Colgate’s decision to expand their relationship with WaterBridge further validates our position as the water solutions provider of choice in the Delaware Basin” said Jason Long WaterBridge chief executive officer. “This transaction further enhances our ability to manage and distribute over two million barrels per day of produced and recycled water across our Permian platform.”

David Capobianco CEO of WaterBridge parent company Fiver Point Energy said the company sought to grow its presence in the prolific Permian Basin region as producers like Colgate continued to grow their operations.

“Five Point and WaterBridge have built the leading water solutions platform in the Permian by continuing to support the success of our customers” he said. “We are excited to strengthen our relationship and to further expand our operations to support Colgate’s growth in the region.”

More:What we know about environmental impacts of the Big Papi oil drilling project near Loving

As more unconventional wells those that use hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling were added to the region greater interest was shown for the higher volumes of water produced during operations in the arid region.

Researchers recently began studying how produced water a combination of flowback and formation water brought to the surface with crude oil and natural gas could be used to solve water scarcity.

Research suggests expanding use of oil and gas wastewater

In New Mexico a research consortium between the State and New Mexico State University was convened by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in 2019 to study the potential for use of produced water outside of oil and gas with results of the multi-year study pending.

A Sept. 8 study published by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board based on a five-year study found little health or environmental impacts to using produced water on agricultural crops in central Kern County California.

That region was the only in the world already using produced water to irrigate crops the study read and it recommended increased monitoring and more requirements for water to permits to allay environmental and public health concerns.

While the study was confined to that region it was one of the first in the nation to indicate produced water often high in brine and other chemicals associated with oil drilling could be safe for use by the agricultural industry.

“Concern that severe drought may become more common in the future has increased interest in using unconventional water sources for irrigation” the study read. “Oil and gas ‘produced water’ is an unconventional water source that has potential for agricultural use because of the proximity of some oil and gas fields to agricultural lands.”

Researchers admitted there were concerns for using produced water on crops that would ultimately be consumed by humans as the water can contain chemicals and contaminants unfit for human use.

“However environmental advocacy groups and other members of the public have raised questions regarding the safety of reusing produced water as a source of irrigation” read the study.

To determine the extend of such dangers the study first identified the chemicals using in oil production in the area studied their toxicity levels in various crops and soils and implemented a monitoring program in collaboration with producers and users of the water.

Researchers also contended more monitoring and studies were needed into the extent of chemicals from produced water found in soils and crops over a longer period than the study was conducted and that more research into soil and water sampling was needed.

“There were no findings from crop sampling to indicate a food safety or public health concern related to the reuse of produced water for irrigation in this region” the study read.

Despite continued research on the potential for produced water to be used to address water scarcity across the U.S. New Mexico environmentalists argued it was “toxic” waste that would never be safe for human use or consumption outside of extraction.

“Climate change is ravaging New Mexico leading to more severe droughts and water shortages. In response Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham is endorsing the use of the oil and gas industry’s toxic wastewater to replenish drinking water supplies irrigate crops and fill rivers” said Rebecca Sobel with WildEarth Guardians in a statement.

“Her policy position is an extremely reckless approach to regulating the fossil fuel industry and stands to leave New Mexico’s diminishing water supplies poisoned and unusable.”

With the win the Flames extend their school record home win streak to 13 consecutive games which is the sixth longest active FBS home win streak in the country.

Willis finished the night with six touchdowns four passing and two rushing. The half-dozen scores were his second highest career total falling just short of his program record seven touchdowns set against Southern Miss last year (six passing one rushing).

Willis was efficient through the air completing 21-of-28 passing attempts for 242 yards his highest passing total of the season. He also led the Flames rushing attack with nine carries for 77 yards including a season-long 56 yard run in the second quarter.

Demario Douglas (seven receptions 60 yards) and Kevin Shaa (seven receptions 51 yards) led Liberty in receptions. Shaa and CJ Daniels each had two touchdown receptions tonight.

Liberty’s defense limited Old Dominion to 201 total offensive yards (67 rushing 134 passing) including just 45 yards in the second half.

The Flames recorded five sacks in a game for the second week in a row and held ODU quarterback D.J. Mack to 15-of-27 passing for 134 yards.

Linebacker Tyren Dupree paced the Flames with six stops while defensive lineman Kendy Charles had a career game with three of Liberty’s five sacks.





Turning Point:

After allowing the Monarchs to find the end zone twice during the second quarter and rack up 117 total offense yards the Flames’ defense ended any threats of a comeback in the third.

Liberty’s defense limited 11 total plays and negative one yard off offense (-12 rushing 11 passing) which included a pair of three-and-out drives.

Meanwhile the Flames’ offense added two more touchdowns during the third 15-minute period to seal Liberty’s 13th-straight home victory.

First Quarter



For the third-straight game Liberty scored the first time it touched the ball with all three scoring drives ending with a scoring pass Willis. Tonight the redshirt junior capped a 10-play 68-yard drive with a sideline pass to CJ Daniels who avoided a defender and cut back to the middle of the field for a 14-yard scoring play at 11:25.

Willis showcased his running ability later in the quarter during a six-play 79-yard scoring drive that put Liberty up 14-0 at 3:17. Willis got the Flames in Monarch territory midway through the drive with a 56-yard rush up the middle and ended the drive on a 17-yard scamper to the right for 17th career rushing touchdown.

A muffed punt late in the first quarter gave Old Dominion prime field position but Liberty’s defense kept the Monarchs out of the end zone. Old Dominion was forced to settle for a 43-yard field goal by Nick Rice with 46 seconds left in the quarter trimming Liberty’s lead to 14-3.

Second Quarter

Both teams scored twice during the second quarter sending Liberty into the locker room at halftime with a 28-17 lead.

Both of the Flames’ scores came on passing plays from Willis. The first was a 33-yard strike to Daniels at 13:23 while the second was an over-the-shoulder grab by Kevin Shaa for a 38-yard score at 3:48.

ODU found the end zone for the first time of the evening when running back Elijah Davis scored from one yard out at 6:29. Later in the quarter D.J. Mack Jr. capped a 12-play 75-yard with a 30-yard scoring pass to Zack Kuntz with 42 seconds before halftime.

Third Quarter

Both sides of the ball shined for Liberty in the third quarter with the Flames scoring twice more while holding Old Dominion to negative one yard on 11 total offensive plays.

Willis recorded his fifth and six touchdowns of the game during the third quarter. The first was an eight-yard passing play to Shaa on Liberty’s opening drive after halftime at 11:10. Willis ran for a one-yard score at the 5:18 mark to record Liberty’s final touchdown of the evening.

Fourth Quarter

The Flames punctuated the 28-point home win during the fourth quarter when Alex Barbir capped a 14-play 67-yard drive with a 31-yard field goal with 3:29 left to play in the game.

What’s Next:

Head coach Angie Hind said ""This was a big weekend for us and a great start to conference play. After the long trip to Texas to come back here and get another win against a quality opponent was really pleasing"".

ODU (6-2-0 2-0-0 C-USA) came out of halftime with fire scoring an early goal to pull ahead. In the 54th minute Cami Johnstone found Yuliia Khrystiuk on the left side of the 18-yard box. Khrystiuk scored her first career goal as well as the only goal of the match.

Kasey Perry recorded one save in her 90 minutes of play and earned her third clean sheet of the season.

UAB (2-6-2 1-1-0 C-USA) fired five shots one shot on goal and played off of one corner kick. Anika Toth recorded one shot and five saves in her 90 minutes of play for the Blazers. Jessica Wheeler led UAB on offense with two shots and one shot on goal.

""This was a real squad effort this weekend as we had some players out with injury but others stepped up and really played there part. Delighted for Yuliia to get her first goal and it was well deserved given her work rate and impact today. Another clean sheet also and real credit to our back line which was again led superbly by Emily Roberts""  Hind said.

A warming climate leads to greater weather extremes and impacts the distribution of marine life in North Carolina’s coastal waters scientists say.

The changes occurring challenge the state’s fishing industry and other secondary industries that rely on the catch. But the effects trickle down and place a burden on the state’s most economically vulnerable coastal residents dependent on access to seafood to provide income and help feed their families.

Local anglers who rely on their catch for food often fish from spots along the shore not boats. Although sales of recreational fishing vessels are at a record level the price is beyond the reach of individual anglers at the bottom rung of the state’s economy.

Shore fishing from piers beaches banks and roads is at the front line of the climate crisis because they are at sea level.

“Not everybody has a boat to fish from so what happens when you have damage to docks erosion water quality issues sea-level rise or habitat loss?” said Jessica Whitehead director of the Institute for Coastal Adaptation and Resilience at Old Dominion University in Norfolk Virginia.

“Will there still be places you can fish?”

Her job focuses on an interdisciplinary approach to addressing the impact of climate change on coastal communities.

“There’s been a lot of work done in North Carolina on the ways that the coast is changing” said Whitehead formerly North Carolina’s first chief resilience officer with the N.C. Office of Recovery and Resiliency.

“For example the shift from working waterfronts to homes and condos. Not always included in the conversation is how the state’s poorest residents are handicapped by climate change.

“Climate change is not just a question of science government or engineering. It also involves the social importance and economic security of things like fishing.”

State Of The Climate

While the effects are local the catalyst is a global problem.

The latest U.N. scientific report on climate change released in early August insists that a hotter future is certain and humans are to blame.

Warming is inevitable for the next 30 years because carbon dioxide takes decades to break down. According to the report some changes are already “locked in.”

One result of the shift is evident in the skies over North Carolina’s coastline including frequent weather extremes once considered rare or unprecedented. 2020 for example was the state’s second wettest.

To blame was a record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season. Only one storm made landfall as a hurricane but the state was soaked by the remnants of eight additional tropical systems.

Sea levels will continue to rise as ice on land melts and oceans warm and water expands. More frequent flooding will impact coastal habitats and fisheries.

Extreme storm surges will erode shorelines and kill vegetation in maritime grasslands tidal marshes estuaries lower reaches of coastal plains rivers and low-lying wetlands.

Calvin Adkins/Carolina Public Press Blake Huling casts his line on Aug. 28 at Jeanette’s Pier in Nags Head.

Extreme tides storm surges and more intense rainfall will also affect land use and public infrastructure such as piers and boardwalks.

“Piers offer access to people from all walks of life a wide range of income different races and different levels of fishing ability” said John Hadley an economist with the South Atlantic Fisheries Management Council who authored a Division of Marine Fisheries social and economic study of piers in 2012.

Some people fishing from piers on the North Carolina coast may be recipients of a fishing license waiver. Included in 2006 legislation the program is intended to allow low-income state residents to fish for free either for recreation or to serve dinner.

According to the N.C. Division of Marine Fisheries in 2019 30469 people received a recreational fishing license waiver. The number of waivers is one-tenth of all recreational licenses issued to North Carolina residents evidence that many people in North Carolina use a hook and line to feed their families.

In September 2018 Hurricane Florence crashed into land near Wrightsville Beach then tortured the state’s central coast with fierce winds devastating rain and a record-breaking high tide and tidal surge.

Recorded rainfall totaled 17 inches in New Bern 25 inches in Newport and 33 inches in Swansboro.

Jack Igelman/Carolina Public Press Trace Cooper is the mayor of Atlantic Beach and owner of the Oceanana Pier.

Among the casualties of Florence was Atlantic Beach’s 60-year-old Oceanana Pier which had also sustained damage from Hurricane Irene in 2011.

Trace Cooper and his family the owners of the pier decided to rebuild in spite of the potential for more frequent and punishing storms in the future due to climate change.

According to Cooper who also serves as Atlantic Beach’s mayor it wasn’t an easy decision.

Cooper told Carolina Public Press last year that the cost to repair the pier is roughly $1000 per foot. The last rebuild in 2018 and 2019 was nearly $300000. Since the price of insurance is prohibitive the Coopers incurred the entire cost to restore the pier.

“If you do the math if we go 15 to 20 years without a hurricane it makes sense to rebuild” he said. “We’ve lost the pier twice in a decade. That’s never happened before.”

In the 1990s Bogue Banks a 21-mile barrier island near Morehead City once anchored seven ocean piers to its shore.

Today just two remain on the island; the 1000-foot-long Oceanana is one of them. Two piers in Atlantic Beach the Sportsman’s Pier and the Triple S Pier were razed in 2006 to make room for development.

The heyday of seaside piers Cooper said was the 1950s and 1960s.

Cooper’s grandfather A.B. Cooper Sr. built the Oceanana Fishing Pier and a motel in 1959. The 8-acre property bounded by State Road 58 on one side and the Atlantic Ocean on the other also includes several dozen vacation trailers whose owners lease land from the Oceanana.

“For a long time if you wanted to fish on the ocean you had to go to a pier” Cooper said.

At the height of the pier boom in 1980 there were 36 ocean piers along the state’s coast. Now there are fewer than two dozen.

Jack Igelman/Carolina Public Press Looking down the length of the Oceanana Pier at Atlantic Beach toward the horizon in July 2020.

Yet the pier has remained more pluralistic economically speaking than perhaps the rest of Atlantic Beach. Much like public spaces and public parks piers may be more inclusive and a shared place because of the low entrance barriers.

The destruction of piers is just one example of the mounting intensity of the weather hazards prompted by climate change according to a message from Gov. Roy Cooper in the state’s Climate Risk Assessment and Resilience Plan. The severe weather may intensify existing social inequalities and hamper the ability of economically challenged counties to adapt in the coastal region.

Fishing Woes In Tyrrell County

In some counties fishing is an essential way of life for people trying to eat.

That includes Tyrrell County in Northeastern North Carolina along the Albemarle Sound. A 2016 North Carolina Sea Grant survey of Tyrrell County citizens found that more than 50% are dependent on catching fish to help with their grocery bills.

Located on a low-lying peninsula Tyrrell is prone to floods and especially vulnerable during hurricanes. Though it was spared the worst of Florence in 2018 when it made landfall the impact came later when heavy rains inland caused the Scuppernong River and other bodies of water to rise and flood low-lying areas.

David Clegg the county manager said Tyrrell County is the delta of North Carolina.

“You start the discussion from the understanding that you’re in a swamp” Clegg said. “There is not a square inch of the county that is not in a swamp.”

With a population of just 3200 in the 2020 census Tyrrell County is the least populated in the state. It’s also among the poorest.

The economic viability of the county is dependent Clegg said on the “three Fs” — farming forestry and fishing.

Often residents have their hands in each of the three of which fishing is roughly 30% of the county’s economic output.

“People could work at the warehouse in the fall work with black gold potatoes in the spring and summer and work in the crab house in the winter” he said. “You could cobble together a livelihood.”

And access to fish such as crabs is particularly meaningful in a county where 1 in 4 residents is food insecure.

According to Clegg many supplement their income by harvesting crabs and selling them to suppliers or having them for dinner.

“I can’t keep county employees in positions because I can’t pay them as much as they can make crabbing” he said.

However access to crabs is threatened by climate change.

Fishers are adapting to crab pots to deal with changing currents and buying more nets and line because they must go deeper.

Not only that Clegg said but “every time there’s a storm or we have a nor’easter all of a sudden in some parts of the county you can’t get there from here. You don’t get to say ‘Oh yeah I can take the bypass.’ There is no bypass.”

The road system on the peninsula also connects visitors to fledgling ecotourism destinations such as Pettigrew State Park the Alligator River Game Land and Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. More than 50% of Tyrrell County is public land and a meaningful destination for birders and nature lovers.

The county has taken steps to address the potential for more flooding in the future but Clegg said it has no official climate resilience plan.

“You know they say a bad day fishing is better than a good day working but you still want to catch something.” Jessica Whitehead director of the Institute for Coastal Adaptation and Resilience at Old Dominion University and former chief resilience officer with the North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency.

“It’s essentially an ad hoc plan” Clegg said.

“I’ve just had to raise the Social Services Department (building) a couple of feet so that it won’t flood anymore. I’m moving the county maintenance garage because it floods so badly.”

Whitehead of ODU is concerned that losing access to fishing sites due to flooding and sea-level rise may be compounded by other environmental factors.

“You know they say a bad day fishing is better than a good day working but you still want to catch something” she said.

When The Fish Don’t Bite

A short way east of Tyrrell County at Jeannette’s Pier in Nags Head people fishing on a hot August afternoon talked about poor luck possibly due to the sweltering temperatures but they were less certain about the role of broader climate change.

“My experience is that the water is too hot and the fish are finding deeper water to live in” said Dennis Scott. “As far as the environment is concerned I don’t think that’s an issue.”

Others along the pier had similar observations and various suggestions for what is undermining the fishing.

Calvin Adkins/Carolina Public Press Willie Murwin fishes at Jeanette’s Pier in Nags Head on Aug. 28.

Like Scott William Murwin pointed a finger at the hot weather. “It’s been pitiful everywhere” Murwin said. “I go fishing just about every day and I don’t catch anything. And I got oodles and oodles of stuff to fish with. It’s just too hot. They are down deep.”

However Anthony Ramirez speculated that too many small fish are spoiling the fishing.

“I’m not catching fish like I used to” Ramirez said. “I think everybody is going through the same thing. Crabbing is the same way. I believe there are so many baitfish out there they have too much to eat.”

To Blake Huling multiple causes underlie the fishing woes though he doesn’t think the blame should go to commercial fishing.

“To be honest everybody is going to have problems now and then” Huling said.

“What I think it runs in a cycle of what fish do. I don’t think that it is related to commercial fishing. It’s more related to the water temperature the tide the moon. It’s just a phase that fishing goes through year by year. Last year wasn’t that great and it has not been that great so far this year. It just runs in cycles.”

Calvin Adkins/Carolina Public Press Richard and Fran Barger fish off the Washington Bridge in Manteo on Aug. 28

In nearby Manteo at the Washington Bridge Richard and Fran Barger were among about 10 people also braving the August heat to try their luck. Like others they said the fishing has been poor and see multiple culprits.

“Before we used to catch fish all day; now we fish all day and catch nothing” Richard Barger said.

“Overfishing pollution it’s multiple things. It’s frustrating … A lot of people are saying the same thing fishing is not like it used to be.”

Fran Barger agreed: “There were times when I threw my line out I caught a croaker right and left. … Unfortunately I haven’t experienced it lately. I figure I’m using the wrong bait.”

According to our friend Clint Richardson of the Auburn Uniform Database marks the first uniform alternation for the Tigers since they wore a No. 7 decal on the sides of their helmets and a gray facemask for the 2020 Outback Bowl against Minnesota in honor of late quarterback and 1971 Heisman Trophy winner Pat Sullivan.

That’s actually one of just two games since 1984 that Auburn did not wear a navy blue facemask joining the 50th anniversary of the 1957 national championship in 2007 when the Tigers removed the “AU” decals from their helmets and donned a gray facemask for the win over Vanderbilt.

Kickoff for Saturday’s game in Happy Valley is set for 7:30 p.m. ET on ABC.

Demand is booming for silicon chips which are embedded in everything from smartphones and televisions to wind turbines but it comes at a big cost: a huge carbon footprint.

The industry presents a paradox. Meeting global climate goals will in part rely on semiconductors. They’re integral to electric vehicles solar arrays and wind turbines. But chip manufacturing also contributes to the climate crisis. It requires huge amounts of energy and water – a chip fabrication plant or fab can use millions of gallons of water a day – and creates hazardous waste.

As the semiconductor industry finds itself increasingly under the spotlight it is starting to grapple with its climate impacts. Last week Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company the world’s largest chipmaker which supplies chips to Apple pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The company aims to “broaden our green influence and drive the industry towards low-carbon sustainability” said the TSMC chairman Mark Lui.

But decarbonizing the industry will be a big challenge.

TSMC alone uses almost 5% of all Taiwan’s electricity according to figures from Greenpeace predicted to rise to 7.2% in 2022 and it used about 63m tons of water in 2019. The company’s water use became a controversial topic during Taiwan’s drought this year the country’s worst in a half century which pitted chipmakers against farmers.

In the US a single fab Intel’s 700-acre campus in Ocotillo Arizona produced nearly 15000 tons of waste in the first three months of this year about 60% of it hazardous. It also consumed 927m gallons of fresh water enough to fill about 1400 Olympic swimming pools and used 561m kilowatt-hours of energy.

Chip manufacturing rather than energy consumption or hardware use “accounts for most of the carbon output” from electronics devices the Harvard researcher Udit Gupta and co-authors wrote in a 2020 paper.

A global shortage of high-end chips as the pandemic boosted demand for electronics and Covid outbreaks closed fabs has increased focus on the industry.

In a tight market automakers found themselves at the back of the chip queue far behind much bigger-scale semiconductor customers such as Apple who use the chips to give computing power to their smartphones laptops and other devices. GM halted production in several of its North American factories this month while Toyota said it would cut its carmaking by 40% in September.

In an attempt to increase production many countries are embarking on big programs to boost the industry.

The Chips for America Act proposes $52bn in funding over five years for the US semiconductor industry. The EU has forwarded its own legislation aimed at increasing its share of the global chips market to 20% by 2030. The European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen called it “a matter of tech sovereignty” in her State of the European Union address last week.

These ambitions line up a potential clash with international climate goals. Both the EU and US aim to get halfway to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. And as the semiconductor industry grows so too will its carbon footprint.

However amid pressure from investors and electronics makers keen to report greener supply chains to customers the semiconductor business has been ramping up action on tackling its climate footprint.

“Recently I started seeing our effects on the environment completely come to the forefront” said Sohini Dasgupta principal design engineer at ON Semiconductors.

Two years ago she said the industry “was sitting on the fence in the middle of the pack saying: ‘Yes sustainability is important but we don’t know what to do with it’”. But now she sees movement: “Every day it pops up in our emails what our company’s doing what other companies are doing” she said.

The rise of ethical investing has helped according to Mark Li a semiconductor analyst at the investment firm Bernstein. Fund managers increasingly market “green funds” and investors are asking more questions about companies’ environmental social and governance (ESG) impact. “Over the last three years the voice of ESG investment is much louder than before” Li said. Ultimately this changes how companies behave he added.

Greater availability of renewable energy is helping chipmakers reduce their carbon footprint. Intel made a commitment to source 100% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 as did TSMC but with a deadline of 2050.

Energy consumption accounts for 62% of TSMC’s emissions said a company spokesperson Nina Kao. The company signed a 20-year deal last year with the Danish energy firm Ørsted buying all the energy from a 920-megawatt offshore windfarm Ørsted is building in the Taiwan Strait.

The deal which has been described as the world’s largest corporate renewables purchase agreement has benefits for TSMC said Shashi Barla renewables analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. As well as guaranteeing a clean electricity supply it pays a wholesale cost and removes itself from price shocks “killing two birds with one stone” he said.

TSMC’s actions have the potential to influence the rest of the industry said Clifton Fonstad professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT “other manufacturers are likely to follow its lead”.

As well as switching to renewables chipmakers could also implement efficiencies in fabs said Peter Hanbury a semiconductor manufacturing expert at the management consultancy Bain & Company. A chip fab is basically “a gigantic warehouse with a clean room inside” he said and to cut emissions “the easy part is the facility itself”.

Fabs could be more efficient in regulating air and water temperature humidity and pressure. They could segment warehouses so one production line had high pressure and another lower using less energy than keeping the entire warehouse at a high pressure.

They could capture more data and use machine learning to turn tools off when they weren’t being used said Huili Grace Xing an engineering professor at Cornell University who works on semiconductor materials.

There is also innovation aimed at tackling the worst-polluting materials used in making semiconductors. The chip industry uses different gases during the production process many of which have a significant climate impact.

Chip companies make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost they can afford it Mark Li semiconductor analyst

TSMC said it had implemented scrubbers and other facilities to treat gas emissions. But another route is replacing “dirtier” cleaning gases that clean the delicate tools in semiconductor manufacturing said Michael Pittroff a chemical engineer working on semiconductor gases at Solvay Special Chemicals.

In industrial tests over the last six years with about a half dozen chipmaker clients Pittroff said he and his team had replaced more polluting gases with “cleaner” fluorine with a lower global warming impact.

Other companies target the gases that are used to etch patterns onto and clean the silicon surface of a wafer – the thin piece of material used to make semiconductors. Paris-based industrial gases company Air Liquide for example has come up with a line of alternative etching gases with lower global warming impacts.

But replacing gases will be a challenge: anything that touches the silicon wafer such as an etching gas is really hard to alter once a fab is operating said Hanbury. The process involves a huge amount of precision. Fabs have to place up to 100m transistors on a postage-stamp sized wafer and need to do it perfectly. It takes four to five years for fabs to develop a recipe for this and “once you set it you basically never want to change it” Hanbury said.

Some experts believe chipmakers will start to modify their processes to incorporate greener gases especially if the big players make a move. “If TSMC switches I am sure the others will” said Fonstad. “If TSMC doesn’t then other manufacturers may switch to show they are better than TSMC.”

To some observers of the chip business the determination to clean up the industry seems real. The vast demand for chips at the moment will only help the semiconductor industry embrace sustainability goals said Li.

According to IDC the industry will see normalization and balance by the middle of 2022 with a potential for overcapacity in 2023 as larger scale capacity expansions begin to come online towards the end of 2022.

Growth is driven by mobile phones notebooks servers automotive smart home gaming wearables and Wi-Fi access points with increased memory pricing. IC shortages are also expected to continue easing through 4Q21 as capacity additions accelerate.

“The semiconductor content story is intact and not only does it benefit the semiconductor companies but the unit volume growth in many of the markets that they serve will also continue to drive very good growth for the semiconductor market” says Mario Morales Group Vice President Enabling Technologies and Semiconductors at IDC.

Despite the current Covid-19 wave consumption remains healthy. IDC reports that dedicated foundries have been allocated for the rest of the year with capacity utilization at nearly 100%. Front-end capacity remains tight but fabless suppliers are getting the production they need from their foundry partner. Front-end manufacturing is starting to meet demand in 3Q however larger issues and shortages will remain in back-end manufacturing and materials.

According to IDC 5G semiconductor revenues will increase by 128% with total mobile phone semiconductors expected to grow by 28.5%. Game consoles smart home and wearables will grow +34% 20% 21% respectively. Automotive semiconductor revenues will also increase by 22.8% as shortages are mitigated by year end. Notebook semiconductor revenues will grow by 11.8% while X86 Server semi revenues will increase by 24.6%.

Semiconductor wafer prices increased in 1H21 and IDC expects increases to continue for the rest of 2021 due to material costs and opportunity cost in mature process technologies.

Overall IDC predicts the semiconductor market to reach $600 billion by 2025 – representing a CAGR of 5.3% through the forecast period. This is higher than the typical 3-4% mature growth seen historically."

The so-called Oracle of Omaha has conveyed to Korean Steel mill POSCO (NYSE:PKX) that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) will not back the Posco’s bid for Daewoo shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME).

Warren Buffett said the reason for not supporting the bid is that he is expecting a downturn in the shipping Industry worldwide. Buffett’s Berkshire controls a 4.5 percent stake in Posco.

Chung Yang CEO of Posco in a quest to expand the footprints of the company is developing a $30 billion plan under which the company will construct plants in India and Indonesia after the demand improves post global recession. Chung announced that Posco will look into the bidding for DSME in January which is the world’s third biggest shipbuilder.

The shares of Daewoo shipbuilding will be affected and come down as the news implies that the sale will not be concluded. Head of research at Heungkuk Securities Co Cho In Karp said “POSCO (NYSE:PKX) is the only company that has the cash on hand to buy a company of this size.” The stocks of DSME declined to their lowest in four months.

State-owned Korea Development Bank and Korea Asset Management Corp. have not agreed to selling their 50 percent stake in the Daewoo Shipbuilding in the previous year as they were expecting an increase in the stock prices.

Warren Buffett who rejected to back Posco for DSME deal has a simple style of Investing. The idea is compounding the capital at the fastest rate and keeping the margin of safety consistent. The margin of safety could be anything from a balance sheet to a product with a high gross margin for which there is a limited competition in the market.

Buffett’s friendship with Charlie Munger changed his investment style. He learned that companies with limited competition and better competitive advantages have an edge over the dud companies which have no future for growth.",,,,,,,,,

All this started with a call to action made by Allan Liska a member of Recorded Future's CSIRT (computer security incident response team) on Twitter over the weekend.

Since then with the help of several other contributors that joined his efforts the list quickly grew to include security flaws found in products from over a dozen different software and hardware vendors.

While these bugs have been or still are exploited by one ransomware group or another in past and ongoing attacks the list has also been expanded to include actively exploited flaws as security researcher Pancak3 explained.

The list comes in the form of a diagram providing defenders with a starting point for shielding their network infrastructure from incoming ransomware attacks.

Vulnerabilities exploited by ransomware gangs (Allan Liska / Pancake)

Vulnerabilities targeted by ransomware groups in 2021

This year alone ransomware groups and affiliates have added multiple exploits to their arsenal targeting actively exploited vulnerabilities.

For instance this week an undisclosed number of ransomware-as-a-service affiliates have started using RCE exploits targeting the recently patched Windows MSHTML vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444).

In early September Conti ransomware also began targeting Microsoft Exchange servers breaching enterprise networks using ProxyShell vulnerability exploits (CVE-2021-34473 CVE-2021-34523 CVE-2021-31207).

In August LockFile started leveraging the PetitPotam NTLM relay attack method (CVE-2021-36942) to take over the Windows domain worldwide Magniber jumped on the PrintNightmare exploitation train (CVE-2021-34527) and eCh0raix was spotted targeting both QNAP and Synology NAS devices (CVE-2021-28799).

HelloKitty ransomware targeted vulnerable SonicWall devices (CVE-2019-7481) in July while REvil breached Kaseya's network (CVE-2021-30116 CVE-2021-30119 and CVE-2021-30120) and hit roughly 60 MSPs using on-premise VSA servers and 1500 downstream business customers [1 2 3].

FiveHands ransomware was busy exploiting the CVE-2021-20016 SonicWall vulnerability before being patched in late February 2021 as Mandiant reported in June.

QNAP also warned of AgeLocker ransomware attacks on NAS devices using an undisclosed flaw in outdated firmware in April just as a massive Qlocker ransomware campaign targeted QNAP devices unpatched against a hard-coded credentials vulnerability (CVE-2021-28799).

The same month Cring ransomware started encrypting unpatched Fortinet VPN devices (CVE-2018-13379) on industrial sector companies' networks after a joint FBI and CISA warning that threat actors were scanning for vulnerable Fortinet appliances.

In March Microsoft Exchange servers worldwide were hit by Black Kingdom [1 2] and DearCry ransomware as part of a massive wave of attacks directed at systems unpatched against ProxyLogon vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855 CVE-2021-26857 CVE-2021-26858 CVE-2021-27065).

Last but not least Clop ransomware attacks against Accellion servers (CVE-2021-27101 CVE-2021-27102 CVE-2021-27103 CVE-2021-27104) that took place between mid-December 2020 and continued in January 2021 drove up the average ransom price for the first three months of the year.

Fight against an escalating ransomware threat

Liska's and his contributors' exercise adds to an ongoing effort to fend off ransomware attacks that have plagued worldwide public and private sector organizations for years.

Last month CISA was joined by Microsoft Google Cloud Amazon Web Services AT&T Crowdstrike FireEye Mandiant Lumen Palo Alto Networks and Verizon as part of the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) partnership focused on defending critical infrastructure from ransomware and other cyber threats.

The federal agency also released a new ransomware self-assessment security audit tool in June designed to help at-risk organizations understand if they're equipped to defend against and recover from ransomware attacks targeting information technology (IT) operational technology (OT) or industrial control system (ICS) assets.

CISA provides a Ransomware Response Checklist for organizations that have been hit by a ransomware attack advice on how to protect against ransomware and answers to frequently asked questions about ransomware.

The New Zealand Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT NZ) has also recently published a guide on ransomware protection for businesses.

CERT NZ's guide outlines ransomware attack pathways and illustrates what security controls can be set up to protect from or stop an attack.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PFE,Pfizer,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIwNTk3NjkvcGZpemVyLWlzLXBsYW5uaW5nLXRvLWFkdmVydGlzZS1pdHMtY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS1jb21pcm5hdHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer is planning to advertise its Covid-19 vaccine Comirnaty,"Pfizer is about to start advertising a new product in the US: the Covid-19 vaccine.

This might sound a bit odd. After all it’s hard to think of a product that’s received more promotion than the Covid-19 vaccine. Governments activists healthcare specialists celebrities and regular citizens are all unpaid advocates for it urging anyone who is unvaccinated to get a shot often a second and soon a third.

The US is with New Zealand one of only two countries that allow direct-to-consumer advertisement of prescription drugs. So when Pfizer’s vaccine which now has the brand name Comirnaty received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Aug. 23 the company was also authorized to market it and has expanded its salesforce to do so.

Pharmaceutical companies spend an exorbitant amount of money on marketing their single biggest area of expenditure ahead of research and development. In 2019 Pfizer spent about $2.4 billion in advertising and its resources to promote the Covid-19 vaccine might be even bigger considering the company is already expected to make $15 billion from it prior to any marketing.

The company hired the advertising agency Ogilvy to work on a campaign. “We plan to take a thoughtful approach to marketing and advertising Comirnaty to the public during this time with the goal of increasing confidence in vaccination” Eamon Nolan a spokesperson for Pfizer told Quartz in an email. Both Pfizer and Ogilvy declined to share further details about the campaign.

Whatever thoughtful approach the company plans to take to its marketing it’s likely the objectives are to expand the market for Covid-19 vaccines and convincing as many people as possible to get the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine rather than any of the others that are available.

This will become especially important as Americans over 65 and at high risk of contracting Covid-19 will soon begin getting a booster dose after a panel of FDA advisors recommended it to strengthen their immune response. Other groups won’t be needing the booster just yet but they are likely to eventually especially as pharmaceutical companies refine their products to be more effective against the delta variant. Preliminary research shows there are no disadvantages and potentially even advantages to mixing vaccines with a booster shot so Pfizer could compete for a portion of the market to boost other vaccines. Plus if the Covid-19 vaccine becomes a yearly appointment like a flu shot Pfizer is looking at a potential market of about 300 million doses a year in the US alone.

How can the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine be advertised?

It’s hard to think of precedents when the advertisement of a drug coincided with a large public campaign to promote it let alone at this scale. Even when AIDS drug cocktails were introduced the advertisement was not for one specific drug but more broadly for the availability of treatment.

But the large promotion apparatus associated with the vaccine which has included cash prizes for those getting the shot doesn’t necessarily make the job of advertising Comirnaty easier. In fact it creates rather choppy waters for a marketing team to navigate says Pradeep Chintagunta a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who specializes in pharmaceutical marketing.

There are two main types of direct-to-consumer advertising available to Pfizer. The first is known as help-seeking advertisement and it’s a type of promotion that doesn’t recommend a specific drug. This kind of ad aims to expand awareness of a disease or in this case of the availability of a vaccine and its value. It focuses on expanding the market letting consumers know that they should be talking to their doctors but it cannot specifically mention Comirnaty or any product though it can bear the Pfizer logo.

This kind of advertising Chintagunta says could even be done in collaboration with other drugmakers and would have the main goal of expanding the potential market. It would also have another advantage which might prove especially valuable with vaccine promotion: It doesn’t need to list the drug’s side effects.

That is not true for the second type of advertising Pfizer could choose to do a product claim ad. This kind of advertisement promotes the prescription drug with its brand name but has to list side effects and risks as clearly as its benefits. A product claim ad can also be comparative selling a product by highlighting the way in which it is superior to a competitor.

For Comirnaty this latter type of advertisement could be a minefield.

On the one hand being able to promote the specific product would be valuable to Pfizer especially in the longer term. One of the concerns is that with so many companies working on vaccines there will be many options available and an oversupply of vaccines says Chintagunta. “Competition is going to play a big role and how a firm is able to communicate the relative benefits of their vaccine might then become really crucial” he says.

But this comes with the danger of dissuading potential patients from getting vaccinated because reading or hearing the whole list of side effects might alarm someone on the fence even if the side effects pale when compared to the risks associated with Covid-19. Comparative advertising would push this risk even further; highlighting any shortcomings of a competitor product might have the consequence of reducing trust in any vaccine irrespective of the maker.

Help-seeking advertising wouldn’t run that risk but might have limited impact at least in the short term. It’s hard to imagine anyone in the US who isn’t at least aware of Covid-19 and of the option of getting a vaccine.

Who would Comirnaty advertising benefit?

There is another element to consider says Chintagunta. Americans who traditionally hold pharmaceutical companies in low regard have come to associate drug marketing with greed and vaccine skeptics might be further driven away by seeing the vaccine as a commercial product. “If this product is viewed as something that we should get for free […] the fact that it’s been advertised and potentially people will have to perhaps pay for it might reflect poorly on the company” he says.

All this would suggest caution when it comes to advertising Comirnaty. But many working in pharmaceutical marketing believe the company will spare no efforts to promote the drug to the fullest possible extent.

Markus Saba a healthcare marketing professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said he expects the campaign for Cominarty will be on a scale proportional to the once-in-a-century size of the health issue comparing it to the prominence of campaigns for Viagra. “You turn on the TV and you can’t watch a show without 10 different commercials coming on” he told the Financial Times.

But although direct-to-consumer ads are the most visible part of the marketing effort an equally—if not more—important area of promotion and one with fewer risk is reaching hospitals doctors and pharmacies. Unlike the first immunization campaign booster shots will probably be administered in the same way flu shots are via the doctor or the pharmacy. So it will be essential for Pfizer to convince those who will prescribe or administer the vaccine to recommend Pfizer over Moderna or other options. “If it defaults into the traditional ‘go to your doctor and get the shot’ then [the game] is not going to be played on-air or in the pages of a magazine but in the doctor’s office” says Chintagunta.

There is however one important way in which Pfizer’s direct-to-consumer advertisement might be helpful not only to the company but to the overall vaccine drive. If its resources were turned toward fine-grained targeted advertising it might be able to move the needle of vaccine skepticism in groups that haven’t been responsive to government campaigns and other forms of vaccine promotion such as young adults or immigrant communities. “This is the place where they can flex their marketing muscle I think the benefit of targeted advertising can really manifest itself in this particular case” says Chintagunta.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL25vdmFydGlzLWRldGVybWluZWQtdG8tZGV0aHJvbmUtcGZpemVyLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1ib2xkLWtpc3FhbGktaWJyYW5jZS1oZWFkLXRvLWhlYWQtdHJpYWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Novartis determined to dethrone Pfizer will launch bold Kisqali-Ibrance head-to-head trial in breast cancer,"Despite two life extension wins Novartis still finds it tough to convince doctors to use its breast cancer drug Kisqali over Pfizer’s first-to-market Ibrance. Now with a third survival victory under its belt the Swiss pharma is determined to overthrow its rival—and it's launching an ambitious head-to-head trial to make it happen.

Sunday Novartis said it’s collaborating with SOLTI Innovative Cancer Research to launch a new phase 3 trial for Kisqali and Ibrance. Dubbed Harmonia the trial will pit the two CDK4/6 inhibitors—both used on top of endocrine therapy—against each other in patients with the HER2-enriched subtype of HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.

The news comes as Novartis churned out a third clinical trial success for Kisqali at the ongoing European Society for Medical Oncology annual meeting whereas Ibrance’s clinical programs have yet to report a life-saving benefit for the Pfizer med. And it comes as Ibrance’s U.S. new-to-brand prescription numbers stay about 10 times that of Kisqali’s despite its lagging behind in clinical data.

“The strength and consistency of the Kisqali overall survival data across the Monaleesa program reinforce there are differences among CDK4/6 inhibitors and that Kisqali stands apart in its ability to help patients achieve their goal of more quality time” Susanne Schaffert Ph.D. president of Novartis Oncology said in a statement Sunday.

“Harmonia a novel head-to-head trial is a testament to our bold development approach and will provide evidence on the unique profile of Kisqali and its unmatched benefit for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients” Schaffert added.

RELATED: ESMO: In landmark win Novartis' Kisqali extends breast cancer survival by one year. Can it challenge Pfizer's Ibrance?

With help from Alliance Foundation Trials the new study will start enrolling patients in the first quarter of 2022 across 80 hospitals in Spain Portugal and the U.S. The main goal is to see which therapy is better at delaying tumor progression or death. It will also assess whether Kisqali alters tumor biology in a way that enables better response to endocrine therapy compared to Ibrance according to Novartis.

An exploratory cohort of the study will also enroll patients with a basal-like subtype of tumors which resemble triple-negative breast cancer. These participants will get chemotherapy alongside the CDK4/6 inhibitors.

Novartis in 2019 unveiled two positive datasets from the Monaleesa-7 and Monaleesa-3 trials detailing significant overall survival improvements for different Kisqali combos in premenopausal and postmenopausal women respectively.

In contrast Ibrance’s pairing with AstraZeneca’s Faslodex didn't significantly outperform solo Faslodex at extending the lives of previously treated patients in the Paloma-3 trial. A smaller phase 2 trial dubbed Paloma-1 also failed to show a significant survival advantage for Ibrance’s use on top of Novartis’ aromatase inhibitor Femara. And the Pfizer drug also fell short as a postsurgical treatment in two trials in the adjuvant setting.

Still Ibrance holds a seemingly unshakeable lead in market share. In the second quarter Ibrance’s U.S. sales came in at $862 million and its share in first-line new patient starts was strong at 73% according to Pfizer. Kisqali brought in only $83 million in the same period.

According to SVB Leerink’s most recent tally of IQVIA data as of Sept. 10 Ibrance’s average new-to-brand scripts have been roughly stable at around 1100 to 1200 per week while Kisqali’s were about 110. Eli Lilly’s Verzenio probably thanks to its recent first-in-class adjuvant win is seeing a growing number of new scripts reaching 359 for an average of the last four weeks.

At ESMO 2021 Novartis unveiled new data from the Monaleesa-2 trial. It showed that adding Kisqali to Femara extended patients’ lives by one year and the reduction in death risk reached 24%. Ibrance’s counterpart phase 3 trial Paloma-2 has yet to report final overall survival data.

Gabriel Hortobagyi M.D. of the MD Anderson Cancer Center lead investigator of the Monaleesa-2 trial has suggested that it may take a readout from the Paloma-2 trial to finally change doctors’ prescribing habits.

“If that [Paloma-2] trial is similarly positive to Monaleesa-2 then I think physicians will continue to prefer [Ibrance] simply because that’s their habit” Hortobagyi said in an interview about Kisqali’s new data at ESMO 2021. “If that trial is negative then I think … there will be an exodus from [Ibrance] to [Kisqali].”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzgyMDE1MzIvcGZpemVyLW1vZGVybmEtY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZXMtbmV3LW5hbWVzLWV4cGxhaW5lci_SAVxodHRwczovL2dsb2JhbG5ld3MuY2EvbmV3cy84MjAxNTMyL3BmaXplci1tb2Rlcm5hLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmVzLW5ldy1uYW1lcy1leHBsYWluZXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why did Pfizer Moderna COVID-19 vaccines get new names after approval? Experts explain,"Months after emergency use approval both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were given their full stamp by Health Canada — a stamp that came with new names for the vaccines as well.

In a tweet Thursday morning Canada’s health agency announced the new names with Pfizer’s vaccine now being known as “Comirnaty” Moderna’s jab as “Spikevax” and AstraZeneca’s shot would be called “Vaxzevria.”

“These are only name changes. There are no changes to the vaccines themselves” Health Canada said.

While the full approval means that kids aged 12 and up are now able to receive their shots of Comirnaty or Spikevax the renaming raised some concern over possible confusion people might have with the new “complicated” names — especially during a time when Canada is struggling to increase its vaccine uptake.

Health and vaccine experts tell Global News that the renaming really is just a part of the normal regulatory process that the vaccines have to undergo and that their old names would most likely stick in the long run.

Scott Halperin director of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology and professor at Dalhousie University explained that the renaming was not Health Canada’s choice but rather a branding exercise decided by the vaccine makers themselves.

“So it’s the companies that did it and the condition is that companies are not allowed to market the vaccine or a drug before it’s approved for use” said Halperin.

3:33 Where is Canada heading in its fight against COVID-19?

“Now what happened with COVID vaccines is unusual in that they did not receive full approval they were released for emergency use authorization.”

Halperin pointed to the lack of marketing around COVID-19 vaccines in Canada the last year-and-a-half due to the approval process and that vaccine makers weren’t allowed to name their drugs in Canada without full approval.

“So it’s not that they renamed them. It’s just now their name is allowed to be used publicly” he said.

Health Canada’s full approval stamp comes just weeks after the United States Food and Drug Administration fully passed the Pfizer jab on Aug. 23.

“Based on the longer-term follow-up data that we submitted today’s decision by Health Canada affirms the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine at a time when it is urgently needed” announced Fabien Paquette the vaccines lead for Pfizer Canada on Thursday.

“While a significant number of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated there is still much work to be done as infection and hospitalization rates continue to rise across the country primarily among unvaccinated populations.”

On whether there was concern that the new brand names would change the public’s perception of the shots and influence people’s decision on whether to get a dose Halperin says his guess is that it won’t make much of a difference.

It’s an assumption also shared by infectious diseases specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch who said that he’s still going to call them by their old names.

Yeah nobody cares. I'm still going with Pfizer Moderna & AZ rather than [unpronounceable] the name of a D-division volleyball team and Vaxixkckerkrzvia. — Isaac Bogoch (@BogochIsaac) September 16 2021

In an interview with Global News on Saturday Bogoch said that he doesn’t think people are going to use those brand names.

“They’re hard to say they’re new they’re a bit confusing and I just think people are going to continue with what they already know” he said.

“Since it’s been announced by Health Canada has anyone used any of these names? I heard them once — and I talk about vaccines all the time.”

Bogoch said that the one change that made sense to him and was helpful was the World Health Organization (WHO) naming its variants of concern.

In May the WHO announced it had assigned several key variants of the virus letters of the Greek alphabet such as the B.1.1.7 variant being renamed to the Alpha variant and B.1.617.2 to Delta.

As for the new vaccine brand names Bogoch was confident that it would do little to deter people from getting their vaccines or change the way they would be discussed.

“With the brand names for the vaccines I could be wrong but I don’t think that we’re going to be using this in our day-to-day conversations — both in the field of medicine and also in regular conversation outside of medicine.”

Everything you need to know.,"Despite the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and easy access the U.S. has fallen behind 40 other countries in getting its people fully vaccinated in a pandemic that is still raging.

About 55% of Americans have gotten at least two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or a single shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine according to Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center. That compares with top-ranked Malta which has fully vaccinated 83% of its population. Our Canadian neighbors have a 70% vaccination rate. China is at 72%. The UK is at 66%.

And though the pace of vaccinations rose slightly in August it has trended downward the last two weeks.

Editorial: An appeal to vaccinated Free Press readers

At this rate ""by the end of September the U.S. will have the lowest vaccination level of all prosperous democracies With the largest supply & the biggest head start"" Andy Slavitt who stepped down in June as senior adviser to the White House pandemic response team said in a tweet last week.

Michigan's vaccination rate lags behind the national average with 51.4% of its population now fully vaccinatedCDC data shows.

And that's despite a supply of coronavirus vaccines that is now abundant. Anyone 12 and older who wants a shot can get a shot. All they have to do is go to a local pharmacy or text their ZIP code to 438829 or call 800-232-0233.

Don't have a ride? The government will pay an Uber or Lyft driver to take you there. And in some communities including Detroit health care workers will even make a house call to bring the vaccine to you.

What types of COVID-19 vaccines are available in the U.S.?

There are three different coronavirus vaccines widely available today:

Pfizer: Made in partnership with the German-based biotechnology firm BioNTech this coronavirus vaccine is fully authorized by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for use in Americans ages 16 and older. Adolescents ages 12-15 also are eligible for the Pfizer vaccine under an FDA emergency use authorization. It is given in a series of two doses spread three weeks apart. It is being marketed now under the brand name Comirnaty.

Federal regulators have recommended a third dose for people with immune-suppressing conditions. A decision is expected next week on whether Americans ages 65 and older along with people who are at high risk of severe disease should also take a third dose.

Moderna: Available under an emergency use authorization for Americans 18 and older the Massachusetts-based company has applied for full approval from the FDA for its coronavirus vaccine. It is given in a series of two doses spaced four weeks apart. Federal regulators have recommended a third dose for people with compromised immune systems.

Johnson & Johnson: Available through an FDA emergency use authorization for Americans ages 18 and older the J&J vaccine made by its Belgian-based pharmaceutical branch Janssen Pharmaceuticals is given in a single dose.

The CDC published a study Friday analyzing the effectiveness of all three vaccines in use in the U.S. from March to August when the more contagious delta variant was circulating.

It found the Moderna vaccine was 93% effective at preventing hospitalization and death among U.S. adults who were not immunocompromised. Pfizer's vaccine was 88% effective and J&J's was 71% effective.

How do the COVID-19 vaccines work?

Both Moderna's and Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccines are made with messenger RNA technology. They use a protein that mimics the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It tricks the body into mounting an immune response that will protect a person from the virus.

They do not use the live virus and cannot give a person COVID-19.

The mRNA used to make these vaccines does not affect or interact with a person's DNA or genetic material. It is quickly broken down by the body and eliminated.

The J&J vaccine is different. It is an adenovirus vector vaccine. It uses a modified cold virus that has been stripped of several of its genes. Those genes are replaced with genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus which then triggers an immune response to protect a person from the virus.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine cannot multiply in the body and it cannot give a person COVID-19. It also does not alter a person's DNA.

Is the technology used to develop the mRNA vaccines brand new?

No it's not new.

The technology has been studied and tested for decades including in the development of vaccines for flu Zika rabies and cytomegalovirus. It's just that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines created by Pfizer and Moderna were the first to complete the federal regulatory process and bring an mRNA vaccine to market.

In addition to using mRNA in the production of vaccines the technology also has been used in cancer research to trigger the immune system to attack cancer cells.

What was the approval process like?

The coronavirus vaccines were created and tested using the same process the FDA and CDC require for every vaccine in use in the U.S. today. They were not experimental.

Here is how it worked:

The pharmaceutical companies first had to apply to the FDA for permission to test new vaccines to fight the novel coronavirus. The FDA evaluated those applications and was satisfied the ideas and the technology they planned to use met its standards for quality and safety.

Clinical trials began next.

Each company recruited thousands of volunteers for randomized blinded and controlled trials conducted in a series of phases that expanded at each level to include more people. The trials helped scientists determine whether the vaccines worked what the side effects were and identified the ideal dose.

Data from the clinical trials was then submitted to the FDA and CDC for review. Federal regulators inspected the vaccine manufacturing facilities to ensure that the companies could produce the vaccines reliably and consistently.

Then the companies each had to submit a licensing application asking for permission to distribute and market their vaccines to the public.

The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee made up of an independent panel of expert scientists reviewed all the data and recommended each vaccine for emergency use authorization. The FDA commissioner signed off on the recommendations.

At that stage the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices developed recommendations for the use of each of the vaccines establishing who should get them the number of doses that should be given and how far apart they should be spaced.

After the CDC committee issued guidelines for the vaccines the CDC director approved them. They then could be injected into the arms of Americans.

Pfizer was the first to win an emergency use authorization in mid-December 2020. It was soon followed by Moderna and then Johnson & Johnson in late February.

In August the FDA fully approved the Pfizer vaccine for Americans ages 16 and older. The vaccine remains under emergency use authorization for teens and tweens ages 12-15 and for a third dose for people who are immunocompromised.

An FDA committee recommended Friday that an emergency use authorization be granted for a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for people six months after the second dose if they are ages 65 and older or are at high risk for severe COVID-19 complications because of underlying health conditions such as obesity or diabetes.

The FDA commissioner a CDC committee and CDC director must all agree before that emergency use authorization can be granted. Those steps could come as soon as next week.

Moderna also has applied for full authorization of its vaccine and Johnson & Johnson is expected to apply for full approval soon.

What are the risks?

All three coronavirus vaccines continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring of any vaccines in U.S. history. Both the FDA and the CDC say the benefits of being vaccinated far outweigh the risks.

The most commonly reported side effects for all three vaccines are mild and tend to dissipate within one to two days. They include pain redness and swelling at the injection site fatigue headache muscle or joint pain chills and fever. There also have rarely been reports of severe allergic reactions.

All three vaccines are considered safe and effective in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 but there have been some safety concerns:

JOHNSON & JOHNSON: In April the FDA added a safety warning saying there's an association with rare reports of thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome following vaccination. The condition causes blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets that can be life threatening. Those at highest risk for the complication are women ages 18-49.

A warning also was added in July about a small increased risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome after taking the vaccine. The rare neurological condition causes the body’s immune system to damage nerve cells and can lead to muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.

In August warnings were added that the vaccine also could trigger tinnitus or ringing in the ears diarrhea and vomiting.

PFIZER & MODERNA: In June the CDC vaccine advisory committee reviewed reports of heart inflammation among teens and young adults after they were immunized with either a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices acknowledged there likely is an association with myocarditis and pericarditis among 12- to 39-year-olds following vaccination.

The complication is more likely to occur in boys and young men and the condition is most likely to appear within the first five days after vaccination. Most who developed the heart complication post-vaccination have made full recoveries.

Anyone can report side effects to the federal government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System by calling 800-822-7967 or online at vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html.

Do the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks?

Yes. Unvaccinated people are 4.5 times more likely to be infected with coronavirus compared with fully vaccinated people. They also are over 10 times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 and 11 times more likely to die of the disease said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.

The data comes from a new study of case rates hospitalizations and deaths from the virus among more than 600000 people in 13 states from April 4-July 17 when the highly contagious delta variant was circulating in the U.S.

The study Walensky said ""offers further evidence of the power of vaccination.""

While a very tiny percentage of people have had complications from vaccination 1 in every 500 Americans has died of COVID-19 since the pandemic began. It was the third leading cause of death in the month of August and has now infected more than 41.8 million people and killed more than 668000 in the United States.

The virus also can cause little understood long-term complications that can be disabling and last four or more weeks after the initial infection. Known as long COVID or post-COVID syndrome it can affect every major organ system and can include fatigue pain brain fog difficulty breathing cough or shortness of breath headache heart palpitations dizziness and more.

Scientists know the vaccines work at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Comparatively the risk of serious side effects from any of the vaccines is extremely small.

Among 1 million women ages 18-49 who received the J&J vaccine seven developed blood clots with low platelet count according to the CDC. The incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome among Americans 18 and older who got the J&J vaccine is estimated to be about 1.5 in 100000.

For those who took the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines cases of serious heart inflammation — myocarditis or pericarditis — have been reported at a rate of 12.6 per million people within 21 days after a second dose of a vaccine though some cases have also been reported after the first dose as well.

Anaphylaxis a severe allergic reaction has occurred in 2 to 5 people per 1 million who get a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S.

What are the religious objections to the vaccines?

Very few religions are opposed to COVID-19 vaccines as a matter of doctrine.

Traditionally Christian Scientists have rejected the use of vaccines; most of its members rely on prayer for healing and have sought religious exemptions from vaccine mandates.

However the church issued a statement on its website saying that members ""are free to make their own choices on all life-decisions in obedience to the law including whether or not to vaccinate. These aren’t decisions imposed by their church.""

Some members of the Dutch Reformed Church also oppose vaccines believing they interfere with God's will. But that isn't an absolute either. Some members also view the vaccines as gifts from God according to a review of religious objections to vaccines from Vanderbilt University.

Catholics have some objections too.

In early March Michigan's seven Catholic bishops including Archbishop Allen Vigneron of the Archdiocese of Detroit called the J&J vaccine ""more morally problematic"" than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

That's because J&J ""utilized in the design production development and confirmatory testing a cell line that originated from tissue taken from an aborted baby"" and abortion violates Catholic doctrine.

The bishops urged the state's Catholic faithful to take Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccines instead and to only take the J&J vaccine ""if there are no other alternatives.""

Why isn't natural immunity just as good as a vaccine?

While a person who contracts coronavirus is likely to develop antibodies that should provide some protection from reinfection for at least a little while it's unclear how long that protection will last.

The CDC urges everyone including people who've already had COVID-19 to get vaccinated. The federal agency published a study in August that analyzed coronavirus reinfections from May to June among hundreds of fully vaccinated people and unvaccinated people in Kentucky.

It found that those who were unvaccinated were more than twice as likely to be reinfected with the virus than fully vaccinated people were.

“If you have had COVID-19 before please still get vaccinated” Walensky the CDC director said in a statement. “This study shows you are twice as likely to get infected again if you are unvaccinated. Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others around you especially as the more contagious delta variant spreads around the country.”

If you had the virus and were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma the CDC recommends waiting 90 days before getting a coronavirus vaccine.

Who should get a booster shot?

For now federal regulators have not approved COVID-19 vaccine boosters for the majority of Americans.

However the CDC urges some people to get another shot. Anyone who had a two-dose series of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines who has a moderately to severely compromised immune system should get a third dose the CDC advises.

That's because people who are immunocompromised might not build up the same level of immunity from the vaccines as healthier people.

The recommendation for a booster includes people who:

Are being treated for tumors or cancers of the blood.

Received an organ transplant and are taking immune-suppressing medication.

Received a stem cell transplant in the last two years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system.

Have moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency such as DiGeorge syndrome or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

Have advanced or untreated HIV infection.

Are undergoing treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress immune response.

On Friday the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted to recommend a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for Americans ages 65 and older and for people who have other underlying health conditions that put them at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Those conditions include diabetes and obesity.

The third dose for that population would fall under an emergency use authorization and would be recommended six months after the second Pfizer dose. FDA officials are also considering whether to include in the recommendation that health care workers and other front-liners who are at high occupational risk of exposure to the virus get a third dose.

But there are still some hurdles it has to jump before that recommendation goes into effect. It first must be approved by the FDA director. It also must be reviewed by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices which meets Wednesday.

If the CDC director signs off on the recommendation a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine could win an emergency use authorization as soon as next week for those 65 and older people with underlying health conditions and potentially front-line workers.

Federal authorities also are investigating whether people who took the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines should get another dose but so far no recommendations have been made.

What we don't know

There's so much scientists are still learning about the SARS-CoV-2 virus how to treat it and why it seems to cause severe symptoms in some people but not in others.

Because the virus is mutating every new strain of the virus brings with it new questions and concerns. Some variants like the delta strain are more transmissible than others. Scientists worry that as the virus continues to spread new variants will emerge that could evade the current tests or render the vaccines and treatments ineffective. Such a strain could be deadlier as well.

That's one of several reasons why doctors and health officials urge as many people as possible to get vaccinated. Immunizing more people will reduce the rate of infection and thereby cut the chances the virus has to mutate.

Because the coronavirus vaccines have been on the market for less than a year some people who've yet to get vaccinated say they are concerned about potential long-term effects.

While there aren't studies yet showing their safety over a long period of time the CDC says serious side effects that could cause long-term health problems are extremely unlikely for the COVID-19 vaccines as they are for any vaccine.

That's because side effects from any vaccination are most likely to occur within six weeks after getting a shot the CDC reports.

Vaccine advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted Friday to recommend emergency use authorization of a booster dose of Pfizer’s vaccine to people 65 and older and those at high risk of severe Covid-19 six months after they get their first two shots.

But the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee rejected a broader application to approve booster doses of Pfizer’s vaccines for everyone 16 and older six months after they are fully vaccinated.

Members of the committee expressed doubts about the safety of a booster dose in younger adults and teens and complained about the lack of data about the safety and long term efficacy of a booster dose.

Biden administration officials had previously announced a plan to begin administering booster doses to the general population during the week of September 20 irritating some members of the committee. They later noted that any action would be pending signoff from the FDA and US Centers for Disease Control.

Some of the advisers – a group of vaccine experts immunologists pediatricians infectious disease specialists and public health experts – have said the process was rushed and several members said during the meeting they wanted to see more data.

The group unanimously supported authorization for the more limited higher-risk group and they informally advised the FDA to include health care workers or others at high risk of Covid-19 exposure in the EUA too. The FDA will now craft its decision on Pfizer’s request taking into account the committee’s guidance.

Dr. Archana Chatterjee dean of the Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Franklin University noted the lively discussion and adjustments during the meeting proved they are truly independent advisers.

“I think this should demonstrate to the public that the members of this committee are independent of the FDA and that in fact we do bring our voices to the table when we are asked to serve on this committee” she said.

Pfizer’s case for boosters

During the meeting Dr. William Gruber senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development at Pfizer said several studies indicate that people’s immunity can and does wane and that giving booster doses restores that immunity – sometimes to levels higher than seen at initial vaccination. He said people who got the boosters did not have any more side effects than seen after the first two doses.

And Gruber said while the two-dose Pfizer vaccine continues to protect well against severe infection hospitalizations and deaths there are hints that could change.

The company relied heavily on data from Israel where vaccinated people started to get breakthrough infections. Israeli researchers earlier told the meeting that adding booster shots in Israel helped keep many people out of the hospital.

“The Israeli experience could portend the US Covid-19 future” Gruber said. “Israel and the United States real world evidence suggests that vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 infection wanes approximately six to eight months following the second dose” he added.

“In addition recent US CDC data hint at reduced Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness over time against severe disease and hospitalization in the US” he said. “This reduced vaccine effectiveness tracks with longer spans of time between two doses of vaccine and SARS coronavirus exposure.”

But FDA staff and advisers pushed back on the data available so far.

Dr. Phil Krause deputy director of the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review noted that Pfizer was using data that had not been reviewed by experts.

“One of the issues in this is that much of the data that’s been presented and being discussed today is not peer-reviewed and has not been reviewed by FDA” Krause told the meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.

Krause along with another FDA vaccine official Marion Gruber signed a Lancet paper published earlier this week that argued it’s too soon to start giving people boosters.

Dr. Michael Kurilla an infectious disease specialist at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences noted that Pfizer’s studies relied heavily on measurements of antibodies without looking at other important aspects of immune response.

“It’s a little disappointing that there’s been very little reporting of the cellular immune responses and an entire focus on the neutralizing antisera” Kurilla said. “Which clearly for that population at high risk is absolutely essential but for the broad population in terms of their protection which seems to be holding up well over time – (that) should be because of adequate cellular immune responses but we have no indication of that.

“So it’s unclear that everyone needs to be boosted other than a subset of the population that clearly would be at high risk for serious disease.”

Dr. Cody Meissner a professor of pediatrics at Tufts University School of Medicine said during the meeting he didn’t think boosters would significantly contribute to controlling the pandemic.

“It is very important that the main message that we still transmit is that we have got to get everyone two doses. Everyone has got the get the primary series” he said. “This booster dose is not likely to make a big difference in the behavior of this pandemic.”

Pfizer received full approval for its vaccine from the FDA so the request to add a booster dose is a supplement to that approval. Pfizer – and other researchers – say their studies show people develop strong immunity after two doses of vaccine but that levels of antibodies start to drop after a few months.

The FDA noted in its briefing documents that Pfizer’s vaccine – as well as vaccines made by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson – still provide strong protection against severe disease hospitalization and death even if antibodies do wane over time.

After the FDA advisory committee makes its recommendation the FDA makes the decision about whether to approve the booster dose.

“Today was an important step forward in providing better protection to Americans from COVID-19. We stand ready to provide booster shots to eligible Americans once the process concludes at the end of next week” White House spokesman Kevin Munoz told CNN.

The CDC has scheduled a meeting of its vaccine advisers for September 22 and 23 – and CDC must give its stamp of approval for any booster doses to be officially given. In a letter sent Thursday and obtained by CNN the CDC urged local and state health officials to wait to administer boosters until both agencies had signed off.

Third doses are already approved for certain immunocompromised people but not for the general public."

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaW5jaW5uYXRpL25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWF0dG9ybmV5LXByaXNvbi1yZWxlYXNlLWFwcGVhbC5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYml6am91cm5hbHMuY29tL2NpbmNpbm5hdGkvbmV3cy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtYXR0b3JuZXktcHJpc29uLXJlbGVhc2UtYXBwZWFsLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZ2xvYmFsLzIwMjEvc2VwLzE5L2ktaGF2ZS10by1iZS1icmF2ZS10by1nZXQtbXktbWF0ZXJpYWwtam9obi1zYWZyYW4tb24taHVtb3VyLWxpZXMtYW5kLXBoaWxpcC1tb3JyaXPSAYEBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2dsb2JhbC8yMDIxL3NlcC8xOS9pLWhhdmUtdG8tYmUtYnJhdmUtdG8tZ2V0LW15LW1hdGVyaWFsLWpvaG4tc2FmcmFuLW9uLWh1bW91ci1saWVzLWFuZC1waGlsaXAtbW9ycmlz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘I have to be brave to get my material’: John Safran on humour lies and Philip Morris,"John Safran’s getting squeezed out. These days it seems every journalist shares his beat. Where once the impish provocateur was famous for inhabiting the fringes of culture those fringes now occupy centre stage.

Health reporters ponder the rising human consumption of deworming paste for cattle while tech writers explain the global torching of mobile phone towers. Members of parliament peddle quack cures; the Therapeutic Goods Administration anxiously declares a “tenfold” increase in the importation of ivermectin; while Sky News invites the far-right on to the telly.

The extreme is mainstream the author likes to say and paranoia civic distrust and quack theories are front-page news.

“I managed to have a career because I go to the fringes of the fringes and come back with this stuff” Safran says. “Now these things have just taken over the world it’s sort of like a mainstream kind of theatre.”

So what now for Safran? It might surprise you: a book on Earth’s largest cigarette company Philip Morris and the world-bending influence of corporate language.

Puff Piece – How Philip Morris Set Vaping Alight (and burned down the English language) opens in a Melbourne bus terminal’s carpark late at night where Safran meets a dealer of contraband. The writer has come for the IQOS – a type of electronic cigarette produced by Philip Morris which despite the machine’s dependence upon tobacco (AKA “HeatSticks”) the company insists is neither a vape or a cigarette. It’s outlawed in Australia.

From here Safran investigates the company’s tactical pivots – for example on World No-Tobacco Day Philip Morris declares its intention to “unsmoke” the world. Safran warns it’s best not to trust grand social claims made with corporate neologisms and examines its attempt to redefine smoking not merely through technological innovation but with words.

“From a storyteller’s perspective it’s fascinating that Philip Morris have their back against a wall and they’re gonna have their menthol cigarettes banned in Europe and they’ve figured out this way to weasel around it and they’ve won in a way” Safran says.

In his car after closing the deal with his shady eBay hawker Safran is left fingering the device that Philip Morris says is helping people to quit smoking but which by book’s end Safran convinces us is merely designed to addict people to something only artificially different to the old product.

Safran was the “least religious kid in Melbourne’s most religious school” – St Kilda’s Yeshivah College – before entering RMIT’s school of journalism in the early 90s. He dropped out and joined the world of advertising.

Safran enjoyed it – making a successful ad was like solving a logic puzzle he says – and while driving around the city he found himself pondering the invisible design of billboard ads. He also learned two valuable lessons.

“Advertising trains your mind to come up with short snappy ideas” he says. “I also learned that very little in that world is done accidentally.”

But Safran had grander creative ambitions and in 1997 he became one of eight young documentary film-maker contestants for the first season of ABC’s Race Around the World. In the Ivory Coast Safran conscripted a voodoo priest to curse his girlfriend; in California he showed viewers how to break into Disneyland. Safran won the public vote but was disqualified by judges after secretly filming Brazilian priests giving confession. A star was born.

The next year the ABC commissioned a pilot: John Safran: Media Tycoon. Lampooning the aggressive doorstop techniques of A Current Affair Safran forced a legendary confrontation with its host Ray Martin. The pilot never aired but the footage has enjoyed a long and cultish life online. Soon after Safran would find himself in court in a bizarre test of trespass laws after remotely sending a cigarette-puffing robotic seagull on to the MCG to “tempt” Shane Warne – who had recently signed an endorsement deal with Nicorette – into sneaking a cheeky drag.

Safran’s national reputation as a sly jester and social stuntman was cemented by three TV series that aired in the noughties on SBS and ABC: John Safran’s Music Jamboree John Safran vs God and John Safran’s Race Relations. It’s significant that each series bears his name and the covers of two of his three books bear his face: the subjects of his documentaries matter less than his distinctive treatment of them. Early in his career Safran says he realised how to attract an audience. “You can get humour by making it all about yourself” Safran says. “Making stories personal while making it about a bigger thing.”

He uses humour because he doesn’t want to come across deadly serious because then no one will listen to you Father Bob McGuire

Perhaps his most popular work was his long radio partnership with Father Bob McGuire on Triple J. For 10 years from 2005 a Jew and a Roman Catholic – an agnostic and a priest – riffed on the week’s news often in bitter disagreement.

“We had a funny way of being serious” Father Bob says of their partnership. “I liked John’s attitude to life which is scepticism. Everything’s up for grabs all things flow. And John has common sense which is a great attribute much underestimated by humanity. The ruling class doesn’t want you to have common sense because then you’ll see right through them. And he uses humour because he doesn’t want to come across deadly serious because then no one will listen to you.”

John Safran public performer is a confection of sorts. The difference between the private Safran and the public one is enormous. Privately Safran is shy awkward deferential. Few people could pull the stunts he has – or volunteer for such weird danger – but that he has might suggest that it comes naturally. Or enjoyably. It doesn’t. It’s remarkable that such a quiet man has so insistently made a career of outlandish provocation. That career is a long and very serious effort of will.

“I really love being a storyteller” Safran says. “And I’ve figured out a way to engage an audience but I have to be brave to get my material so I can put it in a story that an audience will react to. But [the stunts] make me uncomfortable in the stomach. I mean I find it uncomfortable just approaching people. I find making phone calls awkward. A friend said that I’m intimidated by authority and I think that’s true.

“And” – he’s only half-joking here perhaps – “I’ve forgotten what the real me is any more.”

The enfant terrible is almost 50 now and the pranks are mostly retired. He’s an author these days though his books remain stamped with the Safran schtick: heavy irony dramatised naivety and restless personal digressions.

“The fact I’m always talking about little stories in my life well that’s because that’s what my audience and Penguin wants” Safran says and jokes that his publisher would frown upon him writing a novel – Safran is a bankable brand.

His first book Murder in Mississippi was released in 2013 and became a prize-winning best-seller here (American critics were far less kind). It was a non-fiction account of the killing of a white supremacist by a black man – coincidentally the murder victim had previously been the subject of a Safran prank. Confounded by the usual difficulties of journalism – lack of access unreconcilable contradictions – Safran says he struck upon a realisation that would inform not only Mississippi but both subsequent books: rather than harming the story these difficulties could become the story.

“I got really stressed out” Safran says. “We didn’t know what was happening and I couldn’t meet the killer. And that drove me crazy. But then like it clicked: oh you just write about whatever the obstacle is.”

Safran’s second book 2017’s Depends On What You Mean By Extremist written with his eye for personal strangeness and contradiction was a Gonzo romp amongst the far-right Islamic radicals and antifa. The figures were often vulgar volatile and unblanchingly bigoted – but perhaps too often presented as merely laughable. Today when humour and a diseased irony functions as both recruitment tool and alibi for those in the alt-right fringes he has immersed himself in – a way to suggest it’s all a joke while stoking the hatreds required for very real obscenities – I ask Safran if he thinks humour might be most effective when used against the humourless.

“The answer to alt-right irony is better irony” Safran says. “I have 100% faith in humour.”

To use humour against bigotry injustice or corporate cynicism is not to trivialise these threats he says but part of a tradition of facing and surviving darkness. “Humour’s been this awesome thing for a thousand years this lubricant and way of decompressing trauma” Safran says. “That’s my culture. That’s my way of doing dot paintings.”

And so it is for Puff Piece a kind of jester’s voyage through etymology combustion science and corporate blaggardry and stuffed with winking asides terrible puns and earnest dialogues with his rabbi about the nature of evil. After remarking on the glamour of an image of Hannah Arendt smoking Safran writes: “I love everything about cigarettes except for the cancer.”

For all his irreverence and cringe-making stunts Safran is deadly serious about humour. And language. He’s been thinking about words for decades. In Puff Piece there’s this beautifully taut expression of his faith: “Words hold power. A phrase so overused it has itself lost much of its power. Still it’s no less true. I’ve been clobbered with this concept since Sunday School: according to kabbalah the mystical branch of Judaism God created the universe by breathing words. And the Jewish mystics teach we too can build and bend realities like God has. Not with piping mud and scaffolding but with words.”

And Philip Morris Safran says – that old titan – will either die or guilefully reinvent itself with them. “It all pivots on corporate kabbalah breathing words into the world hoping they catch alight and reshape reality.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

In his current role as CEO of Empowerment & Inclusion Capital Corp. and Vice Chairman of PNC Bank he sees a not-to-distant future when most if not all American companies will be led by boards and management teams that practice diversity that extends to women people of color and members of the LGBTQ community.

He has good reason to be confident. His employer PNC Bank has introduced several initiatives aimed at achieving equality. In the wake of the racial justice movement in 2020 the PNC Foundation committed to contributing $1.5 billion to efforts working to combat racism empower African Americans and bring about economic opportunity for low- and moderate-income communities.

Providing share holder value while promoting inclusive economic growth

In 2020 a PNC board member who is a senior manager at Microsoft noted that just as the tech company leverages technology to work toward equality a financial giant like PNC can do likewise with its resources.

The idea was then hatched to sponsor a SPAC or Special Purpose Acquisition Company with the goal of purchasing an existing private company to further promote diversity. PNC Bank approached Rep. Ford to spearhead the initiative. Hence the creation of the Empowerment and Inclusion Capital Corp.

SPACs exist for the sole purpose of raising capital and acquiring another company with the intention of achieving a predefined goal in this case a more equitable and inclusive society. Sponsors come together and put up the at-risk capital including the costs of consultants lawyers etc.

Ford explains that once the partner company is acquired the mission is to “take all of the profits and invest them in initiatives supporting the economic empowerment and inclusion of underrepresented groups.”

The Empowerment and Inclusion Capital Corp. debuted on the New York Stock in March 2021 and trades under the ticker symbol EPWR. To date it has researched several potential partner companies but is not yet ready to consummate an acquisition.

In the meantime PNC continues with its broader goal of promoting diversity and inclusion at every opportunity while setting a positive example.

“A number of other companies are working toward achieving diversity including Netflix Google and Microsoft” says Ford. “We (at PNC) want to be part of the pantheon of awareness that leads to an even bigger intentionality for companies to make a difference in this way.”

What is the key to bringing more diversity to the financial sector or mortgage industry?

Stacey Cunningham President New York Stock Exchange

We need to advance diversity across the entire corporate landscape Wall Street included. Our capital markets can play a powerful role when investors demand change by allocating dollars to companies that are prioritizing diversity. At the NYSE and through our parent company ICE we arm investors with ESG data that informs their investment decisions. We are also leveraging our brand and CEO network to deliver a solutions-based approach by identifying and placing diverse independent directors with our Board Advisory Council. The key is for us all to take action as our collective efforts are critical to driving meaningful change.”

Jay Farner Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Hiring diverse talent is a top priority at Rocket Companies as we continue growing our FinTech businesses. We have partnered with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and diverse student organizations at many other universities to recruit new talent. In fact we surpassed our goal of hiring 10% of this year’s summer interns from HBCUs. Rocket Companies remains committed to keeping DEI in our DNA and leveraging our culture to enact lasting positive change.”

Suzanne Shank President and Chief Executive Officer Siebert Williams Shank & Co. LLC



After 33 years on Wall Street what’s most encouraging is that improvements in DEI in employment and procurement are at the forefront of senior leadership team and corporate board agendas. The most glaring issue is that diversity declines dramatically as you move up the corporate ladder. Wall Street must look at the pipeline of talent and do a better job ensuring bias and preconceived perceptions are not playing a role in advancement decisions. DEI must be viewed as a responsibility and priority throughout each firm at every level.”

",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHljYXIuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wOS8wOS0xOS1idXp6LWxhZ3VuYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paddock Buzz: Dixon's Title Reign Ends with Bang on Tough Day,"Scott Dixon probably wasn’t going to repeat as NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion. After all despite winning six series championships – the second-most in the sport’s history – he has never won titles in consecutive years. His came in 2003 2008 2013 2015 2018 and 2020.

The easy explanation for Dixon being eliminated from contention Sunday in the Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca is to say he got struck in the Corkscrew by Takuma Sato. But Dixon had been struggling to contend long before that.

After starting eighth and moving to the fifth spot on the opening lap the handling of Dixon’s car often was a handful. On the Firestone’s primary black tires Dixon’s No. 9 PNC Bank Grow Up Great Honda of Chip Ganassi Racing couldn’t match the speed of others around him and his car was sliding where it wasn’t supposed to.

Then the Sato incident occurred.

Sato spun in the treacherous turn and then started to back across the track. Dixon tried to avoid the two-time Indianapolis 500 winner darting toward the dirt on the left side. But Sato’s car kept rolling backward and the impact was firm. The damage to Dixon’s right sidepod and undertray was visible even at speed and he was left to soldier on as best he could.

Dixon was 11th at the time of the contact and finished 13th but it didn’t matter. With teammate Alex Palou (No. 10 NTT Data Honda) grabbing 40 points for the second-place finish Dixon’s deficit swelled from 49 points to an insurmountable 72.

Assuming Palou participates in next week’s Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach all drivers not within 49 points do not have a chance. That means Palou’s only significant challenger is Pato O’Ward (No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet) who finished fifth Sunday. His deficit is 35 points.

Newgarden Barely Hanging On

Josef Newgarden (No. 2 Hitachi Team Penske Chevrolet) also has been bidding to add another series championship to his resume but it also likely won’t come this year.

Unlike Dixon Newgarden managed to stay in title contention – barely – as he battled through an extra pit stop and difficulty keeping his tires under him to finish seventh. He will go to Long Beach with a 48-point deficit. He would need to score the maximum number of points -- win the race and lead the most laps -- and have Palou finished 25th or worse in a 27-car field without leading a lap. In that scenario O’Ward also would need to finish third or worse for Newgarden to mount a miracle comeback.

“It was just hard to do more than we did starting 17th” Newgarden said. “We can’t start back there; we know that. Just a punch to the gut (in qualifying) with the way that went – two weekends in a row.

“It’s still a little bit hard to digest. We’re not sure what’s caused that but I’m proud of my team.”

Newgarden’s INDYCAR titles came in 2017 and 2019 so he probably won’t be able to go every other year on the Astor Challenge Cup. He’s not willing to go out without a fight but he fears the title opportunity is gone.

“We’ll go to Long Beach and at least get second out of this championship” he said.

Ericsson Eliminated but Undeterred

Marcus Ericsson (No. 8 Huski Chocolate Honda of Chip Ganassi Racing) continued his strong run in the second half of the season with a sixth-place finish.

Ericsson stood 13th in the standings after the two races at Texas Motor Speedway in early May and he was still 10th following the Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge. In the nine races since he has won two races to climb to fifth.

In this race the Swede had to go 30 laps on the same set of tires during the middle stint but he handled the difficulty like the series veteran he has become.

“It was a tough day I think” he said. “We had a good car but we had some traffic in the first stint that we had to (pit early) out of that traffic. Then we had to run long on each stint and today with the (tire) degradation on this track it was tough for us to keep the pace over the stints.

“P6 was a good result but we were hoping for a little bit more.”

Johnson Hangs on for Best Result

Jimmie Johnson (No. 48 Carvana Honda of Chip Ganassi Racing) finished 17th his best result as an INDYCAR driver. But even more rewarding on the weekend of his 46th birthday was the way he battled.

Seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Johnson had a lengthy duel with six-time INDYCAR race winner James Hinchcliffe (No. 29 Genesys Honda of Andretti Steinbrenner Autosport) and escaped heavy contact from Romain Grosjean (No. 51 Nurtec ODT Honda of Dale Coyne Racing with RWR) at the top of the famous Corkscrew. Both drivers did well to hang on.

“I thought our day was over (following the contact)” Johnson said. “I couldn’t believe that he threw it in there that late on me. Luckily we both saved it. I thought I (broke) my wrists too as the wheel went whipping around. We both saved it.

“I was worried about getting a penalty for being inside the green (restricted area) but thankfully I didn’t get that penalty and I was able to get that career-best finish.”

Contact Befells Rossi

Alexander Rossi (No. 27 NAPA AUTO PARTS/AutoNation Honda) had perhaps his best chance to win a race this season go bad on the second lap.

Rossi who started second had an opportunity to pass Andretti Autosport teammate Colton Herta (No. 26 Gainbridge Honda) on the inside in Turn 5 after Herta drifted briefly into the dirt in Turn 4. Rossi tried to pounce but once alongside Herta his car wiggled and then pushed into Herta’s causing contact that sent Rossi to the left-side barrier.

After being helped from the gravel trap Rossi continued finishing two laps down in 25th.

However there are those few that have made to be elite of all metal music. Without any doubt one of those bands is Megadeth. You can not simply deny their greatness and influence. This year these legends joined forces with Lamb of God to go on an epic metal tour and quite frankly that is how they called it – The Metal Tour of the Year. Special guests are Trivium and Hatebreed who replaced In Flames who supposedly ran in to some Visa issues to come stateside. We caught up with the tour on a rainy night in New Jersey.

First on were American hardcore band from Connecticut called Hatebreed. They are active for over two decades. Led by vocalist Jamey Jasta the band has released eight studio albums and through years of lineup changes Jamey remains the only founding member left. Their set consisted of ten songs. To the delight of all early birds their set was loud and raucous.

Next came Trivium. The band hails from the state of Florida and while they released their first studio album in 2003 they have managed to release nine more to date. They have been very busy writing music and touring. I saw them first in 2018 and they blew my mind by how great they sounded live and how well the band mix together. Sound and stage performance are flawless. Maybe one thing I found funny is vocalist and guitarist Matt Heafy’s way of getting the crowd to be louder. He informs that the best and loudest crowd they encountered in one of the early shows of the tour and asks people in attendance to be better than those. It was the same three years ago and it was the same this night. It worked!

The set consisted of eight songs from which most were from their latest two albums What the Dead Men Say (2020) and In the Court of the Dragon (2021). The best reception was received for The Heart From Your Hate though I must say that their whole set was wholesome and well received by all fans in the amphitheater.

Lamb Of God set was hidden from fans behind the black curtain. When the lights went down two blue lights shone through and giant bands name was projected on this screen. Somewhere there on his platform vocalist Randy Blythe stood and sang intro to their hit song Memento More from the bands latest self-titled studio album. Such mystique atmosphere just blew away as soon as curtain fell and the usual mayhem ensued. Lamb of God really put up a real metal show. There was everything loud explosions fire smoke and relentless onslaught of heavy metal.

Randy remembered the early days of the band playing in New Jersey parking lots and now being here with Megadeth. He suggested that they are not here to just play music but we are all in the need to really fuck this place up. What can I say to the relief of venue owners the amphitheater still stands but the atmosphere through the bands performance was truly electric.

They played most of their best songs within their allocated time little more than one hour including Walk with me in Hell and Redneck. Their energy still vibrated through the air after their set was done and we all waited for Megadeth.

Dave Mustaine entered the stage with his current band members to the loudest ovation I have heard so far in my life. It sent chills down the spine. Knowing Dave’s recent bout with cancer it was awesome to see him in good spirits and enjoying the life and music. Just before performing Sweating Bullets he stood there in the middle of stage with the spotlight on him looking on the crowd while numerous fans were screaming about their love for Dave and declaring that he is the legend.

They started the evening with Hangar 18 from Rust in Piece. Song included many guitar solos that brought pure delight to the fans. The band also played Holy Wars …. The Punishment Due from the same album as the encore. Second song performed was The Threat is Real from Dystopia followed by Sweating Bullets which you can find in their fifth studio album Countdown to the Extinction released back in 1992. Personally to me that is my favorite album and the band played one more hit song later in the show from it called Symphony of Destruction.

While we can say that Megadeth is Dave Mustaine and Dave Mustaine is Megadeth it would be unfair to current band members. Kiko Loureiro on guitar Dirk Verbeuren on drums and James LoMenzo on bass were so good that you would think they are all together since the early beginnings. This whole performance was one of the best live heavy metal shows I witnessed in my whole life.

The tour still has a few more stops left before the end and then … we are waiting for a new Megadeth album which will be called The Sick The Dying and The Dead!

Simon Pagenaud ended up fourth at 1:11.3381 in the No. 22 Menards Team Penske Chevrolet while Will Power helped Team Penske take three of the top five spots by rounding out the top five at 1:11.3936 in the No. 12 Verizon 5G Chevrolet.

Among the other four drivers eligible for the Astor Challenge Cup as series champion Josef Newgarden ended up 10th at 1:11.6116 in the No. 2 Hitachi Team Penske Chevrolet after leading practice Friday. Marcus Ericsson was 12th at 1:11.7162 in the No. 8 Huski Chocolate Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.

Two red flags cut track time by nearly 20 minutes during the 45-minute session.

Twelve minutes were lost early in the session due to a crash involving Dalton Kellett in the No. 4 K-Line Insulators/AJ Foyt Racing Chevrolet. Kellett lost control of his car and hit the tire barrier in Turn 4 inflicting damage to the right side and rear of the car. Kellett climbed from the car and was unhurt.

With 11 minutes left Rinus VeeKay spun off and crashed in the No. 21 Sonax/Autogeek Chevrolet in nearly the same spot as Kellett. VeeKay also was unhurt. The ensuing red flag lasted seven minutes with a traffic jam of cars entering the racetrack for a furious final four minutes of activity.

Through nine specific action points they commit to supporting the goal of global net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner.

The initiative which has been led by some members of the Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Groups in the UK (ICSWG‐UK) and US (ICSWG‐US) is endorsed by the United Nations Race to Zero campaign and supported by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). The twelve investment consultants are: Barnett Waddingham bfinance Cambridge Associates Cardano Frontier Hymans Robertson JANA LCP Meketa Redington Willis Towers Watson and Wilshire.

Key influencers of capital allocation: investment consultants’ role in the Net Zero transition

Investment consultants play a crucial role within the savings and investment ecosystem. They provide strategic advice to asset owners such as pension funds sovereign funds endowments insurers foundations and family offices in areas such as investment beliefs and strategy asset allocation asset manager selection. They also provide broader education on the long‐term investment risks and opportunities related to climate change such as transition risk physical risk and stranded assets risk. These firms are often the critical link between asset owners and asset managers determining which firms and strategies are favoured for selection. Consultants also provide guidance to asset managers about ESG capabilities and climate competence as well as advising on the development of new investment solutions.

The commitments developed for the NZICI have been designed to facilitate alignment with the UN‐ convened Net‐Zero Asset Owner Alliance the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and other signatories of the Race to Zero campaign. They will work together with other signatories of net zero initiatives as a member of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).

Clear commitments and timeframes

The NZICI sets out nine actions that investment consultants will take to support the goal of global net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner in the context of legal and fiduciary duties and specific client mandates. First among these actions: integrating advice on net zero alignment into investment consulting services as soon as possible and within two years of making this commitment. The commitments apply to investment advisory service and business operations. For those consultants which offer discretionary asset management services the commitments include a pledge to align with the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative within two years.

The nine actions are as follows:

Within our investment advisory services we will:

Integrate advice on net zero alignment into all our investment consulting services as soon as practically possible and within two years of making this commitment Work with our institutional asset owner clients to identify the investment risks from climate change highlight the importance of net zero alignment and where applicable support our clients in developing policies that align their portfolios to a net zero pathway Support efforts to decarbonize the global economy by helping our clients prioritize real economy emissions reductions reflecting the target of 50% global emissions reduction by 2030 or sooner using existing decarbonization methodologies 1 Assess and monitor asset managers on the integration of climate risks and opportunities in their investment decisions and stewardship and reflect this evaluation in our client recommendations

With respect to our fully discretionary services we will:

Align with the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative as soon as practically possible and within two years of making this commitment

With respect to our own business operations we will:

Set emissions reduction targets across all our operational emissions in line with 1.5°C scenarios

Within the wider financial community we will:

Where suitable net zero methodologies do not exist work collaboratively for the benefit of our clients to address these challenges seeking harmonized methodologies Engage directly or in collaboration with regulators and policymakers to facilitate the transition to net zero carbon emissions addressing any barriers to our clients adopting and achieving their net zero targets

To ensure accountability we will:

Report progress by our firm against the commitments made here at least annually in public domain.

Quotes are included below from signatory firms PRI and Race to Zero.

Alex Pocock Head of Investment Consulting at Barnett Waddingham: ‘A systemic change like net zero can only be achieved by working together with other organisations ‐ to go further and faster to build a sustainable future. For Barnett Waddingham sustainability is about moving forward and meeting the needs of the present without jeopardising future generations. Joining this initiative means cementing our commitment to working with others across our industry and beyond to solve the complex systemic problems of climate change. Collaboration is absolutely key and this initiative demonstrates our collective commitment for the future; none of us can be ‘net zero’ alone.

David Vafai CEO at bfinance: “We believe that global investment consultants working closely with our asset owner clients have a vital part to play in the transition towards a resilient Net Zero economy and we are committed as a firm to making a difference. This initiative is an important milestone for us: we are making some significant changes to policies and processes as we look to deliver on commitments. A number of our clients are already very advanced in addressing issues such as portfolio carbon intensity temperature alignment and investment opportunities relating to the energy transition.”

David Druley CEO at Cambridge Associates: “Earlier this year Cambridge Associates proudly announced its global carbon neutral accreditation. As investors and stewards of long‐term capital it is also essential that our commitment to sustainability reach beyond the walls of our firm and permeate directly across our work with clients. We are lucky to already be working with several clients that are leading on the full spectrum of what needs to be done from decarbonization to investing in real world solutions and are looking forward to utilizing this expertise across our broader client base.”

Keith Guthrie Deputy CIO at Cardano: “The challenge with getting to Net Zero is that it’s a collective action problem. Net Zero is not properly priced in markets which is why it warrants attention – in other words markets are financing investments that remain profitable in the short‐term but are inconsistent with long‐term environmental goals aligned with Net Zero. The focus on Net Zero across the investment‐ value chain including advisors allows us to move the market‐as‐a‐whole and that’s why it’s helpful to set that out in writing in the form of a commitment. In other words this is a step beyond financial risk / return characteristics to focus on driving real change in the global economy. At Cardano we support the Paris Climate Agreement of limiting global warming to +1.5°C versus preindustrial levels. We do this by committing our investment portfolios to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We support global emissions reduction of 50% by 2030 with baseline year 2019. This informs our asset‐class decarbonisation targets. This is our default position – in our fiduciary management our advice and our liability driven investments. It’s for these reasons we strongly endorse the launch of the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative.”

Andrew Polson CEO at Frontier: “Collective action is vital in meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement. By joining the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative Frontier is proudly and publicly committing to develop capabilities to support our clients align their investment strategies to a 1.5C degree future while also achieving their performance objectives. While accomplishing net zero is daunting it is critical so we are determined to play our part in contributing to reducing real world emissions alongside like‐minded investment consultants and asset owners.”

Simon Jones Head of Responsible Investment at Hymans Robertson: “In joining our peers to make this net zero commitment we are sending a clear message about the role the financial services industry has to play in addressing climate change. The NZICI recognises that investment consultants are both educators and influencers and we can help ensure our clients take actions that create real world change. Our commitment builds on the climate pledge we made at the start of 2021 to integrate the consideration of climate risks into our research advice and services. Having already invested in developing both our people and the tools available to support the advice they give we will continue this thereby ensuring that our clients are properly equipped to address the risks and opportunities that the transition to a net zero economy will inevitably bring.”

Jim Lamborn Chief Executive Officer at JANA: “JANA is proud to be a part of the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative (NZICI). JANA’s mission statement is that together we have the opportunity to impact millions of people. However achieving the UN’s SDGs will require sustained international collaboration. This is why global initiatives like the NZICI are so critical. We are proud to be involved with the NZICI and look forward to working with others in the investment community to work towards meeting our universal goal of a global net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner.”

Clay Lambiotte Head of Investment at LCP: ““LCP puts sustainability at the heart of how we operate and how we support serve and inspire our clients. Net Zero is ultimately about protecting everyone’s future so working together with our clients and their investment managers is a critical part of that vision. We are therefore pleased to be supporting the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative from the outset. As part of that commitment we will be proactively raising net zero alignment with our investment clients and supporting them with practical solutions to address the associated climate risks and opportunities.”

Sarah Bernstein Managing Principal at Meketa Investment Group and Chair of the Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Group – U.S.: “Given the urgency with which climate change must be tackled investment consultants such as ourselves want to provide investment advisory services to support asset owners as they seek to implement investment strategies to help limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5 °C in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement and work to reduce our own corporate carbon footprint. We are very pleased to be a founding member of the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative. We expect our commitment to drive the development of consulting practices that will ensure an informed assessment of risks and opportunities related to transitions to net zero in the real economy are provided to Meketa clients.”

Fiona Reynolds CEO for the Principles for Responsible Investment: “We welcome the establishment of the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative. The initiative underlines the growing awareness that a move to net zero must be realised at every stage and level of the investment process. Investment consultancies have a key role to play in facilitating this shift by working with their clients to help embed ESG considerationsthroughout theirinvestment activity. The scope and influence of the founding partners behind the initiative is extensive and sets the tone for the rest of the sector. We encourage other investment consultancies to consider their involvement in positively affecting the shift to net zero and to come together to support this vital work.”

Mitesh Sheth CEO of Redington: “We are delighted to join with leading firms across the Investment Consulting industry in committing to delivering net zero advice to our clients. This reflects our own commitment earlier this year to make net zero our default advice and our ongoing efforts to embed climate change issues into our assessments of fund managers’ investment approaches and stewardship. The world economy faces a majortransition and we acknowledge ourrole and our clients’ roles in helping deliver the change that is needed.”

Nigel Topping High Level Champion for Climate Action at UN Climate Change Conference (COP26): “We are delighted to announce the launch of Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative. Assisting and advising asset owners to meet net zero goals through investment choices is crucial in meeting the collective decarbonisation targets. This commitment also cements their role in holding asset managers accountable on stewardship and product innovations. As part of GFANZ we look forward to working together to make the investment process align to net zero.”

Luba Nikulina Global Head of Research at Willis Towers Watson and Co‐Chair of the Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Group – UK: “The global transition to a net zero economy means asset owners have to develop their understanding of climate risks think about changing pathways for their assets and exercise their stewardship rights. Investment consultants play a vital role in supporting asset owners on this journey and helping them increase their level of climate ambition. I am delighted to work together with other NZICI members to make this industry wide transition quickly effectively and sustainably. We are proud to partner with the Race to Zero and the Principles for Responsible Investment to achieve better alignment across all stakeholders in the investment industry. It is only by working together that we can create a sustainable future for us all.”

Daniel E. Ingram Senior Vice President Chair of ESG and Diversity Committee at Wilshire: “Helping clients navigate the risks and opportunities unique to their portfolio and investment strategy to improve outcomes is an important part of our pedigree. As proud signatories of new Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative (NZICI) we are signalling our commitment to help clients invest for a better future. We’re honoured to collaborate with our peers on this initiative where as stewards in the institutional advisory space working together we can significantly magnify the impact we’re able to make individually to benefit investors industry wide.”

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Al Letson: From the Center for investigative reporting and PRX this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. This past July in Baltimore amid fireworks and patriotic music workers relit the famous Domino Sugar sign which was under repair. For decades this icon has cast a red glow over the city’s Inner Harbor. You can see it from miles away. Each year Domino produces millions of pounds of refined sugar for candy makers and supermarkets but if you look at their packaging it doesn’t say exactly where that processed sugar originates. Some of it comes from cane grown in the U.S. Brazil and Mexico are also big suppliers.



Al Letson: Then there’s the Dominican Republic where still today on vast plantations sugarcane is cut by men with machetes and hauled away by ox drawn carts. The work is grueling. This past month hundreds of workers protested in the Dominican capital Santo Domingo. They chanted without cane cutters there is no sugar [foreign language]. These men are from Haiti and are among the thousands of Haitians who are living across the Island’s border in the Dominican Republic. They’re demanding simple things like the pensions they were promised and better living conditions for their families. Conditions are harsh but things were even worse 30 years ago when reporter Sandy Tolan first visited.



Sandy Tolan: Walking down this dirt street and each house is surrounded by standing black water which is just human waste and garbage kids playing around this water. It’s a breeding ground for mosquitoes. It’s a really poor place.



Al Letson: In the sugar plantations Sandy met people living in work camps who’d been trafficked into the Dominican Republic and forced to cut cane. (singing). He recorded this cane cutter singing in Haitian Creole asking the spirit to lead him to a better life. In the Dominican Republic the biggest sugar company and largest exporter to the U.S. is the Central Romana Corporation. Back in the 1980s it was bought by a group of investors led by two Americans Alfonso and Pepe Fanjul. The company supplies millions of pounds of raw sugar for the Fanjul’s empire in addition to Domino Sugar the Fanjuls also have major interests in CNH and Florida Crystals. Over the years the Fanjuls and the Dominican sugar industry have come under pressure to improve the situation for Haitian cane cutters from local activists human rights groups the United Nations and the U.S. Department of Labor and they claim they’ve done just that. So Sandy decided to go back to the Dominican Republic to see for himself. He brings us this story made possible with help from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.



Sandy Tolan: Locomotives roll past undulating waves of sugarcane their green weedy tops blowing in the wind. We’re at the Eastern edge of the Dominican Republic where the train cars are piled high with cane stocks. We’re rolling into an empire a plantation of sugar nearly the size of New York City all the property of the Central Romana Corporation. Scattered across this territory work camps owned by the company they’re called bateyes.



Euclides Corder…: My name is Euclides and we are in the Carretera-



Sandy Tolan: I’m driving with my reporting partner Euclides Cordero Nuel. He’s a Haitian Dominican journalist who knows a lot about life here. Euclides grew up on a batey alongside thousands of other workers and their families part of the long history of migration of Haitians to the Dominican Republic.



Euclides Corder…: Growing up at the batey is not easy because your parents are working in the sugarcane plantation but the payment is very low. You just have food for [foreign language]. Very little.



Sandy Tolan: Euclides was just two years old the first time I came to report on life on the bateyes. Since then Central Romana says it’s poured millions of dollars into the bateyes to improve living and working conditions. We’re going to check that out.



Euclides Corder…: We’re heading towards a batey named Cacata Las Cacata.



Sandy Tolan: Cacata is a place Central Romana calls a model batey. We walk the quiet streets laid out in a grid about a mile long in total. At first we see small houses in tidy rows with dirt yards families relaxing [foreign language]. The kinds of uplifting images promoted on Central Romana’s website. A boy in his front yard singing to Jesus. (singing). But as we walk deeper into the batey we reach a grim looking line of concrete barracks-



Euclides Corder…: It’s okay. Here we go.



Sandy Tolan: And just beyond we find two cane cutters sitting on a pair of broken plastic chairs [foreign language]. Euclides greets them warmly in their native Creole and they invite us to join them [foreign language]. I’m calling the men Julio and Cardenas they don’t want us to use their real names out of fear of retaliation for talking with outsiders and that’s the case with most of the workers we meet in the bateyes. Cardenas says on a good day he can cut about a metric ton of cane. That’s 2200 pounds and that one ton gets them a little over $3 from Central Romana. The company says it pays more than the national minimum wage and younger men can cut more and make five six even eight bucks a day but not Julio and Cardenas [foreign language].



Euclides Corder…: If it’s good you can cut one ton per day.



Sandy Tolan: A lot of the sugar Julio Cardenas and their fellow workers cut ends up in the U.S. The men say they’ve been doing this kind of work for the past 40 years. They’re way past retirement age. Cardenas is almost 80 but even though Central Romana deducts government pension funds from their paychecks they say they’ve never seen one peso of it [foreign language].



Euclides Corder…: It’s not my fault I’m working because I make requests for my pension and I don’t have it-



Sandy Tolan: Unlike so many of the caneros or cane workers we meet they say they could never afford to get regular working papers and that neither the government nor Central Romana is helping them get legal status or their pensions. And so they’ve been undocumented for decades.



Euclides Corder…: They have to stay in the batey for their whole life until they die because they cannot have any other jobs.



Sandy Tolan: So every day they slash and slash under an unrelenting sun sharp stocks cutting into their hands.



Euclides Corder…: Do you feel like they treat you well the bosses [foreign language]. For me I’m not good [foreign language].



Sandy Tolan: Euclides repeats “But do they treat you well here?” Cardenas stabs his machete into the ground. He’s choking back tears.



Euclides Corder…: [foreign language] And you can see how they treat us here as a Haitian [foreign language]. Now if you have to go to the hospital you have to find your own money to spend on your sickness.



Sandy Tolan: So if you get sick what happens?



Euclides Corder…: [foreign language]. If you don’t have money you’re going to die.



Sandy Tolan: There’s so much more we want to ask them like what were your dreams when you first came from Haiti decades ago? But we never get that chance because just as we’re about to ask another question [foreign language] two armed men in uniform pull up on a motorcycle [foreign language]. They want to know what authorization do we have to talk to the workers?



Euclides Corder…: You guys you have to understand us. We are protecting interests here.



Sandy Tolan: Okay. Let’s go. Protecting interests here is paramount. By one estimate Central Romana generates nearly a billion and a half dollars in revenue every year. A lot of it from raw sugar exported to the U.S. In this vast landscape of cane and company work camps we’re learning something. Central Romana is a state within a state with a large private security force that doesn’t like outsiders poking around. Still in six separate reporting trips spread out over two years Euclides and I managed to visit about two dozen bateyes where the workers and their families welcomed us.



Euclides Corder…: Batey [foreign language] batey [foreign language] batey [foreign language] batey-



Sandy Tolan: This is what we see. Flimsy wooden houses cracked crumbling walls a mattress on a bare floor a few clothes drooping from a piece of rope darkness. In an estimated 90% of bateyes no electricity and so many holes in the roof it rains on you when you’re sleeping. Seeing all this it really hits you when you realized that fabulous modern luxury is 10 minutes away. We drive past the international airport toward the turquoise Caribbean to another property of Central Romana one that tourists know by a different name.



Euclides Corder…: Hello?



Speaker 2: Hello.



Euclides Corder…: How are you?



Sandy Tolan: Casa de Campo.



Euclides Corder…: Thank you. And which way do I go?



Speaker 3: Good morning from Casa de Campo here in the Dominican Republic. Here’s our view this morning.



Sandy Tolan: When the Fanjuls bought the sugar operation nearly 40 years ago Casa de Campo came with it. The luxury resort builds itself as the best in the Caribbean. Alfonso and Pepe Fanjul when they’re not at their West Palm Beach mansions enjoy a huge house here called Casa Grande. And the resort is a popular destination for A-list celebrities European royalty U.S. presidents. On Casa de Campo’s 7000 acres you can play polo hit the spa rent a villa pilot a yacht shoot live pigeons or [inaudible]. At the shooting range a young American fires her rifle into the clear blue sky. Her name is Elise Mordos. She’s from New York and won a free trip for two to Casa de Campo. The resort she says is very nice but she knows poverty lies just outside the well secured gates.



Elise Mordos: I think it’s pretty bifurcated because you come to the resorts and it’s safe and the minute you step outside is when you really see how people live. When you are trying to appeal to wealthy individuals you have to isolate them somewhat.



Sandy Tolan: At dusk Euclides and I are sitting on a patio at the resort at the edge of the golf course. He can’t stop thinking about where he grew up on a batey just like the ones a few miles from here.



Euclides Corder…: Really really really not too comfortable. I’m in the university. If I would not have the chance to have education I could be there cutting cane. I could. Why not?



Sandy Tolan: It turns Euclides didn’t just live in the batey with his family. When he was 14 he picked up a machete. He was starting high school and needed money for some basics.



Euclides Corder…: I went to work in the sugarcane because I needed shoes to go to school in that time. My mom doesn’t have the money. I use the shoes of my brother.



Sandy Tolan: You guys shared the shoes?



Euclides Corder…: We share it.



Sandy Tolan: That evening in another part of Casa de Campo we visit a replica of a 16th century Mediterranean village thousands of lights festoon the full Renaissance church.



Euclides Corder…: If you counted every light you’d get into the tens of thousands but you go to bateyes there’s no light no electricity and the people doesn’t have food to eat doesn’t have money broken housing and look here it’s a contrast it’s a contrast.



Sandy Tolan: The contrast here is stark and powerful but it’s something Central Romana executives won’t talk to us about. For months the company’s top PR guy repeatedly denied my requests for interviews. Though they did provide written responses to some of my questions but we still wanted a tour. So one day Euclides and I drive to company headquarters to try to talk to someone [foreign language]. No one came out to meet with us here either [foreign language]. It’s a private company we’re told but we’re invited to stay and read a glossy coffee table book about Central Romana.



Euclides Corder…: [inaudible] the story of Central Romana Corporation.



Sandy Tolan: We read about the company’s 25000 employees it’s cattle real estate and tourist businesses and how Central Romana treats its workers with “Respect.” And provides healthcare for all cane cutters and their families. When it comes to healthcare in the bateyes we get a very different picture. A study by the Dominican Ministry of Health shows child malnutrition rates are sharply higher than the national average. We spoke with dozens of Central Romana workers and with doctors who said many cane cutters and their families have limited access to company healthcare and almost never see the inside of Central Romana’s state-of-the-art hospital. Guests of Casa de Campo on the other hand get priority attention at the hospital according to the resort’s website.



Sandy Tolan: As for the medical vans Central Romana sends into the bateyes workers say they’re hard to access and aren’t nearly enough to treat their many ailments. In Batey 80 Euclides and I arrive as an after-work baseball game is in full swing in the dirt streets. The workers we meet here say they’ve gotten repeatedly sick from spraying herbicides. Severe headaches backaches dizziness nausea double vision [foreign language]. More than 30 workers in multiple Central Romana bateyes described a range of these symptoms. More than half of those cited insufficient protective equipment like ripped aprons loose fitting boots and faulty masks. This man says he sometimes sprays herbicides for a week without a working mask.



Euclides Corder…: And they don’t care about it [foreign language] and they say “Tomorrow tomorrow we are going to bring you a new one.” And they turn up here with a new one.



Sandy Tolan: He’s not the only one complaining of lax safety protocols. One fumigator we interviewed showed us how he mixes big vats of chemicals in an open barrel with a stick [foreign language]. And then we meet another worker who says he fell gravely ill after spraying herbicides. This man’s name is Raoul Jean Hervil. Raoul is 49. He migrated from the eroded lands of Haiti’s Northern Coast about 20 years ago and has worked the cane ever since. For the last two years he says he’s sprayed chemicals for Central Romana [foreign language]. During that time he was diagnosed with HIV.



Sandy Tolan: Raoul says because of the chemical spraying he also had trouble breathing [foreign language]. After a year of fumigating work Raoul will tells us he started getting the flu [foreign language] fever. Then came the rashes burning skin. His respiratory problems grew worse. In November 2018 Raoul tells us he collapsed on the job [foreign language]. His fellow fumigators took him to the hospital the public hospital not Central Romana’s where he was diagnosed not only as HIV positive but with tuberculosis. Raoul believes the exposure to herbicides nearly killed him and that his bosses didn’t care [foreign language].



Euclides Corder…: If you die it’s your problem. They don’t say anything.



Sandy Tolan: Are they compensating you at all for your disability.



Euclides Corder…: [foreign language]. Never. They don’t give me anything.



Sandy Tolan: Raoul tells us he needs a ride to the medical clinic. We tell him “Sure. We can go on Tuesday.” We return but before we can get to Raoul we’re spotted by another security guard.



Euclides Corder…: He’s a Central Romana police. He have a gun. He showed the gun.



Sandy Tolan: The guard starts following us. He doesn’t want us talking to people [foreign language]. Then he orders us to leave [foreign language]. I walk toward our truck. Euclides goes to find Raoul. We meet up at the edge of the batey. Raoul dives into the backseat face down. He’s terrified that Central Romana security will spot them with outsiders [foreign language]. Okay. So we’ve got Raoul. We’re taking Raoul to the doctor. So now Raoul is lying down in the back seat so he’s not going to be noticed.



Sandy Tolan: We try to get Raoul to his doctor but we can’t find her and by this point Raoul’s exhausted. He says he just wants to go back to the batey. Euclides and I say goodbye. We make plans to meet up on our next visit. Raoul walks off his shoulders slump as he raises a bony arm to flag a scooter. We soon discovered that the health problems reported by the fumigators seemed to go way beyond Raoul and the other men we’ve interviewed [foreign language]. Euclides and I are in the town of Guaymate several dozen men are giving statements to an American attorney and his legal team for a series of lawsuits back in the U.S.



Robert Vance: I’m Robert Vance. I’m one of the plaintiff’s lawyers in the case.



Sandy Tolan: One lawsuit on behalf of the Haitian fumigators sites chronic health problems due to pesticide and herbicide exposure. So far nearly 400 fumigators have given statements to Vance’s team for a lawsuit involving a company that sells the chemicals to Central Romana.



Robert Vance: We asked them a series of questions have you had any of the following symptoms eye irritation skin irritation vomiting diarrhea nausea stomach ache headache-



Sandy Tolan: The health problems echo what we’ve been hearing from Raoul and the other fumigators [foreign language]. Robert Vance’s lawsuit targets the chemical manufacturer Drexel but in another suit he takes on Central Romana and the Fanjul Family Corporation.



Robert Vance: Fanjul Corporation is directly responsible for the conditions of the bateyes where the caneros and the [foreign language] live to the use of the pesticides. They have never really been required to do what is ethically and morally right by their employees because no one has forced them to.



Sandy Tolan: The Fanjul Corporation did not comment on the suits. A Central Romana spokesman wrote we are very surprised to hear the workers’ claims and that all workers have the required protective equipment. It won’t be easy to hold either company legally responsible in the U.S. for chemical contamination problems in the Dominican Republic. There’s the question of jurisdiction and Central Romana won’t divulge its corporate structure or the size of the Fanjul family state or exactly who’s calling the shots. What’s more according to documents filed in the U.S. Federal Court Central Romana is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands a tax haven that helps keep company assets and ownership secret. Robert Vance’s lawsuits are facing potential setbacks and even if they’re successful it’ll be too late for some fumigators. [foreign language]. This past June Euclides and I returned to Batey 80 to see Raoul but he wasn’t there. Raoul Jean Hervil had died alone of respiratory failure in his rickety shack [foreign language]. With some friends and neighbors we went to the place where Raoul was buried.



Euclides Corder…: We just came here to pay our respect.



Sandy Tolan: We walked through a small graveyard just outside the batey and stopped at a mound of dirt. Here lay Raoul’s body [foreign language]. There’s just a stick in the ground painted white. Doesn’t have a name nothing written there.



Euclides Corder…: It’s a shame a man like Raoul who worked many years in sugarcane just buried in the dark. There is no cross make me very sad because this man worked hard and he doesn’t deserve this. He doesn’t deserve this.



Sandy Tolan: For generations workers like Raoul Jean Hervil have toiled in the Dominican cane fields. Coming up we meet a man who decided to speak out.



Father Christop…: These people live are born and die in this same paradise that they live in it as slaves.

Speaker 1: It’s the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11th but Dan Teberski isn’t interested in that day. He wants to talk about what happened the next day and every day after that. In his new podcast 9/12 Dan tells the stories of a series of characters whose lives would never be the same after September 11th. And through them we begin to realize that there are new lessons to be learned and that we just might have enough distance now from 9/11 to make sense of some things we couldn’t understand before. Stick around to the end of this episode to hear a preview of 9/12.



Al Letson: From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. We’re following a supply chain of sugar millions of pounds from the cane fields of the Dominican Republic to our breakfast table. We’re also looking at the toll this is taking on people who harvest some of that sugar. They’re Haitian migrants living in ramshackle work camps or bateyes. When Sandy Tolan started reporting on the Dominican sugar industry the situation was a nightmare. He met people forced to work on sugar plantations guarded by men with shotguns like prisoners. He also found a spark for change. Here’s Sandy.



Sandy Tolan: [foreign language]. I still carry the memory of him. A child standing barefoot under a punishing sun in a place called Batey 8 all stick limbs and sunken eyes. He was 14. It was 1991 [foreign language]. And his name was Lulu Pierre. With my cassette recorder rolling Lulu told us he’d been kidnapped at a market on the Haitian border in broad daylight [foreign language].



Lulu Pierre: This army officer grabbed me. I studied to run but he was armed. They put me into a red Daihatsu truck. There were 25 of us in the truck. I was the youngest. They sold us to this place here. My mother and father and three brothers they don’t know where I am now.



Sandy Tolan: This is just terrible. The men who grabbed Lulu as we reported at the time were part of a massive human trafficking ring aided by the Dominican military that had been going on for decades. Haitian and Dominican officials signed off on the selling of Haitian workers to cut cane in the Dominican sugar industry. The traffickers dumped Lulu in Batey 8 part of a government owned plantation. The bosses gave him a machete and said “If you want to eat you’ve got to cut the cane.” [foreign language]. But Lulu told me he couldn’t do it. When we met him he’d been fishing in the pesticide ditches beside the cane fields to try to get some food to survive.



Lulu Pierre: Today is Sunday. I haven’t had anything to eat since Friday. I can’t do this work. So I always have not to do it and see what God is going to do with me. I have to go home [foreign language].



Sandy Tolan: My reporting partner Alan Wiseman and I worked with a Catholic aid worker to try to get Lulu home. For decades I’d think about Lulu Pierre and wonder if he ever got back to his mother. So when I returned to the island three decades later I tried to find him [foreign language]. Working with reporter Euclides Cordero Nuel I looked in the Dominican bateyes went to the Haitian border [foreign language] and to Lulu’s hometown in Haiti.



Euclides Corder…: Is it possible they [inaudible].



Sandy Tolan: We heard he’d made it home but we never found him. Turns out the story we found wasn’t about Lulu it was about all the other people still living in the bateyes. As Euclides and I started traveling the country we learned of efforts in recent years to break up the trafficking rings ban child labor and hold sugar plantations accountable. Who ignited that push for change? As much as any one person the answer is Father Christopher Hartley.



Father Christop…: When I arrived in the Dominican Republic I had no idea whatsoever what I was going to confront.



Sandy Tolan: Father Hartley’s a Catholic priest from Spain. He arrived six years after my first visit and after 20 years working alongside Mother Teresa. He was so shocked by the conditions facing the Haitians in his parish that he began to speak out.



Father Christop…: These people live are born and die in this same paradise that they live in it as slaves.



Sandy Tolan: That’s Father Hartley from a documentary about the industry’s human costs but criticizing the sugar industry carried its own price. Multiple death threats.



Father Christop…: Very explicit. One of them was tell the Reverend that the day he least expect it he’s going to be found dead on a sugarcane field track with his mouth full of flies.



Sandy Tolan: In 2006 Hartley says he was forced to leave the Dominican Republic. As for his fight he just changed battlefields. In Washington he met a long time official with the State Department and the U.S. Department of Labor



Charlotte Ponti…: I’m Charlotte Ponticelli frequently known as Charlie.



Sandy Tolan: Charlie Ponticelli headed up the Labor Department’s International Bureau. One day she saw a documentary about Hartley and was so moved by his struggle that on her last day at work-



Charlotte Ponti…: I sent him an email before I walked out the door and I said “Father Hartley I’ve admired your work so much and if ever I can be of help to you please let me know.” Well he took me up on that.



Sandy Tolan: Father Hartley and Charlie Ponticelli decided to challenge the sugar industry together. They found leverage in a trade agreement between the U.S. Central America and the Dominican Republic known as CAFTA.



George W. Bush: CAFTA’s more than a trade bill. It is a commitment among freedom loving nations to advance peace and prosperity throughout the region.



Sandy Tolan: President George W. Bush backed the agreement. It had bipartisan support among lawmakers but not everyone was on board. According to State Department cables published by WikiLeaks U.S. diplomats reported the treaty infuriated a coterie of sugar barons in the Dominican Republic. One cable said Pepe Fanjul was trying to sabotage the treaty to protect his family’s sugar empire. It was ratified anyway binding countries to the widely accepted standards of the UN’s International Labor Organization. With CAFTA in place and with Ponticelli providing advice Father Hartley walked the halls of Congress.



Father Christop…: Me in Capitol Hill it was like Mickey Mouse running in the Vatican. She would be the one to tell me “Write to this senator or write to this congressman.”



Sandy Tolan: And he did something else. He filed a formal petition with the Department of Labor and to his astonishment and Ponticelli’s the Department agreed to take action. They sent teams to the Dominican Republic to report back on the conditions in the sugar industry.



Father Christop…: The U.S. Labor Department published its report which was tremendous.



Sandy Tolan: The report was released in 2013 and cited evidence of forced labor and child labor. Many of the same problems I had reported on in the ’90s. Dominican sugar plantations criticized the report and especially Father Hartley. As a follow-up Father Hartley asked Charlie Ponticelli to travel to the Dominican Republic where she saw the bateyes for herself.



Charlotte Ponti…: It was like a nightmare. Workers are walking around with rags that are falling off of them. And when you think of the money that’s made off the backs of these workers the injustice and the stupidity of it you just want to say to somebody “Why don’t you clean this up? This is crazy.”



Sandy Tolan: The Dominican government was under growing pressure to clean things up. Some big sugar companies did just that. In fact one company Father Hartley had tangled with the Vicini Group reportedly made the most progress. I saw it for myself when I toured the Vicini operation new housing with electricity and running water buses to ferry kids to school soccer fields medical clinics in the bateyes. Still the Labor Department encountered resistance within the Dominican sugar industry. In follow-up reports it said some companies weren’t fully on board with the reforms. I wanted to know which ones. So I reached out to the Labor Department’s International Affairs Bureau. They wouldn’t give me an interview or release internal documents about this but other government sources told me the biggest obstacle was Central Romana. Father Hartley was hearing the same thing.



Father Christop…: They have videos photographs interviews of the members of the Department of Labor who have regularly gone down to the plantations of the Fanjul Family had the freedom to speak out and say what their eyes have seen you would not need to interview Father Hartley.



Sandy Tolan: The Department contends that forced labor is still an ongoing problem in the Dominican sugarcane fields but officials won’t name names or share details. They say that’s not in their mandate. We sued the Labor Department to get those documents but so far nothing. This leaves us to wonder whether offending companies that ship sugar to the U.S. are getting off the hook. For its part Central Romana insists there’s no forced labor in its operations. The issue of forced labor has been getting renewed attention in recent years and some companies that export goods to the U.S. are facing new scrutiny.



Speaker 4: A disturbing new report is exposing evidence of widespread labor abuse in the lucrative palm oil industry.



Sandy Tolan: Reports from the Associated Press and human rights groups prodded the U.S. to step up enforcement of a 1930s law that blocks the import of goods produced with forced labor.



Speaker 4: Customs agents will be turning away products from China that they say are sourced from forced labor in China’s-



Duncan Jepson: This is the first time we’ve seen this and it’s pretty amazing that that’s happening.



Sandy Tolan: Duncan Jepson directs the anti-trafficking group Liberty Shared. For two years he investigated labor abuses at one of the world’s biggest palm oil producers. Finally he convinced U.S. customs officials to block imports from the company.



Duncan Jepson: This isn’t like sex trafficking for instance where the business is completely criminal and illicit. These are businesses that are public listed perhaps listed perhaps in multiple stock exchanges.



Sandy Tolan: Jepson says companies can use all sorts of social controls to keep workers trapped.



Duncan Jepson: We’re talking about coercive forces that are psychological coercive forces that are driven by debt and that’s slightly more subtle than methods of violence.



Sandy Tolan: It reminds me of the two old Haitian caneros I met at Batey Cacata. They had no papers no access to the pensions they paid into no savings. Their future work in the cane fields into their ’80s.



Duncan Jepson: We’re talking about people who have very little financial resources and therefore they are very very vulnerable and fragile to any kind of financial shock.



Sandy Tolan: For Haitian cane cutters that vulnerability is amplified by deep racism they face living and working in the Dominican Republic and these tensions go back many generations.



Eddie Tejate: The culture said that we are the children of Spain.



Sandy Tolan: Eddie Tejate is the Dominican migration expert. He says decades old racial violence and stereotypes create a racialized Dominican self-image that says.



Eddie Tejate: We are White and we are Catholic. We are not Black. We are not poor. We don’t practice Voodoo.



Sandy Tolan: These attitudes help shape policy. For years the government has resisted providing legal status for tens of thousands of Haitians and their children. Many of them were born in the Dominican Republic and are stateless. In this context Eddie Tejate says few Dominican officials are concerned about the conditions facing Haitian caneros.



Eddie Tejate: It’s very very shocking but I don’t think this is a priority for the authorities.



Sandy Tolan: Dominican officials say this is a priority. In a short statement the Dominican embassy in Washington claimed broadly that the government is making great strides in tackling poverty but provided no details about what they’re doing in the bateyes. The Dominican government’s failure to address many of the problems facing Haitian migrants means that some end up trapped. The human trafficking and child labor that I saw 30 years ago maybe just about gone but as Duncan Jepson said there’s more to forced labor than physical restraint. It can be coercive like very low wages that amount to involuntary work. Another area of forced labor is debt from which workers cannot escape. (singing).



Sandy Tolan: One Sunday morning Euclides and I go to a batey for an evangelical church service under a patchwork of red and blue tarps fitted to wooden poles. (singing). We’re with a couple I’m going to call them Efrain and Noni because they’re also worried about the risk of talking to reporters. Noni’s feeling the Holy Spirit in the church they built for the community. She paces back and forth in front of the congregation microphone in her hand leaning back giving it everything. The entire congregation is calling out clapping laughing crying giving praise [foreign language]. Unlike his wife Efrain sits quietly in a folding chair. He’s a fumigator and says exposure to all those chemicals has made him sick. And in spite of Central Romano’s promise to provide free health care to workers he says he has to pay for much of it himself. All that has pushed him into spiraling debt.



Euclides Corder…: [foreign language]. Yes I borrow money. I borrow money from people. Yes a lot.



Sandy Tolan: And so Efrain now owes 30000 pesos about $600 or nearly three months pay. Lender is charging them 10% per week.



Euclides Corder…: [foreign language] 1000 pesos. So you have to give this person 100 pesos every week. Interest yes.



Sandy Tolan: Over a year that works out to 520% interest. It’s all connected. Substandard medical care requires borrowing more money and that pushes families more deeply into debt and with no legal papers there’s really nowhere else to find work [foreign language]. Noni says “We have to pay people we took money from. It’s never enough.” [foreign language]. We spoke with more than two dozen cane workers who told us their low salaries forced them into the hands of money lenders who operate in nearby towns. Efrain told us “It’s a brutal cycle. The cane cutters are in debt until they die.” I asked Central Romana about this. A spokesman said in an email that like other companies Central Romana has no control over the borrowing habits of its workers. Noni finds all this bitterly ironic given who is supplying the sugar that feeds our habit [foreign language]. She says “Haitians make the sugar. Without Haitians you don’t have sugar.” (singing).



Al Letson: As powerful as Central Romana is there’re efforts to make it more accountable to the cane cutters and their families. That’s coming up next on Reveal. (singing).

Al Letson: From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. This week’s show is from Sandy Tolan together with reporter Euclides Cordero Nuel he spent the last two years investigating the biggest sugar company in the Dominican Republic and the harsh conditions its workers face. And Sandy’s with me now. Hey Sandy.



Sandy Tolan: Hey Al. How you doing?



Al Letson: Good. It seems like this company you’ve been looking at Central Romana has enormous control over its workers and their families. People like Efrain and his wife Noni. What makes this company so powerful?



Sandy Tolan: Well I described it as a state within a state. So of course it’s got big political connections. For example the company’s former chief executive was the foreign minister he was the country’s vice-president and he was the Dominican ambassador to the U.S. and looming over all of this is the Fanjul family especially brothers Alfonso and Pepe. They own a major stake of the company according to court records. And as we’ve said the ownership structure of Central Romana is unclear since they don’t release this information.



Al Letson: Right. I’ve seen these guys called the sugar barons of Florida.



Sandy Tolan: Yeah. But the origins of the Fanjul sugar empire actually are in Cuba. The family owned sugar plantations and fled in the late 1950s during the Cuban revolution. Alfonso and Pepe eventually settled in West Palm Beach. They bought 150000 acres in Florida Cane and their properties stretch into the Everglades and they tangled in Florida with environmentalists and labor advocates. Then in 1980s they expanded into the Dominican Republic. Then they bought the Domino Refinery in Baltimore sugar interests on the West Coast in Canada the UK. So now it’s really a global empire. And along the way they’ve become known for their lavish lifestyles. Mansions in West Palm Beach 100 foot yacht private planes fancy holiday parties both in West Palm and in the Dominican Republic.



Al Letson: In your story you talked about how Central Romana and by extension the Fanjuls push back hard against the Labor Department and other organizations that were critical of the sugar industry. So what gives them so much influence?



Sandy Tolan: Well you might not be that surprised that a big part of it is money. In addition to controlling the world’s biggest sugar refiner the Fanjuls also have other business interests and they make a lot of money from the U.S. Sugar Program. That guarantees all sugar producers in the U.S. a certain price. It fluctuates but over the years sugar in the U.S. has sold for about 10 cents a pound above the world market price and when you’re talking about millions of tons that adds up pretty quickly. For the raw sugar coming from Central Romana the Fanjuls as part owners of the company also benefit from a preferential trade quota meaning low tariffs on that imported sugar plus it’s sold in the U.S. at those inflated prices so basically they get two bites out of the apple.



Al Letson: So wait let me get this straight. Sugar producers are making tens of millions of extra profits simply because the government inflates the price?



Sandy Tolan: Actually it’s a lot more than that. One economist I spoke to Vincent Smith estimates that the net gain for sugar producers in the U.S. is about $1.2 billion annually. For the companies the Fanjul family controls he puts their share somewhere in the range of 150 to $200 million a year. As Smith says “Nice work if you can get it.” The bottom line though Al is this has all earned the Fanjuls the nickname the first family of corporate welfare. That’s what John McCain called them from the floor of the Senate.



Al Letson: I gather they put some of that money into the political system.



Sandy Tolan: Yeah. Over the last 20 years so-called Big Sugar has spent about $220 million in federal campaign contributions and lobbying and the Fanjuls and their affiliated companies and trade alliances are a big part of that. And they divvy it up. On an individual level Pepe Fanjul contributes to Republican coffers. For example he’s a big supporter of Florida senator Marco Rubio and Rubio is a huge supporter of that higher U.S. price on sugar. Then Alfonso Fanjul gives to the Democrats. Of course we can’t determine exactly a quid pro quo but clearly the Fanjuls have access. Al there’s this wild story that comes out of the Starr Report investigation into Bill Clinton Alfie Fanjul was able to get through to President Clinton in the oval office reportedly while he was breaking up with Monica Lewinsky. Alfie wanted the president’s ear about a proposed new sugar tax which of course he didn’t like and later that tax proposal went down.



Al Letson: And so what are the Fanjuls say about all this?



Sandy Tolan: Well as we mentioned earlier they wouldn’t talk to us for this story. In fact they don’t talk to the media much at all but in a short statement a Fanjul spokesperson pointed to a family foundation that’s poured millions of dollars to support education and healthcare for the cane workers and the families and Central Romana says pretty much the same thing.



Al Letson: So has there been any success in making the company pay attention to the problems you found in your reporting?



Sandy Tolan: Yes. And I want to go back to Father Christopher Hartley the Spanish priest. He was frustrated that the U.S. didn’t take more aggressive action. Then together with other activists he learned that Central Romana was seeking membership in a pretty respected industry group called Bonsucro. It promotes sustainable sugar and its members include some very familiar names like Coke Pepsi General Mills Mars and Hershey. Father Hartley and the others raised an uproar over working conditions and also evictions and Al that’s something I saw for myself widows whose husbands worked for Central Romana for 20 or 30 years after their husbands die they’re evicted. Central Romana confirmed that’s what they do. And these old women are left to fend for themselves. In any case Bonsucro rejected Central Romana’s application. Now a lot of people have never heard of Bonsucro but the companies that are members have invested a lot of time and money showing their commitment to fair and ethical trade. If nothing else the optics are pretty important.



Al Letson: So what are the companies who buy sugar from Central Romana telling you?



Sandy Tolan: Well our reporting shows that Hershey does source sugar from Domino’s Baltimore refinery which does get millions of pounds of raw sugar every year from Central Romana. Now like all the Bonsucro members we contacted Hershey wouldn’t agree to an interview or answer a lot of questions but in a short email they said they don’t tolerate forced labor or unsafe working environments. Mars told us basically the same thing but they wouldn’t say whether they use Central Romana sugar. And it gets a little complicated actually because Central Romana was recently certified by a different industry group ProTerra but there are questions about the quality of that certification how many workers the auditor has actually spoke with. And the bottom line is that Central Romana is still excluded from Bonsucro and that’s a pretty big deal.



Al Letson: Okay. So let’s say U.S. companies decide to stop buying Domino sugar because some of it originates at this plantation in the Dominican Republic. How could this impact the cane cutters and their families?



Sandy Tolan: Well there are a couple of ways it could go. After the Fanjuls were sued for their treatment of Jamaican cane cutters in Florida the entire Florida cane industry mechanized and that effectively sent the Jamaicans back home. There’s some concern this could happen in the Dominican Republic with Haitian cane cutters. Parts of Central Ramona’s plantation are already mechanized but there’s another thing that could be done. The company could improve the conditions now help the workers get the proper papers improve their access to medical care provide more buses to send children to school help them get electricity in the bateyes pay their workers more than three three and a half dollars a ton plus a holiday bonus. Some of this is happening at other sugar companies so we know it can be done.



Al Letson: Sandy thanks so much for bringing us this story.



Sandy Tolan: Hey thanks for having me Al. I appreciate it.

Anthony Roth Costanzo may be opera’s ‘outest’ and most articulate star singer. With liberal psychologist academic parents a past as a Broadway child performer and with a featured movie role as a gay teen in “A Soldier’s Daughter Never Cries” he never really had to come out. He jokes that in his gender-bendingly high voice category the straight countertenors who must come out as such. A North Carolina native who has long lived in Manhattan Costanzo has starred with New York City Opera New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera. Michael Urie could play the nimble youthful and industrious Costanzo in some TV version though the singer/producer — whose adept tap-dancing crossover cabaret rep and utterly cool music video collaborations with people like Tilda Swinton — would probably do it himself.

Costanzo had a uniquely productive lockdown during the pandemic. This summer he debuted at Santa Fe Opera headlining the world première of “The Lord of Cries” with a gay team he admires — composer John Corigliano librettist Mark Adamo and director James Darrah. Playing a mash-up of Dionysus and Dracula his personal notices were superb. Beyond praising his singing Fred Cohn wrote in Opera News: “He is opera’s reigning emblem of transgression. Costanzo has donned gender-bending robes for his environmental concert ‘Glass/Handel’ and in ‘Akhnaten’ glided across the stage naked and body-waxed.”

He has a rich local season slated starting with joint performances at Brooklyn’s St. Ann’s Warehouse this week (through October 3) with cabaret legend Justin Vivian Bond touring ahead of their new Nico Muhly-arranged Decca recording “Only an Octave Apart” a January release. In March Costanzo returns to the Met in his debut role Unulfo in Handel’s “Rodelinda.” We Zoomed earlier this month.

GCN: How did you and Justin Vivian meet?

Years ago a mutual friend told me I had to catch Viv’s act. I made a common mistake of young gays in their early 20s then (today is a very different time) in just not getting trans issues and assuming it would be a drag show. But after 30 seconds I was totally transfixed by Viv — fully self-actualized and among the best funniest and most compassionate performers I’ve ever seen. I stopped thinking “What’s their gender?” After the show I proposed myself as a guest for the next week. Feeling pain after a break-up I sang [Handel’s aria] “Pena tiranna.” Then we did “Summertime” as a duet and the audience went nuts: The combination of our voices and personalities really stoked something. As friends we’ve pondered doing a “Beverly Sills/Carol Burnett” type show; when my record company asked what I wanted to do next we went to Bard to workshop an album and had the best time. In classical music today it’s fine to be queer — unlike so many other communities in the city where people are disowned entirely for coming out and have to forge a new family which is what so many expressions of queer culture like voguing are about. I feel my artistic identity stems from that sense of queer community and it’s important to incorporate that into my work process. Classical material itself doesn’t often express that identity. Working with Viv and understanding their journey as a trans person so well articulated this project seems an expression of our queer identities: very joyful. A single called “Didos” dropped September 17 before St. Ann’s.

Tell us about your Philharmonic pandemic project.

I was walking around the fairly deserted New York masked feeling — after all the streamed stuff — the need for live music. I had a Zoom drink with Deborah Borda [the Phil’s out innovative President/CEO] and told her my idea of how to construct engagement with underserved communities throughout the city. The media mainly covered Bandwagon One where we put Philharmonic performers on a pickup truck for 81 pop-up concerts in the neighborhoods. To get 75 non-Philharmonic ticket buyers stopping and listening to our music was moving and fun. I emceed sometimes sang and also built it: design logistics location scouting permitting. In the spring Deborah asked me to do another one; I felt that creating links with extant community groups was better than repeating the pop-ups. How could we take the Philharmonic’s resources hand them to an organization and say “What do you want to do?” So with Bandwagon Two we for example asked National Black Theatre in Harlem what they wanted to do giving them a bigger (20-foot) truck big screen and stage and paying all kinds of artists they wanted to program (including one Black queer filmmaker) not necessarily Philharmonic personnel. When they proposed a memorial service for a slam poet we asked if they’d want a wind quintet to play music and they said yes — how about Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good.” So we commissioned an arrangement. That kind of partnership was very meaningful all around; we did 40 such events. My artist-in-residency with the Phil — meant to carry on these relationships — is very much about queer stuff. For countertenors the question is always: what is your authentic self? How you look or how you sound the expression of your soul in a register not perceived as masculine. There are my two winter concert groups: a differently contextualized program with Viv moving from their theater sphere into my classical sphere… plus Berlioz’ “Nuits d’été“ where the texts and performance tradition cross gender lines in juxtaposition with Gregory Spears’ new cycle setting some wonderful Tracy K. Smith texts. There will be other Phil programming like an evening [February 4] with National Black Theatre and me celebrating the complexities of identity.

So…the Bisexual Vampire God of Wine?

Santa Fe was a great experience; John’s music is fantastic very atmospheric. The piece works well but we all needed more time to figure out how to do it. It needs some cuts — as most things do when they première. I liked Alex Ross’ review in the New Yorker that really captured my experience of it and what was extraordinary in the music. There are talks to bring it to New York it’s just a question of what we can mobilize."

These proposals are part of a report on rationalisation of government bodies prepared by Sanjeev Sanyal Principal Economic Advisor Ministry of Finance after studying the structure and distribution of Railways ministry.

The proposals are wide ranging and not restricted to PSUs: bringing 94 schools run by Railways under the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghatan (KVS) upgrading 125 Railway Hospitals — most of them under-invested — through an institutional mechanism and opening these to the public at large. Wherever appropriate it suggests a PPP (public-private partnership) model for schools and hospitals run by the Railways. This will help the organisation focus on its core competence of running and maintaining the railway service.

In a recent note sent to the Railways the Cabinet Secretariat has asked Suneet Sharma Chairman and CEO Railway Board to update it on the actions taken on the recommendations in the first week of every month.

When contacted a senior Railway Ministry official told The Indian Express the report had been handed over to them just a week ago. “It has now been sent to all key departments… all these require serious discussion with all members of the Railway Board” said the official who did not wish to be named.

On consolidation of PSUs Sanyal’s report stated that both IRCON – a specialised infrastructure construction company and RVNL which implements projects to create and augment rail infrastructure capacity on a fast-track basis have similar business functions. Hence it has said RVNL can be merged into IRCON.

Highlighting the overlaps between Rail Tel a large telecom infra provider through optic fibre networks along railway tracks IRCTC a mini ratna whose core activity is internet ticketing and CRIS an autonomous society to develop software for passenger ticketing freight invoicing passenger train operations etc the report recommended that CRIS be wound up after handing over its work to IRCTC and then Rail Tel be merged into IRCTC.

The report called for setting up a new public sector enterprise to hold the three coach factories in Chennai Kapurthala and Rae-Bareli locomotive units in Chittaranjan Varanasi and Patiala and two rail wheel units in Yelahanka (Bengaluru) and Bela in Bihar. All the assets may be transferred to this CPSE and employees deployed to the proposed enterprise in a phased manner.

Between Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) a statutory organisation with complete powers of station development land monetisation and contract management and Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd a joint venture between RLDA and IRCON the Sanyal report said one should be identified as a sole functioning entity and given full responsibility.

The report also recommends that the Railways Board and the Ministry of Railways pull out of direct involvement in Indian Railway Welfare Organisation a society set to provide housing to serving and retired employees. IRWO be treated as a privately run body. Both the board and the ministry must work at an arm’s length from IRWO it said.

An officer who did not wish to be identified said many of these PSUs and bodies existed simply because they served as a parking space for officers who wished to be retained in a certain city or region. Another officer explained that in many of these societies companies might have had an objective at some point of time but their creation was also a result of departmentalism within the railways.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is because the general public hasn't even noticed the gas price explosion says Andrey Gurkov.

The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has the capacity to pump 55 billion cubic meters of gas a year from Russia to Germany Image: Jens Büttner/dpa/dpa-Zentralbild/picture alliance

The current state of the European gas market can be summed up as follows: Imagine that the price explodes but no one is paying attention. It must be very frustrating for Gazprom's bosses in Moscow: They came up with a clever way to blackmail the Europeans yet those insouciant customers didn't even notice.

For months now the Russian state-owned corporation has apparently been pursuing the goal of forcing the Europeans to issue a swift and unconditional operating permit for Nord Stream 2. Putting both strings of this new gas pipeline into full operation simultaneously would contravene EU energy market laws. Gazprom would therefore need an exemption but so far this has been denied.

To pile on the pressure Europe's largest gas supplier sold all the gas in its storage facilities in the EU over the summer while at the same time not booking any additional transport capacity through Ukraine and Poland beyond what was already contractually agreed.

Low gas reserves for winter

Consequently just a few weeks before the start of the heating season levels in European gas storage facilities are at a record low and in September wholesale gas prices shot through the roof. This was exacerbated by the fact that for several months the majority of LNG (liquefied natural gas) tankers from all over the world were shipping to Asia where prices were even higher.

DW's Andrey Gurkov

As a result Europe is heading into winter without its usual gas reserves. If it gets cold earlier than usual or stays cold for a particularly long time European heating and power suppliers will probably end up paying horrendous prices on the spot market. Alternatively they may increasingly resort to coal and oil and these would then also become more expensive. The additional costs would at least in part be passed on to consumers.

Dire warnings in the Russian media

This was the situation when Gazprom announced in early September that Nord Stream 2 had been completed. And Moscow has let the Europeans know in various subtle ways – recently for example via Putin's press spokesperson – that if only the whole of the new pipeline could be connected to the grid as swiftly as possible supplies to Europe this winter would be assured and the price would certainly drop.

If Moscow believed that in these circumstances worried European consumers would put pressure on their governments it was a serious miscalculation. For weeks now Russian media outlets have been the only ones reporting that Europeans would either freeze this winter or have to fork out a fortune. Few in Europe knew that the price in the EU for 1000 cubic meters of gas had reached $600 (€512) that it had then topped $750 and was hurtling toward $800. Finally on September 15 it hit $950 almost $1000!

Europeans ignore price increases

The general European public has completely failed to notice any of this and is therefore not playing along as Gazprom anticipated. This is especially true in Germany by far the biggest importer of Russian natural gas.

The German media has paid hardly any attention to soaring wholesale gas prices in the EU over the past few months. In particular it has almost completely ignored the recent speculative activity on the spot market. Perhaps this can partly be explained by the fact that German energy suppliers usually purchase gas under long-term fixed-price contracts so the huge price increases simply have not yet reached the end consumer.

The Nord Stream 2 pipeline was completed a few days ago

Opportunity for the Greens and the FDP

However if the looming gas shortage means more and more utilities are forced to raise prices in the near future the problem could become the focus of public interest after all. In Germany this would probably happen shortly after the election on September 26 when coalition negotiations will be in progress.

Discussions would then most likely take a turn that would not be at all in Gazprom's interest. It would constitute an excellent opportunity for the Greens who are staunch opponents of the pipeline lending weight to their demand that the project should be stopped altogether. The free-market liberals of the FDP are also unlikely to respond well to the state-owned Russian monopolist's attempt at blackmail. One or even both of these political parties are almost certain to be involved in negotiations over the formation of the next German government.

How did the EU become so dependent on Russia?

The discussion will therefore not be looking at how to issue an operating permit for both strings of the Nord Stream 2 as fast as possible – even though that would certainly alleviate the pressure on prices. Instead there are likely to be calls to speed up Germany's transition to renewable energy still further in order to reduce its obvious dependence on Russian energy supplies.

There are also sure to be questions about how it was possible for the largest natural gas storage facilities in Germany and Austria to come under the control of a Russian company that is itself controlled by the Kremlin. The first proposal may well be the introduction of a legal requirement for private storage operators to maintain a high minimum level of gas at the start of the heating period.

So perhaps Moscow should actually be pleased that Germany has been ignoring the Russian blackmail attempt. For now at least this will save Gazprom a lot of trouble in its biggest sales market which is already working to accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuels.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9ob3ctdG8tc2V0LXVwLWEtbmFzLXNlY3VyZWx5LXNoYXJlLWZpbGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Set Up a NAS to Securely Share Files,"Network Attached Storage (NAS) drives plug straight into your router rather than your desktop or laptop—and while this has some drawbacks (such as slower file transfer times comparatively speaking) this setup also has plenty of benefits.

To begin with the files on a NAS drive are accessible from any computer or device on your network and can even be made available over the web too. If you've got a family repository of music movies and photos or if you and your colleagues need access to a shared group of files and folders a NAS is ideal. There's no need to remember to keep a particular computer switched on or a particular hard disk attached—NAS drives are always accessible around the clock.

Another key benefit is data redundancy. While you can get NAS drives with just a single disk bay most have two or more slots for hard drives and these drives can be configured in various ways: You can if you want pool all the storage together and treat multiple disks as a single volume giving you a serious amount of storage in one place.

Alternatively you can have your NAS mirror the data on your hard disks so you end up with drives that are exact copies of each other—very handy from a backup perspective if one of the drives should suffer a technical failure. All of this is handled automatically by the NAS drive software so it's really simple to operate.

Many of these disk modes are referred to as RAID or Redundant Array of Independent Disks: RAID 0 in the case of pooled storage and RAID 1 in the case of mirrored disks for example. While buying multiple hard disks and a NAS unit to hold them does mean extra expense you can set up configurations that aren't possible with the hard drives you've got inside your desktop or laptop.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZmFsbG91dC03Ni1jdXN0b20td29ybGRzLW1vZGUtYmV0dGVyLXB1YmxpYy1wdnAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Fallout 76's Custom Worlds Mode Is Better Than Public Worlds,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZmFsbG91dC03Ni1jdXN0b20td29ybGRzLW1vZGUtYmV0dGVyLXB1YmxpYy1wdnAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

Large sliding glass doors lead to the covered lanai from the spacious kitchen and open gathering room while the owner’s suite features dual walk-in closets. A flexible space provides homeowners with options for personalization including the potential to add a third bedroom.

White-on-white finishes add a pop of elegance and luxury in the Prestige model. Charcoal grey cabinetry accented by stainless steel lighting pendants elevate the space while pops of emerald green in accent pillows and a velvet Franco chair add depth and an idyllic contemporary modern accent to the home’s styling.

Starting at 2483 and ranging up to 3659 square feet the Stellar home design part of the largest series Echelon offers an open living and dining area connecting seamlessly to the lanai ideal for daily living and entertaining. A spacious owner’s suite features an expansive walk-in closet while a third garage provides space for a golf cart bikes or other equipment. An optional second floor adds a loft space and fourth bedroom and bathroom.

Bold rich navy and ebony make way for lighter touches of cream taupe and cool grey in the Stellar model. White oak flooring unifies living and bedroom spaces while trim detailing in a chevron pattern displayed in white in the gathering room and blue in the owner’s suite provide added dimension to the Stellar model.

I’m not going to get in depth on why this is a big deal but I will mention what these Qualcomm/Windows devices are supposed to offer over the regular Intel/AMD built options that have been available till now: snappy and efficient everyday performance in cooler/smaller packages always-connected features longer battery life and integrated cellular connectivity out of the box.

You should also keep in mind that these Qualcomm systems are not high-performance computers but aim to offer a viable option for the average consumer that needs a highly portable device that’s always connected to the Internet.

In the last weeks we’ve spent time with an early version of the Asus NovaGo TP370QL and gathered our impressions below. This is a very early implementation months before its actual release so you should take our findings with a lump of salt. Either way the article below will tell you how the Windows 10 experience feels on a Snapdragon platform and what quirks you should expect if you’re planning on getting one of these at some point in 2018.

The specs sheet

Asus NovaGo TP370QL Screen 13.3 inch 1920 x 1080 px resolution IPS touch pen support Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Video Adreno 540 Memory 4GB LPDDR4x (soldered) Storage 64 GB SSD (soldered ? ) Connectivity Wireles AC (2×2) Bluetooth 4.2 LTE Ports 2x USB-A 3.0 HDMI headphone/mic microSD card reader Baterry 52 Wh 45 W power adapter OS Windows 10 Size 316 mm or 12.44” (w) x 221 mm or 8.7” (d) x 14.9 mm or 0.59” (h) Weight 1.38 kg (3.05 lb) .16 kg (0.35 lbs) power brick Extras non-backlit keyboard stereo speakers HD webcam

Asus will offer the NovaGo in a few different configurations with 4 to 8 GB of RAM and 64 to 256 GB of storage. We got this entry-level option for our test with a supposed retail price of $599. A higher end version with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage will be available for $799 but we don’t know exactly when these will actually be available in stores (I’d expect late-Q1 2018).

First impressions

The NovaGo TP370QL feels and looks much like one of the Asus VivoBook Flip models based on Intel hardware. In other words it’s a standard 2-in-1 laptop with a 360-degrees convertible touchscreen ports on the sides a full-size keyboard and the hardware tucked beneath it. The real goodies hide beneath the shell but before we get to talk about those let me share a few things about this laptop’s build keyboard and screen.

The construction is pretty good with a metallic lid-cover and a plastic main body. There’s some noticeable flex in the lid and the keyboard’s deck though. The former actually causes ripples on the panel when pushed firmer so I’d be careful when carrying this laptop in my bag while the latter is noticeable with everyday typing. All in all though the build quality is not bad for the mid segment but there are sturdier made computers in the same price-range.

There’s not much to complain about the aesthetics though. The NovaGo TP370 gets a dark-grey color scheme (Sky Grey according to Asus) with a few chromed accents here and there: the beveled edge around the lid-cover the Asus logo on the hood and the plastic frame around the trackpad. All in all the design is clean and simple and I’d reckon will appeal to most people.

This laptop is fairly compact and light yet not as compact or as light as some of the other hybrids out there. At 3 lbs and .6″ in thickness it should be a fairly good travel companion but I’d expect well see tinier implementation of the Snapdragon platform down the road. The bezels around the screen are fairly small on the sides but pretty hefty on the top and bottom which somewhat make this cumbersome to use in tablet mode. They shouldn’t be an issue if you plan to use the NovaGo mostly as a laptop though.

As far as practicality goes this NovaGo Tp370 shares its strong points and small quirks with the other Asus 2-in-1s. That means it sits firmly on the desk thanks to the grippy feet on the bottom but you’ll need both hands to open the screen and the edge around the interior is rather sharp but it shouldn’t bother you with daily use due to the device’s thin profile.

The underbelly gets a very simple design with just the rubber feet and the speaker cuts on the front. There are no air intake/output grills as the platform is passively cooled.

One final aspect to mention here is the IO. There are two USB-A slots on this computer and full-size HDMI for video as well as a headphone jack and some status lights all placed on the left and right edges. The novelty is however the small tray on the left side that takes a microSD card and a nanoSIM for that LTE connectivity.

Keyboard and trackpad

The keyboard and trackpad are once more similar to what we’ve seen on many other Asus laptops.

The keyboard gets a standard layout with proper sized keys and well spaced arrows. It types well but they do feel somewhat shallow and spongy so you’ll need some time to get used to the feedback. Average users will probably find this good enough for everyday use though but it’s important to mention that there’s no backlightning which is hard to accept in $600+ ultraportable these days.

As far as the trackpad goes it’s spacious and slightly indented into the frame. It gets a smooth glass surface and Precision drivers so it feels nice to the touch and it performs well with swipes taps gestures you name it. The physical clicks are stiff though at least on this early sample. A fingerprint sensor is integrated in the clickpad’s top right corner.

Screen

For the screen Asus went with a 13.3-inch IPS panel with 100% sRGB/ 70% NTSC color coverage. Unfortunately our Spyder did not work on this laptop (more about that in the next section) so I can’t share specific details on brightness contrast gamma and color accuracy but as far as I can tell the AU Optronics B133HAN05.3 (AUO532D) panel that Asus went for is about what you should expect from a mid-range notebook: roughly 250 nits brightness and 700:1 contrast with good viewing angles decent colors and no noticeable light bleeding.

That means you’ll struggle to use it in bright environments especially since this is a touchscreen and the glass on top adds a fair amount of glare but should do fine indoors.

The screen includes support for Asus’s Active Stylus Pen but the Pen is sold separately and was not included with out sample so I can’t tell you much about it. I’d expect the experience to be similar to the one offered by the existing Asus VivoBook and Zenbook Flips that support the same stylus.

Everyday experience – Windows 10 on a Snapdragon platform

OK let’s get to the elephant in the room.

Out of the box the NovaGo came with Windows 10 S the basic version of Microsoft OS that limits users to installing only applications from the Store and using the default Edge browser but with enhanced security and performance at least according to Microsoft. You’ll find plenty about Windows 10 S online all I can say is that I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro (free upgrade) as soon as I got the laptop in order to be able to install and run all the things that I normally put on a Windows computer.

There are a few reasons why you might not want to do that though. First of all if you get this basic configuration with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage (all soldered and non-upgradeable) Windows 10 Pro is going to only leave you with about 32 GB of free space on the drive (less over time) and about 2 GB of RAM available for everyday use. On top of that even if I could install most apps on this computer some of them did not launch. I could use Chrome and my favorite video player and so on but some programs will not work at least for now and that’s because they’re not all compatible with the ARM architecture. This clip sheds light on the ARM processors (the Snapdragon we have here) and how they differ from the x86 processors (Intel AMD) in case you’re curious.

Of course app compatibility is going to improve over time and don’t forget we got to play with a very early version of this laptop months before it was scheduled for retail release. Normally these Snapdragon laptops should be able to run most Windows 32bit compatible applications as Microsoft has developed an emulator that allows these x86 applications to run on an ARM platform. So far though not everything is compatible at least on this early sample. Things like Office Photoshop or even some older games worked fine on my sample although performance with these games was limited.

As far as we know right now Microsoft compiled the Windows 10 core systems to run natively on ARM not through emulation and third-party applications could also be recompiled for ARM which should translate in improved performance and efficiency when (if) this happens. 64-bit Windows programs aren’t supported yet nor are applications that use kernel mode drivers.

If you don’t plan to upgrade away from Windows 10 S you can think about this computer as an alternative to Chromebooks which work in the same way: most of the activities are browser and Internet based and you can only install apps from a store. However there are a lot more apps available for Chromebooks (at this point and I don’t think that’s going to change much in the future) Chrome is arguably a more complete browser than Edge and Chromebooks are usually affordable while a Snapdragon 835 notebook won’t sell for $300 or less.

Of course a Snapdragon 835 laptop is going to perform better than a Celeron/Pentium based Chromebook and not just on paper. In practice this Asus NovaGo feels snappy and fast even with 15+ Tabs open in Chrome some music playing the background and some Word documents. The processor is fully capable of supporting everyday loads yet you’ll notice some sluggishness with multitasking and the bottleneck is probably the amount of RAM. Chrome is a memory-hog as we all know and 4 GB of RAM are hardly enough on a Windows computer these days that’s why you’ll probably want to go for the higher end configuration with 8 GB of RAM and more storage space. At this point you’re however biting into the higher-tier of Core U premium laptops though and a Snapdragon option with limited app compatibility might not make that much sense in this $800+ price range.

Back to performance I’ve also added a few benchmarks below but don’t forget our sample is pre-production with early drivers and running on Windows 10 Pro so results can much improve by the time these Qualcomm laptops will be available for retail.

3DMark 11: P826 (Physics – 1493 Graphics – 786);

P826 (Physics – 1493 Graphics – 786); 3DMark 13: Sky Driver –1711 Fire Strike – 453;

Sky Driver –1711 Fire Strike – 453; 3DMark 13 – Graphics: Sky Driver – 1692 Fire Strike – 518;

Sky Driver – 1692 Fire Strike – 518; Geekbench 3 32-bit: Single-Core: 1144 Multi-core: 3960;

Single-Core: 1144 Multi-core: 3960; Geekbench 4 64-bit: Single-Core: 814 Multi-core: 2952;

Single-Core: 814 Multi-core: 2952; PassMark: 650.0;

650.0; CineBench R11.5 32-bit: CPU 1.50 cb CPU Single Core 0.50 cb.

As far as CineBench performance goes on this unit I ran the test for several times in a loop and got results within 1.48 and 1.50 pts with the CPU running at only around 2.00 GHz in the multi-core test and around 2.5 GHz for the single-core benchmark as you can see in the pic below.

I also ran a few browser based Javascript tests (in Chrome and Edge where possible):

JetStream 1.1 (Chrome): 79.857;

79.857; JetStream 1.1 (Edge): 80.363;

80.363; Octane 2.0: 3086;

3086; Sunspider 1.0.2 (Chrome): 2498.0 ms;

2498.0 ms; Sunspider 1.0.2 (Edge): 210.0 ms;

210.0 ms; WebXPRT 2015 (Chrome): 161;

161; WebXPRT 2015 (Edge): 167.

These numbers fall behind even an Intel Core m3 but as I mentioned earlier these benchmarks are probably not optimized for the ARM platform and thus the results should be taken with a grain of salt and not directly compared to those of standard x86 platforms.

As far as noise and temperatures go given this kind of hardware is normally used on smartphones and tablets there should be no surprise the Asus NovaGo is one of the coolest running notebooks we’ve seen lately.

It’s also completely silent as it’s passively cooled and I also didn’t notice any traces of coil whining or electronic noise.

Always connected

One of the biggest selling points for these Snapdragon powered computers are the integrated cellular connectivity and always-on features.

Regular laptops can get into sleep mode but those that are always-on capable will wake up from time to time while they appear to be closed in order to sync your apps with the cloud (mail social media etc). Think about your phone which is able to sync your messages and data while in stand-by and can still be efficient and offer days of stand-by time on a charge. With Snapdragon laptops you’ll get the same experience but longer stand-by times because they get bigger batteries inside.

Always-on features are made possible by the integration of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X16 LTE modem inside the Asus NovaGo one of the fastest solutions out there capable of transfer speeds of up to 1 Gbps. The implementation comes with a 4×4 MIMO antennae system so signal strength and performance should be top-notch (as much as allowed by the cellular network in your area of course). The laptop comes with a SIM tray but there’s also support for eSIM a technology that allows to switch between carriers when needed without having to actually swap out physical SIM cards.

The notebook also gets Bluetooth and Wireless AC (with 2×2 MIMO antennae) which performs well near the router but is pretty much unusable at 30 feet with 1 wall in between on 5 GHz.

Battery life

There’s a 52 Wh battery inside the Asus NovaGo TP370 and efficiency is one of the platform’s biggest selling points. Asus advertises up to 22 hours of battery life (twice of what an Intel Core U laptop offers) and up to 30 days of always-on standby times.

Unfortunately HWinfo and other apps that measure battery dischargement didn’t work on our sample so I can only offer you some estimates on battery life. From my tests I’m expecting around 12 hours of Youtube around 15 hours of looping a 1080p mkv file and about 7-8 hours of everyday multitasking from this computer (with the screen at around 120 nits) which is indeed a significant step-up from the available Intel based ultraportables with similar sized batteries.

Stand-by use on the other hand didn’t work as advertised on our unit which for some reason did not enter that-efficient sleep mode so I can’t share any data on this topic.

Price and Availability

As far as we know so far Asus plans to offer the NovaGo in at least two configurations all built on the Snapdragon 835 platform but:

one with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of SSD storage for $599;

another with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of SSD storage for $799.

There’s no word on availability but we do know that other Snapdragon notebooks are scheduled for late Q1 2018 so I’d reckon the NovaGo won’t come earlier. We’ll update this section once we know more.

Wrap-up

All in all I’m hyped about the potential of Snapdragon laptops running Windows 10. Yes there’s a lot of room for improvement when it comes to app compatibility and performance but even so this early sample of the Asus NovaGo shows there’s plenty to like in here.

With these Snapdragon builds OEMs are able to create much thinner designs that run cooler than their Intel/AMD counterparts but also more efficient. That aside these devices get always-on connectivity and integrated LTE modules something you normally only get with very expensive business laptops. As far as performance goes yes a lot depends on how well Microsoft manages to emulate x86 software on this ARM platform and in general Snapdragon laptops are only meant for everyday chores and casual multitasking but most people don’t ask more from their laptops anyway so performance wise I’d reckon these will appeal to many potential buyers.

Back to the Asus NovaGo TP370QL this is one of the first Snapdragon-Windows 10 implementations. At $800 for the configuration with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage it’s on par with a fair amount of laptops built on Intel Core i5 platforms but I’d expect it will get cheaper down the line. It’s expensive and one might even say limited as a Windows 10 S computer and an alternative to Chromebooks but once you upgrade it to Windows 10 Pro it makes more sense and it will be an even better solution as app compatibility improves down the line.

At the end of the day this NovaGo is a computer for everyday use and a computer for those among you that value battery life portability and a constant connection to the Internet over performance in demanding loads. It’s hard to say whether it’s a good buy or not based on my experience with this early sample and I’ll refrain from any conclusions until I actually get to spend time with some more mature versions of this Snapdragon/Windows implementation. What I can definitely say is that this is worth keeping an eye on in the first half of 2018 and next year should be quite interesting for those interested in ultraportable laptops.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVld2Fsay5jb20vYXBwbGUtaW5jLWNoaW5hLW1vYmlsZS1kZWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple Inc. Barriers To China Mobile Deal Disappearing,"Things are looking up for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s ability to cement a deal with China Mobile the world’s largest carrier. Many investors see a deal with the carrier as being an important step in Apple’s ability to gain ground in the rapidly growing market.

Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook met with the chief of China Mobile last month. The two were undoubtedly working toward the long-awaited deal that would give Apple access to 740 million more mobile subscribers.

Apple expected to release low cost iPhone

Lee Chyen Yee and Yimou Lee of Reuters report that one of the key ingredients in a deal between China Mobile and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the long-rumored low cost iPhone. The company is expected to unveil the handset next month.

According to Reuters Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s use of chips made by QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) also give it a leg up in China because those chips will work on China’s networks which are different than those found in other countries. So far the company has not signed a deal with China Mobile because it would have required that the iPhone be redesigned so that it could work on the carrier’s TD-SCDMA 3G technology.

The other big barrier to a deal between the two companies has been China Mobile’s hesitance to pay the large costs associated with subsidizing and marketing the iPhone.

4G licenses could help Apple

Chinese officials are expected to begin handing out 4G licenses by the end of this year and China Mobile could be first in line to receive one of those licenses because of its size. Those licenses are expected to be based on TD-LTE technology which by QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM)’s chips are compatible with. As such it would prevent Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from having to redesign the iPhone so that it would work on the carrier’s network.

Apple’s sales in China slumped by 43 percent in the June quarter compared to the March quarter as mid-range Chinese companies zeroed in on customers on their home turf. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s smartphone market share in the country has been almost cut in half since last year and is now under 5 percent according to research firm Canalys.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9hMTUtYmlvbmljLXZzLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tODg4LXZzLWV4eW5vcy0yMTAwL9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9hMTUtYmlvbmljLXZzLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tODg4LXZzLWV4eW5vcy0yMTAwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A15 Bionic vs Snapdragon 888 vs Exynos 2100: Best Smartphone Processor?,"At the iPhone 13 series launch Apple introduced its flagship A15 Bionic chipset that’s going to redefine the boundary in the smartphone world once again. Naturally users are excited to pit the latest A15 Bionic against the Snapdragon 888 and Exynos 2100 the two close competitors in the Android world. While Apple has maintained its pole position in the silicon market for some time let’s find out if the A15 Bionic is just an iterative upgrade or leap-frogged the competition. So without wasting any more time let’s find out who wins the battle between the A15 Bionic vs Snapdragon 888 vs Exynos 2100.

A15 Bionic vs Snapdragon 888 vs Exynos 2100: In-depth Comparison (2021)

We have compared Apple’s A15 Bionic Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 and Samsung’s Exynos 2100 in terms of CPU performance GPU AI ML and more front in this article. You can expand the table below and move to any relevant section with ease.

Specifications Table

Before we do a deep dive into the specifics of each chipset here’s a specifications comparison table for the A15 Bionic vs Snapdragon 888 vs Exynos 2100. Check it out:

CPU

Beginning with the A15 Bionic’s CPU architecture it uses the traditional hexa-core CPU design and is built on TSMC’s 2nd-gen 5nm process node (N5P). The CPU has two high-performant cores and four power-efficient cores. Currently we don’t have any information about the core frequencies. But going by last year’s specs it should sustain the 3GHz frequency for a longer time. Apple has also doubled the system cache which means the SoC now has access to 32MB SLC. That should result in much better performance.

On the other hand we have the Snapdragon 888 which has an octa-core CPU featuring the powerful new Cortex-X1 core clocked at 2.84GHz. The flagship Qualcomm chipset is also built on the 5nm process and has been manufactured by Samsung. Apart from that we know that last year’s A14 Bionic already had a lead of 30% to 40% over the Snapdragon 888. Now with the new A15 Bionic Apple claims that its latest processor is 50% faster than the leading competition. We need to wait for the benchmark numbers and more intensive tests to find the actual gap between A15 Bionic and Snapdragon 888.

Snapdragon 888

Finally talking about Samsung’s Exynos 2100 in respect to A15 Bionic and Snapdragon 888 it’s also built on the 5nm process and features an octa-core CPU. The CPU architecture of the Exynos 2100 is similar to Snapdragon 888 and the benchmark numbers prove that both are almost on the same level as far as the CPU is concerned. The GeekBench score of Exynos 2100 hovers around 1107 (single-core) and 3518 (multi-core) whereas the Snapdragon 888 benchmark scores are close to 1109 (single-core) and 3244 (multi-core). Basically we can say that both Snapdragon 888 and Exynos 2100 SoC have identical CPU performance and Apple A15 Bionic is still a generation ahead of both the processors.

One interesting thing to note here is that during the iPhone event this year Apple kept comparing its processor against the next-best competitor rather than the company’s last-gen processor which is so unlike Apple. According to Andrei Frumusanu of AnandTech it seems Apple has not been able to pull off a beefy CPU overhead this year. Hence it has forced Apple to compare its flagship A-series processor against the competition. In a SPECint2017 test the last-gen A14 Bionic was already 41% faster than Snapdragon 888. Now with Apple claiming that the A15 Bionic is 50% faster than the leading competition the difference between A14 and A15 comes down to just 9%.

Sure the A15 Bionic is still a generation ahead of the Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 but it’s fascinating to see that Apple is no longer getting a healthy 20-25% performance jump YoY. Perhaps this is the time for Qualcomm and Samsung to reduce the performance gap against the upcoming A-series chips.

GPU

Talking about the GPU the A15 Bionic comes with a newly-designed 4-core GPU (on the non-Pro variants). It is said to bring 30% performance gains against the best competition across the aisle. If we talk about the last-gen A14 Bionic’s graphics performance it scored around 132 in the GFX Manhattan ES 3.1 test and Snapdragon 888-powered devices could squeeze in around 122.

It’s a marginal difference of around 10% and with the 30% bump this year it’s safe to say that A15 Bionic has seen an improvement of around 20% which is iterative and not a meaty upgrade over its last-gen GPU. Note that we are talking about the 4-core GPU which is present on the non-Pro iPhone 13 variants in this case. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max flagships released this year come with a 5-core GPU and it is said to have a 50% performance jump over the competition.

Apple A15 Bionic has a 4-core GPU in non-Pro variants

To put things into perspective the Snapdragon 888 chipset saw an improvement of 35% in the GPU department last year. When the new Snapdragon chip drops in December later this year I think it will get close to A15 Bionic in terms of GPU performance. Not to mention the 14-core Mali GPU on Exynos 2100 has gone through a massive upgrade and scores near close to the Adreno 660 GPU on Snapdragon 888.

For example both the processors have almost identical scores in both GFX Manhattan and 3D Mark tests. And if we go by recent reports it seems the upcoming Exynos 2200 with AMD GPU has dethroned the A14 Bionic in intensive GPU tests by a healthy margin. It means when the new GPUs arrive on Snapdragon and Exynos chipsets A15 Bionic will have to face a lot of competition.

ISP

Generally Apple does not talk much about its ISP but the company has said that the A15 Bionic comes with a newly-designed ISP that does a great job with Apple’s computational photography the new Cinematic Mode feature live filters and more. The ISP is also capable of shooting 4K HDR Dolby Vision videos at 60FPS which is just amazing. Not to mention the ISP can also handle ProRes RAW footage at 4K 30FPS.

triple ISP on the Snapdragon 888

Coming to Snapdragon 888 well the Spectra 580 ISP supports concurrent HDR operations on its triple-cluster ISP architecture. This allows the ISP to collect more light and create an image stack quickly for a better shot. The Spectra 580 ISP can shoot images up to 200MP and record videos up to 8K at 30FPS.

Similarly the Samsung-designed ISP on the Exynos 2100 lets you capture up to 200MP images and two 32MP images while using a dual-camera system. As far as the image signal processor is concerned sure the hardware is essential and all three chipsets have capable ISPs. However of late the secret sauce to smartphone photography has become computational photography and advancement in AI and ML technologies. So yeah in terms of hardware we can’t say for sure which one has a better ISP than the other.

AI & ML

Last year’s A14 Bionic was capable of doing 11 trillion operations per second (TOPS) and the new 16-core Neural Engine on A15 Bionic has seen a healthy improvement and it can perform 15.8 TOPS. By no means it’s a small number but when you compare Apple silicon’s prowess on AI & ML against Qualcomm and Samsung the figure falls short.

16-core Neural Engine on A15 Bionic

The 6th-gen AI accelerator along with the Hexagon 780 DSP on Snapdragon 888 can deliver up to 26 TOPS. And the new flagship chip by Qualcomm possibly the Snapdragon 895 or Snapdragon 898 will increase the capability once again. Samsung is also on the top of this game. With the AI Engine Triple-core NPU and DSP the Exynos 2100 can perform 26 TOPS without breaking a sweat. It’s safe to say that the Snapdragon 888 and Exynos 2100 are much ahead of the A15 Bionic when it comes to AI and ML operations.

Modem and Wireless Technologies

When it comes to radios and 5G Qualcomm leads the industry. Since last year Apple has been using Qualcomm’s modem. And this year too it’s being speculated that Apple has utilized Qualcomm’s X60 5G modem the same modem available on Snapdragon 888. We will have to wait for a teardown to confirm the presence of Qualcomm’s modem inside the iPhone 13 series.

Do note that it’s a discrete modem rather than an integrated one. By the way Apple has been working on its own 5G modem for some time but it seems the in-house modem is not ready for prime time yet. As for other wireless technologies the A15 Bionic supports Bluetooth 5.0 and Wi-Fi 6.

Talking about the Snapdragon 888 it comes with an integrated X60 5G modem that has a peak download speed of 7.5Gbps and a peak upload speed of 3Gbps. It supports both mmWave and sub-6GHz bands along with Carrier Aggregation. You also get the latest Bluetooth 5.2 and WiFi 6E technology support with Snapdragon 888. Finally Samsung has developed its in-house 5G modem and it is also integrated right into the Exynos 2100 chipset. It can theoretically go up to 7.3Gbps while downloading and 3.6Gbps while uploading data. And similar to Snapdragon 888 Exynos 2100 also offers WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 support.

A15 Bionic vs Snapdragon 888 vs Exynos 2100: Which Mobile Chipset Wins the War?

So that was our in-depth comparison between A15 Bionic Snapdragon 888 and Exynos 2100. As we went through the article it’s clear that Apple is still the king of smartphone chipsets despite an iterative upgrade over the last-gen processor. Whereas the Snapdragon 888 and Exynos 2100 chipsets are putting up a fight against Apple’s dominance in the mobile silicon market. I am hopeful that 2022 will be the year the performance gap in CPU and GPU will be considerably reduced between Apple and Android devices. So those are my thoughts. But what do you think?

With a new Frasers department store coming to Derby a look inside the UK's first branch gives city shoppers an idea of what to expect.

Last month it was announced that Derbion's biggest unit empty since Debenhams closed for the final time in early May will be opening as a Frasers next year.

The store will have 127000 square foot of retail space spanning three floors - floor space enough for more than 40 tennis courts.

Inside there will be a beauty hall and areas dedicated to stocking men's women's and children's fashion from hundreds of brands as well as a Sports Direct store operating on one of the three floors.

It is part of a deal signed by Frasers Group headquartered in Shirebrook Derbyshire which will also see luxury retailer Flannels open in the former Topshop unit at the city shopping centre by the end of this year.

Derby's Frasers store is set to become the first to open in the East Midlands after the UK's first Frasers store opened in Wolverhampton in April.

With several months still to go until the Derby opening Birmingham Live's look inside its outlet in Wolverhampton gives shoppers a taste of what to expect.

The 34000 square foot city centre shop is based in the former multi-storey Debenhams building in the Mander Centre.

The store features homewares in an interactive Frasers House area of the store and a new modern brasserie-style restaurant on the second floor.

Adjoining Flannels and Sports Direct stores with separate entrances are also linked to the department store.

The store stocks more than 120 beauty brands including Christian Dior Clarins NARS and MAC as well as newcomers such as Natasha Denona and Uoma.

– The USF football team (1-2) posted its first win of the 2021 campaign with a 38-17 defeat of Florida A&M (1-2) at Raymond James Stadium Saturday night.""It feels good to get up here after a victory. It's been a long time. I told the players after the game that I was really proud"" head coachsaid. ""We've been through a lot of things. The natural thing when you go through this much adversity between last year and this year is to split up and divide. Our guys have not done that. They've stuck together. They've continued to work hard and have shown up each and every day. They're continuing to move forward. We talk a lot about grit which is continuing to move forward in the face of adversity. The guys have done that.""Freshman quarterbackmade his first start and promptly logged the Bulls' longest run of the season to that point with a 27-yard scamper and then hitwith a 31-yard completion. The first drive stalled at the FAMU 5-yard line as the Bulls turned the ball over on a McClain fumble but the offense was clicking early.McClain would go on to complete 12 of 23 passes for 163 yards and a touchdown and run for 51 yards on the night before giving way to freshman who started the fourth quarter with the Bulls leading 31-10. McClain led five scoring drives including touchdown drives of 75 and 87 yards.""He (McClain) did a good job this week"" Scott said. ""There's times tonight he made some really nice plays and there's times where he looked like a freshman. That's part of it. I've coached freshman quarterbacks before and this is the first time he's ever started a game and I think he definitely does some things that can help us offensively. He's still got a lot of things to clean up. I think that's the exciting part about him is he's got a lot of room to grow.""USF compiled 404 yards of offense including 241 on the ground led by freshman110 yards on 10 carries.

The 44-year-old quarterback threw five more touchdown passes in Sunday’s 48-25 win over the Atlanta Falcons at Raymond James Stadium. That gives him nine in the first two games to start the season a personal best and club record.

In scoring 30 or more points for the ninth straight game including playoffs the Bucs broke the old mark of eight which was accomplished twice by — you guessed it — Brady and the Patriots.

But here is the best news for the Bucs’ offense.

One day they will snap out of their funk.

They will quit messing around and leaving so many points off the scoreboard.

And after Brady beat the Falcons to go 9-0 against them in his career you were left to imagine just what the Bucs will do when they get you know good!

“What I think and I’m sure guys feel the same way is I think we can do better” Brady said. “I really do. And I think we have the opportunity.

“We’re a little loose with the ball. Some penalties at different times that have knocked us out of scoring drives. Some missed throws that I’ve had. Some missed reads. Certainly wish I had made a few better throws tonight.”

This might sound like Brady is picking nits but he’s not wrong.

The Bucs built a 28-10 lead over the Falcons Sunday and watched it shrink to a field goal until just over nine minutes remained in the fourth quarter.

That’s when Brady connected with Chris Godwin on a 12-yard touchdown pass. But it was safety Mike Edwards who put the game away by returning interceptions of Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan 31 and 15 yards for scores later in the quarter.

Maybe it was the heat the humidity or just boredom but Brady and the Bucs offense went through some long lulls Sunday.

They did very little with the football from 12:22 left in the first quarter when Brady hit Rob Gronkowski on a 20-yard touchdown pass until 14:07 remaining in the second. A similar lull came from 12:43 in the third quarter when Brady connected with Mike Evans for a TD until 9:18 in the fourth when he found Godwin in the end zone.

Two plays before Brady lost a fumble when he was sacked by Dante Fowler in the first quarter he missed on a deep throw to Evans who had two steps on cornerback A.J. Terrell. The Bucs were only 4 of 12 on third down and one of two on fourth.

The Falcons had more yards (348-341) and time of possession (33:31 to 26:29).

“We know we’re leaving some (points) out there but it’s good to take advantage when we’re doing it” Brady said. “We’re getting good opportunities and we’re scoring points and we’ve got to just keep building. We’re off to a decent start and we know we can play even better football than we’re playing.”

Makes you wonder what the Bucs offense would look like if it wasn’t all iceberg tips through two games.

Let’s admit this all sounds rather silly.

If you know anything about Bucs football fans are used to cheering only when the defense takes the field.

The biggest stars in franchise history — its only Hall of Famers — are Warren Sapp Derrick Brooks John Lynch and Tony Dungy.

None of them were paid to throw run or catch the football.

In fact at halftime on Sunday the Bucs inducted longtime defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin into the team’s Ring of Honor.

But Brady is changing all of that. Gronkowski caught two more TDs to give him four on the year. Evans who had only three catches for 24 yards in the 31-29 win over Dallas was targeted nine times Sunday and caught 5 for 75 yards and two TDs.

Photos: Bucs vs Falcons Week 2 at Raymond James Stadium The Bucs improved to 2-0 with a 48-25 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC South opener for both teams Sunday at Raymond James Stadium.

The Bucs are 2-0 and we have had only cameos from players such as Ronald Jones Scotty Miller O.J. Howard Cameron Brate and Tyler Johnson.

“I think he has a great grasp of it” coach Bruce Arians said of Brady and the Bucs’ offense. “That’s obvious. The way teams are trying to play us. He sees it early and they usually don’t break their pattern. Even when the game got tight they were still the same. And guys made plays.

“We jump out and we feel good we got them and we relax for 10 or 15 minutes. Then we turn it back up then we relax again. We haven’t played for 60 minutes yet. That’s what we talked about.”

The Bucs will need to do that next Sunday against the Rams in Los Angeles. The Rams have taken the Bucs’ template kicking their first-round QB overboard and hiring a veteran gunslinger in Matthew Stafford. They had the best defense in the NFL a year ago.

“The most important thing for me is we’ve got two wins” Brady said. “I know I can play better. I could make some better throws. I had more opportunities to make some better throws and I missed (Antonio Brown) a few times. Had some other reads I should’ve done a better job on. ... It’s a long season. It’s a marathon for all of us.”

Especially for the statisticians.

But this recent discovery is painting the 3060 a bit differently which could mean major implications involving Team Green.

According to WCCFTech a host of NVIDIA RTX 3060 cards have been spotted sporting a different GPU die: GA104 instead of the original GA106 Ampere chips.

This discovery was made by a man named Matthew Smith who works as the GPU database editor for the computer hardware site TechPowerUp.

The GA104 is a higher-tier chip than the original GA106 of the first-edition RTX 3060s. It's actually the die that's found in the RTX 3060 Ti and the RTX 3070 according to TechPowerUp.

However this doesn't mean that any 3060 with the GA104 is faster than any base 3060 equipped with the GA106 chip.

Even if the chip in these ""new"" RTX 3060s is technically of a higher tier it will still sport the same specs as base cards: 3584 CUDA cores 12 GB of GDDR6 VRAM and a 192-bit bus.

What this could mean is that NVIDIA has an extra supply of GA104 dies.

These chips might be a bit defective--too defective to be put in a 3070 or 3060 Ti for instance.

Buying these GA104-equipped NVIDIA RTX 3060s won't net you 3060 Ti or 3070 performance but they could theoretically be more stable than the lower-end GA106.

For instance overclocks and boost clocks might be maintained better due to the unconstrained nature of the higher-tier chip.

Various reports are saying that NVIDIA is repurposing these chips because allegedly the supply of GA106 dies have become a bit constrained lately. This is still likely a direct effect of the worldwide GPU shortage but repurposing defective chips is actually quite common in the tech space.

NVIDIA Repurposing GPU Dies? What Is This About?

As mentioned earlier repurposing GPU (and even CPU) dies isn't new in the tech world. NVIDIA might've been forced to do so because of supply constraints and it's actually a great thing that they're not just turning the defective chips to e-waste.

This process is known as ""binning.""

NVIDIA is not the first and only semiconductor company to do this: AMD and Intel also do it on the regular with their products.

According to Tom's Hardware binning involves categorizing silicon (in this case GPU dies) by quality and overall performance as soon as they're out of the factory assembly line.

NVIDIA makes sure that their GPU dies are designed and made to meet a certain performance standard. But specific situations can actually give a chip less-than-expected performance.

If it doesn't meet the expectations it gets ""binned"" and sold as a lower-tier product.

Intel often does this with their CPUs.

For instance an i7 chip may come out with two defective cores out of eight. To not let it go to waste Intel will then fully disable the two non-functional cores and sell the defective 8-core i7 as a fully functional 6-core i5.

These ""new"" NVIDIA RTX 3060s are still perfectly fine to get even if they're technically ""defective"" 3060 Tis/3070s. So don't worry about getting ripped off.

NVIDIA spawns a new model featuring GA104 GPU but with specs of a GA106 based RTX 3060 model.

NVIDIA reusing higher-end GPUs for lower SKUs is not exactly a new topic. Once the company accumulates a large stock of dies that cannot be sold as any other model the decision is made to supply those chips to AIBs who then sell them directly to customers often not even mentioning it has a different GPU.

An appearance of the GA104-based RTX 3060 model has been discovered by @T4CFantasy the maintainer of TechPowerUP’s GPU database. According to him this new model has a device ID of 2487.

Historically speaking GX104 and 106 GPUs often share the same pin layout which makes the transition process for AIBs seamless. There are however often small variances when it comes to TDP. For this reason NVIDIA is not allowing GX104 GPUs to be sold ’60 series’ anywhere else but China where consumer laws aren’t as strong as in Europe or North America where the product needs to be exactly as described.

The RTX 3060 with GA104 GPU would feature 3584 CUDA cores and 12GB of GDDR6 memory across a 192-bit interface. This would in fact be the first GA104 GPU with more than 8GB of memory. What this also means is that nearly 42% of the full chip is disabled which is a lot more than 7% on the ‘original’ RTX 3060.

The card with the lowest count of CUDA cores officially shipping with GA104 GPU is a mobile RTX A3000 graphics card with 4096 CUDAs. In other words anything that has fewer cores is simply of no use to NVIDIA. A question arises though what are NVIDIA plans in regard to RTX 3060 SUPER. The last-gen RTX 2060 SUPER featured TU104 GPU whereas the non-SUPER was TU106 based. With the Ampere series though NVIDIA still has 7% of GA106 GPU to use for the higher-end model.

4 Reviews

During Zenimax’s livestream presentation on updates for The Elder Scrolls Online the company made an interesting announcement about a new NVIDIA technology - Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing (DLAA). The new anti-aliasing tech will debut in The Elder Scrolls Online and builds on DLSS’s AI-powered approach minus the upscaling focusing entirely on image quality instead.

During the livestream event ESO’s Creative Director Rich Lambert had this to say about DLAA: “What you get is absolutely incredible anti-aliasing. It's unbelievable it's crazy how good it is.”

While details about DLAA are scarce on the ground the Zenimax presentation makes it likely that fundamentally we’re looking at DLSS running at native resolution. DLSS works by comparing frames rendered at a sub-native resolution to a “ground truth” training sample with 64x supersampling. This means that reconstructed DLSS images especially in Quality Mode already offer high-quality AA since the image is reconstructed from a supersampled reference point. With DLAA it’s likely that we’re looking at something similar except that the AI algorithm has a full-resolution base image to work with meaning even better image quality.

This means that DLAA would be a great fit in games like Doom: Eternal Necromunda: Hired Gun and ESO where framerates without DLSS/DLAA are already very high. DLAA could then up image quality without the massive performance hit of brute-force techniques like sparse-grid supersampling.

The announcement came a few hours ago during the developer's latest ESO Live stream where Zenimax detailed the upcoming Deadlands zone DLC and the base Update 32. With this new patch Elder Scrolls Online will receive DLSS support which will be useful for the lower end RTX graphics cards to get better performance; however the high-end GeForce RTX GPUs have already run Elder Scrolls Online at a very high frame rate since the latest optimization patch and they'll now be able to use NVIDIA DLAA instead. This is essentially DLSS minus the upscaling part which means it'll be focused entirely on quality instead of performance.

Creative Director Rich Lambert said:

While we were working on adding NVIDIA DLSS we also worked with them on some new tech that we're going to be the first game that's ever done this before. This is debuting their new tech which is called NVIDIA DLAA. It's the same kind of concept you won't get a performance boost out of this but what you get is absolutely incredible anti-aliasing. It's unbelievable it's crazy how good it is.

Alex Tardif Zenimax Online's Lead Graphics Engineer (whom we recently interviewed) explained on Twitter:

https://twitter.com/longbool/status/1438973492620312578

This sounds like it would be a great option for any game that already runs at a high frame rate. Unfortunately we didn't get any preview for NVIDIA DLAA from the ESO Live stream but the feature should be available soon on Elder Scrolls Online's Public Test Server. We'll certainly check it out as soon as possible and capture some footage.

Beyond this exciting announcement Zenimax also announced a series of quality-of-life features coming to the game with Update 32 chiefly the Armory which is going to allow players to easily swap character build loadouts including skills attributes equipment and Champion Points.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5tZS5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtZWxkZXItc2Nyb2xscy1vbmxpbmUtd2lsbC1iZS10aGUtZmlyc3QtZ2FtZS10by11c2UtbnZpZGlhcy1kbGFhLXVwZ3JhZGUtMzA0OTA2M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Elder Scrolls Online' will be the first game to use Nvidia's DLAA upgrade,"The Elder Scrolls Online will be getting a makeover this year as the MMO will be the first game to use Nvidia‘s DLAA (Deep Learning Anti Aliasing) software to improve how Tamriel looks.

As well as DLAA The Elder Scrolls Online will additionally be receiving DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) support. DLAA will first be tested in the public test server and will be available in update 32 alongside DLSS.

DLSS allows players to render the game at a lower resolution and then uses AI to upscale how everything looks meaning that users should get a performance boost without affecting how DLSS-enabled games look.

Meanwhile DLAA uses the same AI upscaling system but does not require a lower-resolution input. This means that while it can be more intensive to run games should look significantly better.

Speaking on a livestream two days ago (September 17) creative director Rich Lambert confirmed that DLAA would allow for “incredible anti-aliasing”. In terms of requirements Lambert said that “you need the RTX 2000 or RTX 3000 series cards in order to take advantage” of DLAA.

As spotted by PC Gamer lead graphics engineer Alex Tardif described the addition of DLSS as a “welcome lift to our now seven-year-old MMO” and stated that because those with RTX cards are running The Elder Scrolls Online “at high FPS already” DLAA works well to make the game look a bit better.

Tardif added that DLAA is “not something every game would need but for ESO it just made sense”.

Should Merck worry?,"In the increasingly crowded market for immunotherapy in newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer Regeneron and Sanofi hope to expand Libtayo into a broader population with a chemo combo regimen. And now they've turned up competitive data that could pressure entrenched players Merck & Co. and Bristol Myers Squibb.

Libtayo used on top of platinum doublet chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by 29% over chemo alone in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer according to data released at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2021 virtual congress.

The 29% improvement in patient survival may not seem so impressive especially after Keytruda put up a massive 51% risk reduction. But a closer look at the results as offered by Regeneron and Sanofi could give rivals Merck and Bristol Myers pause.

The phase 3 Empower-Lung 3 trial included both squamous (43%) and nonsquamous (57%) NSCLC patients all without actionable mutations. The Libtayo-chemo combo extended patient survival to a median 21.9 months versus 13 months for the solo chemo group.

Difficult comparison looks good for Libtayo

By contrast in Keytruda’s historic Keynote-189 trial where the Merck PD-1 posted the 51% death risk reduction at an interim analysis Keytruda and chemo prolonged survival for nonsquamous patients to about 22 months whereas the control group recorded 10.6 months at final analysis. Then in the Keynote-407 trial squamous patients who took Keytruda and chemo lived a median 15.9 months compared with 11.3 months for solo chemo leading to a death risk reduction of 36% at interim.

Notice the difference? Libtayo’s overall survival showing across disease subtypes looked very similar to Keytruda’s at its best in the nonsquamous group and the chemo arm appeared to have performed better in Empower-Lung 3 than in the Keytruda trials.

Regeneron entered the study expecting to see about 12 months of median overall survival for the chemo group Israel Lowy senior VP of translational and clinical sciences of oncology at Regeneron told Fierce Pharma in an interview.

Still one can't conclude that Libtayo is necessarily better than Keytruda because there's an important difference between the studies: Empower-Lung 3 enrolled both advanced (stage 3) and metastatic (stage 4) patients while the Keytruda trials only included stage 4 disease. In the Libtayo trial 15% of patients had inoperable locally advanced disease not eligible for definitive chemoradiation.

But Lowy argued that including those earlier-stage patients didn’t push up Libtayo’s survival performance. According to him advanced patients who aren’t eligible for surgery or chemoradiation have large tumor masses so they don’t necessarily do better than patients with small metastases. He did notice however that relative to the nonsquamous population the squamous group appeared to have done better for Libtayo compared with results seen in other trials.

A more straightforward comparison could be made with Opdivo whose use alongside Bristol’s CTLA-4 inhibitor Yervoy and chemo snagged their front-line NSCLC approval last May.

In the CheckMate 9LA trial the Opdivo-Yervoy-chemo cocktail cut patients’ risk of death by 31% over chemo. Patients with recurrent or stage 4 disease who took the Bristol regimen lived a median 14.1 months versus 10.7 months for chemo at an interim analysis. The trial also recruited both squamous (31%) and nonsquamous (69%) subtypes.

One weak point for Libtayo-chemo lies in the PD-L1-negative group. In a subgroup analysis patients with PD-L1 expression below 1% who make up about one-third of the total trial population performed similarly between the Libtayo regimen and solo chemo in terms of overall survival. Although the trial isn’t powered to statistically perform that analysis the number could spell trouble for Libtayo potentially for PD-L1 nonexpressers. (Graphic for subgroup analysis can be found at the bottom of the article)

The Libtayo trial used a different companion diagnostic (SP263) than in the Keynote trials Petra Rietschel M.D. Ph.D. Regeneron’s executive director of immuno-oncology clinical development wrote in a post on ESMO’s online platform during Libtayo’s presentation. “The difference in results might be due to SP263 being more sensitive and identifying a truly negative subset” she wrote.

Cross-trial comparisons can be difficult given different trial designs. But the new data at least showed Libtayo can be competitive in front-line NSCLC. With the 22-month overall survival data Regeneron’s “sales reps will have plenty of firepower when detailing Libtayo as a viable anti-PD-1 option in 1L NSCLC” Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond wrote in an August note to investors.

It takes more than data

But as Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer noted in an August report “it will take more than clinical data alone to gain a foothold in 1L NSCLC.” He didn’t yet see a niche market for Libtayo but said he would keep an eye on the companies’ commercialization plans including potential discounting.

Thanks to an FDA nod in February Libtayo monotherapy is already allowed for front-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high levels of PD-L1 expression—50% or more. That population according to Lowy makes up about 30% of the NSCLC pool.

“We’re under no illusion that we’re suddenly going to take over the market” Lowy said. “But we do believe that when one looks across different agents and you ask yourself the question of which one of these have delivered consistent results again and again with either monotherapy or chemo combination we’re one of only two agents that have done that.”

Keytruda is the other PD-1/L1 that also succeeded as a monotherapy in PD-L1-high NSCLC.

Libtayo’s launch in lung cancer is progressing well according to Regeneron. “Lung cancer thought leaders recognized Libtayo’s clinical differentiation highlighting the rapid response rates and efficacy in patients with clinically stable brain metastases or high PD-L1 expression” Regeneron’s commercial chief Marion McCourt said during a conference call in early August.

The Empower-Lung 3 trial also has a second part that pairs Libtayo with Yervoy and chemo in patients with PD-L1 expression at lower than 50%. Lowy said the company started the trial amid a general excitement over CTLA-4 inhibitors' potential boosting effect on PD-1 blockade.

But as data mature “if you have a good anti-PD1 plus standard chemotherapy it’s hard to convince yourself that combinations including CTLA-4 to date really do better than that and it sometimes comes with the cost of additional toxicities associated with CTLA-4” he said. So the company has stopped that cohort early pending readout and doesn’t plan to seek regulatory approvals with it he added.

More competitors are on the horizon. AstraZeneca recently reported that its combination of Imfinzi its investigational CTLA-4 agent tremelimumab and chemotherapy cut the risk of death by 23% over chemo alone in previously untreated stage 4 NSCLC.

Eli Lilly and its Chinese partner Innovent Biologics have an application under FDA review for China-approved PD-1 inhibitor Tyvyt in a combo with Lilly’s own Alimta and platinum chemo for newly diagnosed nonsquamous NSCLC.

Looming competition from potentially cheaper China-made drugs could shift the discussion around checkpoint inhibitors to choosing between “data-led” products like Keytruda and “fairly priced” newcomers Bernstein analyst Rony Gal recently observed. In a letter to Regeneron CEO Len Schleifer he called on the U.S. pharma to play the price card first to gain a firmer foothold for Libtayo.

But as with so many other simple pleasures in the age of Covid-19 nothing is that simple for Brown. The 47-year-old Missouri resident takes immunosuppressant medication for lupus. Consequently her body has mounted virtually no antibody response to the coronavirus vaccine – leaving her in persistent peril.

Brown is among the estimated 3% of American adults who have immunosuppression including transplant recipients and people with cancer and autoimmune disorders such as lupus.

For these millions a vaccine-fueled sense of springtime liberation quickly plummeted into a summer of discontent after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the vaccine might not protect them. They and their household members were advised to go right back to masking and social distancing. Last month the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared an extra vaccine dose for many.

“With my immune system I’m terrified of getting Covid” said Brown who lost an uncle to the disease and knows immunosuppression increases her own chances of severe illness and death from Covid.

So Brown was immediately intrigued when her rheumatologist at Washington University in St Louis where she works as a laboratory technician told her the FDA could soon grant emergency authorization for immunocompromised people to receive preventive injections of monoclonal antibodies.

“I trust the scientists and I feel like I don’t have a choice” Brown said of the prospect of receiving antibodies as pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP against Sars-Cov-2. “It’s a no-brainer for me.”

Brown’s rheumatologist Alfred Kim said his immunocompromised patients “are frustrated because they’re seeing the world open up – maybe in some places too fast – and they can’t”.

Consequently he said their interest in antibody PrEP is “very high”.

“Ultimately there will be a large group of immunocompromised people who will not mount a protective response with vaccines” said Dorry Segev an epidemiologist and transplant specialist at Johns Hopkins University who is leading a major study of extra vaccine shots for this population.

“For them monoclonal antibodies as PrEP will likely be their best and possibly only chance for robust protection.”

Regeneron’s dual-antibody cocktail Regen-Cov which is covered by the federal government at $2100 per dose has emergency authorization for treatment of non-hospitalized patients within 10 days of Covid symptom onset. These antibodies which remain effective against Delta have proven powerful at reducing the risk of severe Covid hospitalization and death.

In August the FDA granted further emergency authorization to Regeneron’s cocktail for use as post-exposure prophylaxis or PEP. Unvaccinated or immunocompromised people at risk of severe Covid who have been in close contact with someone who tested positive can receive a preventive infusion or subcutaneous injection of Regen-Cov ideally within four days of exposure.

In the study supporting this authorization participants were evenly randomized to receive a single injected dose of Regen-Cov or a placebo within 96 hours of a household member’s coronavirus diagnosis. The New England Journal of Medicine reported that of 1505 participants who initially tested negative for Sars-Cov-2 the antibody injection lowered their risk of symptomatic infection by 81% over four weeks.

Regeneron is in talks with the FDA about securing emergency authorization for Regen-Cov as PrEP. The protocol would probably entail monthly injections; the cocktail’s half-life is approximately that long. Unvaccinated and immunocompromised individuals are already allowed to follow that protocol under the FDA’s PEP authorization provided they live or work in an institutional setting such as a nursing home or prison where ongoing coronavirus exposure is expected.

AstraZeneca plans to apply for authorization this fall for its own prophylactic antibody cocktail – one that might provide as long as 12 months of protection. The company has contingent agreements with the US government to provide up to 700000 doses.

On 20 August AstraZeneca announced preliminary non-peer-reviewed results from an advanced trial of its cocktail as PrEP among 5172 initially unvaccinated and coronavirus-negative participants. The study which randomized a third of participants to receive a placebo is ongoing in the US and Europe. Thus far a single intramuscular injection of the antibodies reduced symptomatic Covid risk by 77% compared with the placebo during the first one to five months of a planned 15 months of follow-up.

None of those who got the antibody cocktail called AZD7442 have developed severe Covid or died compared with three severe cases and two deaths in the placebo group.

Howard J Huang a transplant pulmonologist at Houston Methodist hospital said: “For individuals with weakened suppressed or no immune response to vaccination” prophylactic antibody injections offer “a realistic alternative to perpetual isolation and risk for serious illness or death from Covid-19”.

Calling PrEP “a ray of hope” for his immunocompromised patients Huang maintains such a confident outlook even though such individuals have only comprised 1.5% to 4% of the study populations in the key treatment and prevention trials of these antibodies.

Myron Cohen a top coronavirus antibody researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a leader of the prophylactic Regen-Cov study said he “saw no reason to believe” immunosuppression would lessen the antibodies’ preventive power.

“They’ve proven very safe” Cohen said of the cocktails adding that he expects the FDA to authorize at least one as PrEP and that the pipeline for coronavirus antibody prophylactics is robust. “There are really no predictable side-effects from these drugs.”

Cohen stressed that PrEP would be meant to complement not replace vaccination.

‘I felt this huge relief’

As a public health strategy PrEP has already revolutionized HIV prevention over the past decade. Some 300000 HIV-negative Americans currently take antiretroviral pills that when taken daily nearly eliminate their risk of contracting that virus.

A rare early bird to the eagerly anticipated prophylactic revolution on the Covid front is Sheila Portington a British expat and kidney transplantee living in Bolton Landing New York. She suffered devastating anxiety after learning through participation in Segev’s study that she had no antibody response to the coronavirus vaccine.

“Your whole life just completely changes when you suddenly realize these vaccines aren’t working for you” said Portington 68. “I can’t even tell you how scary it is.”

Her nephrologist spent numerous hours securing her Regen-Cov as PrEP under compassionate use. She got her first monthly dose in August.

“The difference this made to me mentally is absolutely amazing” said Portington now comfortable planning a long-delayed visit to family in England. “When I stepped out of the doctor’s office I felt this huge relief.’”

Janet Handal 70 is a transplant recipient and New York City consultant who founded a 540-member Facebook group for immunocompromised people and an associated advocacy organization.

She said: “What people are looking for is to be able to resume a normal life and to go out in the community go to concerts eat indoors.”

Shantay Brown said PrEP would allow her to attend those all-important Ohio State games with greater confidence and ease. But she acknowledged that antibody injections wouldn’t make her invincible. So she said she would remain vigilant and keep her mask on.

The unvaccinated activist 28 claimed she had body aches and nausea.

She wrote on Gettr - a social media platform created by former Trump spokesperson Jason Miller: 'Just pray for me please. Can't even begin to explain how brutal the body aches and nausea that come with covid are. I am in so much pain. This is honestly the worst part about it.'

She told fans on the conservative social media platform that she has a fever chills a runny nose sore throat nausea severe body aches and feels like she 'got hit by a bus.'

She later wrote on her Telegram page that she has taken Regeneron Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine or HCQ to treat her symptoms.

Right-wing activist Laura Loomer has contracted COVID-19 telling her fans she feels like she 'got hit by a bus' but doesn't plan on getting the vaccine

Loomer revealed she'd contracted COVID-19 and asked people to pray for her

In December 2020 Loomer said that a bad bout of food poisoning was more life-threatening than COVID-19

More than what she bargained for: Loomer claimed earlier this year that getting COVID-19 wasn't as bad as food poisoning from 'bad fajitas' and she hope she would get the virus to prove it

She also said she hopes to 'be ivermectin soon too' which is used to treat roundworm in humans.

Several studies have found these drugs are ineffective treatments for COVID-19 and patients are advised against using it.

Hydroxychloroquine which can cause heart problems is commonly paired with Azithromycin which the US National Library of Medicine advises to only use for community-acquired pneumonia.

Regeneron one of the experimental drugs former President Donald Trump used when he caught the virus is only effective when the virus is detected early and prescribed by a doctor according to the Dallas Morning News.

Previously Loomer had said she wanted to contract the virus simply to prove it was no worst than a case of food poisoning from 'bad fajitas.'

She claimed that she was hospitalized for food poisoning because she was 'so dehydrated' and could 'barely breath.'

She justified it as worse than the virus that has killed more than 670000 people because 'people get COVID and don't even know they have COVID.'

Loomer reported she had fever chills a runny nose sore throat nausea and severe body aches after testing positive for COVID-19

Loomer has continuously made anti-vaccine comments across Gettr and Telegram. She questioned the validity of vaccines and suspected it will 'have killed more people than COVID'

An estimated 20 to 30 per cent of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic according to UC Health.

Loomer also claimed the virus to be the 'biggest hoax of our lives besides the 2020 election' and warned others 'you can't escape the vaccine propaganda.'

She told her fans she does not plan on getting the vaccine even after contracting the virus because she claimed she will have 'natural immunity.'

'I have COVID and I don't regret not taking the vaccine. I will never take the vaccine. I will now have natural immunity Regeneron antibodies and within a few days of rest along with my ZPACK the HCQ combined vitamin supplements (zinc C D NAC) and hopefully some ivermectin soon I'm confident I will have a speedy recovery' she wrote on Telegram.

More than 60 per cent of the US has been vaccinated against the coronavirus.

COVID-19 cases are on the rise in the US due to the highly contagious delta variant.

The US currently has an almost 149000 weekly average of new cases and the death toll has reached 673000.

More than 670000 Americans have died of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic

More than 41.7 million Americans have contracted COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic

Moderna President Stephen Hoge said the Delta variant 'is just so good at infecting people' that 'raises the bar' for good vaccines he told CNBC.

Breakthrough cases are popping up due to the variant which was once thought nearly impossible.

Booster shots are slowly becoming available across the US with Modern Family star Sarah Hyland who suffers from kidney problems and is immunocompromised receiving hers.

LOS ANGELES — Robert A. Durst the enigmatic real estate scion who evaded criminal suspicion for half his life only to become a national sensation after damaging admissions were aired in a 2015 documentary on HBO was convicted on Friday in the execution-style murder of a close confidante more than 20 years ago.

The verdict which came after about seven and a half hours of deliberations was the latest act in a case that spanned almost four decades. It began in the wealthy precincts of New York with the mysterious disappearance of Mr. Durst’s first wife Kathie in 1982 and concluded with his conviction for the killing two decades ago of Susan Berman a friend who prosecutors said helped him cover up his wife’s disappearance and death.

Mr. Durst a frail 78-year-old millionaire who sat through the trial in a wheelchair was convicted of first-degree murder and faces a life sentence with no option for parole. A judge is scheduled to sentence him in October.

The jury also found that special circumstances had been proven in connection to the death of Ms. Berman determining that Mr. Durst had been “lying in wait” for her and that he had been “killing a witness” because he feared she would reveal what she knew about the disappearance of his wife.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGNvYXN0am91cm5hbC5jb20vTmV3c0Jsb2cvYXJjaGl2ZXMvMjAyMS8wOS8xOC9yb2JlcnQtZHVyc3QtY29udmljdGVkLW9mLW11cmRlcmluZy1jb21taXR0ZWQtd2hpbGUtbGl2aW5nLWluLWh1bWJvbGR00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Durst Convicted of Murder Committed While Living in Humboldt,"click to enlarge Courtesy of HBO

Multimillionaire real estate heir Robert Durst who appeared in the documentary series The Jinx has been found guilty of murdering his best friend.

Durst 78 now faces up to life in prison for the killing of Susan Berman in 2000. It's the first homicide conviction for a man suspected of killing three people over a 39 year period.

Los Angeles County prosecutors called Durst a ""narcissistic psychopath"" who killed Berman in an attempt to cover up the disappearance of his wife Kathleen McCormack Durst in New York in 1982.

The nine-woman three-man jury deliberating for seven and a half hours over three days before reaching their verdict.

Superior Court Judge Mark Windham who oversaw the trial set a date of October 18 for sentencing.

Durst was only on trial for killing Berman in California but prosecutors argued he murdered three people; his missing wife Berman and a neighbour in Texas who discovered his identity at a time when Durst was hiding from the law.

Despite long being a suspect in the disappearance of his wife a 29-year-old medical student Durst was never charged.

Prosecutors said he killed her then decided to kill Berman 18 years later because she had told others that she helped Durst cover up the crime.

Defence lawyers portrayed Durst a frail cancer survivor who uses a wheelchair as a ""sick old man"" who claims is on the autism spectrum.

They noted prosecutors who questioned him for nine days of cross examination were unable to produce forensic evidence linking Durst to the murder of Berman 55 who was shot in the back of

her head inside her Beverly Hills home.

The trial came six years after Durst's apparent confession in the HBO television documentary series ""The Jinx"" in which Durst was caught on a hot microphone in the bathroom saying to himself ""What the hell did I do? ... Killed them all of course.""

In 58 days spread over a year and half including a one-year suspension after the trial began due to the coronavirus pandemic prosecutors presented mountains of circumstantial evidence pointing toward Durst who testified that he discovered Berman's murdered body when he went to visit her but did not call police.

The prosecution also delved into the 2001 death and dismemberment of Morris Black who was Durst's neighbour in Galveston Texas.

A jury acquitted Durst of murder even though he admitted he chopped up Black's body and dumped it in Galveston Bay.

In Texas and again in the Los Angeles trial Durst testified that Black pulled a gun on him and was shot accidentally when the two men wrestled over the firearm in the millionaire's apartment.

Image: X00051) X00051)

California prosecutors argued Durst murdered Black because Black discovered Durst's identity and Durst feared Black would turn him in.

At the time Durst was using an assumed name and disguising himself as a mute woman because he feared he might be arrested by New York investigators who had reopened the case of his missing wife.

Black's death marked the second time Durst had a dead body at his feet according to his own testimony.

In the deaths of both Black and Berman Durst said he at first tried to call the 911 emergency number but later decided against it fearing nobody would believe he was not guilty.

Durst testified from a wheelchair usually in a jail uniform but also wearing a baggy suit jacket that would have fit properly in his younger more robust days.

His voice weakened by esophageal cancer he sounded different from the man with a confident New York accent that jurors saw in ""The Jinx.""

Hard of hearing he would often read a simultaneous transcription of the questions on a tablet.

Lead defence attorney Dick DeGuerin attempted to cast doubt on the ""killed them all"" audio by arguing it was edited and had been kept by the filmmakers for years before it was turned over

to the authorities.

Durst said the mic failed to record him say ""They'll all think I"" before uttering ""killed them all.""

Besides ""The Jinx"" audio two other pieces of evidence appeared to damage Durst's defence.

One was the recorded 2017 testimony of Nick Chavin a mutual friend who said Durst admitted to him in 2014 that he had killed Berman.

""I had to. It was her or me. I had no choice"" Chavin recounted Durst telling him one night after dinner at a New York City restaurant.

Durst also admitted he authored a handwritten letter to Beverly Hills police with the word ""cadaver"" and Berman's address directing them to her undiscovered body.

The killer had denied writing the note for 20 years but relented before testimony began faced with evidence the note was his.

Durst is the grandson of Joseph Durst and son of Seymour Durst who built The Durst Organization into one of New York City's premier real estate companies which has developed some of Manhattan's signature skyscrapers.

Robert Durst long ago left the company now run by his estranged brother Douglas Durst who testified at trial and said of his sibling: ""He'd like to murder me."""

Stu Foord the owner of Elevate Hype and Sport on Ross Road has only been open for a few months. The former CFL running back was shocked when he woke up to missed calls from the police saying there was a break in through the ceiling of his shop between the hours of 3 and 4 a.m.

""They came in through the roof scaled around in the roof until they found a spot to puncture through the indoor ceiling. They grabbed some garments and other items from our store and made their way out the back door” described Foord.

Fortunately for Foord police were on a routine patrol of the area shortly after the thieves exited the building. When officers approached the crooks dropped most of the stolen goods and ran.

""Some of the items were recovered so we’re super happy about that” explained Foord.

He understands times are tough right now for everyone and isn’t upset but wants the suspects to come forward.

The store will reopen Saturday after being closed Friday to allow for the police to investigate.

Foord heaped praise upon the RCMP grateful they managed to recover some of the stolen items and that the situation wasn’t worse.",,,,,,
RCL,Royal Caribbean Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi12cy1jYXJuaXZhbC1jcnVpc2UtbGluZS13aGF0LWFyZS10aGUtZGlmZmVyZW5jZXMvNTY0MTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean vs. Carnival Cruise Line: What Are the Differences?,"Considering taking a cruise but not too familiar with all the various cruise lines? You may find yourself debating between Royal Caribbean and Carnival. Both are incredibly popular cruise lines but both are very different.

While Carnival Cruise Line is more affordable and known for its family-friendly amenities Royal Caribbean offers family-friendly amenities but with more of a luxurious feel and a “wow” factor.

Itineraries differ as well with Carnival offering more U.S.-based sailings and Royal Caribbean sailing to more destinations outside of the United States.

To help you pick the best cruise line for your next vacation we’re breaking down everything you need to know about Royal Caribbean vs. Carnival.

Fleet Size

When it comes to fleet size both of the major cruise lines are pretty well matched but in recent years Royal Caribbean has pushed ahead with more new ships joining the fleet. Carnival Cruise Line has 25 ships and Royal Caribbean International has 26.

Carnival has a few older ships with its oldest being the Carnival Elation built in 1998 but it also offers a few newer ships too with its newest ships such as the Excel class of Mardi Gras Carnival Celebration and Carnival Jubilee.

Royal Caribbean on the other hand has a slightly younger fleet with its oldest ship Grandeur of the Seas being built in 1996.

In terms of ship sizes the two cruise lines are well-matched there too. Carnival’s smallest ships are its Fantasy-class vessels which hold just over 2000 passengers while its largest ship is the Mardi Gras which holds just over 5000 passengers.

Similarly Royal Caribbean offers smaller ships in its Vision class with capacities hovering around 2000 people. Royal Caribbean’s largest ship as of July 2023 is Wonder of the Seas which has a gross tonnage of 236600 and a passenger capacity of 5734 at double occupancy.

However in January 2024 Royal Caribbean’s new class Icon of the Seas will become the new world’s largest cruise ship at 250000 gross otns a guest capacity of 5610 at double occupancy.

So who wins? Both cruise lines offer a range of ships of varying ages and varying sizes. Carnival has led for a long time but Royal Caribbean is becoming the leader in terms of passenger numbers and ships.

Deployment

When cruising with Carnival you’ll find that there are more than a dozen home ports in North America with a ton of cruises available out of Florida and New England. There are lots of itineraries that travel around the Caribbean and along the Mexican Riviera and to Cancun. On rarer occasions Carnival offers longer sailings and sailings to and around Europe but it’s not the norm.

Royal Caribbean on the other hand has fewer North American home ports but it still offers a lot of the same itineraries to the Caribbean and Mexico in addition to cruises to Hawaii and Alaska. There are European cruises available more regularly with Royal Caribbean than with Carnival and there are even some cruises that travel around Asia and Australia.

Who wins? It depends on what you’re looking for. If you want a more affordable cruise headed out of a popular North American port and you primarily have your sights set on Caribbean destinations you’ll do fine with Carnival.

If you want to travel to Alaska Hawaii or anywhere off the East Coast or around Europe or Asia you’ll do best to pick Royal Caribbean.

Cabins

Carnival offers large cabins in general and the newer the ship you book the better and more modern your cabin. There are specialty cabins available too such as the Cloud 9 Spa rooms that provide extra spa-related amenities and the Havana cabins on newer ships which include access to a private Havana-class pool and deck.

There are some family cabins though not as many as you might think that they would have based off of how much the cruise line markets itself to families. Family suites are available on select ships.

In general Carnival’s cabins (as well as the entirety of the line’s ships) feel more colorful bold and cheerful. Everything is very festive and fun.

On Royal Caribbean you can find a wide array of cabin styles with some pretty cool features that you might not see with other cruise lines. These include the cruise line’s virtual balcony interior cabins that project real-time exterior views onto your interior wall for the illusion of a floor-to-ceiling window. Large suites are also available as are family cabins.

Royal Caribbean’s vibe and decor style is a little more elegant and upscale than what you’ll see on Carnival. The bright colors have been swapped out for sleeker color palettes more similar to what you might see in an upscale modern hotel.

Who wins when it comes to cabins? Royal Caribbean takes top points for its upscale feel and hotel-like designs.

Entertainment and Activities

As you could probably guess Carnival Cruise Line offers loads of family-friendly kid-geared activities. Activities include pools waterparks (including the WaterWorks water park) outdoor sports centers (with mini golf basketball volleyball and more) and for the new Mardi Gras ship a roller coaster. Other entertainment options on newer ships include ropes courses and SkyRide a recumbent bike ride on the top decks.

When it’s time to head indoors Carnival offers your standard comedy sets Broadway-style performances and live music. Nightlife options include poolside movies nightclub-esque parties and DJ sets.

However Royal Caribbean takes the fun up a notch. While the line may not be as renowned for its family-friendly atmosphere as Carnival is it still manages to “wow” with all things entertainment-related.

Royal Caribbean boasts multiple pools on each ship FlowRider surfing simulators water parks zippiness indoor skydiving and rock climbing walls among other entertainment options. About half of Royal Caribbean’s ships offer indoor ice skating rinks.

Newer ships in the Quantum-class offer the SeaPlex an indoor entertainment center with activities such as roller skating and trapeze classes. Of course Broadway-style shows are on tap as are aerial shows acrobatic stunts at the AquaTheater and DJ sets.

Who wins? Royal Caribbean is your place to go for truly “wow”-worthy entertainment and activities. No matter which ship you sail on you’re sure to find near-endless ways to stay busy and have fun.

Dining and Bars & Lounges

Carnival offers both fixed and flexible dining options. There are fewer specialty dining options on Carnival cruise ships and the included basic dining options are firm fan favorites. These include long-standing options such as the BlueIguana Cantina Guy’s Burger Joint and Guy’s Pig & Anchor Bar-b-Que.

Carnival is no stranger to celebrity restaurant concepts either as is obvious with the line’s partnerships with celebrity chef Guy Fieri Shaq and Emeril Lagasse.

Royal Caribbean offers similarly fixed and flexible dining options. There are many more specialty dining options on Royal Caribbean ships as compared to Carnival cruise ships. The basic restaurants included in your fare are pretty standard though and pretty much just include a few casual and cafe options as well as ships’ main dining rooms.

Royal Caribbean doesn’t have as many celebrity endorsements though it does offer a restaurant concept from celebrity chef Jamie Oliver.

Both cruise lines offer drink packages to help you cover the cost of your bar tab versus paying for drinks one at a time. The packages allow you to pay one price for your drinks.

Royal Caribbean’s drink package is more expensive than Carnival’s; however Royal Caribbean’s drink package doesn’t limit the number of alcoholic drinks you can consume in one day whereas Carnival’s drink package limits you to 15 drinks.

When it comes to dining who takes the top prize? It’s a tie here because as with sailings and deployment which cruise line has the best dining and drinking option for you will all depend on what you’re after.

If you want flexibility and lots of free dining options go with Carnival. If you want lots of specialty dining options and free-flowing drinks — and don’t mind paying for them — go with Royal Caribbean.

Other Onboard Features

Other onboard features that the two cruise lines offer?

Carnival’s family focus is pretty solid as you might expect. Kids clubs include separate clubs for elementary-age kids preteens and teenagers. The Seuss at Sea program is pretty popular and includes several events throughout each cruise including costume parades and breakfasts with characters. Babysitting is available as are spa treatments for teens.

Royal Caribbean also boasts plenty of family fun with programming for elementary-age kids preteens and teenagers as well. Babysitting is also available.

Beyond the family stuff other amenities abound and each cruise line offers its own special twist on the cruising experience.

Royal Caribbean for example is known for some high-tech amenities such as its robotic bartenders fast WiFi app luggage tracking and online check-in. Royal Caribbean also boasts its own private island with a water park which is an included stop on many Caribbean siblings.

For other onboard features Royal Caribbean wins for its plenteous amenities even if its children’s programming isn’t as robust as what Carnival offers its passengers.

Private Islands

The Perfect Day Island at Cococay in the Bahamas has been recently redesigned and features tons of ways to play and have well a perfect day — all without battling the crowds you might find at a normal cruise port.

Carnival’s private island on the other hand is Half Moon Cay also in the Bahamas. While it certainly offers its own perks and benefits it’s not nearly as hype-worthy as Perfect Day Island.

The Guests

When you’re on a cruise you end up sailing with the same few thousand people for a week or more and while that might seem like a ton of people and you probably would think that wouldn’t run into the same folks twice… You’d be surprised how much and how often you see the same individuals.

For that reason it’s nice to cruise with people you like and people that are similar in things such as taste and preferences.

Photo Credit: GSPhotography / Shutterstock.com

On Carnival you’ll find a lot of families children singles and budget-traveling couples. Most passengers are middle-aged adults. On Royal Caribbean you’ll find more couples and singles than families with most travelers being middle-aged or older adults.

There’s no clear winner when it comes to cruisers as each line caters to different types of travelers though some cruisers may find things to love about both lines.

Cost

When it comes to cost there’s no argument that Carnival offers the more affordable cruise fares. The cruise line’s entire reputation has been built on affordable cruises for the entire family. Pricing includes most of your dining venues and entertainment and you can often find sales and promotions that allow you to cruise at an even lower cost.

Photo: Pattie Steib / Shutterstock

Royal Caribbean on the other hand certainly doesn’t break the bank when it comes to cruising. It’s still entirely possible to cruise on a budget with the line. However Royal Caribbean is slightly more expensive than Carnival and this is especially the case when it comes to its newer ritzier ships.

Worth Reading: How Much Does a Cruise Cost?

Additionally Royal Caribbean’s basic cruise fares don’t offer all the same inclusions that Carnival bundles into its basic cruise fares; you might find yourself paying extra for things like dining and entertainment.

The clear winner is Carnival when it comes to cost for sure. You just can’t beat the line’s prices.

While participating in the on-field drills at the NFL Combine Oladapo suffered a broken toe. He had surgery on it a few weeks before the draft and the hope is that he will be good to go for training camp in August.

However in the meantime while Oladapo will still be involved in the team meetings he’s not going to have the opportunity to apply what he’s learning in the practice field.

“Just staying in the training room getting the swelling down getting my range of motion back” said Oladapo. “And then just staying locked in mental reps on the sideline and then meet with the coaches after make sure I get the game plan.”

Not that Oladapo will have the same fate as Grant DuBose – Oladapo’s path to contributing as a rookie is much more clear – but we saw just last offseason how an injury during this time of the year derailed any sort of roster push DuBose was hoping to make. He didn’t return to the practice field until mid-August and was playing catch up at that point.

At a minimum Oladapo figures to be a core special teams player for the Packers. Defensively while versatile like Javon Bullard and Evan Williams Oladapo fills more of the traditional safety role as GM Brian Gutekunst described it able to fill both the “free and strong safety role” who can also line up as the “big nickel Sam linebacker.”

“As we can move him around more” said defensive backs coach Ryan Downard “the walk throughs are going to become vital because these guys you teach them what you can but until you go out and do it and walk through it that’s to me where the real learning takes place.

“You can sit in a classroom and learn something but until you either have to teach it back or you take them out there physically let them walk through it that’s I think where the growth takes place.”

Downard added that Oladapo’s intelligence and football IQ will help him stay up to speed throughout this process. Downard liked what he saw from him during rookie minicamp and made sure to fire questions Oladapo’s way to keep him engaged.

The addition of Oladapo – along with Bullard and Williams – provides that interchangability that GM Brian Gutekunst was looking for at the position. Increased versatility at the position opens up the playbook for Jeff Hafley from a game-planning perspective and makes it more difficult for opposing offenses pre-snap not knowing who will have what responsibility.

Another element that these three players bring is speed and physicality. Along with finding the right players from a schematic standpoint there is a certain play-style that the Packers want to have under Hafley.

“I’m comfortable anywhere on the field” said Oladapo. “Whatever the team needs me to do: be in the box be in the post blitz guard tight ends guard slots. I can do it all. I feel comfortable just having my two feet on the grass.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvd29ybGQvZXVyb3BlL3BzZy1tYmFwcGUtcmVhbC1tYWRyaWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Did P.S.G.'s Money Buy?,"As a final scene it was so fitting that for a second it was possible to wonder if Kylian Mbappé had done it on purpose. He had reached the dying embers of Paris St.-Germain’s run in the Champions League. Yet again the dream of European glory that powered the club for more than a decade had been dashed.

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips. And then as Dortmund’s defiant back line trailed helplessly in his blistering wake Mbappé slipped.

No tackle no foul no intervention whatsoever. He just fell over. He would not have his goal. He would not be the hero. But he had at least provided a pitch-perfect allegory: not only for the seven years that he has spent at his hometown club but also for the lavish transformative and deeply flawed project he has come to represent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGEtc3RhdGUtZmxhZy1kaXNwbGF5LzYwMDM2NTI3MC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Laser loon lives: The second life of Minnesota state flag(s),"Not everything Minnesotans ran up the flagpole on Statehood Day was the new state flag.

At Herold Flags in Rochester customers were snapping up Minnesota flags — plural.

""In all the years I've been in business I've never even come close to selling any flag more than the U.S. flag"" owner Lee Herold said. ""Now I've been selling more state flags than U.S. flags.""

The new state flag: bold blues and sharp angles. The old state flag: long ignored long derided suddenly in demand. And the North Star flag. The one Herold co-designed decades ago when he launched his long campaign for a flag all Minnesotans could get behind.

""Frankly I was astounded that people were still coming in to get it"" he said. The flag he designed to represent Minnesota is a golden star on a field of blue for Minnesota's lakes and rivers white for our winters green for our farms and forests.

There were probably more Minnesota homes flying North Star flags than the actual flag when the search for a replacement began last year. Some Minnesotans still make room for it in their hearts and on their flagpoles.

""I had someone come in this morning and they got both. They got the new [flag] design and the North Star"" said Herold who has also had several customers double up to purchase both the old state flag and the North Star.

When Minnesota launched its search for a new flag last year Herold submitted his North Star for consideration.

It wasn't the flag the committee chose. None of the thousands of flags Minnesotans designed quite match the version that now flies above the state.

But the flag competition brought out the best and weirdest in Minnesota. There were lady slippers and laser loons. There were flags that evoked Ojibwe beadwork or heirloom quilts. There were constellations of stars in a kaleidoscope of colors.

All of them represented Minnesota to somebody. That's a pretty great thing to represent.

Minnesota made its choice. And so did Minnesotans who have flocked to online and brick-and-mortar shops to buy whichever design says ""Minnesota"" to them.

Welcome to the second life of Minnesota's second-place flags.

A month before Statehood Day a new flag rose over the crowd at a Minnesota United game. A bright white flag with the image of a bag and the legend printed in letters big enough for the players to read and share the thrill of Minnesota pride: BAYG.

Bayg flag — beloved crowd-pleasing longshot in the state flag redesign contest — lives.

The State Emblems Redesign Commission for reasons that surpass all understanding declined to choose even one of the flag designs that feature loons shooting lasers out of their eyes. Yet laser loon lives — on flags on totes on stickers on any surface that could be improved by the addition of a laser loon.

Including your library card if you're lucky enough to live in St. Paul.

""One of the joys of my job is asking 'what if?'"" said Claire Huber marketing and communications specialist for the St. Paul Public Library. After watching social media collectively melt down with glee over the funniest state flag designs she wondered: ""What if we made a laser loon library card? Wouldn't it be funny if we did?""

After watching several ""how to draw a loon"" tutorials online Huber designed her own laser loon with the legend: ""READ.""

Suddenly a library card was the hottest ticket in town. The library gave away all 500 new cards — and 500 laser loon stickers for existing cardholders — in a matter of days and quickly printed a thousand more.

""One of the best things about this project has been to bring delight to people"" she said. ""To see something so silly but so community-driven. Everyone has an opinion about the flag … I think it taps into the innate pride of the North.""

Minnesota hasn't quite realized Herold's dream of one flag we can all rally behind.

""Reminder"" Gov. Tim Walz posted on social media on Friday. ""Minnesota's new official state flag will be raised for the first time tomorrow.""

Stocks with game-changing growth potential can grow exponentially in a matter of years but among the many companies aggressively pursuing growth today only a handful seem capable of making it through the stock gyrations and hitting the coveted $1 trillion market capitalization by 2035. After all only five companies have made it to the $1 trillion club so far so unless a company is already growing like a weed and has convincing catalysts ahead to sustain that momentum it's hard to make it that far.

To be able to get your hands on a potential trillion-dollar company early in the game is a dizzyingly tempting idea though so I dug deep into the hundreds of stocks with a market capitalization of more than $100 million to see which ones could go that far. I found four stocks that have a really good chance of making it. Read along.

COVID-19 pandemic is a boon for this stock

Many use Visa (V 0.79%) cards but few are aware of the kind of growth the company can enjoy in coming years.

At the recently held Deutsche Bank Technology Conference Visa's CFO Vasant Prabhu highlighted four structural trends triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic that should power up the company's growth:

Acceleration of cash digitization or the use of digital modes of payment instead of cash.

Booming e-commerce particularly cross-border e-commerce as people are buying things online they traditionally bought in stores like groceries and drugs.

Greater adoption of cashless modes of payment by merchants of all sizes as they realize the importance of going online for survival.

Growth in value-added services like data solutions digital security and CyberSource -- an e-commerce card payments management company owned by Visa.

These are all secular trends that Visa knows how to exploit given its dominance in the payments processing space with 3.6 billion cards issued under its name as of the last quarter.

Management has clear-cut plans to grow shareholder wealth: Capture growing consumer payments and value-add markets through acquisitions and new services pay out 20% to 25% of annual earnings per share in dividends and repurchase shares with remaining cash. Visa's attempt to acquire fintech company Plaid may have fallen through on regulatory concerns but it's a fine example of Visa's hunger for growth.

Visa is already a cash-cow machine thanks to a low-capital high-margin core business and it generates operating margins north of 60%. With the pandemic forcing economies to go cashless and online Visa with its market cap of $492 billion should be able to hit $1 trillion long before 2035.

There's more money to be made from this massive trend than you think

I am going to make my boldest $1 trillion contender pick yet: It's a utility with a market cap of $165 billion.

Yes you read that right but I strongly believe NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%) will become the first utility stock in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club by 2035.

NextEra Energy's stock price has risen more than fivefold in 10 years and even more in dividends which have risen every year for more than 25 years. Now if the company could achieve that kind of growth when renewable energy was still in its nascent stage imagine where it could be once countries start working toward their net-zero emission goals. 137 countries have already committed to these goals mostly by 2050.

Statista projects that the global renewable energy market will cross $1 trillion as early as 2027 up from only $613.8 million in 2020. Projections through 2025 from the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2020 report are even more notable:

By 2025 major oil and gas companies' spending on renewables could grow tenfold.

Renewables could account for 95% of the increase in total global power capacity.

Renewables could make up one-third of the world's total electricity led by hydropower solar and wind.

Now consider this: NextEra Energy's subsidiary Energy Resources is already the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and has a backlog of 16.7 gigawatts (GW) which means near-term growth is already built into its portfolio.

To top that NextEra Energy's Florida Power & Light company is a steady cash-flow machine and its affiliate NextEra Energy Partners a steady source of funds. Then there's the opportunity in green hydrogen which alone could be a $12 trillion market by 2050.

There's another reason why NextEra has me excited: Growth via acquisitions. After its failed bid for Duke Energy I'm sure NextEra Energy is on the lookout for the next big merger or acquisition opportunity which could speed up this top renewable energy growth stock's journey to $1 trillion.

This company is beating the best in its game

Customer relationship management (CRM) has emerged as the fastest-growing software market as a rising number of businesses now understand why digitizing customer management is critical to retain and gain customers in an ever-expanding virtual world. These stunning statistics reveal why Salesforce.com's (CRM 0.55%) market cap could easily grow fourfold to $1 trillion well before 2035:

The global CRM market grew by 6% to $69 billion in 2020 according to Gartner.

Salesforce dominated the market with 19.5% share two percentage points higher than the combined market share of SAP  Oracle  Microsoft MSFT 0.59% ) Adobe  according to Statista.

   according to Statista. While SAP's and Oracle's market shares dropped in 2020 Salesforce's market share grew from 18.4% in 2019 to 19.5%.

Salesforce has more than doubled its revenue in the past three years.

Salesforce predicts revenue to cross $50 billion by 2026 from $21.1 billion in fiscal 2021.

Clearly Salesforce has its pulse on the CRM market like none other. Salesforce uses artificial intelligence extensively and its recent acquisition of business messaging platform Slack could be a potential game-changer as Slack competes directly with Microsoft's Teams platform. Slack added a record net new 13000 paid customers and had 169000 total paid customers as of last quarter including biggies like IBM.

As Salesforce is also already profitable its journey toward a $1 trillion market cap should be easier if it can grow sales as projected.

These industries could explode and so could this stock

Sea Limited's (SE -1.64%) market cap has grown at an astounding pace to $189 billion from only about $4.9 billion in October 2017. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results but Sea Limited's market cap growth so far wasn't a fluke: It was backed by exponential growth in revenues and gross profit. And if Sea Limited can continue to make a splash in the two big markets it's targeting nothing can stop its stock from hitting $1 trillion.

Sea Limited's integrated online platform forms the base of its three core businesses:

Entertainment (gaming): Garena.

E-commerce: Shopee.

Digital financials services: SeaMoney.

Here's how each business is faring:

Garena: Quarterly active users (QAUs) and quarterly paying users (QPUs) hit 725.2 million and 92.2 million respectively in second-quarter 2021. QAUs and QPUs were 402.1 million and 35.7 million as of March 30 2020.

Shopee: Gross merchandise value and orders hit $15 billion and $1.4 billion respectively in Q2 2021 from only $6.2 billion and $0.4 billion as of March 30 2020.

SeaMoney: Mobile wallet payment volumes crossed $4.2 billion in Q2 2021 from only $1.1 billion as of March 30 2020.

If anything at all these numbers indicate Sea Limited's growth potential.

Its flagship game Free Fire beat Tencent's (TCEHY -0.15%) PUBG Mobile to become the world's third-most downloaded mobile game in August 2021. Shopee is already the leading e-commerce company in Southeast Asia and Taiwan and is now expanding into Latin America Europe and even India. SeaMoney is growing beyond mobile payments -- it has already won a banking license in Singapore and recently acquired Indonesia's PT Bank.

Remember though Sea Limited's losses are swelling and that's something that may not sit well with some investors. However Sea Limited is a typical growth stock focused on customer and top-line growth and has successfully monetized Garena to reinvest the cash into e-commerce and financial services beyond Southeast Asia. If you believe in the power of these two businesses Sea Limited could be an enormous winner by 2035.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2VudGVycHJpc2UtdGVjaG5vbG9neS12ZW5kb3JzLXJldi11cC10aGUtd29ya2Zsb3ctYnV6endvcmQtbWFjaGluZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Enterprise technology vendors rev up the workflow buzzword machine,"Workflow is becoming the buzzword of 2021 for a broad range of software and cloud giants as collaboration hybrid work automation and task management all collide.

Based on transcripts from earnings calls and analyst events it's clear that workflow is bubbling up as a technological term.

ServiceNow which built a juggernaut on delivering workflow automation and popularized it mentioned ""workflow"" 32 times on its most recent earnings call. ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott noted that customers are buying workflow infrastructure for IT customers employees and creators. And for what it's worth ServiceNow essentially started the slow-moving workflow bandwagon. During its 2013 analyst meeting ServiceNow executives mentioned workflow 35 times as they laid out the case that the company could expand beyond IT service management.

Salesforce on its second-quarter earnings call covered the term workflow twice in depth. Bret Taylor president and chief operating officer at Salesforce said: ""IBM is one of my favorite examples of a Slack-First Customer 360 company. IBM has built their entire Customer 360 on Salesforce. Over 530000 customers 380000 employees and 50000 partners using our platform. And all of these employees are working in Slack. They've connected their workflows across Sales Cloud across Service Cloud and enables them to connect and take action from anywhere.""

Zoom executives during their Zoomtopia analyst day covered workflow tools and strategies four times.

Microsoft also talked about its role in enabling workflows twice on its most recent earnings call.

Atlassian also talked about automated workflows in relation to Jira. ""The best thing we can do is be deeply integrated in all of those places. We believe that's best for the customers. It is then our job to automate workflows to coordinate data and to do that the best we can across all of those different applications"" said Atlassian co-CEO Michael Cannon-Brookes.

If this workflow-meets-messaging and collaboration apps vibe sounds familiar that's because it is the next enterprise software battleground. As work goes hybrid and automates workflow engines that operate within collaborative apps (essentially the digital office these days) will be critical. That vision is why Salesforce bought Slack and is now integrating ahead of its Dreamforce conference. It's also why ServiceNow's latest Now Platform release has a heavy dose of automated workflows and integrations with Microsoft Teams. And it's why Zoom at Zoomtopia spent a lot of time talking about workflows and how it can integrate with video meetings and collaboration.

How will this workflow war play out? Here's a crib sheet of the landscape today and how it'll evolve.

ServiceNow-Microsoft vs. Salesforce-Slack.

If this were a professional wrestling match ServiceNow-Microsoft vs. Salesforce-Slack would be the lead tag team battle. I'll spare you the Photoshop putting ServiceNow Bill McDermott and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff in wrestling gear largely because I did it a few years ago.

But I digress. Ultimately the ServiceNow-Microsoft vs. Salesforce-Slack is about automating work within the collaboration. Think about bringing services into collaboration tools. What remains to be seen is whether ServiceNow and Salesforce collide directly. ServiceNow is focused on more backend processes such as resolving issues answering questions fixing broken things and streamlining approvals. Salesforce is more of a front-end workflow play with Customer 360 CRM customer service and sales and bringing insights into tools like Slack.

Collaboration moves into workflows.

Zoom may be ahead of the workflow meets collaboration game but at Zoomtopia the company's video-centric approach to workflow is telling. Zoom is building industry-specific templates and bringing in apps to its platforms to meet employees where they are.

Oded Gal chief product officer at Zoom said at Zoomtopia:

A little less than 2 months ago we announced Zoom Apps. Zoom Apps consists of over 50 launch partners with apps that you can use in the Zoom Meeting today. They are already some of the most popular of the 1500-plus third-party integrations in the Zoom App Marketplace and include integrations with HubSpot DocuSign Google Suite Microsoft Office and more.

Gal cited DocuSign integration as a strong workflow example.

You can see here the workflow really integrates the ability to sign a document while you're in a video meeting.

And Graeme Geddes head of Zoom Phone said at Zoomtopia:

We've seen a tremendous level of interest and adoption from Zoom Rooms from our customers as it's been central to their own return-to-office strategies. Over the past year we've leveraged the power of Zoom Rooms to help our customers build new spaces and workflows to support a new hybrid way of working. We introduced a number of capabilities for example if we go to the next slide kiosk mode to support virtual receptionists; people counting and voice commands to support corporate safety standards and social distancing practices; and Smart Gallery. With Zoom talking about workflows and integrations with enterprise app players rest assured that other video collaboration vendors are going to follow suit. For what it's worth Cisco's most recent earnings conference call didn't surface workflows in reference to WebEx.

The rest of the field and workflow washing.

Once this workflow theme gains more traction you can rest assured other technology vendors will pile on. We've seen the buzzword bingo before so get ready for ""cloud-enabled blockchain quantum AI and machine learning powered workflow automation"" headlines any day now.

Our international correspondent Richa Goyal Sikri unravels the story of the grossular green garnet.

Tsavorite was discovered in 1961 when a curious second-generation geologist decided to go exploring one weekend in Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). His name: Campbell Bridges.

Bridges’ curiosity brought him face to face with a Cape Buffalo who decided to express his irritation by charging him. “My father knew how dangerous these bovine warriors could be…and managed to jump into a steep ravine in the nick of time.” recalls his son Bruce. “He continued coursing up the ravine making his way to the top of the hill. [There] he caught a glint of green in the sunlight. On further investigation he realised the flash of colour was mineral in nature and had the crystal makeup of garnet but [was] unlike anything he had ever seen.”

Before Bridges could do much about his discovery the Atomic Energy Authority transferred him out of Rhodesia. Six years later (1967) his continuous prospecting and geological knowledge brought him to a range of hills outside the village of Komolo in Tanzania similar to the ones he had seen earlier. Once again the green garnets caught his eye and he was able to develop that deposit bringing this 550 million-year-old gemstone to the world.

In 1970 the Tanzanian government nationalised the mines motivating Campbell Bridges to use old colonial maps to rediscover tsavorite (later that year) across the border in Kenya!

Although tsavorite is coloured by the same elements as an emerald (vanadium & chromium) its light dispersion capabilities are double of an emerald.

Tsavorite specialist Joe Belmont co-founder KV Gems explains “Technicalities aside these characteristics mean that when properly faceted tsavorite sparkles with an electric energy [as opposed to] the sleepier glow of an emerald. Its distinctive character. Tsavorite is also singly refractive of light being part of the cubic crystal system (like a diamond).”

To sum up tsavorite beautifully combines the rich green colour of an emerald with the dazzling sparkle of a diamond.

Gem quality tsavorite worthy of a connoisseur’s attention have mainly been found in East Africa. Tsavorite miner and African gem specialist Bruce Bridges explains “While samples of tsavorite have been found in other locations till now the gem-rich geological region across Kenya and Tanzania is responsible for commercially important fine-quality tsavorite.”

Elaborating on the gem’s distinguishing features based on origin Bruce explains “There are trends within regions. The small quantities found in Madagascar tend to have tsavorite with higher Vanadium content rendering darker gems which work mainly for calibrated small sizes”. Regarding larger sizes in more exceptional qualities Bruce elucidates “In my opinion Kenya produces tsavorite in good qualities up to about 30 carats Komolo (Lemshuko) in Tanzania has produced stones up to around 50 carats in fine qualities. The larger stones (above 50 carats) have come from Merelani (now more widely called Mererani) in Tanzania. In my collection I have the largest fine square-cushion cut tsavorite on record known as the Lion of Merelani which is 116.76 carats.”

The rarity of tsavorite emanates from the unique geological events that birthed this incredible gem. Kenya-based independent geologist Cedric Simonet explains “Pockets of tsavorite are the result of the transformation of small masses of mineral salts that originally formed in dried up lakes on the surface of the earth. When mining underground predicting the next tsavorite pocket is akin to figuring out the location of the patch of salt in a surface environment 700 or 800 million years ago an almost impossible challenge.”

If both Tanzania & Kenya share similar geology then why has Tanzania yielded larger tsavorite? Tsavorite miner & African gem specialist Bruce Bridges shares his views “The rock formations in Merelani have larger shadow-zones where slightly lower pressures and temperatures allow the chemically-rich hydrothermal solution to form larger cleaner crystals. In other locations the higher temperature pressure and smaller cavities tend to lead to smaller and more fractured material.”

Campbell Bridges understood that for a gem to become collectable beauty durability and rarity were not enough; professional storytelling techniques needed to trigger a desire for acquisition plus consumer confidence via the endorsement of a recognised brand. In 1967 Bridges introduced tsavorite to Henry B. Platt from Tiffany & Co. The company became the first jewellery brand to launch tsavorite in their collections enabling Bridges to develop formal mining operations in Kenya.",,,

Based on transcripts from earnings calls and analyst events it's clear that workflow is bubbling up as a technological term.

ServiceNow which built a juggernaut on delivering workflow automation and popularized it mentioned ""workflow"" 32 times on its most recent earnings call. ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott noted that customers are buying workflow infrastructure for IT customers employees and creators. And for what it's worth ServiceNow essentially started the slow-moving workflow bandwagon. During its 2013 analyst meeting ServiceNow executives mentioned workflow 35 times as they laid out the case that the company could expand beyond IT service management.

Salesforce on its second-quarter earnings call covered the term workflow twice in depth. Bret Taylor president and chief operating officer at Salesforce said: ""IBM is one of my favorite examples of a Slack-First Customer 360 company. IBM has built their entire Customer 360 on Salesforce. Over 530000 customers 380000 employees and 50000 partners using our platform. And all of these employees are working in Slack. They've connected their workflows across Sales Cloud across Service Cloud and enables them to connect and take action from anywhere.""

Zoom executives during their Zoomtopia analyst day covered workflow tools and strategies four times.

Microsoft also talked about its role in enabling workflows twice on its most recent earnings call.

Atlassian also talked about automated workflows in relation to Jira. ""The best thing we can do is be deeply integrated in all of those places. We believe that's best for the customers. It is then our job to automate workflows to coordinate data and to do that the best we can across all of those different applications"" said Atlassian co-CEO Michael Cannon-Brookes.

If this workflow-meets-messaging and collaboration apps vibe sounds familiar that's because it is the next enterprise software battleground. As work goes hybrid and automates workflow engines that operate within collaborative apps (essentially the digital office these days) will be critical. That vision is why Salesforce bought Slack and is now integrating ahead of its Dreamforce conference. It's also why ServiceNow's latest Now Platform release has a heavy dose of automated workflows and integrations with Microsoft Teams. And it's why Zoom at Zoomtopia spent a lot of time talking about workflows and how it can integrate with video meetings and collaboration.

How will this workflow war play out? Here's a crib sheet of the landscape today and how it'll evolve.

ServiceNow-Microsoft vs. Salesforce-Slack.

If this were a professional wrestling match ServiceNow-Microsoft vs. Salesforce-Slack would be the lead tag team battle. I'll spare you the Photoshop putting ServiceNow Bill McDermott and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff in wrestling gear largely because I did it a few years ago.

But I digress. Ultimately the ServiceNow-Microsoft vs. Salesforce-Slack is about automating work within the collaboration. Think about bringing services into collaboration tools. What remains to be seen is whether ServiceNow and Salesforce collide directly. ServiceNow is focused on more backend processes such as resolving issues answering questions fixing broken things and streamlining approvals. Salesforce is more of a front-end workflow play with Customer 360 CRM customer service and sales and bringing insights into tools like Slack.

Collaboration moves into workflows.

Zoom may be ahead of the workflow meets collaboration game but at Zoomtopia the company's video-centric approach to workflow is telling. Zoom is building industry-specific templates and bringing in apps to its platforms to meet employees where they are.

Oded Gal chief product officer at Zoom said at Zoomtopia:

A little less than 2 months ago we announced Zoom Apps. Zoom Apps consists of over 50 launch partners with apps that you can use in the Zoom Meeting today. They are already some of the most popular of the 1500-plus third-party integrations in the Zoom App Marketplace and include integrations with HubSpot DocuSign Google Suite Microsoft Office and more.

Gal cited DocuSign integration as a strong workflow example.

You can see here the workflow really integrates the ability to sign a document while you're in a video meeting.

And Graeme Geddes head of Zoom Phone said at Zoomtopia:

We've seen a tremendous level of interest and adoption from Zoom Rooms from our customers as it's been central to their own return-to-office strategies. Over the past year we've leveraged the power of Zoom Rooms to help our customers build new spaces and workflows to support a new hybrid way of working. We introduced a number of capabilities for example if we go to the next slide kiosk mode to support virtual receptionists; people counting and voice commands to support corporate safety standards and social distancing practices; and Smart Gallery. With Zoom talking about workflows and integrations with enterprise app players rest assured that other video collaboration vendors are going to follow suit. For what it's worth Cisco's most recent earnings conference call didn't surface workflows in reference to WebEx.

The rest of the field and workflow washing.

Once this workflow theme gains more traction you can rest assured other technology vendors will pile on. We've seen the buzzword bingo before so get ready for ""cloud-enabled blockchain quantum AI and machine learning powered workflow automation"" headlines any day now.

However with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and people working remotely the traffic started rising. So much so that by June 2020 it touched 7000 prospects and then 15000 in August.

“All these users or prospects were interested in what Rezolve AI had to offer” says Saurabh Kumar Co-founder and CEO of US- and India-based Rezolve AI a smart service desk SaaS product that offers ‘resolution as a service’ in a conversation with YourStory.

Started in 2017 by IIM Bangalore alumni Saurabh Kumar Manish Sharma (Chief Business Officer) and Udaya Reddy (CTO Head of Product and Engineering) US and India-based Rezolve AI is an AI-led automated employee service desk. The startup aims to disrupt the IT support market by improving employee servicing experience and satisfaction through its automated query resolution software.

Saurabh explains that the team at Rezolve.ai is using AI to automate L1 support that will essentially help organisations in cost-cutting by reducing human involvement. Rezolve AI’s smart service desk provides smart chatbot conversational ticketing intelligent knowledge management seamless live agent chat morsel microlearning and auto resolution skills which the founders explain is at Level 1 or the first support line.





The startup is based in California with offices in Chennai Dehradun and Toronto. It has a team of more than 50 team members with most of them based in India and is backed by investors including Tri-Valley Ventures Venture Catalyst Pentathlon VC SLO Seed and Sand Hill Angels.

The beginning

Saurabh Manish and Udaya became friends while studying at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Bangalore in 1999 and went on to pursue their corporate careers after completing MBA.





Udaya stayed close to product and technology in places like IBM and most recently was CTO at Accenture before starting up. On the other hand Manish went into sales and marketing in the US and led various market and growth teams at Infosys iGate and Tech Mahindra. And Saurabh worked inside large enterprises in senior technology roles at places such as Wells Fargo and BNP Paribas. The three co-founders were buying selling and implementing hundreds of millions worth of technology every year.





Udaya ran the ServiceNow platform and understood how current technology leaders were limited to only tracking issues not solving them. Meanwhile Manish was doing deals to outsource service desk and implement service desk platforms and realised how expensive and labour-intensive the whole process was. Saurabh was running internal IT service desks for companies — and dealt with the challenges of high cost and employee service levels.





Keen to plunge into entrepreneurship and having gained an understanding of the challenges of the service desk the trio concluded that the service desk industry needed to be disrupted and they decided to start Rezolve AI.

What differentiates Rezolve AI?

Saurabh explains that the legacy industry focuses the product on agents while Rezolve AI is built for end-users who are employees. He adds that traditional service desks are built for tracking tickets but Rezolve AI is primarily built for auto resolution. “While traditional service desks don’t deflect any tickets Rezolve deflects up to 45 percent of tickets” says Saurabh.

He adds that while traditional service desk platforms need technology implementation and consulting to deliver outcomes Rezolve AI offers to not just provide Software as a Service but also Resolutions as a Service. “Our collective learning platform will provide out of the box automations across the thousands of kinds of help employees need from day one” claims Saurabh.

Speaking about the need for such a product Saurabh says that all employees need support. He adds that any employee working in any company needs a lot of internal support — around internal policies company information housekeeping information shared PowerPoint presentations data sets logos and a plethora of things from HR marketing and finance teams.

“Usually people walk over to someone next to them to get some help to call service desks or create a ticket or drop an email which is not really a good experience and even costs a lot to the companies” Saurabh explains.

This is where Rezolve AI focusses on “auto-resolving” most of the repetitive issues that employees face. According to him about 80 percent of the spend in IT and HR service desks is on labour and Rezolve AI is focused on faster easier service at a fraction of the current cost.





The company claims that employees can get support within seconds by just having a conversation with the Rezolve AI app and it helps employees by either providing the right information triaging an issue performing a task or creating a ticket on behalf of the employee.

Competition and addressable market

Rezolve AI has two kinds of competition — legacy ticketing systems such as Freshdesk Servicenow Jira; and automation only companies like Moveworks and Aisera.





Saurabh claims that Rezolve AI is uniquely positioned against both of them. He says the startup stands out for being the only full-stack automation first player and the product stands out for focussing on Microsoft Teams which makes the startup’s addressable market too close to 500 million. He says that MS teams are now clubbed with Microsoft 365 pack and that it has 200 million employees actively using it daily across the world and this number is expected to grow to 500 million.

Revenue model

Rezolve AI is priced on a per employee per month model which Saurabh says is very different from traditional service desks that are priced on a per-agent basis and have no incentive to reduce the number of agents needed. In terms of growth Rezolve AI claims to have grown 400 percent in the last 12 months which is on the back of the pandemic turning workplaces into remote workplaces.





The company has more than 30 enterprise customers including four Fortune 500 companies across geographies including the US Canada India and others.





“We are adding four to five customers a month and intend to 10x this pace in the year ahead” says Saurabh.

Funding and future plans

The company has so far raised funding to the tune of $2.5 million in seed and a pre-Series A round from a clutch of investors including Tri-Valley Ventures ﻿Venture Catalysts﻿ Pentathlon VC SLO Seed and ﻿Sand Hill Angels﻿ .





Saurabh says that the startup’s execution was capital-efficient and has plenty of runway from the last raise. Now it is looking to raise Series A round funding to the tune of $10 million to support its expansion and strengthen its technology with an aim to grow 10x faster.

Daily American Correspondent

PORTAGE — North Star played tough against Portage Friday night but miscues proved to be costly in a 23-12 road loss. In a game that was a defensive struggle the Cougars could not overcome penalties and a bad snap on a punt. All of the errors added up to their third straight loss of the season.

“Defensively I thought we played well tonight” said North Star coach Bob Landis. “We were able to slow down their run game. They pride themselves on running the football and I thought we did a pretty good job of slowing things down tonight. The majority of the scoring drives they had tonight were on short fields. You can’t give a good team short fields.”

Play of the game: Late in the first half North Star was backed up in its own end of the field. Ethan Yoder punted the ball out of his own end zone to near midfield. However Gavin Gouse returned the ball 39 yards to the North Star six yard line. The Mustangs scored three plays later on an Oren Heidler 2-yard touchdown run with 2:50 left in the half. Gouse’s return set up the touchdown allowing the Mustangs to take a 13-0 lead into the locker room at halftime instead of being up just 7-0.

Player of the game: In a defensive battle that did not allow a lot of positive statistics Portage Jon Wolford led all rushers with 85 yards on 21 carries. Wolford also scored the game’s first touchdown on a 13 yard scamper. He converted a key first down earlier in the series on a hard 1-yard plunge.

“I knew with North Star coming in we were in for a handful” said Portage coach Marty Slanoc. “I don’t look at what happened last week. They found out they had to play Windber at 5:00 on Thursday. They were not afraid to go play them on the next night and prepare for what they do. That’s a mentally and physically tough team. They are not afraid to battle they are well coached and they are young. We are leaving the WestPAC but they are going to be a team to reckon with.”

Unsung hero: Ethan Yoder put in a strong defensive effort. He broke through the Mustang offensive line on Portage’s first possession to tackle Kaden Claar in the backfield on fourth down to turn the ball over on downs. Yoder had a number of tackles in the Portage backfield to disrupt the Mustangs’ running game. He also averaged more than 41 yards per punt which proved to be big in a defensive battle. Yoder also caught a 4-yard touchdown pass from Connor Yoder.

Vital stat of the game: North Star had 10 penalties for 60 yards. Seven of those penalties came in the first half totaling 45 yards. The biggest of those penalties was an ineligible man downfield mark off later in the first quarter. The penalty was only 5 yards but it negated a 20-yard screen pass from Connor Yoder to Ethan Yoder that would have given the Cougars a first down at the Portage 25 yard line in a scoreless game. Two plays after the penalty a high snap on a punt forced Ethan Yoder to cover the ball giving the Mustangs a first down on the North Star 34 yard line. Portage took advantage of the miscue using the good field position to score their first touchdown. Ethan Yoder also had a 17 yard run negated late in the first half due to a holding penalty. The holding penalty backed up North Star leading to a punt. That was the punt that Gouse returned for 39 yards to set up the Mustangs second touchdown.

“I want to see the film” said Landis of the penalties. “Obviously they called the penalties. I want to see how we can correct those penalties. We will watch the film and get better.”

Records: North Star (1-3) Portage (4-0)

Next week: North Star travels to Meyersdale. Portage visits Conemaugh Valley.

The Dragons did.

The Arabians didn’t.

A bad snap on a punt and an interception on Pendleton Heights first two possessions led to 14 New Palestine points.

The Dragons up 14 tried to let the Arabians back in with an interception and fumble of their own but the Arabians followed with two three-and-out series.

New Palestine added two more first half touchdowns on its way to a 38-3 victory at Kelso Stadium.

The Dragons are 2-3 overall and 2-1 in the HHC. The Arabians fall to 3-2 and 1-2.

“It’s huge. We don’t want to turn the ball over like that but the fact our defense bailed us out and got stops is big” New Palestine head coach Kyle Ralph said. “It was nice to see our offense take advantage of their mistakes which is something we’ve been able to do in the past but haven’t been able to do well this year. It was nice to see us do that this year.”

On the game’s opening series Pendleton Heights got near midfield but a sack of quarterback Luke Candiano by freshman lineman Michael Thacker and junior defensive back Eli Hook forced fourth down. The snap to Arabian punter Justin Beeler was off target and the Dragons ended up starting with the ball at the PH 32.

New Pal converted a fourth down from the PH 25 on a five-yard run by Blaine Nunnally then scored on a 20-yard rush from Kyler Kropp.

Brendan Tanksley added the first of his five successful PATs — he also had a 32-yard field goal in the third quarter — to give the Dragons a 7-0 lead with 5:42 remaining in the opening quarter.

Two plays into the ensuing series Candiano was picked off by senior defensive back Gus Walling. The ball was tipped at the line of scrimmage by Thacker.

The Dragons began their series at the Arabian 14. Three plays later sophomore running back Grayson Thomas scored on a 2-yard run.

The Arabians got a 26-yard field goal from Dominic Apo to start the second quarter to cut the home team’s lead to 14-3.

The Madison County club looked to be gaining momentum when New Pal quarterback Damon Hockett was picked off by Brennan Adams.

It didn’t happen.

The series which started at the Arabian 34 ended three plays later at the Arabian 33 on a sack by Dragon junior Eian Roudebush.

The Dragons gave the ball right back after a botched handoff between Hockett and Thomas. Again the Arabians were unable to do much starting from their own 39 and ending on their own 41.

“You’ve got to give all the credit to the defense” Hockett said. “They set us up for a great start and gave us chances to be explosive. It fires everyone up when you score early.

“I’ll take the blame for those mistakes. They were all me.”

The Dragons Red Rage defense bailed them out then the Dragon offense made them pay.

Its next series was a one and done. From the Dragon 21 Hockett connected with Isaiah Thacker on a 79-yard pass play. Thacker out-ran the Pendleton Heights defense and went untouched to the end zone for a 21-3 Dragon lead.

Before halftime Thomas had his second touchdown of the game.

Set up by a 38-yard run from Hockett on third-and-16 Thomas scored from 18 yards away with just 1:32 left until halftime.

Ralph was glad to see his club turn the Arabian mistakes into points but he was concerned about his team’s offensive errors.

“We are leaving a lot of missed opportunities on the field” Ralph said. “If you’re going to be a good football team that can’t happen.

“If you want to play championship level football you can’t waste opportunities. We’ve been wasting a lot this year. We wasted more tonight. We’ve got to be more efficient and execute better offensively.”

The Dragons executed on their first second-half possession. They got the ball to start the second half and took little time in adding to their lead.

Thomas from the Dragon 17 went 65 yards on the first play from scrimmage. Three plays later Hockett scored on a 4-yard run for a 35-3 NP lead.

Thomas finished with 15 carries for 132 yards. Hockett completed 7 of 14 passes for 191 yards and a touchdown. He rushed 12 times for 55 yards and a score. Isaiah Thacker had three catches for 138 yards and a touchdown.

Kropp rushed for 47 yards and Nunnally picked up 22 yards on the ground and grabbed three passes for 42 yards.

The New Pal defense made it rough on Pendleton Heights’ veteran Candiano. The senior quarterback was 4 of 14 for 50 yards and two interceptions.

James Malone led the Arabians offense with 11 carries for 52 yards.

“They put the clamps on us” Pendleton Heights coach Jed Richman said. “You have to give them credit. Until we learn to be more disciplined in situations this is going to happen against good teams. Their record is misleading. They’re a high-quality football team and are going to win a lot more games this season.

“They’re well-coached and they played hard. We played hard too but we didn’t always play smart.”

The win was the Dragons 10th straight over the Arabians and 20th in the last 22 meetings. Pendleton Heights has not beaten New Palestine since 2012.

The Arabians will finish their three-week run of Hancock County opponents next week with a trip to Mt. Vernon.

New Palestine ends its three-game homestand (going 2-1 including a win over Yorktown and loss to Mt. Vernon) but will stay in Hancock County traveling to Greenfield-Central next week.

The 33-year-old Tottenham-born singer has now seemingly confirmed the romance with the NBA agent and we couldn't be happier for her.

After skipping the Met Gala last week Adele got glammed up for a series of Instagram photos on Sunday. Dressed in a chic black and white gown Adele was glowing as she posed for some stunning snaps. Wearing her golden locks tied back into a bun oversized pearl earrings and her classic cat eye makeup look – fans went wild as she posted for the first time since the beginning of July.

In the first image she stood with her hand on a bannister looking into the camera lens with her nude lips in a pout. The second snap she could be seen stood in a garden slightly turned to the side as she showed off the back of her gown that had an OTT white ruffle. And the third snap was a photo booth selfie with Rich Paul the NBA agent that she's rumoured to be dating. Well it looks like the rumours must be true and we love how casually Adele soft-launched her boyfriend onto her Instagram page.

One fan said ""Omg the beauty realness!!🔥🔥🔥🔥""

A second commented on the snap with Rich ""Did she get married?""



While other fans pressed the star for the release date of her hotly anticipated album with one saying ""Okay Adele good but the real question is are we getting a album now 🤷🏾‍♀️😂‼️""

Adele is thought to have been attending an event with Rich where she also posed for a photo with Jared Dudley an assistant coach for the Dallas Mavericks who posted the snap on his Instagram stories.

The star got glammed up for this event after she skipped the Met Gala last week but was spotted by a fan at American burger joint In-N-Out when fans praised her for being 'the realest of them all'.

This comes as speculation of Adele's next album spirals out of control. With a source telling The Sunday Mirror ""It's been a long time coming but her label wants it released before Christmas and have their sights set on a performance in Vegas.

""Adele and her management have been in talks with BBC America about broadcasting it around the world. This will be one of few performances as part of her promotional tour.

The source continued ""Obviously with ongoing Covid dramas and concern for safety it could affect recording but this is the date scheduled right now.""

Adele looks so happy and we are SO overjoyed for her.. but please release a semi-sad album soon? We need it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXUubGlmZXN0eWxlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9mYW5zLWdvLW51dHMtYmFjaGVsb3ItbWF0dC1hZ25ldy10YXJ6YW4tc2hpcnRsZXNzLXNlbGZpZS0wMzM1NTIzMTMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Bachelor fans go nuts for Matt Agnew's 'Tarzan' transformation snap,"The Bachelor's Matt Agnew has undergone a huge hair transformation in the last year or so with the astrophysicist sending fans wild after sharing a photo of himself looking like 'Tarzan' according to some followers.

The 34-year-old shared the shirtless snap of himself showing off his ripped physique and Tarzan locks. The former reality star also sported a beard that he didn't have when he was on the dating show.

Many others suggested he looked like Jesus in the snap while some questioned how he took care of his hair.

During an appearance on Today Extra last month host David Campbell asked him how long he's going to grow his hair to which Matt responded ""I'm thinking I potentially go shoulder length.""

He laughed ""I've got past that really awkward uncomfortable stage so I've got to just push.""

Belinda Russell followed up asking if Matt was in a relationship and he told the hosts ""I am single yes.""

Matt and his chosen lady Chelsie McLeod sadly split six weeks after the show's finale aired.

The Board chaired today by Lt. Governor Boyd K. Rutherford approved a $44.6 million construction contract to develop the site and lease agreement for Southwest Airlines to build and operate the maintenance facility.

“This is a particularly exciting project and long-term partnership that will benefit the State of Maryland for years to come” said Lt. Governor Rutherford. “This would be another key maintenance facility for Southwest Airlines and enhances an established long term and strategic relationship. Our administration continues to support BWI as a major transportation hub as well as a catalyst for tourism trade and economic development.”

The 27-acre site will include a hangar to accommodate up to three Boeing 737 aircrafts and an apron space to accommodate up to eight Southwest Airlines jets along with associated office and workshop space. The maintenance facility cost is estimated around $135 million which includes an investment of approximately $90 million from the airline.

“Southwest Airlines began serving BWI Marshall Airport 28 years ago and we are honored to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to the airport and to Maryland by progressing with plans to build a first-class maintenance hangar to support our Employees and Customers” said Landon Nitschke Southwest’s Senior Vice President of Technical Operations. “We appreciate the State of Maryland for the continued support of Southwest’s growth investment and presence at BWI Marshall Airport. We look forward to marking this next milestone in Southwest’s continued service to the region.”

“This action today underscores the longstanding successful partnership between Southwest Airlines and the State of Maryland” said Maryland Transportation Secretary Greg Slater. “As our economy and our transportation networks continue to recover from the effects of the pandemic this is a project that will benefit the airport and the airline while supporting jobs.”

The new maintenance facility will be the first in the Northeastern United States for Southwest Airlines. Southwest Airlines currently serves about 70 percent of passenger traffic at BWI. According to the airline there are more than 4000 Southwest employees at BWI including technical and maintenance personnel.

“We thank the Board of Public Works for supporting this major addition” said Ricky Smith Executive Director for BWI Marshall Airport. “For more than 25 years Southwest Airlines has served our market with excellent customer service and efficient flights to many domestic and international destinations. We look forward to this next chapter of the airline’s history at BWI Marshall Airport.”

BWI has seen a strong rebound in passenger traffic as the state continues its recovery from the pandemic. While still below 2019 figures the airport’s departing passenger traffic in August was up 120% from the same period in August 2020. About 95% of airport food and retail concessions are now open at BWI .",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbG9mZnBhdGguY29tL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1sYXVuY2hlcy1uZXctcm91dGVzLWNvbWluZy1pbi0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines Launches New Routes Coming in 2022,"Post may contain affiliate links; we may receive compensation if you click links to those products.

After the departure of Southwest from Newark Liberty International Airport the Department of Transportation noted that those vacant slots would not go to any airline moving forward. The government agency announced that the airport will freeze the eight vacant landing slots into New Jersey’s largest airport and will only be unfrozen once a low-cost carrier or ultra-low-cost carrier sees the need to use them for further expansion.

The airport is currently a hub for United Airlines but has seen expansion and competition in recent years from JetBlue Spirit Sun Country and Allegiant. The airport hopes that in doing this it will promote low airfare and keep existing legacy carriers from absorbing the gates previously used by Southwest.

Southwest vacated service to six cities when it pulled flights back in 2019 citing that the entire market was not profitable for the airline. Those routes included service to Chicago Nashville Austin Denver Phoenix and St. Louis. All six routes are covered by other airlines with St. Louis being the only route to sit under United’s sole control. At least one low-cost carrier — ranging from Frontier to Spirit to JetBlue — competes on the other routes.

Southwest also still serves some of the retired Newark routes in the New York City market through New York’s La Guardia Airport. The airline flies to Chicago Nashville Denver and St. Louis from the airport while Austin and Phoenix services were lost completely when the low cost carrier departed the New Jersey airport.

JetBlue offers the most routes of the low-cost carriers out of Newark with 36-year-round destinations ranging from Orlando and Charleston to Aguadilla Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo Dominican Republic. While JetBlue will not be growing in the near future Spirit and Frontier continue their Newark expansion with Spirit starting Miami flights in October and Frontier inaugurating service to Montego Bay Jamaica; Nassau Bahamas and Providenciales Turks and Caicos in December.

“JetBlue has long advocated for more opportunities which will allow smaller carriers to grow and compete against legacy carriers — particularly at congested airports across greater New York City. One of the most common requests from our customers is more JetBlue service at the New York metro area’s three major airports” noted JetBlue spokesman Philip Stewart.

This move comes after the airlines originally had to fight to keep the slots active. The Federal Aviation Administration had initially planned to remove the Southwest slots from the table when the airline departed noting a potential reduction in Newark’s congestion as a result of the disbanded services. Spirit Airlines sued the FAA citing a potential obstruction to their growth plans at the airport with the slot retirements. Spirit would go on to win the case.

If you buy through our links we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process.

The first pieces of Starbucks' Halloween merchandise has finally landed in stores including the infamous glow-in-the-dark cold cup which features a spiderweb design.

More Halloween merchandise is expected to drop throughout September and October.

We'll update this story with sneak peeks for new Halloween cups as more information becomes available.

They're here! The first pieces of Starbucks' new Halloween merchandise collection have finally started to pop up in cafés and Target retail locations across the country. After becoming a monstrous success (see what we did there?!) last year the coffee giant brought back its beloved glow-in-the-dark cold cups for another spooky Halloween season much to the gloomy glee of adoring fans.

The new Halloween-themed pieces are part of a larger new collection of mugs cold cups tumblers and water bottles released for the Fall 2021 season. Eagle-eyed collectors have already spotted a few variations of Starbucks' classic merchandise themed to autumnal motifs; including a purple-tinted Kaleidoscope cup a few different embellished cold cups a new vibrant neon green textured cup and a whole slew of new mugs.

If you're like us and crept your way through social media channels you'll know that as many as 25 pieces of merchandise are slowly rolling out nationwide this month. The delayed release of these Halloween pieces is better timed to the official start of fall this upcoming Wednesday September 22.

The clear favorite so far for many fans is the glow-in-the-dark spider-web adorned cold cup which has been spotted in both 16oz Grande and 24oz Venti size variations. Resellers on platforms like Etsy have (they usually retail starting at $15 USD) with fans snatching them up online.

While we have yet to be able to confirm whether these glow in the dark Starbucks has also released a new Halloween cold cup featuring a delightfully eerie black cat figure. It seems to exist as a Venti-sized option — but if you're hoping to get your hands on a Halloween exclusive that isn't a traditional iced coffee tumbler there's also a glow-in-the-dark water bottle as well.

They've yet to be spotted but some fans are expecting another full set of reusable hot coffee cups from Starbucks this fall. This special set may contain up to six cups featuring Halloween designs but it's unclear when they'll drop just yet. We'll update this post with more information and a sneak peek of these new cups when available.

Starbucks' Halloween collection is known by collectors to be notoriously hard to snag given their popularity. If you're on the hunt for a glow-in-the-dark cup to add to your collection your best bet may be to start at a local Target retail location as it's known that Starbucks' merchandise (including Target exclusives) often land here first. Happy shopping!

Grace Dean/Insider



Starbucks baristas are allowed to blend fruit into drinks but not other food items.

Still baristas say some customers request that cake pastries or egg bites be blended into drinks.

One said she'd even asked been asked to add protein shakes to drinks.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Should you ask your Starbucks barista to blend a cake pop brownie or cookie into your drink chances are they'll say no.

It's against company policy for baristas to blend food into Starbucks drinks like Frappuccinos. But that hasn't stopped customers from trying.

""I've had people asked for some food items blended"" Alexis Rivera a former Starbucks shift manager in New Jersey told Insider. ""We don't do that.""

A Starbucks representative said baristas ""may handcraft blended beverages using ingredients offered at Starbucks stores including sauces syrups espresso coffee and tea Evolution Fresh juices and bananas and blueberries.""

""Food items in store (including baked goods and egg bites) are not approved additions to blended beverages at Starbucks"" the representative added.

Numerous former baristas however told Insider they had gotten requests – which they said they rejected – for food to be blended into drinks. This included cake cake pops Danish pastries cookies and brownies.

Rivera said some customers brought in their own food or protein shakes and asked for them to be blended.

The baristas said this happened only with in-store customers because adding food to drinks wasn't listed as a modification on the Starbucks app.

Speaking about in-store orders Rivera said ""technically if you're not able to charge for it in the drink it's not something that can be made.""

But she said some customers would seek a workaround: ""If you're requesting those items too you're buying them separately like a Frappuccino but you're asking 'Hey can you blend them for me?' Some places do – some places don't.""

""Making items like that during rushes where you don't even have enough people to go to the back and clean them properly that's most likely why they're declined"" she added.

Different baristas Insider spoke with had different attitudes. ""It's not worth risking my job to add a brownie to a blender"" a current barista in Florida said.







Rivera said one customer had even asked her colleague to blend egg bites into a drink though the customer ultimately described it as a joke.

Rivera said her colleague didn't follow through with the request – but a former barista in Indiana who asked for anonymity because she still visited the store as a customer said she had actually blended egg bites into a Frappuccino.

""It was just gross to hand out"" she said.

The Indiana barista said she had also blended a melted brownie into a frappuccino too. She said her manager had told her that though she technically wasn't supposed to blend food into drinks she could tell the customer they could make it as a one-off.

A former barista in British Columbia who asked to stay anonymous because she might return to work at the chain said customers often asked for their Refreshers which usually contained liquid ice and fruit pieces to be blended.

""A lot of the time we'd be like 'We can do it but we'd rather not put the fruit in it because the fruit gets stuck and it jams the blender'"" she said.

""They're not really designed for that kind of thing"" she added saying the staff at her store once broke a blender blending dried fruit into a drink.

Asking for fruit blended into their drinks is just another way customers are making their drinks orders more complex. Starbucks baristas told Insider they're sick of making TikTok-inspired drinks too sometimes with ""mile-long stickers"" listing order customizations.

While the Delta variant of the coronavirus has again delayed plans by many companies to bring employees back to offices en masse workers who have been trickling into Midtown are discovering that many of their favorite haunts for a quick cup of coffee and a muffin in the morning or sandwich or salad at lunchtime have disappeared. A number of those that are open are operating at reduced hours or with limited menus.

With the pandemic keeping millions of New York City office employees home for the past year restaurants coffee shops apparel retailers and others struggled to stay afloat.

An Ethiopian shepherd allegedly saw goats become excited and even dance after eating coffee berries tasted the mysterious berries himself and thus coffee was discovered.

Of course the reality was nothing like the legend and anthropological research provides us with evidence that the Oromo tribe has been crushing coffee beans and mixing them with animal oil for thousands of years.

How did coffee “come down” from the mountains of North Africa to become the second most widely consumed beverage in the world after water?

In the 15th century Arab slaveowners brought captives from the Oromo tribe from Ethiopia to the Yemeni port city of Mokha. Coffee beans joined the captives on that miserable journey and thus coffee entered the history of the modern world. By the way the famous “Caffè mocha” is named after this city. It was the people of the Shadhiliya Sufi order in Mokha who fell in love with coffee because of its invigorating effect and drank it during long meditations. According to Islamic historians coffee took on its present form at that time and that is how Arabica the most popular coffee species in the world appeared. Arabica is currently accounts for about 60% of global coffee production. The word “coffee” itself is derived from the Arabic word “qahwah” which means “wine”.

Little by little coffee spread throughout the Middle East the Islamic world through trade caravans. The Ottoman Empire the hegemonic state of the time played an invaluable role in transforming the beverage of marginal religious orders merchants and shepherds into a daily social drink. There were taverns and restaurants in Istanbul and Anatolia serving alcohol in violation of Islamic rules but most people the majority of whom were religious gathered in places that were not haram—baths markets and mosques. Since each of these places served a specific purpose people could not freely discuss topics they wanted. Coffee houses pulled the Muslim community out of their homes creating a perfect environment for pastime even at night. As the population of the empire grew rapidly thousands of people migrated from the rural provinces to big cities. Young migrants huddled in tiny rooms in those big cities and at night flocked to the centers of social life that were coffee houses.

But wealthy city folk were frequent customers of these establishments as well.

Wealthy and noble people received their guests mainly in the reception rooms of their homes and spent time with them there. However in accordance with Islamic culture most people did not allow outsiders into their homes and coffee houses were the obvious choice for a meeting place for them.

It should also be noted that people who gathered in coffee houses were exclusively men. Women went to baths to socialize so separate coffee establishments began to emerge in bathhouses. The famous Ottoman historian Ibrahim Peçevi writes: “Some people who liked to have fun especially poets and writers began to gather together and organize gatherings of twenty to thirty people. Some read books and beautiful writings some played backgammon or chess. Sometimes they talked about new ghazals poetry and literature.”

At a time when the Islamic world was living its golden age in coffee houses the West was living the early years of the Renaissance and was still far removed from modern culture. In the 15th century beverages such as coffee and tea had yet to reach the shores of Europe. The concept of sanitation at that time was barely existent: drinking water was so dangerous that beer was the main beverage in Europe. Until the end of the Middle Ages England drank 350 liters of beer per capita and Germany 400-600 liters—Europe lived in a constant state of semi-inebriation. However in the early 17th century Venetian Dutch and Italian merchants introduced coffee to European culture. The first coffee house in Europe was opened in 1652 in London. At the beginning of the 18th century the number of coffee houses exceeded 2000. Penny universities as they became known as one penny was the going price of a cup of coffee created a new environment for socialization in Europe. Progressive people of that time now preferred coffee houses to pubs where patrons were usually drunk and armed and one could easily lose one’s life because of one’s language. Coffee houses played a major role in transforming Europe from an abode of darkness and stagnation to an enlightened and liberal society. Some of the major world-famous companies grew from small groups gathering in coffee houses into hegemonic organizations. The insurance titan Lloyd’s started out as a coffee house as a place for information exchange gathering of sailors and insurers. The East India Company one of the most ultra-greedy organizations in world history also owes its existence to a coffee house. Businessmen of that time gathered in coffee houses in central London to share news about the American colonies monarchy and Parliament.

Of course not everyone liked coffee houses especially women. In 1674 a pamphlet was published in which a group of London women came out against coffee. The Women’s Petition Against Coffee read: “…our men who in former Ages were justly esteemed the Ablest Performers in Christendome. But to our unspeakable Grief we find of late a very sensible Decay of that true Old English Vigor… Never did Men wear greater breeches or carry less in them of any Mettle whatsoever… …we can Attribute to nothing more than the Excessive use of that Newfangled Abominable Heathenish Liquor called COFFEE which Riffling Nature of her Choicest Treasures and Drying up the Radical Moisture has so Eunucht our Husbands and Cripple our more kind Gallants that they are become as Impotent as Age and as unfruitful as those Desarts whence that unhappy Berry is said to be brought…”

By the end of the 18th century coffee had already enchanted Europe and Prussia the superpower of the time was no exception. Frederick the Great did his best to get rid of coffee. He signed a decree on the issuance of licenses for coffee production (roasting). At first glance this ordinance which is an example of commercial culture did not in fact grant this right to anyone. Of course those close to Frederick’s court were an exception. Friedrich said “It is disgusting to notice the increase in the quantity of coffee used by my subjects and the amount of money that goes out of the country as a consequence. Everybody is using coffee; this must be prevented. My people must drink beer. His Majesty was brought up on beer and so were both his ancestors and officers. Many battles have been fought and won by soldiers nourished on beer and the King does not believe that coffee-drinking soldiers can be relied upon to endure hardships in case of another war.”

Of course this ban of Friedrich’s did not last long. Secret coffee houses and smuggling were even more thriving in Berlin and Brandenburg. After the death of Frederick the Great in 1786 the Prussian government buried the meaningless fight on coffee with the king who had started it. Vienna was turning into the next Coffee Hegemony. It was in this city that they first start adding milk and sugar to coffee. Thus the most popular beverage of coffee lovers “Kapuziner”—better known by its Italian name “cappuccino”—was born. Legend has it that the Viennese citizen Georg Franz Kolschitzky obtained a license to serve coffee in the city for his bravery in the defense of Vienna in 1683. The first coffee beans he acquired were from the supplies left behind by the Ottoman army.

In 1669 the Turkish ambassador Suleiman Aga brought coffee to the French court. A low-ranking bureaucrat sent by Mehmed IV as an insult he impressed the French with his delicate oriental culture. Suleiman Aga is portrayed as a rich and charismatic Turkish prince in Molière’s famous five-act play Le Bourgeois gentilhomme. Thanks to him this beverage with pungent aroma made in an odd manner and served in special china cups started a unique fashion among the political elite of Paris.

The famous Café de Procope which opened its doors in Paris in 1686 became a place frequented by people who changed the history of the world—Jean-Jacques Russo Voltaire Benjamin Franklin Thomas Jefferson to name a few. Danton Marat and Robespierre laid the foundations of the French Revolution at the Café de Procope. Revolutionary journalist Camille Desmoulins who encouraged people to attack the Bastille delivered his impassioned speech standing on a table at the Café du Foy.

Coffee kindled the spirit of revolution in the people of France inspired Voltaire to talk about human rights and condemned thousands of Africans to death on coffee plantations.

Coffee enriched Europeans not only spiritually but also economically. Addicted to caffeine Europeans wanted to free the coffee trade from the Ottoman monopoly.

In the middle of the 17th century Dutch colonists exported coffee from India and began growing it on Sumatra and Java. The Dutch filled European markets with coffee from their new colonies and took slavery to a new level. The Dutch writer Multatuli wrote about the colonial abuse in his famous novel Max Havelaar published in 1860.

The Dutch were not the only ones who wanted to make a fortune in the coffee trade. In 1720 French bureaucrat Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee to the Caribbean. Thus the whole world was gripped by coffee fever. Writer William Walker said: “No matter where it appears coffee has always evoked revolutionary feelings. This made people think that coffee was a drink of radicals. When people start thinking they pose a threat to tyrants.“

The strangest thing is that coffee the beverage that led Europeans to freedom and liberty brought people in other parts of the world only suffering and shackles. Millions of indigenous peoples in Asia America and Africa were forced to work as slaves in order to produce this magical drink. About 60% of the coffee consumed worldwide in the 1780s was grown in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti).

French writer and botanist Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre wrote “I know not whether coffee and sugar are necessary for Europe’s fortune but I know for certain that these two plants have been disastrous for two parts of the world. America has been depopulated in order to make space for them to grow; Africa is being depopulated in order to get people to farm them.”

The French Revolution began in 1789 and excited and inflamed slaves in Saint-Domingue. In 1804 Haiti finally gained its independence.

However the largest slave state in the Western world was Brazil and it was one of the last countries to abolish slavery. In the first half of the 19th century alone 1.5 million Africans were brought to Brazil to work in latifundia. Brazil brought coffee production to an unthinkable level and it became the daily drink of the average person. In the 1920s Brazil accounted for 80% of world coffee production and did not yield leadership to any other country for 150 years. Although coffee brought Brazil unprecedented wealth it also took a heavy toll on its population and nature. However other Central American countries seeing the benefits coffee gave this country repeated Brazil’s mistakes.

Before World War I Belgian inventor George Washington began producing ground instant coffee and in 1918 the U.S. military purchased all of Washington’s coffee and added it to the army rations. American generals believed that soldiers could fight better on caffeine. By the end of the war the US military was producing 40 million cups of coffee a day.

However in the 19th century the “dark days” of coffee began and a disease that spread in Sri Lanka struck almost all strains of Arabica produced in Asia destroying entire plantations. At the same time a new species of coffee Robusta was discovered in Central Africa. It was resistant to the disease and contained twice as much caffeine as Arabica. But Robusta had its own issue: it was very bitter even for lovers of strong coffee. In order to soften the bitter taste of Robusta it was mixed with Arabica.

Finally in 1938 Nestle began producing coffee under the brand name Nescafe and became famous almost overnight.

Following is a partial list of free ways to experience Where History Lives.

The ACCORD Freedom Trail

St. Augustine played an important part in the country's struggle for civil rights. In the early 1960s the city was the scene of lunch counter sit-ins protests and marches. Dr. Martin Luther King visited the city several times and even spent a night in jail here on a trespassing charge after he and others attempted to eat at a local restaurant on June 11 1964.

Florida state parks:Fort Mose's 'Flight to Freedom' to become year-round Black history trail in St. Augustine

To honor the struggle and sacrifice of hundreds of local people involved in the protests the city's civil rights leaders have placed markers at historical sites around St. Augustine. Each stop on the trail which goes through the community of Lincolnville and can easily be walked explains what the area is known for.

Stops on the trail include the former dental office of civil rights leader Dr. Robert B. Hayling at 79 Bridge St. Hayling held planning meetings in the building.

For information on the trail visit accordfreedomtrail.org

St. Augustine National Cemetery

The St. Augustine National Cemetery on Marine Street is a solemn reminder of the sacrifices made by members of the military.

Dedicated a national cemetery in 1881 the 1.4 acres was once part of the grounds of a Franciscan monastery. Today it serves as the resting place of more than 2700 people.

Notable on the south side of the cemetery are three pyramids made of coquina stone. Dedicated on Aug. 15 1842 the pyramids contain the remains of soldiers killed in action or who died in service between 1835 and 1842 during the Second Seminole War.

The cemetery is open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Fort Mose

Located north of St. Augustine off of U.S. 1 Fort Mose Historic State Park features 40 acres of history.

In 1688 the land was home to a village of African slaves who had escaped from English colonies in the north and found refuge in Spanish Florida. Historians consider it the site of the first legal Black community in what is now the United States.

The state park has an interactive museum telling Fort Mose's history and features picnic areas an observation and birding boardwalk and a kayak launch.

In 1994 the site was designated a National Historic Landmark and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The visitor center is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday through Monday.

The grounds are open daily from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m.

Admission to park grounds is free.

To enter the visitor center there is a $2 fee per adult. Children under 6 are free.

Fish Island Preserve

On the southeast side of the Matanzas River by the State Road 312 bridge the nearly 60-acre Fish Island Preserve is the City of St. Augustine's newest park.

The waterfront park has many walking trails and lots of wildlife. Jesse Fish the park's namesake ran a citrus plantation on the land in the 1700s and visitors can see what remains of his home's coquina foundation.

With the help of volunteers government officials and the North Florida Land Trust the State of Florida bought the land with $6.5 million in Florida Forever funds to keep it undeveloped. The City of St. Augustine manages the property for the state.

Fort Matanzas National Monument

Located 15 miles south of St. Augustine the Fort Matanzas National Monument is a Spanish colonial fort run by the National Park Service.

The small coquina fort completed in 1742 was designed to protect the southern approach to St. Augustine and the much larger Castillo de San Marcos from British attack.

The park service runs a free ferry to the fort where visitors can see a recreation of the soldiers' living quarters and historical cannons as well as climb to the roof of the building.

President Calvin Coolidge made the fort a national monument on Oct. 15 1924.

Fort Matanzas National Monument is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

The ferry runs Wednesday through Sunday on a reduced schedule with limited capacity. Boarding passes are available on a first-come basis.

The so-called mini-mill will combine two electric arc furnaces which primarily use steel scrap and are far more energy-efficient than traditional integrated plants that are fed by coal. The company expects to begin construction in the first half of 2022 and start producing in 2024.

The steel giant's board has authorized an exploratory site selection process for the location of the mini-mill according to the statement. Potential locations include Alabama and Arkansas where U.S. Steel has existing EAF operations as well as greenfield sites.

U.S. Steel Corp. Chief Executive Officer David Burritt told The Wall Street Journal that the site hasn't been selected but that Arkansas and Alabama are being considered.

U.S. Steel is the relatively new owner of Big River Steel which in 2013 helped sustain and grow the steel industry in Arkansas and more specifically in Mississippi County when it built a $1.3 billion ""flex mill"" near Osceola that employs more than 500. About 15 months later it announced plans for a $1.2 billion expansion.

""We welcome the opportunity to compete for business expansion projects statewide that will lead to more high-paying jobs for Arkansans"" Chelsea O'Kelley a spokeswoman for the Arkansas Economic Development Commission said Friday. ""However per agency protocol we do not comment on specific projects.""

Clif Chitwood director of the Mississippi County Economic Development Commission said ""Like my friends at the AEDC always say we can neither confirm nor deny. Mississippi County has proven to be a hospitable and profitable place for steel production for two decades and we want to continue doing that.""

About 3000 people in the county are directly employed by steel producers such as Nucor Corp. which began its Mississippi County operations in 1988 and U.S. Steel. At least 1200 more are employed by other steel-related businesses and suppliers.

Chitwood estimated that 40% of the workers directly employed by the mills are residents of Mississippi County. ""Almost 100% of the jobs that supply the mills and jobs with all the steel-affiliated companies and businesses are held by residents here"" Chitwood said.

U.S. Steel's announcement comes as domestic futures prices for steel have more than tripled in the past year. The plan to build a new mill is the latest sign that steelmakers are growing more comfortable that higher prices will persist.

While the production increase has produced a windfall for domestic suppliers it's driving up the cost of everything from automobiles to wind turbines to kitchen appliances as the world recovers from the pandemic.

The company also estimated that it would report record earnings for the third quarter on the back of the strong prices which will allow it to reduce debt.

The benefits of higher prices are being felt across the industry. Earlier Thursday Nucor Inc. the largest U.S. steelmaker said it expects record earnings through the end of the year and Steel Dynamics Inc. on Wednesday forecast fourth-quarter earnings to be stronger than its previous guidance.

U.S. Steel characterized the planned mill expected to produce 3 million tons of flat-rolled steel products as part of the efforts to achieve its 2030 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 20% according to the statement.

""The statistics on brain and aneurysms are very grim"" David McCausland Chairman of Maine's Brain Aneurysm Awareness (BA) said. ""About 40000 people a year in this country will have a ruptured brain aneurysm.""

According to BA a brain aneurysm is a weak bulge on the wall of an artery in the brain that can rupture. McCausland started the annual event 13 years ago after his niece Kimberly Tudor died of an aneurysm rupture.

""Then 10 years ago we were joined by the family of Karolina Kurka who passed away at age 27 from a ruptured aneurysm and we started the 5k in her honor"" McCausland said.





McCausland said the event's goal is to show support for those that a brain aneurysm has affected and spread awareness on the signs of one.

""The thing we try to drive home is to pay attention to that severe onset sudden thunderclap headache not the kind of headache that takes a half-hour to come"" McCausland said. ""But the one that feels like a knife or a gunshot to the head that's the headache we want you paying attention to.""





McCausland's wife Heidi McCausland noticed this pain in her head back in 2006 that ended up being a brain aneurysm. She is one of 30 Maine survivors that attended 2021's event.

""I had a severe sudden headache and both my arms went numb when my husband was calling 9-1-1"" Heidi said. ""My heart rate skyrocketed. I had trouble walking trouble speaking. And by the time the EMTs got there my symptoms had subsided a little bit.""

McCausland was not transported to the E.R. but said she wanted to go because it was something she had never felt before. After doctors saw blood in her cat scan she was rushed to Maine Medical Center where they performed an endovascular procedure.

""In traditional neurosurgery they typically would have to go in shave the patient's head and actually opened the skull up to get to the brain aneurysm"" Bruce Rice Territory Manager of Stryker said. ""But we now access the arterial system through either your wrist or your groin and we have a slew of products that we use under X-ray guidance to drive up to the brain aneurysm.""





Rice and Associate Territory Manager of Stryker Nikki Greenhalgh attended BA's event representing Stryker specializing in endovascular neurosurgery which makes and sells stroke equipment in the United States. The two came to the event with an aneurysm simulator to show people how a rupture is prevented.

""It's really important for us to be patient advocates and help save lives in the small ways that we do with consulting with physicians and the staff"" Greenhalgh said.

Maine's BA holds a support group the last Thursday of every month at the Dana Center MMC in Portland.

Here's What You Need to Know: The Department of Defense is finding itself looking abroad for capabilities that the U.S. military desperately needs.

Artillery is reclaiming its place as the King of Battle. Recent conflicts in Ukraine and the Caucasus have demonstrated that long-range precision-fire systems both artillery and rockets are especially deadly against fixed positions and stationary or massed field formations particularly when operating with drones to provide accurate targeting. When it comes to indirect-fire systems the U.S. military is outnumbered and outranged by its great-power competitors most notably Russia.

In response the U.S. Army has made the acquisition of new indirect-fire systems its highest modernization priority. As part of this effort the Army is exploring the value of procuring a mobile truck-mounted 155-millimeter howitzer to replace existing towed 155-millimeter artillery in the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs). Fortunately there are several potential contenders for this mission most of them foreign.

Winning the next firefight in a high-intensity conflict will require indirect-fire systems with additional range greater precision and enhanced maneuverability. This is the driving rationale behind the U.S. Army’s number one modernization priority: Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF). The goal of this effort is to restore overmatch in indirect fire providing new capabilities that can outrange outshoot and outmaneuver those of prospective adversaries.

In this new environment locating and engaging an adversary’s mobile long-range fire systems while protecting one’s own will be a priority. As explained in a recent public presentation by the U.S. Army’s Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville much of the Army’s modernization investments are directed at developing the sensors networks and fire systems to engage such targets in a matter of seconds rather than the ten or more minutes it takes today.

Responding to this new reality the Army is investing in upgrading and modernizing its artillery systems. It has a well-established program to upgrade the existing Paladin self-propelled 155-millimeter howitzers so they can better operate with the armored brigade combat teams of which they are a part. Under the LRPF program the Army is developing a longer-range variant of the Paladin called the Extended Range Cannon Artillery that is expected to be able to hit targets at ranges of at least seventy and possibly one hundred kilometers.

There is a problem when it comes to non-armored units most significantly the SBCTs. The SBCTs are mechanized units primarily built around variants of the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle. These units have proven themselves to be extremely agile and effective in operations in multiple theaters.

But for the high-end fight the Army is planning to enhance the lethality and survivability of the SBCTs. One element of such a program is to replace the SBCT’s 155-millimeter towed artillery with a system that has better range rate of fire survivability and maneuverability.

The Army did not have the time or resources to undertake a new start program. Instead it went on a global search for existing designs that were production-ready. The U.S. Army conducted a 2021 “shoot-off” of candidates for a truck-mounted 155-millimeter howitzer acquisition to equip its SBCTs. Of the companies that indicated an interest in this program only one is entirely U.S.-owned and operated.

Apart from the United States the leading candidates are those from the UK Israel France and Serbia. Each offers enhanced range rate of fire survivability mobility and reduced manpower/maintenance compared to the existing towed 155-millimeter system.

One entrant is BAE Systems Bofors’ Archer-FH77BW L52 self-propelled howitzer mounted on an armored 6x6 chassis. With its advanced fire control system and automatic loader Archer can set up fire half a dozen rounds and move within two minutes. This also means it can operate with a smaller crew—as few as two—than the current towed 155-millimeter system. And with a top speed of 70 kilometers/hour it can keep up with the other SBCT vehicles. Archer is currently operated by both the Swedish and Norwegian armies.

Another competitor is the ATMOS Iron Sabre system offered by Elbit Systems of America a subsidiary of Israeli-based Elbit Systems. The proposed version with a range of more than 40 kilometers could be mounted on either a 6x6 or 8x8 truck and will be equipped with advanced targeting technology and a mechanical/automatic loader that will allow it to operate with a crew of just four. The system can set up and fire its first round within thirty seconds and a salvo of up to six projectiles and move again within two minutes. ATMOS is in use with the Israel Defense Forces and 50 percent of the Israeli version of the system is built in the United States.

French company Nexter is also bringing its Caesar system to the shootout. Caesar operated by the French army is reported to be able to fire six shots in under two minutes. The system’s 8x8 version can carry thirty rounds while the 6x6 variant can carry eighteen. According to Nexter Caesar has an adapted automatic loading system and can be operated with a small crew.

The U.S. entrant has been dubbed Brutus by its designer AM General. The platform uses a unique soft recoil system that allows for rapid setup shooting and movement while minimizing maintenance and manpower requirements. Because it uses existing howitzers prime movers and other components Brutus should have a short time to field.

Finally there is the NORA B-52 M21 155-millimeter howitzer a Serbian-manufactured system being offered in the United States by Global Ordinance. The system can carry thirty-six rounds twelve of which are stored in the automatic loader. It also has an automatic navigation system and advanced fire controls.

Increasingly the Department of Defense is finding itself looking abroad for capabilities that the U.S. military desperately needs but are not always available from the domestic aerospace and defense industry. It is fortunate that the Pentagon has access to a broad-based and robust international defense industrial base. This is a major strategic advantage in an era of global competition. Whichever company wins the shootout though the work will be done in the United States.

While this year's phone is more of a refinement of last year's iPhone 12 line those that crave staying on that bleeding edge might essentially get a free iPhone 13 Pro Max by doing a trade-in that includes up to $1290 toward the phone.

Let me curtail that this isn't for everyone. In fact it's pretty specific. You need to have purchased an iPhone 12 Pro Max and be such a phone enthusiast that you already know you want to upgrade to the 13 Pro Max even though it's not as significant a leap as say moving from iPhone X or iPhone XS.

You also need to either be interested in switching to T-Mobile or already be a current T-Mobile customer and you would like to sign up for (or agree to keep) their Magenta Max plan -- which includes perks like the HD-tier of Netflix and 4K video streaming while on a cellular connection.

So are you a big phone fan that also wants T-Mobile's most expensive plan? If so here's what you can do to get the iPhone 13 Pro Max essentially for free.

T-Mobile's iPhone 12 Pro Max offer is listed on Apple's website. Apple

First start by shopping for the iPhone 13 Pro Max directly from Apple's website. When you do select T-Mobile to get the details on the trade in offer which spells out that the iPhone 12 Pro Max comes with up to $1290 in credit. If your phone is in good condition (meaning no cracked screen or other damage) $790 of that will come from Apple. The remaining $500 will come from T-Mobile in the form of a bill credit.

The credits are being given regardless of the storage capacity of your iPhone 12 Pro Max so if you purchased the 128GB version last year at $1099 you might be able to trade up to the 256GB version of the 13 Pro Max and pay for part of the phone's taxes.

For the first $790 Apple will either give that to you as an instant credit if you choose to pay for the phone in monthly installments or as a credit after you trade in the 12 Pro Max. Once Apple's part of the deal is set you'll receive a promo code to enter on T-Mobile's website to receive the remaining $500 as bill credits dished out over the course of 24 months (a little less than $21 per month).

The T-Mobile offer listed on Apple's website also shows trade-in offers if you are handing over an iPhone X or iPhone 11. Apple

Yes as is often the case since the ""death"" of the two-year contract if you want to receive the full $500 you will need to stay on T-Mobile for those 24 months. But $1290 should cover the cost of the 256GB iPhone 13 Pro Max or be just a few hundred more for the 512GB or 1TB option.

This method also gets you into T-Mobile's ""Forever Upgrade"" program that guarantees that your new Pro Max will be worth at least $800 in two years should you want to trade it into the carrier then.

Watch this: What the iPhone 13 is still missing 08:22

A hidden twist for those who did a deal on last year's 12 Pro Max

Here's where your mileage might further vary. We asked T-Mobile on Friday if this promotion stacks onto prior deals offered by the carrier over the last year for the iPhone 12 Pro Max. They said yes and if that holds up you might be able to pocket whatever promotion that was and get the iPhone 13 Pro Max covered by the new credits.

So long as you stay with T-Mobile for the remainder of that financing term (which you probably plan to in order to get the $500 discount we discussed above) you should still be able to continue getting those credits even if you trade in the phone to Apple.

Do note that if you switch before your term is up you will forfeit the T-Mobile credits from the Apple deal and be on the hook for any remaining balances. Carrier math!

In my personal experience when I called T-Mobile's customer service I was told that doing the trade-in would necessitate that I pay off the remaining balance of the iPhone 12 Pro Max I bought last summer with a $500 bill credit that is being dispersed over two years.

As of 7 a.m. on Monday Entergy said there were more than 888000 power outages in Louisiana after Hurricane Ida thrashed much of the state Sunday evening snapping cables damaging buildings uprooting trees and spreading debris along roads.

The Japanese investment conglomerate just announced it has launched its second Latin America-focused fund with a $3 billion capital commitment from the company that may grow as the fund explores “options to raise additional capital” according to SoftBank. The vehicle follows hot on the heels of SoftBank’s debut Latin America-focused fund announced in March 2019 with an initial $2 billion in committed capital.

It’s easy to see what all the fuss is about. Led by Marcelo Claure CEO of SoftBank Group International and COO of SoftBank Group Corp. the outfit’s roughly four dozen employees — who operate out of Miami São Paulo and Mexico City — have helped SoftBank identify and fund 48 startups into which it has plugged $3.5 billion and according to the firm which feature a combined (on paper notably) net IRR of 85%.

Among the so-called unicorns that SoftBank has backed — and in some cases helped drive into unicorn territory — are QuintoAndar Rappi Mercado Bitcoin Gympass and MadeiraMadeira. Recently it also co-led a $350 million Series D round in Argentine personal finance management app Ualá.

It’s so busy that it just brought aboard two new managing partners at the end of last week to help out with all that investing.

Amazingly overseeing investments in Latin America is just one of the many roles that Claure a native of Bolivia plays for SoftBank. (He also oversees a vast portfolio of SoftBank’s operating companies including Arm Brightstar Fortress SB Energy and Boston Dynamics; he oversees SoftBank’s ownership in T-Mobile US; and he serves as executive chairman of WeWork which he ran as interim CEO after founder Adam Neumann was forced to resign.) Still one senses that it may be his greatest passion right now and we’re thrilled to say that he’ll be joining us at Disrupt on the morning of Thursday September 23rd to talk all about it.

If you care about where SoftBank is shopping in Latin America right now — or generally want to understand better what sparked the torrid pace of investing there that the industry has seen over the last 18 months — this is a conversation you won’t want to miss.

Even better Claure joins a whole host of amazing speakers at Disrupt including Canva CEO Melanie Perkins actor-entrepreneur Ryan Reynolds and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.

VIEW GALLERY - 3 IMAGES

There's a big issue brewing in the GTA community and Rockstar Games should address it as soon as possible. The controversy stems from the recent GTA V Expanded & Enhanced PS5 trailer which has been widely criticized by Grand Theft Auto players. The footage promises high-end graphics that many gamers say look similar to the PS4 and Xbox One versions and the next-gen re-release is being called a ""cash grab"" as a result.

Fans are using YouTube's dislike feature to send a message to Rockstar Games. Five days ago the trailer had 120000 dislikes with an 83% dislike ratio. Now the trailer has grown by a colossal 87000 dislikes and currently sits at 207000 dislikes representing an 87.7% dislike ratio. Just yesterday it had 197K dislikes.

Rockstar should step in and reveal more in-depth details about GTA V's E&E version if possible. However putting together trailers takes quite a bit of time and the game is still six months away from release.

Interestingly enough Take-Two Interactive's stock started to drop a day before the reveal trailer and has fallen a bit every day since currently sitting at $151.66 per share.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Each leader has spent the past 36 days attempting to sway hearts and minds. Now there are just hours remaining before polls open and they are left to await the judgment of voters.

Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau who began the election with a short walk to Rideau Hall on Aug. 15 kicked off its final day with an event in Montreal and is expected to touch down in several provinces before tomorrow. He was not expected to speak with reporters.

Riding high in pre-election polls Trudeau began the campaign by saying Canadians deserved a say in how Canada would recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

""In this pivotal consequential moment who wouldn't want a say? Who wouldn't want their chance to help decide where our country goes from here?"" he said outside Rideau Hall.

But as that initial lead evaporated and the campaign developed the Liberals' message morphed into a mix of asking voters whom they trust to end the pandemic in the first place and a series of attacks against the Conservatives on climate guns and vaccine policy.

""Because my friends Canada is today at a crossroads at a moment where we have to make a really important choice"" Trudeau said at a rally Sunday ""not just about what we're going to do in the coming months to end this pandemic for good but also how we're going to stay true to our values and meet the challenges of the future with the same level of ambition and devotion to each other that we showed as Canadians every day through the past 18 months.""

More than any other leader Trudeau has spent the campaign on the defensive visiting more ridings currently held by Liberals than those controlled by opposition parties according to an analysis of the leaders' schedules by CBC News.

He spoke Sunday in the riding of King–Vaughan a suburban-rural GTA riding held by cabinet minister Deb Schulte and the type of seat targeted by Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole's centrist pitch.

O'Toole's pitch to moderates

O'Toole was in the same part of the country Sunday holding just a couple major events first in Markham and then in Toronto itself neither of which included speaking with media.

Throughout the campaign O'Toole has sought to forge a moderate image with a platform that focuses on issues like jobs and the economy mental health and includes pitches to workers.

""I want you to know if you're frustrated if you're angry anywhere in this country I want you to know something. I get it. Conservatives get it"" O'Toole said at a Saturday rally in Kitchener Ont.

""Now is the time for Canadians to make a choice"" O'Toole said Sunday in Markham Ont. ""We can choose to settle for second-best — for a party that hardly tries and barely delivers. Or we can choose to believe in a brighter better more united future.""

The Conservatives briefly held a substantial lead in public polling before a decline that brought them to a statistical tie in national support with the Liberals according to CBC's Poll Tracker. They have been caught up in recent days responding to Liberal attacks on vaccine mandates and gun policy.

O'Toole spent the campaign almost exclusively in enemy territory targeting Liberal seats in Ontario Quebec and B.C.

Particular attention has been paid to the suburbs around Toronto in regions such as Durham — near O'Toole's own seat — as well as York and Mississauga.

The anti-Liberal NDP campaign

Meanwhile NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has consistently framed the election as a referendum on Justin Trudeau hammering home the idea that the Liberal leader says the right things but does not follow through.

Singh has relentlessly focused his attacks on Trudeau throughout the campaign only occasionally criticizing Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole and then often by linking the two together ""as teaming up to do things that hurt people.""

""The only way you can be absolutely sure that we invest in child care the only way you can be absolutely sure we fight the climate crisis the only way you can be absolutely sure we invest in healthcare is by voting New Democrat"" Singh said Sunday in Burnaby B.C.

The NDP have been on the offensive throughout almost the entire campaign spending a great deal of time in B.C. and Ontario. The only NDP ridings Singh has visited have been in Hamilton Alexandre Boulerice's riding in Quebec one trip to Winnipeg and Singh's own seat.

The party is polling higher nationally than in 2019 and is hoping to pick up seats in B.C. regain some presence in Quebec and pick up more urban ridings across the country in places such as Toronto and Edmonton.

Given how close this election appears to be it appears likely that the balance of power will once more rest with the NDP and other opposition parties. Singh has studiously avoided directly answering questions about how he would behave in a minority situation.

Bloc looking to hold on in Quebec

Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet was the second-most defensive leader of the campaign not surprising given the Bloc's proportion of seats in Quebec. His campaign appeared to be foundering until just recently when backlash over a question in the English debate over Bills 21 and 96 reinvigorated his pitch to be Quebec's defender in Ottawa.

The Bloc's level of support is likely to lead to an incredibly complex set of circumstances in Quebec where many seats will be strongly contested by three or even four parties.

Many seats in the province came down to just a few percentage points in 2019 and the volatile polls suggest another night of close results and unpredictable splits Monday.

Paul sticking close to home

Green Party Leader Annamie Paul is ending the campaign in Toronto Centre — her own riding which she has rarely left over the past five weeks. Weakened by internal conflict before the campaign the Greens will be hard-pressed to defend their two seats and make any gains based on their level of support in public polling.

But Paul has continued to pitch the Greens as the only true champions of climate action in Canada.

Green Party Leader Annamie Paul takes part in CBC The National’s Face to Face hosted by Rosemary Barton on Sept. 14. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)

""If you want to see more change in Ottawa if you are tired of politics as usual if you do not want Canada to keep walking toward the mirage of climate action and actually seize our destiny as a climate champion then the choice is yours"" Paul said Sunday.

A PPC breakthrough?

Maxime Bernier is ending the campaign in western Canada notably not the riding where he himself is running for the People's Party of Canada in Beauce Que.

The PPC has experienced a surge in support in public polling but Bernier has spent little time in his own riding. He has spent the campaign railing against pandemic restrictions and policies like vaccine mandates position that seem to have won him some fervent supporters.

His party is polling at almost 7 per cent support nationally a number that is thought to threaten Conservative support but it's unclear if any of that vote is concentrated enough to win a seat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbnR3YXN0ZXlvdXJtb25leS5jb20vYmlnZ2VzdC1lbXBsb3llci1ldmVyeS1zdGF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's the company with the most employees in every state,"Every state has certain employers that are vital to the economy. They are the companies and institutions that often have tens of thousands of people on their payroll indirectly supporting other businesses with the cash they pay out to their many workers.

Using records and figures from various sources we’ve put together a list of the single biggest employer in each state. To keep things more interesting and diverse we’ve kept the nebulous organizations of simply “state government” and “federal government” off the list because those are actually the biggest employers in nearly every state.

If you think about it you’ll probably know someone who works for the biggest employer in your own state.

Alabama — Redstone Arsenal

You’ll notice a few U.S. military installations on this list as bases around the nation often employ tens of thousands of people at a time. One of them is Alabama’s Redstone Arsenal built in 1941 which is managed by the Army and employs a whopping 60000 people according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The base is located near Huntsville in Madison County. The next biggest employer is the University of Alabama at Birmingham also a public entity but the state’s biggest private-sector employer is the Alabama Power Company with about 5000 workers.

Alaska — Fort Wainwright

The U.S. Army comes out on top again as the biggest employer in our northernmost state. Fort Wainwright located in Fairbanks was built in 1941 and employs a reported 6100 people. When you think of Alaska you probably think of seafood — after ice and the Iditarod maybe — and that connects to the state’s second-biggest employer UniSea Inc. With 5000 employees this massive fishing operation is listed as the top private-sector company in North America’s “last frontier.”

Arizona — Banner Health

According to an exhaustive database compiled by The Arizona Republic in 2019 the hospital network run by Banner Health is easily the biggest employer in the state. Nearly 45000 people were working for the company at that time which helped it top nationwide powerhouses like Walmart Kroger and McDonald’s all of which also hire many Arizonans. The publication reported that the state’s top 100 employers account for about one in five payroll jobs in Arizona.

Arkansas — Walmart

The state of Arkansas is home to several massive companies that were first founded there as modest operations. From Tyson Foods to J.B. Hunt to Dillard’s many Americans work for companies that came out of Arkansas. But the biggest of all those homegrown success stories is Walmart. The company has nearly 48000 workers on its payroll in Arkansas making it the top private workforce there.

California — University of California

Tech giants like Alphabet (aka Google) Apple and Facebook are big employers across California but they are far from the state’s biggest workplaces. The various branches of the University of California separately occupy 10 spots on the list of the 25 biggest employers in the state according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. When you add up all the employees of the academic giant you get more than 185000 workers across the Golden State easily surpassing Los Angeles Airport’s 45000 workers as the state’s biggest single-company total.

Colorado — Denver International Airport

Major transportation hubs are some of the biggest single-location employers in the nation and Colorado’s Denver International Airport is no different. Roughly 35000 people work at DIA according to the airport which puts it ahead of other major Colorado job creators like Lockheed Martin and HealthOne by a wide margin. The 53 square miles covered by DIA’s property makes the airport larger than the cities of San Francisco Boston and Miami.

Connecticut — Yale New Haven Health System

Hospital systems are among the biggest employers in the United States and more Connecticut residents are employed by Yale New Haven Health System than any other business. More than 22000 people work for the hospital network which paces it ahead of other major companies based there like Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. Praxair and ESPN. What’s more a 2016 Forbes report named Yale New Haven Health as the large employer (at least 5000 workers) where employees were happiest in Connecticut as well.

Delaware — ChristianaCare

The chemical giant DuPont was the largest employer in Delaware for a long time but lost that title in the past few years after downsizing. MBNA was another titan in the state that cut its numbers severely after it was bought out by Bank of America. Meanwhile ChristianaCare a hospital system picked up the slack and maintains a state-leading 12000 workers across Delaware.

Florida — Walmart

It probably won’t surprise you to read that Walt Disney World is reportedly the biggest single-site employer in the United States with more than 77000 people clocking in at the Central Florida resort every day. But it probably would surprise you to know The House of Mouse isn’t the state’s biggest employer overall. That honor belongs to Walmart which employs more than 114000 people across the Sunshine State at an average hourly wage of $15.23 which is well below the state’s overall median hourly wage of $18.07.

Georgia — Emory University

Almost 30000 people in Georgia currently work for Delta Airlines making it the biggest private-sector employer in the entire state. Meanwhile Emory University is the biggest employer overall that isn’t the state government with more than 37000 employees on its payroll across Georgia. Emory’s impact on the economy of the Atlanta region alone is remarkable between the jobs it creates and the thousands of students it houses each year.

Hawaii — The Queen’s Health Systems

As you’d likely expect the single biggest industry across Hawaii is tourism but one hospital network is its biggest job creator. The Queen’s Health Systems has more than 7300 people on its payroll which might sound like a tiny number compared to others on this list but is sizable for a state of fewer than 1.5 million citizens. All those surfing injuries aren’t going to take care of themselves are they?

Healthcare reigns supreme in yet another state. While agriculture and manufacturing have major hiring figures across Idaho St. Luke’s Health System is the state’s single biggest employer. More than 14000 people in the Gem State work for the hospital network according to the Idaho Department of Labor pacing it ahead of Walmart Micron Technology and competitor Saint Alphonsus Health System.

Illinois — Walmart

According to the Illinois Department of Employment Security the industry of healthcare and social assistance employs the most people in the state with more than 800000 people working in that sector as of 2021. Sears was the biggest single employer in Illinois for a long time but long ago lost that mantle making way for Walmart to hold the spot today. According to the retail giant more than 56000 Walmart associates are employed across Illinois making it the single biggest employer that we could find in our research.

Walmart

Indiana — Walmart

Yet another Midwestern state that is dominated by Walmart in terms of its employment figures is Indiana. More than 44000 Hoosiers call Walmart their workplace with 127 stores under the company’s umbrella being operated there as of July 2021. Other major employers include Eli Lilly and Tyson Foods but Walmart reportedly employs more people than any of them.

Iowa — Hy-Vee

It’s somewhat refreshing that Iowa’s biggest employer is a regional supermarket chain that was born in the Hawkeye State. While the University of Iowa claims itself to be the state’s biggest employer with 14000 workers our own math and research find that Hy-Vee should actually hold that title because of the sheer footprint it has across Iowa. Between its corporate headquarters two distribution centers tech office and the more than 150 stores we counted across the state we estimate that roughly 50000 Iowans work for Hy-Vee in some capacity — and that’s a conservative number.

Kansas — Fort Riley

The agriculture industry accounts for a major chunk of the Kansas economy and has the biggest workforce in the state but the U.S. Army’s base at Fort Riley employs more people than any other entity. More than 20000 people work at Fort Riley including service members and civilians. Spirit Aerosystems which is based in Wichita is the biggest private-sector employer in Kansas with 12000 workers expected to be on its payroll by 2024.

Kentucky — UPS

The commonwealth of Kentucky has a very tight race for the title of its biggest employer. While Walmart technically has about 1000 more overall employees in Kentucky than UPS its number includes workers at Sam’s Club stores which is why we’re giving the nod to the shipping giant. UPS and its 29000 workers across the Bluegrass State make up an immense workforce that includes 12000 in Louisville alone.

Louisiana — Walmart

While state government accounts for a reported 57000 jobs in Louisiana we aren’t including them so the honor of the biggest workforce there falls to Walmart. The big-box retailer counts nearly 36000 workers across Louisiana between its flagship and Sam’s Club locations. Other top jobs creators in the state include Willis-Knighton Medical Center and Mistras Group.

Maine — MaineHealth

Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and Walmart combine to employ about 16000 people across Maine but that’s still fewer than the number employed by MaineHealth. The hospital network has at least 18000 employees according to the Maine Department of Labor giving it the biggest workforce in the state. It shouldn’t surprise you when you realize that more than 700 hospitals doctor’s offices labs and assisted-living communities fall under the MaineHealth banner.

Maryland — Fort George G. Meade

While the renowned network of hospitals and institutions under the Johns Hopkins banner employs an impressive 30000 people across Maryland the military is the state’s biggest employer: specifically Fort George G. Meade which is one of the Army’s biggest bases period. Located between Baltimore and Washington Fort Meade has more than 56000 employees on base including civilians and service members.

World-renowned institutions like Harvard University and the University of Massachusetts rank among the biggest employers in the commonwealth but they can’t match its healthcare behemoth. Mass General Brigham recently took a new name in 2019 after previously being known as Partners Healthcare. More than 58000 people in Massachusetts work at Mass General Brigham which is a medical network like some other top employers on this list.

Michigan — General Motors

Automotive production still rules in Michigan — for now at least. If you combine the employees from the University of Michigan and its related Michigan Medicine healthcare banner (roughly 58000 people total) that institution would technically be the biggest employer in Michigan but that seems like cheating. Instead we’re spotlighting General Motors as having the state’s single largest workforce since nearly 47000 people work for the automaker there.

Minnesota — Mayo Clinic

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)

The mighty Minnesota-based Target Corporation employs a reported 31000 people across the state but it’s not the biggest employer there. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester with its 28 Mayo Clinic Health System locations spread across the state is the biggest employer in Minnesota. More than 47000 people reportedly get their paycheck from Mayo Clinic making it quite a formidable workplace.

Mississippi — Ingalls Shipbuilding

An innovative powerhouse Ingalls Shipbuilding is one of the longest-standing large private employers on this list. The company had 11500 workers in Mississippi as of 2021 making it the biggest employer in the state. Ingalls has apparently held that title since 1939 which is remarkable and it looks like the grip won’t be loosening anytime soon. The company recently announced it was looking to add 3000 more employees to its payroll.

Missouri — Walmart

Companies like Boeing and Enterprise Holdings each employ tens of thousands of people across Missouri but neither can touch Walmart’s foothold there. The retail giant counts nearly 44000 residents of Missouri among its workforce making it the single biggest employer in the state. Some reports cite the medical giant BJC Healthcare as Missouri’s biggest employer but with a reported 30000 workers there that’s simply not the case.

Montana — Billings Clinic

Population-wise Montana is one of the smallest states in the nation and that’s why the 10000-plus people reportedly employed by the Billings Clinic is a massive figure there. In addition to being the state’s biggest employer it’s also Montana’s top healthcare supplier. The system also operates in Wyoming but has its biggest presence in Big Sky Country.

Nebraska — University of Nebraska

Omaha’s Offutt Air Force Base is a massive workplace that has 8000 employees but that’s only half of the staff employed by the University of Nebraska. That institution which is comprised of four universities across the state counts 16000 workers among its staff. What’s more the University of Nebraska has been ranked by Forbes as one of the best places to work in the entire state based on a survey of its workers.

Nevada — MGM Resorts

When you think of Nevada your mind has to imagine the bright lights of the Las Vegas Strip so this fact probably doesn’t stun you. MGM Resorts operates 10 properties in Las Vegas including nine casinos making it a monster in the gaming industry. The company reportedly counts 42000 workers among its staff in Nevada giving it the state’s biggest workforce. For comparison’s sake the Nevada state government “only” employs 25000 people.

New Hampshire — Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health

In a state of just over 1.3 million citizens a reported workforce of 8000 people is a sizable one. While Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health also has a major presence across Vermont its biggest footprint is in New Hampshire. The system operates a number of hospitals across the state as well as 24 smaller clinics. Its website boasts that it is the No. 1-rated hospital in New Hampshire as well as the biggest private employer there.

New Jersey — Amazon

For a long time the grocery giant ShopRite was the biggest employer in the Garden State but it recently lost that mantle to Amazon. The retail giant took that title after bringing its presence to more than 40000 employees across New Jersey in 2020. An Amazon spokesperson told ROI-NJ.com that the company has invested $14.5 billion into New Jersey’s economy since 2010.

New Mexico — Presbyterian Healthcare Services

In case you hadn’t noticed medicine is serious business in the U.S. Further proof of this is New Mexico’s Presbyterian Healthcare Services which employs more people than any other private entity across the state. The company counts more than 11000 people among its staff in New Mexico. Nine hospitals across the state are included in Presbyterian’s footprint.

New York — Northwell Health

While New York is home to arguably the most bustling arts and culture scene in the world the state’s single biggest employer is just as typical as it is in many states: a hospital system. Northwell Health says it has more than 76000 employees working across its network of more than 800 care facilities in New York. While the healthcare giant has the title for now it’s been estimated that Amazon could become the state’s biggest employer by 2034 as it seeks to add tens of thousands of new jobs there by then.

North Carolina — University of North Carolina System

When outsiders think of North Carolina basketball at the University of North Carolina probably comes to mind first. That institution and the wide-ranging University of North Carolina System that it’s a part of have a whopping 48000 employees across the state making it the biggest staffer behind state government. A total of 17 institutions are included in the system.

North Dakota — Sanford Health

It’s unique for a company not named Walmart to occupy multiple spots on this list and that’s what Sanford Health can claim. The hospital network stretches across four states but has its biggest presence across North Dakota and South Dakota where it is the biggest employer in each. In North Dakota it’s been reported that Sanford Health employs more than 12000 people.

Kroger The Ohio State University and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base each have an immense workforce in the Buckeye State but the state’s top-rated healthcare giant surpasses them all. The Cleveland Clinic Foundation has nearly 51000 workers on the payroll up sharply from the 37800 employees it reported having in 2009. The system’s flagship location in the heart of Cleveland celebrated its 100th year in business in 2021.

Oklahoma — Walmart

The United States government is actually the single-biggest employer across Oklahoma but Walmart gets the credit when nebulous government entities aren’t included. The retailer cuts checks for more than 33000 people across the state which isn’t far from the 37000 employed by the federal government there. Walmart operates 134 stores in the state 81 of which are supercenters.

Oregon — Intel

Technology rules the workforce in Oregon as Intel has had the title of the state’s largest employer for at least six years. The company says it has about 17000 employees in Oregon ranking it ahead of other major jobs creators like Providence Health System Fred Meyers Stores and Nike. The tech giant operates six campuses in the state and has been operating there since 1974.

Pennsylvania — University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

Hillsboro Oregon USA – October 18 2018: An Intel logo at a corner of JF3 building of Jones Farm campus

Healthcare comes out on top yet again this time in the Keystone State. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (aka UPMC) has an immense presence across Pennsylvania operating 40 hospitals and more than 800 clinics. The company employs a reported 92000 people across the state including a whopping 5000 doctors.

Rhode Island — Lifespan

With just over 1 million citizens between its relatively tight borders the fact that Rhode Island’s biggest employer has 16000 workers there is pretty substantial. Lifespan has been operating in Rhode Island since 1994 and runs six hospitals 40 labs and more than 100 clinics around the state. The military is another major hirer in the coastal state with Naval Station Newport counting roughly 10000 workers among its staff.

South Carolina — Walmart

Rhode Island Hospital Zecchino Pavilion

South Carolina has some serious employers in BMW Boeing and Joint Base Charleston but Walmart tops them all. The company employs more than 34000 people across the state which is about as much as those other three giants combined. There are 122 Walmart stores in South Carolina including 83 supercenters according to the company.

Walmart

South Dakota — Sanford Health

As mentioned previously the Sanford Health system is the biggest employer in both North Dakota and South Dakota. The network’s biggest presence is in South Dakota with its headquarters located in Sioux Falls. It’s unclear exactly how many employees Sanford has in South Dakota alone but the company has an estimated 30000 workers total and it has been widely reported to be the state’s biggest employer.

Tennessee — Walmart

Sanford Health Main Campus Sioux Falls South Dakota USA: 3-2021: Children’s Hospital Castle of Care

Yes Walmart rules the workforce in yet another state. Nissan Shoney’s and Vanderbilt University and its associated hospital are counted among the biggest employers in the state but none can match the big-box store’s staff in Tennessee. According to Walmart it employs nearly 43000 people in the state and operates 150 stores within its borders.

Texas — H-E-B

Texas is yet another state where a retailer has the biggest payroll of all. The San Antonio-based supermarket chain H-E-B counts more than 90000 Texans among its workforce reportedly making it the biggest private employer in the Lone Star State. The chain has more than 300 stores in the state giving it an immense presence there.

Utah — Intermountain Healthcare

The state of Utah has a few large employers ranked in a virtual tie at the top but Intermountain Healthcare just wins the race. The hospital system has more than 20000 employees which ranks it just ahead of the Utah state government and the University of Utah. Interestingly Intermountain was in talks to merge with another major employer on this list Sanford Health until the deal was called off early in 2021.

Vermont — The University of Vermont Health Network

Salt Lake City UT / USA – November 6 2020: Intermountain Primary Children’s Hospital

Frankly we were kind of disappointed to find out that Ben & Jerry’s isn’t the biggest employer in Vermont but what can you do? The fact is that The University of Vermont Health Network employs 8800 people edging out semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries as the state’s biggest staffer. The network is anchored by the flagship UVM Medical Center in Burlington which staffs 1700 nurses and 600 doctors.

Virginia — Walmart

Virginia sees about 46000 of its citizens employed by the combined powers of Huntington Ingalls Industries and Sentara Healthcare but that figure barely surpasses the number employed by Walmart. The retailer has an impressive 45727 workers across Virginia where it operates 149 stores. That figure easily makes the company the biggest staffer in the entire commonwealth.

Photo: Walmart

Washington — Amazon

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a shift at the top of Washington state’s employment rankings. Boeing was the biggest employer in the state until the pandemic hindered the company’s business while doing the opposite for Amazon’s. As a result the online retailer which was born in Washington became the state’s top dog. Amazon counts more than 80000 employees among its workforce in Washington.

West Virginia — WVU Medicine

For nearly two decades Walmart ruled West Virginia as the biggest employer but it was unseated in 2016 by a healthcare titan. WVU Medicine has more than 15000 employees within its network in the state. Other top employers across the state include Kroger Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Lowe’s.

Wisconsin — Advocate Aurora Health

Morgantown WV – 21 January 2021: WVU Medicine covid-19 vaccination center in old mall in Morgantown West Virginia

Another health system this one based in Milwaukee tops another state’s list of the biggest employers. Wisconsin’s Advocate Aurora Health operates 15 hospitals and more than 150 clinics across the state and into northern Illinois. All that care requires 75000 employees to make up its substantial payroll. It’s unclear how many of them work solely in Wisconsin but the company has widely been reported as the state’s biggest private employer.

Photo: Advocate Aurora Health

Wyoming — Walmart

With just 14 stores across the state Walmart’s presence in Wyoming is nowhere near what it is in other parts of the U.S. Still the retailer is counted as the biggest private employer there despite the fact that it has fewer than 5000 workers. Wyoming’s F.E. Warren Air Force Base employs more than 4000 people at a single site but it’s still not quite enough to catch up with Walmart’s payroll in the state.",,,,,,

Bad words carefully avoided but thought loudly:



1. I can't get rid of the visualization. It takes up the most visible part of the display distracting me as I drive.

2. The autopilot software can't even get the visualization right. Flickering bouncing images of vehicles? That bus next to me is sliding back and forth even though we're both dead stopped. That pickup? It's a minivan. No! It's a sedan. No! It's a pickup.

3. The UI has no significant customization. The speedo needs to be larger for instance but I cannot modify anything. Elon knows best?

4. I want to turn on my heated steering wheel. Not under car settings. No way to hit a button directly on the main screen. Hitting the electric seats button doesn't do it. Nor does holding down on the seat button. Looked it up in the manual on built into the car and it doesn't even list the feature. Finally searched on the internet and found a screenshot about the feature existing that shows it's in the HVAC screen. Click on HVAC. Look around. Find the button. I'm supposed to do this while driving? I no I have to memorize where every single unintuitive and undocumented control is. That assumes the control actually exists.

5. The time the car wouldn't open for a few minutes. Then it opened but wouldn't start. Then it finally all turned on 10 minutes later.

6. The time the entire interior electronics were dead including AC speedo and so on. But then they magically turned on 10 minutes later.

7. The charge port that doesn't want to let go even though charging is done. No button to do it either. Gotta unplug the charger from the adapter then the adapter from the car. I love pointless extra steps. Yes this is software.

8. Back to the UI: it's a total fustercluck. Tabs at the bottom with tiny icons. Tabs that have no discernable meaning (A circle with stars? Wut?) and then jumble a bunch of unrelated ideas together.

9. The settings menus have no discernable logic. I have to go through several items to find the settings I want but only when they actually exist. And yes sometimes I have to search up the location as I tire of searching through tabs.

10. Thanks Mr. Screen for blinding me at full brightness when I got in the car at 10:15PM last night.

11. The auto-bright headlights that turn off when signs shine back at them but that don't notice the oncoming car.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZmVlLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy90ZXNsYS1kb2RnZXMtbmV3LW1leGljby1yZXN0cmljdGlvbnMtYnktb3BlbmluZy1uZXctc3RvcmUtYW5kLXNlcnZpY2UtY2VudGVyLW9uLXRyaWJhbC1sYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Dodges New Mexico Restrictions by Opening New Store and Service Center on Tribal Land,"Tesla’s business model is unique in many respects. From its reliance on green energy credits to its frantic pursuit of self-driving technology there are many things that make the automaker stand out in the industry. But one of the company’s lesser known idiosyncrasies is that it only sells its vehicles directly to customers. It never goes through third-party dealerships.

The problem for Tesla is that many states prohibit or severely limit this practice meaning Tesla owners often have to drive to a different state to buy and service their vehicles. Recently however Tesla found a creative solution to this problem in New Mexico.

“Tesla has opened its first store and repair shop on Native American land” the New York Post reports “dodging car dealership laws that have stymied its expansion plans across the country. The Elon Musk-helmed carmaker opened a store and service center [in] Nambé Pueblo a tribal area about 25 minutes north of Santa Fe that is not subject to laws that have prevented Tesla from opening stores elsewhere [in] the state.”

“The New Mexico store marks the first time Tesla has worked with a tribe to get around state dealership laws” the report continues. “Until now New Mexico Tesla buyers had to pay thousands of dollars to have their cars shipped or travel to other states to pick them up. For repairs owners had to travel to service centers in Colorado Arizona or Texas.”

The Perils of Protectionism

While this workaround is laudable and honestly kind of funny the fact that it was necessary in the first place is concerning. Though the laws prohibiting direct sales are sold as a way to protect auto dealerships from larger opportunistic manufacturers what’s really happening is that dealerships are being protected from competition.

As in all other industries the established players don’t like to be challenged. Franchise dealerships see automakers like Tesla as a threat to their business model and rightly so. But rather than striving to outdo Tesla in serving customers and creating value they have simply asked politicians to make it illegal for Tesla to compete. And since politicians always seem to have a soft spot for special interest groups they have often been happy to oblige.

But these laws don’t just hurt automakers like Tesla. They also hurt consumers who have fewer options in their local area as a result and have to sacrifice lots of time and effort if they really want a Tesla. Just imagine what it must have been like to be a Tesla owner in New Mexico. You had to drive all the way to Arizona for a simple repair not because that makes any sense whatsoever but just because the local dealerships didn’t want the competition.

It’s exactly that kind of needless inefficiency that free-market advocates decry when we talk about crony protectionist policies.

The Market Will Find a Way

Cronyism aside what’s beautiful about this story is how it perfectly exemplifies the persistence of the market. Even in the face of crushing prohibitions businesses will exploit every loophole and oversight to create value for consumers (and profit for themselves). Entrepreneurs do not sit around idly waiting for the law to change. They innovate they adapt they find workarounds anything to get valuable goods and services to eager customers.

Of course sometimes these workarounds need to be very creative like putting a store and repair shop on Native American land. But creative workarounds like this are nothing new.

For example when the District of Columbia made it illegal to sell marijuana in 2015 residents quickly used their imagination to get around the law. A T-shirt vendor included a “gift” bag of marijuana for customers who tipped really well. Another entrepreneur started a $125 cooking class to learn about cooking with cannabis. Free samples were included of course.

Going further back the prohibition era is also an excellent case study of the market finding all sorts of creative ways to get around the law.

But my favorite story of a creative workaround has to be Dan the Panini Man.

“A kid at my school has a panini-maker so he sells paninis to other students and everyone called him Dan the Panini Man. But the campus police people shut him down because it’s not legal to sell food if it’s not a bake sale or whatever. So now he’s Dan the Paper Towel Man and he sells paper towels but with each paper towel purchase you get a free panini.”

The meme appended to the story has just three words. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.

That’s basically the motto of every entrepreneur that’s ever lived.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDY3NzgyMi9lbG9uLW11c2tzLXRlc2xhLXJvYm90YXhpLXByb21pc2UtdHlwaWZpZXMtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLW92ZXJleHViZXJhbmNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk's failed Tesla robotaxi promise is the height of self-driving hype,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fastcompany.com/90677822/elon-musks-tesla-robotaxi-promise-typifies-self-driving-overexuberance on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDY3NzgyMi9lbG9uLW11c2tzLXRlc2xhLXJvYm90YXhpLXByb21pc2UtdHlwaWZpZXMtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLW92ZXJleHViZXJhbmNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8xOC90ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zLXNyLXJvYWQtdHJpcC1hcm91bmQtcXVlZW5zbGFuZC1wYXJ0LTcv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9jbGVhbnRlY2huaWNhLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzE4L3Rlc2xhLW1vZGVsLTMtc3Itcm9hZC10cmlwLWFyb3VuZC1xdWVlbnNsYW5kLXBhcnQtNy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model 3 SR+ Road Trip Around Queensland — Part 7,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

For those of you who have just joined us this is the middle of a saga about driving from Brisbane on the coast of Queensland 1500 km to the inland town of Winton in a Tesla Model 3 SR+. Earlier articles are available in my author archives. In this leg we’re going from Winton to Longreach to Barcaldine in Queensland.

We left Winton on that Sunday morning with a full battery — 350 km (217 mile) range. But Tess lies like a politician. Halfway to Longreach (about 90 km into our 290 km leg) the car started telling us we wouldn’t make it to Barcaldine. Remember we had driven the other way just a few days ago and the car did make it. We couldn’t work out what the problem was but we dutifully turned off the air conditioning and drove 90 km/h (in a 110 km/h zone). Just as well — there was very little traffic on the road. Those who were on the road passed us easily and I wondered what must be going through their heads: “I thought those Tesla cars were supposed to be fast!!” The range prediction didn’t get any better.

Later when checking the weather we found that we had been driving into a 40 km/h headwind. Meanwhile we had to find some charging in the next town Longreach. PlugShare was no help as there was nothing listed. We rang the information centre and two caravan parks. Only one answered the phone. He had a cousin who owns a Tesla. This cousin had bought shares and made millions. “This is great” I thought “he will be understanding.” But no he wanted $29 for two hours of charging — about $2 worth of electricity. No thanks. Then he wanted to keep chatting about his problems at the caravan park. Sorry mate I’ve got problems of my own — I need to find a place to charge.

We dropped in at the information centre where the lovely manager looked all around the building but couldn’t find an external power point. So we went around to the other caravan park (the one we hadn’t spoken to and who hadn’t returned our phone call). Going through our minds were various backup plans — staying overnight a very expensive option at $240 a night; driving to Ilfracombe but not sure where we could charge there either. Of course there was the obvious: arriving in Barcaldine on the back of a tow truck after waiting many hours on the side of the road.

Then we found a very helpful Māori lady at the desk at the Longreach Tourist Park. Yes they had room. Yes we could use a powered site. And yes we could charge our car. Yay! Once again the tyranny of distance (and strong headwinds) was overcome by the kindness of strangers. So we walked into town with 2 hours to enjoy the delights of Longreach.

Coffee food and service were great at the Merino Bakery and the prices were reasonable. After lunch we dropped into Outback Pioneer Tours to look at their historic building and artifacts. As usual I told the manager I was a writer for CleanTechnica and was writing up my Tesla journey. We had the most interesting conversation about Brazil. Yes the manager and his wife were from Brazil. His cousin’s children attend an exclusive school in Brazil and need extra security because of the possibility of kidnapping. So of course we talked about the Cybertruck being bullet proof. He wants one!

Time to walk back to the car (we certainly did our 10000 steps that day) and head off for Barcaldine. The wind hadn’t dropped and now we had tumbleweeds to contend with. It was like being in a bowling alley with giant kangaroos tossing hundreds of large grey balls across the road. We were still hypermiling and made it to our motel (and our destination charger) in the red.

Going for my walk after dinner I noticed a trailer parked next to the motel and realized that there were worse possibilities than running out of charge. Two thousand litres of flammable liquid would make for quite a bang.

ABC7 Los Angeles reports that the car hit a roadside wall and continued its journey to god knows what destination.

The police slowed the car down and forced it to a full stop which is probably the best way to stop a car at least until someday when police get access to ask Tesla to shut down a particular car in the case of emergency.

""A DUI suspect was taken into custody after her Tesla vehicle that was reportedly on Autopilot stopped on a freeway overpass in the Glendale area Thursday night. According to a California Highway Patrol incident log the vehicle hit a roadside wall shortly after 11 p.m. and kept traveling as the driver was reportedly unconscious.""

It's hard to blame Tesla Autopilot assist driving system in this case. Actually without the system the car potentially would crash one way or another.

In the future the industry will have to figure out how to determine the driver's status and safely stop driving (or continue slowly if stopping would be more dangerous than moving to exit some high-speed section).

For police stopping an Autopilot-driven car actually sounds easier task than stopping a DUI-driven car."

Over the past decade North Texas has grown by some 1.3 million people to reach a population of just under 7.7 million making it the nation’s fourth-largest metro area based on new figures from the 2020 census.

Dallas-Fort Worth is now home to 24 Fortune 500 company headquarters trailing only New York and Chicago. Among America’s top 20 metros D-FW boasts the fourth-highest rate of net inbound migration and demographers project North Texas will reach 10 million people sometime in the 2030s surpassing Chicago to become America’s third-largest metro area.

Rather than building on natural advantages North Texas owes its tremendous growth to railroads interstate highways and airports plus an unusual degree of economic freedom and affordability.

In the second half of the 20th century business leaders built a first-tier transportation network centered on DFW International Airport but also including a premier national hub for ground logistics and a toll-road system that could support rapid outward growth. Thanks to DFW Airport the world’s 12th-largest in passenger numbers travelers can reach every major city in the United States within four hours plus 66 nonstop destinations outside the U.S.

Today Dallas is pulling away economically from the nation’s long-established urban centers because of a distinctive policy orientation: growth-friendly with lighter-touch business regulation and lower taxes than longtime urban centers in the Northeast the Midwest or California.

Only four of the 53 U.S. metros with more than 1 million people outperform D-FW on an SMU Bridwell Institute for Economic Freedom index. The index measures tax levels government spending and labor rules. Likewise only five of these metros have more growth-friendly land-use rules than D-FW based on a data set compiled by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.

D-FW’s location and cost advantages have become powerful magnets for businesses. Already home to the headquarters of well-established companies like Texas Instruments American Airlines Southwest Airlines Kimberly-Clark and D.R. Horton North Texas in recent years has rapidly acquired headquarters for such elite companies as California-based Jacobs Engineering Fluor Toyota Motor North America McKesson Tenet Healthcare CBRE and Charles Schwab.

Bob Pragada chief operating officer of Jacobs which moved to Dallas in 2017 said high living costs particularly for housing made the Los Angeles area increasingly prohibitive for his 55000-employee firm.

“If you’re not a tech company it’s very difficult to be in California” he said in an interview adding that it was getting harder to persuade employees to move there.

According to data from the World Population Review Texas’ cost of living is about 10% below the national average while California’s is about 50% above.

D-FW has also established itself as America’s third-largest financial center. Comerica Charles Schwab and First Foundation moved their headquarters to Dallas in recent years and State Farm and Liberty Mutual have opened large operations in the area.

Recent shifts in domestic migration patterns are reshaping the D-FW area as well as the other large metros of the flourishing Texas Triangle region: Houston San Antonio and Austin. From 2010 to 2020 D-FW saw net inbound migration from elsewhere in the U.S. of more than 500000 more than any other U.S. metro.

As a result North Texas has a more youthful population than most areas. Many of these newcomers come from the coasts and the Midwest. The region received more than 100000 migrants from the Los Angeles New York and Chicago metros between 2012 and 2016 alone.

According to Census Bureau data foreign-born residents made up nearly 21% of North Texas residents age 25 and over with a bachelor’s graduate or professional degree as of 2017; that’s 25% above the national average.

Over the past decade notes demographer Wendell Cox D-FW has expanded its foreign-born population by 30% more than any of the seven U.S. metros with more than 5 million people. Foreign-born populations basically flatlined in New York while dropping in absolute terms in Los Angeles and Chicago.

Immigrants come for opportunity but this is not to say that poverty particularly among newcomers and long-established minorities has not persisted. In contrast to the ethnically diverse suburbs north of the city Dallas continues to have pockets of seemingly insoluble poverty.

At the same time D-FW is struggling with how to create greater economic vitality in its vast left-behind areas especially southern Dallas and southeast Fort Worth where pockets of concentrated poverty remain. As economic energy in the region shifts northward and westward southern Dallas has become what Dallas Citizens Council Chief Executive Kelvin Walker calls a “big gaping economic hole” — “the giant elephant in the room.”

Still North Texas seems poised for future growth. Its economy far more than that of Houston and most other metros is remarkably diversified. Only modestly dependent on the energy sector for example the D-FW economy weathered the effects of declines in oil and natural gas prices in 2014-15 and again in 2019-20.

Collin and Denton counties are likely to see their populations more than double by 2050 and counties still farther north along the Oklahoma border are primed to become large growth engines as well.

America’s most economically and demographically dynamic metros will continue to play leading roles in shaping the nation’s urban geography as they always have. In the first half of the 20th century the place to watch was New York. In the second half it was Los Angeles.

In 21st-century America keep your eyes on Big D.

Messenger Reporter

CROCKETT – Readers have probably seen that headline before. Usually however the traffic stop leads to a drug bust. And while there were drugs found at the scene this time the traffic stop led to a forgery bust.

Justin Lloyd Dixon 34 and Christina Nicole Castro 34 were both arrested and charged with forgery of financial instruments as well as manufacturing with the intent to sell counterfeit instruments after the vehicle they were traveling in was stopped because of a defective brake light.

According to a probable cause affidavit Crockett Police Department Lt. Lonnie Lim was on patrol during the early morning hours of Sept. 11 when he received a call about a reckless driver. Lt. Lum observed the vehicle as it traveled around the square in Crockett and began to follow it.

When the vehicle turned on to Bowie Street the police lieutenant observed the vehicle had a defective brake light and initiated a traffic stop.

The police report stated “I (Lum) exited my vehicle and approached the passenger side and a Hispanic female rolled down the window. I could immediately smell the extremely strong odor of marijuana coming from inside the vehicle. At this time I did not mention this but spoke to both the driver and passenger. I then identified them both and advised them (about) the reason for the stop. I spoke to them briefly about where they were going to and coming from and while talking to them I observed an AR-15 in the backseat on top of a speaker box. Due to the odor of marijuana and a weapon being in the vehicle the occupants (Dixon and Castro) were asked to step out.”

When Lum ran the criminal histories of the two the results showed Dixon was a convicted felon. The police lieutenant then asked about the odor of marijuana and Castro “… immediately admitted that she had some marijuana in the car in her bag.”

Dixon

A probable cause search was conducted and a blue Kobalt backpack was found in the backseat of the vehicle.

“Dixon admitted that the backpack belonged to him. Inside the backpack was a scale commonly used for weighing drugs a Pronto card printing machine and five fictitious/false Texas drivers licenses made from this machine two lap tops and miscellaneous other items” the affidavit reported.

Two other fake drivers’ licenses were also found in Dixon’s wallet. The licenses had Dixon’s picture on them but had different identifying numbers and addresses. In addition the search also uncovered 12 blank cards used in making the fake drivers’ licenses stashed in a visor area.

As the investigation continued a safe was discovered which contained two handguns along with 87 more blank cards used to make the phony licenses. An unopened package of unprinted check paper along with several forged checks were also found.

Dixon was placed under arrest and booked into custody on charges of: felonious possession of a firearm a third-degree felony; forgery of a financial instrument a state jail felony; and delivery or manufacture of a counterfeit instrument also a third-degree felony.

Castro was charged with: unlawful carrying of a weapon a Class A misdemeanor; possession of marijuana a Class B misdemeanor; possession of a controlled substance penalty group one a third-degree felony; forgery of a financial instrument a state jail felony; and delivery or manufacture of a counterfeit instrument also a third-degree felony.

According to Section 12.34 of the Texas Penal Code “An individual adjudged guilty of a felony of the third degree shall be punished by imprisonment in the institutional division for any term of not more than 10 years or less than two years. In addition to imprisonment an individual adjudged guilty of a felony of the third degree may be punished by a fine not to exceed $10000.”

The total bond for Dixon was set at $30000 while Castro’s bond was set at $32500. Both Dixon and Castro posted bond and were released pending further legal proceedings.

The Viper is built by Bell Textron at the company’s Amarillo Texas assembly center.

“Of all of the domestic AH-1Zs delivered to date 91 percent of them have been on time” said Col Vasilios Pappas program manager. “This is a feat only possible through the determination of our production team and the program’s strong relationship with our industry partners and suppliers.”

The AH-1Zs delivered to date are a mix of U.S. and FMS sales with an additional 34 aircraft scheduled for delivery through 2023.

For the Marines the AH-1Z provides close air support armed escort/reconnaissance anti-armor operations and anti-air warfare. Beginning in 2011 the AH-1Z began replacing the two-bladed AH-1W Super Cobra. The helicopter features a four-bladed composite rotor system performance-matched transmission four-bladed tail rotor upgraded landing gear and a fully integrated glass cockpit compared to its predecessor. The AH-1Z is also equipped with an integrated advanced fire control system and the capacity to support multiple weapons configurations.

The Marine Corps operates the AH-1Z alongside the UH-1Y Venom the utility version of the H-1. The two variants capitalize on a 85 percent commonality; the mix allows a squadron to accomplish diverse missions from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to close air support and air-to-air warfare.

“And we are continuously integrating new technologies and researching innovative options to keep the platform ready and relative well into the future” said Pappas.

Earlier this summer a Marine Corps’ AH-1Z Viper established a two way connection between a ground station and the aircraft’s Link 16 and Advanced Networking Wideband Waveform (ANW2) systems. This was a major step in the test and integration of the digital interoperability (DI) suite a gateway to share information across various networks. Additionally the suite includes a new digital moving map enabling the Marine Corps’ H-1 platform to display information from these data links on a common display. The DI suite also modernizes how data is loaded to and from the H-1 platform.

Flight test on the AH-1Z will continue through the fall with initial Marine Corps integration expected in 2022. In addition the program is working with industry and the test squadron to flight test the same DI suite on the UH-1Y.

The aircraft anticipated to be delivered to the company in November 2021 will join Fuji Business Jet’s fleet of business aircraft including two Cessna Citation CJ2+ aircraft for passenger charter services. This will be the first Citation CJ4 Gen2 delivered into Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. It achieved Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB) type certification in 2011 and the JCAB interior certification for the CJ4 Gen2 is expected in September 2021. As one of the world’s largest and most developed economies Japan has a wide range of general aviation airports with a growing number of private aviation and charter users.

“It’s fantastic to see the first Citation CJ4 Gen2 delivered into the Asia-Pacific region where more than four billion people are within a 6-hour flight radius” said Tony Jones vice president Sales (Asia-Pacific). “Cessna Citation light jets continue to be a popular choice with Japanese-based operators. It has a well-deserved reputation as a versatile and efficient business tool. The new Citation CJ4 Gen2’s updated cabin experience and class-leading performance allow our customers like Fuji Business Jet to take advantage of greater range out of airports with shorter runways across Japan.”

The Citation CJ4 Gen2 is the largest Citation in Textron Aviation’s light jet segment. It offers operators a host of features that elevate ramp presence and in-flight comfort including a new stair and handrail premium seating options and enhanced ambiance lighting throughout. Along with the new cabin seating options there is enhanced lighting in the pockets on the sidewall and floor and in the cupholders. This is the first Citation aircraft equipped with CoolView lavatory skylights to provide more natural lighting throughout the lavatory and aft cabin area. The CJ4 Gen2 combines superior speed range and operating economics when compared with larger aircraft making it the ideal platform for owner-operators and special missions.

The Cessna Citation CJ4 Gen2 allows customers to go further with the light jet segment’s leading range-to-payload ratio and a best-in-class IFR range of 1926 nautical miles (3567 km) with a maximum cruise speed of 451 knots. The single-pilot certified jet combines superior speed range and operating economics when compared with larger aircraft making it the ideal platform for owner/operators or corporate missions. The CJ4 Gen2 has seating for up to 10 passengers and includes a notable 1040-pound baggage capacity.

The company is likely to employ around 375 people at the facility which is expected to be completed in the fall of 2022. Merchandise could get rolling in and out of the site by the end of next year.

The new road is expected to span 3230 feet or about 0.62 of a mile.

The road connection will assist heavy semi-trailer trucks hauling freight to and from the warehouse.

United Earthworks of Deerfield was hired for the road extension project. The $2.2 million effort is funded mainly by a $1.65 million grant through the Ohio Development Services Agency as well as about $220000 from the Ohio Department of Transportation.

Navarre Mayor Bob Benson said the addition is strongly needed and will be an economic benefit to the area.

""I drive by the road (construction area) often and it's looking pretty good"" he said. ""It will be nice to have the project done.""

Special to The Star Press

(Editor's note: A reference to one of the Facebook posts by Delaware County health officer Donna Wilkins included in the original version of this article has been removed because it was not related to COVID-19.)

MUNCIE Ind. – Across Indiana the COVID vaccine-averse are turning to a product made to rid livestock of worms and it’s setting off alarm bells for most healthcare professionals.

Ivermectin and variations on the de-wormer are available through livestock veterinarians and farm supply stores including those in Muncie. Tractor Supply in Muncie’s ivermectin shelf – with a prominent printed warning that the drug is not to be used for COVID-19 in people - was virtually empty of the product last week.

Physicians warn that people shouldn’t be using ivermectin for COVID and IU Health on Tuesday issued an advisory to physicians marked “URGENT.” In it the IU Health Infectious Diseases Clinical Council recommended against the use of ivermectin for prevention or treatment of COVID.

Fact check:Ivermectin is not a proven treatment for COVID-19

In an interview a physician and infectious disease specialist at IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital sounded a similar caution.

“There is no data supporting use of ivermectin for prevention or treatment of COVID-19” said Ritika Zijoo in an email to The Star Press. “We recommend against the use of ivermectin for COVID-19 treatment or prevention outside of a clinical trial setting.”

Delaware County’s health officer a longtime physician who oversees the county health department has on her personal Facebook page touted the possibility of human use of ivermectin for COVID-19 even as most medical authorities warn against doing so.

Using ivermectin to treat COVID is as Adam Overberg executive director of the Indiana Poison Center told The Star Press “truly worse than doing nothing.” The poison center has this year received reports of nine individuals having bad reactions to ivermectin.

“Basically there’s no biologically plausible mechanism by which it could be effective” Overberg said of ivermectin. “Studies that are highly touted either have statistical problems or methodological problems or both. To my staff and public taking no position on whether people choose to get vaccinated or not if they’re not going to get vaccinated we would prefer they not also use ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine. This is a case where doing something Is truly worse than doing nothing.

“I would prefer they not poison themselves.”

What is ivermectin?

Demand for prescriptions for ivermectin jumped 2400% in the middle of August compared to the pre-pandemic weekly average USA Today reported on Sept. 14.

The newspaper also reported that calls to report ivermectin poisoning had increased by 163% according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers.

But what is ivermectin and why are some people increasingly touting its use as a treatment for COVID-19 a respiratory virus as opposed to an intestinal disease?

Ivermectin is a medicine used to fight parasites mostly in livestock. Veterinarians use ivermectin to treat intestinal worms in cattle sheep and other livestock as well as domesticated animals like dogs.

Ivermectin and related medicines are available in many forms. The medicine can be made up in quantities large enough to dip animals in. Ivermectin can be injected with a syringe or taken as a pill. And it can be found as a paste which is one of the forms reportedly preferred by people who are using it in response to COVID.

Only a handful of tubes of ivermectin paste could be found in local farm stores last week. Most of those were the labels noted “apple flavor” presumably to appeal to horses.

Signs warning against human use of ivermectin intended for animals were taped to shelves and coolers in the livestock medicine sections of Rural King and Tractor Supply Co. in Muncie.

“SAFETY ALERT” read the sign at Tractor Supply. “Animal products containing ivermectin SHOULD NOT be used in people. These products can cause serious health effects including death. Ivermectin has not been shown to be a safe or effective way to prevent or treat COVID-19. If you are worried about COVID-19 please talk to your doctor.”

At Tractor Supply the shelf on which the warning sign was posted was empty when surveyed by The Star Press. A few tubes of the paste form remained on another shelf.

Veterinarians: Livestock ivermectin is not for human use

Ivermectin tablets are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in people to treat some parasitic worms The Washington Post reported on Sept. 10. The Post noted that a prescription is needed for human use and that the forms of the medicine for livestock can easily be found in the livestock medicine aisles of farm stores near medicine for pinkeye in cattle and other remedies.

Merck one of the pharmaceutical companies that makes ivermectin noted that its scientists have so far found no scientific basis for a “potential therapeutic effect” against COVID.

Camela Schmitz a veterinarian at Hartford Animal Clinic in Hartford City said her patients aren’t asking about ivermectin.

“I would never recommend that anyone use an animal product for themselves” Schmitz told The Star Press.

Julie Davis a veterinarian at Circle D Veterinary Services in Modoc told The Star Press she hasn’t heard from her farm customers asking for ivermectin.

“Farmers already have it on their shelf they know where to find it and they’re smart enough to know to consult their physicians to ask about treatment” Davis said.

“Where to find it” leads back to farm supply stores.

‘Lot of people calling’

The Rural King store in Muncie offers along with farm-appropriate work clothing and baby chicks a variety of livestock medicines. Among those is ivermectin.

“Despite media reports that ivermectin could potentially be used to treat people with COVID-19 these products are not safe or approved for human use which could cause severe personal injury or death” read the warning signs posted at Rural King.

“We do get a lot of people calling if we have it but we always have” said Matt Clevenger the assistant manager of the store. “It’s a very popular item.”

Clevenger said when he talks to customers he’s not answering questions about human use of ivermectin but “We’ve talked about it. We’ve heard of people trying to use it but we’ve heard of people dying too.”

At Tractor Supply managers referred The Star Press to corporate headquarters in Tennessee. The Star Press called and left a message and later emailed questions to a spokesperson but received no response.

Facebook and the spread of ivermectin

Interest in using ivermectin as a COVID treatment fueled by celebrities and some medical authorities has been on the increase in recent months. The National Poison Data System said that the number of exposure cases reported to poison centers increased from 133 to 459 in July and August National Public Radio reported in early September.

The Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration in August warned against people using ivermectin for COVID. Research continues however: The Guardian reported that a University of Oxford clinical trial was underway.

Before vaccines were available The Guardian reported a few medical groups were considering ivermectin as a possible treatment. The news site also noted that the medicine soon became a rallying point for conservative vaccine critics whose posts on Facebook and other social media – although sometimes removed or annotated with an advisory label by the social media platform – spread the word.

Facebook is a communications venue for Donna Wilkins a longtime local physician respected for her work with newborns with medical issues. Since 1988 Wilkins has been the health officer for Delaware County. As a physician she helps guide the Delaware County Health Department administrator Jammie Bane and the staff. On the official county government page for the health department her name and contact info is the only one visible on the first page. She serves at the discretion of the county health board whose members are appointed by the Delaware County commissioners.

Earlier:Delaware County health officer's Facebook post questioning COVID-19 vaccine causes concern

Since mid-August at least Wilkins has been posting to her 1700-plus Facebook friends about ivermectin and other related conspiracy-fueled posts that she shares or writes. The posts have not appeared on the Delaware County Health Department Facebook page.

“Ivermectin should be offered to more people with COVID imho (in my humble opinion)” she wrote in mid-August on a video about “new COVID drugs.”

“This is excellent!!” she wrote on a video of a physician Pierre Kory who testified before a Senate committee about ivermectin.

Wilkins shared a post from Jeff Byerly with the headline “Get to a VACCINE REBELLION state or be HUNTED by the vax enforcers.”

Wilkins also shared a meme showing two lions. “THERE’S NO TIME LEFT TO WAKE THE SHEEP. IT’S TIME TO WAKE THE OTHER LIONS.”

The Star Press asked county officials and local health officials if Wilkins’ COVID-related posts which could be seen by her 1700-plus Facebook friends but shared with others through screenshots were appropriate.

‘I don’t know why she would even post that’

“If it hasn’t been proven effective I don’t know why she would even post that especially with her being on the health department” Delaware County commissioner James King told The Star Press.

“To me if it’s not safe and it’s not effective and it hasn’t been proven I don’t believe she should be telling people they can use this” King added. “She’s supposed to be the doctor that we have over our health.”

King went on to defend Wilkins’ use of her personal Facebook page however. “If she was posting it on (the health department Facebook page) I would have a problem with it.”

Commissioner Shannon Henry after saying that the county can’t police personal Facebook pages said “I would suggest people follow our county page and the Delaware County Health Department page.

“I’m sure people look at her personal page and question things” Henry added. “I’m sure they do. But it’s her right. It’s her belief.”

Vaccines:Delaware County Health Department providing free COVID vaccinations booster shots

When contacted for comment health department administrator Bane said “As for ivermectin I think it's tragic that individuals chose to use a product intended for veterinary use and further chose to dose it improperly resulting in injury. However the counterpoint I feel compelled to also mention is that media has not seemed interested in touching the fact that ivermectin is not just a ‘horse de-wormer.’”

Bane went on to note that ivermectin is “FDA approved” but did not note that approval is for treating parasites not COVID.

On Sept. 3 the FDA posted a news release titled “Why you should not use ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19.”

“Does it work against COVID-19 as many claim?” Bane asked. “I'm not qualified to answer that hence why I do not promote it nor will you find the DCHD promoting it without further solid evidence of its effects.”

The Star Press on Wednesday emailed several questions to Wilkins about her Facebook posts. In addition The Star Press on Monday sent several questions to Bane about Wilkins’ posts. Bane said he had shared the questions with Wilkins.

‘Fraudulent data’ in one analysis

Zijoo the infectious disease physician from IU Health Ball said she has not heard from patients asking about ivermectin.

“Veterinary formulations of Ivermectin should not be consumed by humans” she added. “These formulations can lead to significant toxicity in humans and may cause death.”

In its advisory to physicians IU Health noted that its caution against ivermectin was in agreement with national health specialist organizations.

The advisory noted that an “often-quoted recently published meta-analysis” of the use of ivermectin “was withdrawn due to the discovery that one of the included trials in the analysis contained fraudulent data.”

The IU Health advisory cited large medical organizations that called for “an immediate end” to prescribing dispensing and use of ivermectin for COVID. “In addition we are urging physicians pharmacists and other prescribers — trusted healthcare professionals in their communities — to warn patients against the use of ivermectin outside of FDA-approved indications and guidance whether intended for use in humans or animals as well as purchasing ivermectin from online stores. … Use of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 has been demonstrated to be harmful to patients. Calls to poison control centers due to ivermectin ingestion have increased five-fold from their pre-pandemic baseline.”

So far in 2021 the Indiana Poison Center has received reports of nine instances of people using ivermectin in COVID-related uses Overberg said. Most of those experienced mild abdominal pain.

“The people at real risk are taking 20 milligrams plus a day multiple days in a row of the paste in tubes. Some of them are applying it to their skin some are taking it orally.” Noting the “apple flavor” Overberg added “From what I’ve heard even animals don’t like the flavor.”

As for the social media takes by people like Pierre Kory Overberg said “Everything they’re basing it on is faulty or bad science. My position would be to seek out reputable sources and question anything that is too good to be true (and) miracle cures.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb2tlc21hbi5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxL3NlcC8xNy9pcy1pdmVybWVjdGluLWdvaW5nLXRvLWtpbGwteW91LXByb2JhYmx5LW5vdC11bmxlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is ivermectin going to kill you?

As some Americans turn to ivermectin a cheap drug used to kill worms and others parasites in humans and animals federal officials have seen a surge in prescriptions this summer accompanied by worrying increases in reported overdoses.

At Franciscan St. Anthony Health in Michigan City and Chesterton a handful of cases where ivermectin was in use have crept into the emergency room.

Dr. Erik Achramowicz medical director of emergency medicine for Franciscan Health Michigan City and Chesterton said he has seen four cases come through the emergency room in recent weeks. Three of those cases were people who had been taken ivermectin on a prescription from a nurse practitioner. One other patient had purchased the ivermectin they ingested at a farm.

There have been no cases so far in other Franciscan hospitals according to a hospital spokesperson.

In each case the individuals had been treating their COVID-19 symptoms with ivermectin for about a week before coming into the emergency room. Typically people suffering from COVID-19 who wind up in the hospital come in around day nine or 10 he said.

“They had completed their course (of ivermectin) and were not any better. They actually got worse” Achramowicz said.

“It’s just mind-boggling” Achramowicz said. He said he cannot understand how someone would use a product for an animal that is unproven to treat or cure a disease like COVID-19 in humans over an approved vaccine that has been tested in humans and found effective.

“(People) need to stop politicizing your beliefs on this stuff if you are considering something completely off the deep end on what is clinically relevant. This is an example of that” Achramowicz said.

The emergency room director said he hopes more people would opt for the vaccine.

“I see it every day. Every single day there’s a patient that comes in and says if I only knew it was like this I would have gotten the vaccine. Every single day I see it” Achramowicz said.

He said the one study where ivermectin was looked at for treating COVID-19 was in a laboratory setting in extremely high doses and not tested on animals or humans. Achramowicz said there is a hierarchy of what is legitimate research and what is the beginning of a study. He described the study on ivermectin use for COVID-19 at its “very beginning” and “low quality.” He said the study is nowhere near close enough to begin clinical applications in humans.

“As physicians and scientists we really pride ourselves on randomized control trials and peer reviews. This is garbage. It’s not even close” he said.

Achramowicz said fear of the pace the mRNA vaccines were rolled out is misplaced. The mRNA vaccines have been in development and testing for 20 years and were used to treat bird flu. The vaccines need to be altered to attack a new virus instead of recreated from scratch. mRNA-based vaccines currently are being studied to treat a variety of illnesses including malaria tuberculosis and HIV.

“In the next 10 years you will really see mRNA vaccines ramp up. It’s a realistic possibility to have a malaria vaccine (in the future)” he said.

Equine veterinarian Dr. Kate Hodson who owns Hodson Veterinary Services LLC in Hebron shares Achramowicz’s bewilderment at people would turn to an unproven treatment especially the variety intended for animals. She said she has only received one inquiry about ivermectin that she thought was related to using the product for treating COVID-19.

“I’ve only been asked by one older gentleman for heartworm preventative for his dog” Hodson said. The request came earlier in the year when the drug was first promoted as a potential treatment and cure for COVID-19. Her clinic does not treat small animals and she was suspicious of the man’s intentions ultimately telling him to reach out to a physician.

“My clients have been very respectful. They’ve not asked for it other than for their horses” Hodson said.

Hodson said using an animal product as a human could be potentially dangerous. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic that can be prescribed to humans to treat things like lice. Animal products containing ivermectin can also contain other animal specific dewormers or fillers not intended for human consumption. The drug also is intended for single use. Prolonged use could lead to overdose.

“People are just looking for the word ‘ivermectin’ and don’t realize the other antiparasitics they could be ingesting. That’s definitely a danger to them” Hodson said.

Taking a drug not approved for human consumption could result in a potential overdoes cause neurological problems and organ damage. In the worst-case scenario using a product like horse dewormer off label could result in death she said.

Hodson said it would be difficult to determine an appropriate human dose from a product intended to treat a 1000-pound animal. The smallest notch on the ivermectin paste horse dewormer is about 250 pounds.

So far the equine vet said she has not seen issues with the supply chain that would be considered out of the ordinary. The availability of injectable ivermectin as typically off and on even prior to the pandemic something she described as normal supply issues. There have not been any issues securing other ivermectin products.

“In our area I don’t think people are abusing it. As a professional in a veterinary industry I appreciate everybody’s compliance” Hodson said.

In a region like Northwest Indiana where the landscape is mixed from city suburban to rural products like ivermectin for horses are easy to find without a prescription. Local stores where ivermectin can be purchased without a prescription for equines and livestock say they have not seen any unusual demand for the product.

Stores like Tractor Supply carry the product in its Northwest Indiana locations including Valparaiso Hobart St. John and DeMotte.

“The anti-parasite drug Ivermectin has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. The product sold in our stores is only suitable for animals and is clearly labeled as such” a statement from Tractor Supply Co. said.

Pat Warner company spokesperson said beginning in August all of the Tractor Supply locations including those in Northwest Indiana posted a sign on the entrance warning of the dangers and advising of the intended use. Ivermectin products for equines and livestock is available without a prescription.

At Bellstras Milling Co. in DeMotte a store servicing local farmers and horse owners manager Jenni Craig said there has not been any requests for ivermectin products other than those from their typical customers related to the care of their animals.

“It’s been sales as usual” she said.

The manager at Crown Feed & Supply in Crown Point which also carries ivermectin products hung up when asked if he would respond to questions.

Editor's note: This story by Elizabeth Clarkson Zwart was originally published in the Des Moines Tribune in February 1964 about three months after the Travelers umbrella was first erected.

When Ned. G. Kendall of the Travelers Insurance Companies threw a switch on the roof of the Insurance Exchange Building on the evening of Nov. 1 1963 a huge red umbrella – 50 feet wide and 40 ½ feet tall – opened on the Des Moines skyline.

The umbrella – the tip of which turns the 10-story building into a 14-story building – is a neon sign.

It’s the largest neon sign in Iowa; and there isn’t another like it in the world.

Not yet …

The idea for displaying the big insurance group’s nationally known trademark high in the sky originated in the Des Moines offices.

“And the national office went right along!” they say. (I think this means the men at national headquarters didn’t turn pale when told that a big red neon umbrella would cost several thousand dollars.)

Now since the big sign has been so well received local company representatives wouldn’t be a bit surprised if others should open on other rooftops across the country.

The local umbrella was built by the Iowa Neon Sign Co. 1934 Cottage Grove.

It took a month and a half to bend 1277 feet of neon tubing into a dozen sections and then prepare them for a lifetime in the sky.

More:How downtown Des Moines' iconic Travelers umbrella sign was almost lost then saved — but don't ask the cost

When everything was ready the sections were trucked down Keo and hoisted by crane to the roof of the Brown Garage.

Then a pickup truck with a donkey engine – a winch – on its back was driven half a block away to Riley’s Parking Lot on Fifth Street and a cable was run first to the garage then to the 11-story roof – and that’s a lot of cable.

For about two weeks the donkey worked hoisting the sign to the Insurance Exchange roof.

Then the assembling was completed.

And then the switch was thrown.

No one at Travelers was more pleased and excited than were Al Campbell and George Wingert at Iowa Neon.

After congratulating them I turned practical and asked if they’d had to pay rent for the use of the roof of the Brown Garage.

They hadn’t.

And what about the parking lot?”

“The donkey and its truck paid the regular daily parking fee while they were there” said Al Campbell. “Worth every penny of it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVlcGVuZ3Vpbi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2NvbnN1bWVycy10cmF2ZWwtbG95YWx0eS1wcm9ncmFtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More Than Half of Consumers Don't Take Advantage of Travel Rewards Programs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel/consumers-travel-loyalty-programs on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVlcGVuZ3Vpbi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2NvbnN1bWVycy10cmF2ZWwtbG95YWx0eS1wcm9ncmFtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMTgvZm91ci1jaXZpbGlhbi1zcGFjZS10cmF2ZWxlcnMtYmFjay1vbi1lYXJ0aC1hZnRlci1sYW5kbWFyay1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four civilian space travelers back on Earth after landmark flight – Spaceflight Now,"Four civilian space travelers rode a SpaceX capsule through a blazing re-entry back into Earth’s atmosphere Saturday evening and safely splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean northeast of Cape Canaveral completing a historic 71 hours in space as the first privately-funded non-government crew to fly in orbit.

The four-person Crew Dragon Resilience spacecraft descended under four main parachutes to an on-target splashdown at 7:06 p.m. EDT (2306 GMT) Saturday about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Kennedy Space Center where the private Inspiration4 mission launched Wednesday.

“Inspiration4 on behalf of SpaceX welcome home to planet Earth” radioed Kris Young SpaceX’s space operations director moments after splashdown. “Your mission has shown the world that space is for all of us and that everyday people can make extraordinary impacts in the world around them.

“Thank you for sharing your leadership hope generosity and prosperity” Young said referring to the mission’s four principles or “pillars” attached to each Inspiration4 crew member.

Jared Isaacman the billionaire businessman and civilian pilot who paid SpaceX for the mission replied that the mission was a “heck of a ride … We’re just getting started!”

After a final braking burn to drop out of orbit the Crew Dragon streaked through the atmosphere over Florida flying southwest-to-northeast toward the splashdown zone off the east coast. Faint sonic booms were heard at Kennedy Space Center after the capsule soared overhead.

Live views broadcast by SpaceX from the Atlantic Ocean showed the spaceship’s return to Earth. Recovery teams quickly swarmed the capsule to verify there were no toxic leaks then SpaceX’s “Go Searcher” vessel raised the spacecraft from the ocean.

Once personnel positioned the capsule on the deck of the recovery ship SpaceX teams assisted each of the four Inspiration4 crew members out of the spacecraft. All four appeared ecstatic and healthy after their three days in low Earth orbit.

After medical checks and a chance to take a shower on the recovery ship the Inspiration4 crew back to Kennedy Space Center on a helicopter for a reunion with their families.

The successful mission was the first U.S. human spaceflight to orbit Earth without major participation from NASA. Advocates for commercial spaceflight said Inspiration4 opens a door for “everyday people” launch into space where fewer than 600 people have flown since the dawn of the Space Age.

The price of a trip to space is still out of reach for most people. But SpaceX is striving to make space missions more “airline-like” with lower prices and less risk according to Benji Reed SpaceX’s senior director of human spaceflight programs.

NASA’s inspector general says a seat on a Crew Dragon spacecraft for a six-month expedition to the International Space Station costs the agency more than $50 million.

Isaacman paid SpaceX less than that according to officials familiar with the arrangement but SpaceX and Isaacman have not disclosed the cost of the Inspiration4 mission.

“We can’t talk about the price of the mission” Reed said. “That’s obviously private.”

Todd “Leif” Ericson an Inspiration4 mission director said the flight signaled the start of a new era in spaceflight.

“We are certainly riding on the shoulders of giants across this nation” Ericson said in a media teleconference Saturday night. “I think today is a good day for America. I think it’s a great day for commercial space travel.

“And I really believe that this mission will be looked at (as) the opening of really the second Space Age where space becomes much more accessible to average men and women across the world.”

SpaceX developed the Crew Dragon spacecraft with assistance and funding from NASA under the auspices of a public-private cost-sharing contract.

NASA awarded $6.8 billion in contracts to SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to complete development of new commercial crew capsules to ferry crews to and from the International Space Station ending the agency’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz capsules.

SpaceX got $2.6 billion in government funding to design and build the human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft and Boeing received a similar $4.2 billion deal for its Starliner spacecraft.

Both programs ran into delays but SpaceX launched its first astronaut mission for NASA in May 2020 ending a nearly nine-year gap in U.S. orbital crew launches since the retirement of the space shuttle.

Boeing’s Starliner program on the other hand still has not flown into space with a crew.

SpaceX has launched four Crew Dragon missions to date all under contract to NASA. Three of the missions have carried astronauts to the space station.

One of the Crew Dragon missions is still docked at the space station and is scheduled to return to Earth with four astronauts in November making Inspiration4 the third Dragon flight to return to Earth with human passengers.

After launching on top of a Falcon 9 rocket Wednesday night the Crew Dragon capsule climbed into an orbit stretching as high as 366 miles (590 kilometers) above Earth higher than anyone has flown since a space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope some two decades ago.

The crew members participated in a question-and-answer session with patients at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Isaacman 38 conceived of the mission in part to raise money and awareness for St. Jude.

Isaacman established four pillars or values for the mission with each seat representing one pillar.

“We set out from the start to deliver a very inspiring message about what can be done up in in space and the possibilities there but also what we can accomplish here on Earth” Isaacman said in a press conference before launch.

Isaacman said he chose four mission pillars — leadership hope prosperity and generosity — “to assemble a very inspiring crew who all have so many amazing qualities and contribute so many interesting firsts of this mission.

“And we also chose to do it through the largest fundraising effort in the history of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital acknowledging the real responsibilities we have here on Earth in order to earn the right to make progress up in space” said Isaacman who took the commander’s seat on the mission to represent leadership.

Isaacman donated $100 million to St. Jude and started a fundraising effort linked to the Inspiration4 mission to try to raise $100 million more.

Most of the nearly 600 people who have flown in space have been professional astronauts or cosmonauts employed by a government agency. A handful of “space tourists” have flown into orbit but all launched on spacecraft commanded by a professional astronaut.

In July space companies founded by billionaires Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos accomplished a pair of suborbital flights to the edge of space.

Branson founder of Virgin Galactic flew with five crewmates on his company’s rocket plane to an altitude of 53 miles (86 kilometers) over New Mexico on July 11 experiencing several minutes of weightlessness before returning to Earth.

Blue Origin Bezos’s space company launched four people — including Bezos himself — to an altitude of 66 miles (107 kilometers) over West Texas nine days later. Like Branson Bezos’s crew floated in their capsule for a few minutes before descending back to the planet.

The Inspiration4 mission accelerated must faster speeds — more than 17000 mph — needed to enter orbit around Earth.

Issacman’s crewmates included Hayley Arceneaux a 29-year-old physician assistant at St. Jude and a survivor of childhood bone cancer. She was selected as part of the mission’s “hope” pillar.

Arceneaux became the youngest American to fly in orbit and the first person with a prosthetic body part to go to space.

Proctor the fourth Black woman to fly in space was selected in a competition for the “prosperity” seat on Inspiration4. She used Shift4 Payments a company bounded by Isaacman to promote sales of her art and poetry and submitted a Twitter video for consideration to be a part of the mission.

Sembroski entered a lottery for the “generosity” seat by donating to St. Jude. A college friend won the sweepstakes but passed on the seat and offered it to Sembroski.

Reed SpaceX’s human spaceflight director said Saturday that Inspiration4 was a “very clean mission from start to finish.”

A double-redundant temperature sensor on a Draco thruster dropped offline. “That was never a risk” Reed said.

Another problem encountered on the three-day mission was an issue with a fan on the Crew Dragon’s waste management system or toilet.

Without explaining more details Ericson said officials implemented “contingency procedures and workarounds.”

“The crew was able to obviously complete the full duration mission without any real issues” Ericson said. “As in most exploratory adventures like spaceflight there’s always you know one or two little hiccups along the way but this was dealt with amazingly by the SpaceX team.”

Isaacman and his crewmates trained with SpaceX for around six months to familiarize themselves with spacecraft systems and space operations. They were ready to manually command the Crew Dragon spacecraft in the event of an emergency but the three-day mission flew on autopilot guided by on-board computers and ground teams at SpaceX mission control in Hawthorne California.

By Saturday night the Inspiration4 fundraising initiative for St. Jude had tallied $160 million including $100 million donated by Isaacman and $60 million from the public.

Elon Musk SpaceX’s founder and CEO tweeted late Saturday: “Count me in for $50M.”

The donation of another $50 million appeared to put the St. Jude fundraiser over its $200 million goal.

In a live video downlink Friday the Inspiration4 crew described their “incredible perspective” of Earth from space. Arceneaux detailed some of the scientific experiments measuring any changes in the crew’s bodies and monitoring the radiation environment at an altitude of more than 360 miles about 100 miles above the orbit of the International Space Station.

The crew members chatted with Musk Tom Cruise and U2 lead singer Bono. They also enjoyed panoramic views from a cupola viewing window attached to the front end of the spaceship.

The video update Friday was the first only public downlink from the crew between launch and landing. Space-to-ground communications are broadcast publicly throughout NASA flights to and from the International Space Station keeping with the government agency’s charter for openness.

But radio transmissions between the Inspiration4 crew and SpaceX mission control were not available to the public limiting real-time insight into the crew’s activities in orbit.

The Crew Dragon spacecraft was in near-constant communication with SpaceX mission control through voice and data links provided by NASA’s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite network. The Crew Dragon can only downlink live video during passes over ground stations.

Ground teams planned to retrieve high-resolution still photos and high-definition video recordings including imagery from a GoPro 360-degree camera after splashdown Saturday night. The video will be featured in a Netflix documentary about the mission.

SpaceX has other private crew missions on the books beginning with the launch of another four-person team on a Dragon spacecraft in early 2022. On that mission sponsored by the Houston-based company Axiom Space the Dragon spacecraft will dock with the space station and the private astronauts will spend about a week living and working there under an arrangement with NASA.

There are also more dedicated NASA flights with SpaceX’s fleet Crew Dragon capsules. SpaceX’s next NASA crew flight is set for launch Oct. 31 from Kennedy Space Center to kick off a six-month expedition to the space station.

“As we look for ways to evolve toward that airline-like model we’ll look for how we can cut back on the amount of training that’s necessary to ensure safety” Reed said before Inspiration4’s launch.

“The reality is that the Dragon manifest is getting busier by the moment” Reed said. “We’re gearing up to fly three four five six times a year at least.”

It was initially published in 1896 and since then a significant quantity of important information has continued to be provided about inventories from various firms. This guide explores all about this robust index.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) is one of many indexes used as a gauge for how well an entire market performs at any given time. The index can be helpful because it shows where and how much specific markets have fluctuated in value for days weeks or months. It also allows investors to track their investment performance and compare themselves against others with different portfolios.

History of DJIA

The DJIA is one of the oldest and most well-known stock market indexes in America. Charles Dow the co-founder of the Wall Street Journal created the index back in 1884. Charles Dow composed his first stock average of nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the Customer’s Afternoon Letter a daily two-page financial news bulletin that preceded The Wall Street Journal. By 1900 the index was renamed Dow Jones Industrial Average and included 30 equities divided into two groups: the industrials (comprising 19 members) and the railroads (11).

DJIA expanded beyond transportation stocks with the addition of General Electric (NYSE: GE) in 1901. It joined as one of 11 industrial sector companies added that year due to perceived growth prospects based on earnings per share multiples at a time resulting from significant expansion following consolidation/merger wave among USUS manufacturing businesses during the 1890s – 1910s.

Many significant adjustments occurred throughout the 20th century as many former components combined departed or were relocated.

Using historical data from the DJIA you could get a good idea about what factors affect stocks in general. For example if you saw that oil prices tend to go up when there’s terrible weather somewhere – maybe your portfolio has some exposure to alternative energy research?

DJIA history is a significant indicator of the overall direction of top-level economic activity as measured by leading US industrial corporations whose performance is indicative of changes in business conditions and investment prospects for stock market investors. DJIA value has been included in significant decisions regarding monetary policy that affect global markets such as Federal Reserve rate decision announcements published in advance so financial professionals can monitor new information before public release.

Understanding the Dow Jones Industrial Average

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) sometimes called the “Dow” is a stock market index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States are trading during a standard trading session in the stock market.

The components of DJIA are chosen from leading US companies across different industry groups to reflect their significance within those specific industries and national markets overall.

For a company’s stocks to be added onto or removed from this average they must meet specific requirements including management integrity and liquidity along with shareholder equity over time which helps ensure only established corporations remain included.

Dow Jones Industrial Average Components

The DJIA comprises numerous components that are crucial to the information it provides about how well or poorly the stock market as a whole has performed on any given day.

As of 2021 the Dow Jones Average Index includes the following companies: Apple Inc (NYSE: AAPL) Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE: CRM) Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) Visa Inc (NYSE: V) The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) The American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: HON) Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) The Travelers Companies (NYSE: TRV) Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) Merck & Co. Inc (NYSE: MRK) UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) IBM (NYSE: IBM) 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) The Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) Amgen Inc (NASDAQ: AMGN) Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT) Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA).

DJIA vs the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite

While the basic mission of DJIA S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite is similar the way they go about the task is very different.

Their selection methodology varies. The Dow tracks the value of 30 large companies which tend to be blue-chip firms that are household names. The S&P 500 tends to be broader hoping to have a bigger representation of companies from various sectors and industry groups. And the Nasdaq composite includes only stocks that are trading on the Nasdaq market.

Conclusion

The DJIA has been a historical benchmark for investors to keep in mind when evaluating their stock performance compared to other top companies on the market. However there are many different indices these days and each investor needs to conduct thorough research before placing any investments with a financial adviser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy91bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtY2VvLXBhc3Nlbmdlci12YWNjaW5lLW1hbmRhdGUtYmlkZW7SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvdW5pdGVkLWFpcmxpbmVzLWNlby1wYXNzZW5nZXItdmFjY2luZS1tYW5kYXRlLWJpZGVuLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Airlines CEO: ‘We’re prepared’ for passenger vaccine mandate if Biden says so,"United Airline CEO Scott Kirby said Sunday his company is ""prepared"" to require COVID-19 vaccinations among passengers if President Biden says so.

Appearing on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" Kirby said he believes a vaccine mandate for travelers would place undue ""burden"" on vaccinated people but he would nevertheless support a mandate if the Biden administration determined it was necessary.

BIDEN'S SILENT SHUTDOWN: BUSINESSES SHUTTER AMID VACCINE MANDATES EXTENDED COVID RELIEF

""I think the administration’s doing a really admirable job of trying to find all the levers to push to get the whole country vaccinated"" he said. ""I think the administration’s perspective has been that getting people vaccinated at work it’s a one-shot and you can really get a high percentage of the country as opposed to making it a burden on people that are vaccinated – every time you get on a plane a train any kind of public transportation – to prove that you’re vaccinated.""

Biden unveiled a new plan this month that directs the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine or weekly tests and he signed an executive order requiring all federal government employees to be vaccinated.

Kirby cheered the move and said it would help reinvigorate air travel which he said he didn’t expect to rebound until January.

""For now I think their approach of focusing on the employment and focusing on work is probably the right way to go"" he added. ""But they get great data and science and if they tell us that they want us to check everyone we’re prepared to do that as well.""

In August United Airlines became the first major airline to mandate the vaccine among its 67000 U.S. employees. Kirby told CNN last week that about 90% of the company's employees had shown proof of their vaccination to the airline and that very few employees had resigned over the mandate. He also said he didn't think a vaccine mandate for passengers would greatly increase vaccination rates and that such a decision would have to be federally mandated."

(Seminoles.com) — Quarterback McKenzie Milton completed 11 of 16 passes for 119 yards Ontaria Wilson posted 91 receiving yards and Treshaun Ward ran for 48 yards but Florida State lost its ACC opener to Wake Forest by a 35-14 margin at Truist Field.

Wake Forest scored the first 14 points of the game and led 27-14 at halftime. The Demon Deacons scored only once after halftime as the Florida State defense limited Wake Forest to 152 total yards in the second half. Wake Forest held the ball on offense for 39 minutes as they not only kept Florida State’s defense on the field but held the Seminoles to 21:00 minutes of possession. Wake Forest’s up-tempo offense ran 89 plays while the Deacons limited Florida State’s offense to 51 plays.

Florida State’s defense was stout as it recorded 95 total tackles during the game. Jermaine Johnson led the Seminoles with 10 tackles (six unassisted). He was credited with one quarterback hurry and a quarterback sack. Florida State totaled three sacks in the game and have a team total of 12 in the first three games of the season – three more than the Seminoles recorded in nine games during the 2020 season. Johnson has 5.0 sacks and 7.0 tackles for minus yardage in his first season as a Seminole.

Quarterback Jordan Travis threw for two touchdowns – one to Wilson and one by Ward – as he completed five of six passes for 107 yards.

“Disappointed in the outcome of today” said Seminole Head Coach Mike Norvell following the game.

“I’m hurting for these guys that are in the locker room. There’s a lot of work that goes invested. I believe in these guys. I believe in what they can do. I believe in what they can accomplish. In the moment we’ve got to keep that same belief and go out there and play to the belief and go out there and play to the level and coach to the level that we are capable of. You’ve got to give credit to Wake Forest for how they played and what they did.”

Wake Forest struck first after both teams traded turnovers on the first two possessions of the game (an interception by Florida State’s Sydney Williams and a fumble by the Seminoles’ Jashaun Corbin). The Deacons scored on a 49-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Sam Hartman to A.T. Perry for a 7-0 Wake Forest lead.

Christian Beal-Smith increased Wake Forest’s lead to 14-0 with a seven-yard scoring run as the home team scored for the second time in the first quarter. The Deacons’ scoring drive was kept alive by a roughing the punter penalty called on the Seminoles.

Florida State cut the Deacons’ lead in half late in the first quarter as Travis found Treshaun Ward on an 8-yard touchdown scoring play to make the score 14-7. The touchdown pass was the third of the season for Jordan and the first career touchdown reception for Ward.

Hartman connected with Donald Stewart on an 11-yard touchdown pass to increase Wake Forest’s lead to 21-7 early in the second quarter. The scoring pass culminated a 12-play 75-yard drive – a drive that included a 14-yard unnecessary roughness penalty called on the Seminoles.

A 42-yard field goal by Wake Forest’s Nick Sciba increased the Demon Deacon’s lead to 24-7 with 3:25 left before halftime.

A second touchdown pass by Travis – this time to Wilson – brought the Seminoles to within 10 at 24-14 at the 3:16 mark of the second quarter.

Wake Forest added a 22-yard field goal by Sciba and led 27-14 at halftime.

After forcing Florida State to punt on its first possession of the second half Hartman led a lengthy 14-play 90-yard drive that ended in a one-yard scoring burst by Justice Ellison. The touchdown increased the Deacons’ lead to 35-14 and was the final score of the game by either team.

Florida State plays host to Louisville Sept. 25 at Doak Campbell Stadium in a 3:30 start as the Seminoles return home for the first of two consecutive home games.

Bulls designated hitter Rene Pinto smashed three hits and drove in four runs while second baseman Esteban Quiroz and catcher David Freitas both homered as Durham clinched the regular season Triple-A National Championship title with a 9-5 win over the Charlotte Knights on Saturday evening at Truist Field.

The win guarantees the Bulls the best overall regular season record among all 30 Triple-A teams marking the third time in the franchise’s history they have earned the Triple-A National Championship. Durham’s previous two league titles came in 2009 and 2017. The Bulls clinched the Triple-A East regular season title with a win on Thursday evening after clinching their 15th division crown in 23 seasons at the Triple-A level on Tuesday.

After the Knights jumped ahead with a three-run first frame Pinto lined a two-run single in the third to narrow the deficit to one. Charlotte would plate a single tally in the fourth prior to Quiroz’s go-ahead three-run homer to right in the sixth pushing the Bulls ahead 5-4.Freitas would then leave the yard with a two-run shot one inning later before Pinto laced another two-run single in the eighth to make it 9-4. The Knights then made it a four-run contest with another single score in the last of the eighth.

Pinto (3-5 4 RBI) and RF Josh Lowe (3-5 R) each posted a game-high three hits with CF Garrett Whitley (2-4 2 R 2B BB) adding a multi-hit effort of his own. Durham starting pitcher Brent Honeywell Jr. (6.0 IP 8 H 4 R 4 ER 0 BB 5 K) earned the win while Charlotte reliever Matt Foster (1.0 IP 3 H 3 R 3 ER BB K) suffered the defeat.

The two teams are set to complete their regular seasons on Sunday evening with first pitch scheduled for 6:05pm. Durham’s starter has not yet been announced while RHP Alex McRae is anticipated to get the nod for the Knights.

The Bulls return to Durham for their final homestand of the 2021 campaign on Wednesday September 22 to start a five-game set versus the Gwinnett Stripers the Triple-A affiliate of the Atlanta Braves. First pitch of the series opener is set for 6:35pm. Tickets for that game as well as all remaining Bulls home games are available and can be purchased at DurhamBulls.com.",,,

The Red Raiders shook loose from a tight game after the first quarter with four touchdowns in the second period and racked up 264 yards along the way. They finished the night with 580 yards.

In the best offensive night this year for Texas Tech (3-0) Shough was an effective catalyst. He spread the ball around to 11 receivers and twice completed eight passes in a row going 26 of 35.

The Red Raiders needed that spark after falling behind 7-0 in the first quarter. The Panthers (1-2) blended inside power runs by D'vonte Price and deep throws by Max Bortenschlager to piece together an 88-yard drive. Price bulled into the end zone with 6:27 to go in the opening quarter for a 7-0 lead.

Meanwhile Texas Tech's offense scuffled. The Red Raiders' first two possessions ended in punts and when they forced FIU into a three-and-out returner Adrian Frye muffed the ball to give it right back to the Panthers.

The game changed on the next snap though when Texas Tech defensive back Marquis Waters picked off a Bortenschlager pass found daylight on the sideline and dashed 72 yards for a touchdown return.

FIU drove into field-goal range on the ensuing possession but Chase Gabriel's kick was wide left and the Panthers never recovered.

Knotted at 7-all the Red Raider offense kicked into gear with four consecutive touchdown drives in the second period covering 80 75 68 and 61 yards. Shough completed 12-of-13 passes in that span for 217 yards and touchdowns to Travis Koontz twice and Trey Cleveland. Tahj Brooks rushed for the other score.

Texas Tech continue to move the ball after halftime sandwiching a field goal and touchdown around FIU's third TD in the third period. Backup quarterback Henry Colombi took over and engineered the final scoring drive which he finished with a 19-yard scamper.

Bortenschlager completed 12 of 27 throws for 190 yards two touchdowns and a pick.

PAST AND PRESENT

Texas Tech added two names to the stadium's Ring of Honor at halftime one name familiar to fans of modern football and one from the Red Raiders' past. Elmer Tarbox was a three-sport letterman at Texas Tech from 1937-39 the co-MVP of the 1939 Cotton Bowl and a B-25 bomber pilot in World War II winning both the Silver Star and Purple Heart. He later served as a Texas state representative from 1967-77. Michael Crabtree meanwhile caught 231 passes for 3087 yards and 41 touchdowns from 2007-08 to become the first two-time winner of the Biletnikoff Award as college football's top receiver. He spent 11 years in the NFL the last in 2019.

THE TAKEAWAY

FIU: Lost its second game on as many road trips to Texas and looked bad in the process. Unable to get Price on track (51 rushing yards) the offense fizzled after a promising start against the first power-five foe it has faced this season.

Texas Tech: Its trend of slow starts continued for a third week in a row but the Red Raiders snapped out of their funk much better than in the first two games to complete their first perfect non-conference season since 2017.

In the best offensive night this year for Texas Tech (3-0) Shough was an effective catalyst. He spread the ball around to 11 receivers and twice completed eight passes in a row going 26 of 35.

In the first two games the Red Raiders ran only 102 plays and star receiver Erik Ezukanma had 17 of the team’s 27 receptions. He faced double-teams most of the night and Shough adjusted.

“We got to spread the wealth a little more and you saw guys making plays” Texas Tech coach Matt Wells said.

Added Shough “It was just part of the progressions. Guys were getting open and I got them the ball.”

There was more than enough shelf-stable food on standby thanks to Unincarcerated Minds. The local nonprofit composed mostly of formerly incarcerated people and their loved ones brought 5000 pounds of food.

Ralph Mitchell a member of the group comes from Norristown. He said this act of community service means a lot to him.

“The main thing I like to do is come back to my community and do the best thing I can for my community. I grew up kind of OK but I’m different. And I just want to make sure that our community is taken care of properly” Mitchell said.

Saturday was a team effort and the public defenders are always looking to add to their roster of partner organizations.

“We are seeking to make sure that everybody is connected to what they need at this moment. And we’re going to continue to expand our efforts every year little by little based upon what we see is going on in the county” Hook said.

With criminal justice reform having a moment in public discourse the public defenders also hope to seize that moment through events such as these to make an impact.

“Our office believes in a holistic representation of the individual. And it’s our vision with the office that we focus really on three things” Nester said.

The first is obviously providing good legal representation for their clients. The second is making sure their clients have the tools they need to succeed after they leave the criminal justice system.

The last is simple and very relevant to Saturday’s event: providing people with opportunities and resources so that they don’t end up in the criminal justice system in the first place.

For those that do the Montgomery County OIC and Unincarcerated Minds are co-hosting an expungement clinic Sept. 25 with the secretary of the state’s Board of Pardons Brandon Flood at the OIC’s Norristown headquarters.

Saturday’s event started rather slowly but as people started to take notice of what was being offered in the parking lot the numbers grew as the hours passed.

Some of that was because of Seanah Gary who moved to Norristown from Philadelphia. She didn’t know about the event until she passed by while walking her dog. Curious she took the dog home and came back for another look.

Then she called her friend over Raphael Gladden who’s originally from North Philly.

“I moved up here in ’94 to get a better way for my family to live found a niche and I’ve been here ever since” Gladden said.

Now Gladden said he’s looking for any and every job opportunity available to him.

Meanwhile Gary said she likes doing hair and wants to go to cosmetology school but she is also willing to learn new skills — and help her neighbors.

“I just want everybody to help each other out and I think everybody should be a part of the community and try to make everybody better” Gary said.

Charles Delaney of West Norriton works as a social worker. Wife Audrey Delaney is a special education teacher. They came to the job and resource fair to see what was going on in their community.

“Plus quite frankly we’re also in need. So we want to see what resources are available” Charles said.

He was able to exchange business cards and interact with people regarding social services.

“I think that it’s awesome that these agencies are going to reach out to people” he said.

After the food distribution booth one of the most visited tables was operated by the Norristown Hospitality Center a neighborhood day shelter that offers breakfast five days a week showers mail contracts social services locker storage and even travel assistance to job interviews.

“We also are there to support and encourage people and what they need. We’re offering right now the Arize Program. It’s a back-to-work program. It’s going to be Oct. 4th through the 8th from 9 to 3 at the Hospitality Center. This is a course that’s basically brushing up on skills like resume writing and interviewing skills so that people can get back in the workforce” said Heather Mingle the center’s workforce development coordinator.

Sidney Williams cooks the breakfast for the Hospitality Center and he also throws a barbecue every summer for those experiencing homelessness.

“We have a lot of people that contribute and to help make it grow bigger and bigger each year” Williams said.

However he said that the organization is always looking for more help and resources to support its clientele. The group is hosting its eighth annual Sole Harvest 5K and 1 Mile Walk for those experiencing poverty at 9 a.m. Oct. 9 at Norristown Farm Park.

Another busy booth Saturday belonged to Norristown’s NAACP branch getting people registered to vote.

Angelique Hinton the branch president said she’s noticed that the community often gets the short end of the stick after disasters. She was there to make sure that didn’t happen.

“Communities like Norristown don’t necessarily have the resources or the support that they really need to kind of get back on their feet. And so that’s something that we encounter working with communities of color in particular. So really trying to partner with the county and the federal government to make sure that those resources are there” Hinton said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA5LTE3L3Utcy1ncm9jZXJzLXRvLWdhaW4tbmV3LWFsdC1tZWF0LWVudHJhbnQtYXMtYWRtLWVudGVycy1mb3JhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alt-Meat Options Grow as ADM Confronts Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods,"Why did this happen?

Today all the beef that Everett's buys is processed in Omaha. Like many industries beef processing over decades has been reshaped by scale and specialization to bring consumers more products at lower prices. And it's cheaper for Everett's and most groceries to sell beef from the global supply chain than from farmers down the road.

""We'd like to be able to buy from local producers but it's not cost-effective"" said Evan Pregler the meat buyer at the family-run store.

But now there are signs that the drive for efficiency and low prices may have gone too far in the beef industry. More than 80% of the beef consumed in the U.S. is processed by just four companies. The vulnerability of that concentration surfaced at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic last year when stricken workers forced processing plants to close temporarily.

Lately another effect emerged. As the economy recovered and food prices surged as part of an inflationary wave — consumers paid 12% more for beef last month than a year ago the government said last week — processors captured far more money than farmers did. Meanwhile drought damaged grasslands across the Midwest this summer sending feed costs soaring for cattle growers.

""At a time when beef was at record sales we were losing $100 on almost every animal we processed"" said Don Schiefelbein who farms several thousand head of cattle with his seven brothers near Kimball Minn.

Farmers are getting a smaller portion of the wholesale value of beef today than they did two years ago.

Schiefelbein who is also president-elect of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the lament on farms and ranches is nearly universal: ""Why in record prices am I not making enough to pay my bills?""

Now Washington is getting involved with the Biden administration taking steps to ease the effects of consolidation in meatpacking.

What's clear is there aren't enough slaughterhouses to keep up with all the cattle ready for slaughter. This oversupply often forces farmers and feedlots to sell cattle at discount. Processors cite labor shortages and COVID-19 safety protocols for slowing their output creating a surplus of cattle.

But signs of trouble in the nation's beef supply chain predate the pandemic.

A 2012 drought killed off vast supplies of grass throughout cattle country queuing up a livestock shortage. The big processors including Minnetonka-based Cargill shuttered a handful of major slaughterhouses around the country because they didn't have the cattle to support them.

The cattle numbers rebounded but the capacity never did.

Then in August 2019 a fire at a Tyson beef packing plant in Holcomb Kan. severely curtailed the nation's beef production capacity. Allison VanDerWal executive director for the Minnesota State Cattlemen's Association called it a ""black swan event.""

Then the early weeks of the pandemic brought worries of food shortages as plants closed due to outbreaks. In late April 2020 then-President Donald Trump ordered the government to ensure that meat plants stayed open leading many to operate at reduced capacity.

Even so profits remained steady or better for the big four processors — Cargill JBS Food National Beef Packing Co. and Tyson Foods — and they also took a greater share of overall sales.

Two years ago processors paid cattle farmers about $1550 per animal a figure derived from what's known as the carcass weight or the weight of meat. Processors at that time received about $1900 per animal when they shipped meat to groceries and restaurants.

Today farmers are paid on average about $1700 per animal while processors are getting around $2500 widening the revenue gap to more than $800. The difference in profits per animal is likely even greater farmers say.

""It's ridiculous"" said Dan Owens a livestock farmer in Truman Minn. ""The big processors — those guys are making a thousand bucks a head right now. All of these producers they're lucky if they're getting $100 $150 a head.""

At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on beef prices in July Tyson executive Shane Miller said the change in financial outcomes has ""everything to do with the law of supply and demand."" He cited ""unprecedented shocks"" from the pandemic and severe weather that left processors unable to operate at capacity.

The profitability of farmers and processors diverged like this every five or so years over the last two decades said Michael Swanson chief agricultural economist for Wells Fargo. He found only one instance in 22 years of pricing comparisons where cattle producers had better margins than processors.

""This is an industry prone to cyclical outbursts of imbalance"" Swanson said.

Forecasters predict farmers will be paid more for cattle next year due to large sell-offs of herds this year in drought-stricken areas he said. That could ease the financial imbalance and some of the tensions between farmers and processors.

Tom Pyfferoen checked on some of his herd of beef cattle at his farm in Pine Island.

Another strain on Minnesota cattle growers: They aren't fetching the same prices for their cattle as counterparts in the southern U.S.

Under what's called a ""live negotiated"" process in the north a representative from a meatpacker will give the farmer a base price. The rates are reported to the USDA and publicly available. ""It's like buying a car"" VanDerWal said.

But cattle growers in the southern U.S. typically sell under a ""formula"" system which aren't considered live cash sales and don't carry a reporting requirement. That leaves southern growers able to set their own pricing formula — often higher — based on publicly-reported sales rates without having to participate in that disclosure.

Mike Landuyt who runs a 700-cattle feedlot near Walnut Grove Minn. said cattle producers are skeptical that the federal government can fix the system given that the north-south discrepancy arose from the 1999 Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act which itself was a product of growing political concerns over meatpacking consolidation.

But last month the USDA took a significant step toward fixing this glitch by publishing a new daily report that includes total head sold using formulas and what the average price was.

""We are certainly excited we are getting some of these numbers now. It's definitely a partial solution"" VanDerWal said. ""Now we want to know what these formulas are based on how they are determined.""

Meanwhile in early July the U.S. Department of Agriculture took a swing at the processing bottleneck problem by promising $500 million to spur construction and expansion of smaller meat processing plants.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told Minnesota farmers last month the money is meant to increase capacity and reverse the effects of industry consolidation. Funds will be used to offset inspection fees for struggling small processors and be distributed as grants and loans for existing small packers to expand.

Cargill declined to comment on the USDA's efforts and plans to decentralize the nation's meat processing.

""We want to make sure we can help small and very very small processors"" Vilsack said in Cannon Falls Minn. as he urged Congress to increase funding further. ""We don't have enough capacity.""

Long-time cattle farmers remember when there were more players in beef processing.

""There used to be five six seven packing plants in operation in South St. Paul"" said Tom Pyfferoen 70 who farms a few hundred head of cattle south of Pine Island Minn. ""And often there were days when all of them needed more cattle. So the farmer had a market to compete in. That doesn't exist anymore.""

These days he sells mostly to a buyer representing Arkansas-based Tyson which lately has been setting dates up to a month in the future when they want to make a transaction. That Pyfferoen said leaves him on the hook to keep feeding the animals. ""Absolutely I wish I had more choices"" Pyfferoen said.

Just as Pyfferoen ships his livestock several states away for processing into beef Everett's buys all its beef from JBS and National Beef processing facilities in Nebraska.

Everett's has been in business under the same ownership since 1956. Jane McCormick the store manager and daughter of the founder said the store sees little benefit from the recent jump in beef prices. ""If anything we see a hit because more people can't afford to buy it at a higher price point"" she said.

Some cattle farmers are finding options outside the commodity market controlled by the Big Four. Jared Luhman keeps about 220 pasture-fed cattle on a Goodhue County farm selling most to a small independent cattle cooperative and the rest directly to consumers through a website.

""In one way the price of commodity beef coming up makes my price a little more competitive"" Luhman said. ""We're definitely high-priced but if everything rises a little closer to us all of a sudden I'm a little more competitive."""

A new system enables bank customers to switch from one bank to another online quickly and at no cost.

Under the new “follow me” service bank accounts can be switched within seven days and any charges or deposits reaching the old account will automatically be routed to the new account within two years of the switch. Under the current situation any debits or credits for a closed account are returned and it is the customer's responsibility to arrange the transaction.

Users can request to transfer between banks via the banks’ websites and at bank branches the central bank said. Accounts with complicated issues or legal holds against them may not be eligible for the program.

Customers with questions or needing assistance should contact the new bank not the old one the Bank of Israel clarified. Information is also available at switchbank.org.il.

The system which was developed over more than three years is part of a series of steps initiated by the Bank of Israel and the Finance Ministry to enhance competition in the financial system. While many Israelis say they are unhappy with their banking services very few actually switch banks due to the high costs and inconveniences involved.

“Completing this step is another stage on the way toward an open transparent and more competitive financial system that we are promoting on several fronts and that will enable customers to easily and conveniently choose the providers of the various financial services they use” said Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron. “We will continue to utilize the digital age available to us in order to advance processes and reduce barriers in the financial system and in the payment systems.”

“Rapid transfer from one bank to another is an important step and an integral part of the policy of enhancing competition that we have adopted in various industries” Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman added. “We will continue working to reduce bureaucracy in significant focal points that ease our daily conduct.”

The new system will enable customers to easily move credit balances in shekels and in foreign currency debit balances in shekels and in foreign currency authorized debits of a current account checks securities (Israeli and foreign) credit card activities and standing orders. Regarding loans and mortgages as well as savings accounts special arrangements were made according to which the banks will work out each case on an individual basis with their customers.

The new system will not be available for customers of Union Bank which is expected to be merged with Bank Mizrahi Tefahot and Bank of Jerusalem at which the number of customers managing a current account is very low. Customers of those banks interested in switching to another bank can do so using a different mechanism the central bank said.

Switching to the new First Digital Bank will be available as of April 1 2022 it added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjQ5ZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQ5ZXJzLXByZXAtc2VsZWN0cy1ncmVnLWNhbGNhZ25vLWFzLXRoZS1jb2FjaC1vZi10aGUtd2Vla9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,49ers PREP Selects Greg Calcagno as the Coach of the Week,,,,,,,

Northern Express hails some rides and learns why toting takeout is better than porting people

By Brighid Driscoll | Sept. 18 2021

Is there a better airport experience to be had at Cherry Capital Airport in Traverse City?

I don't think so.

The postage-sized airport is pleasant. It's clean and quiet and its small size makes for a simple streamlined experience. Never have I dreaded navigating a long TSA line or long-distance run to another terminal at Cherry Capital. What I found myself dreading the last time I returned from a trip was finding a way home.

A few Sundays ago I was sitting outside of the airport refreshing an open Uber app roughly every 10 minutes. Each time a message popped up on the screen telling me that there were no cars available. After grappling with the thought of hoofing it several miles to my home at nearly 11pm it occurred to me to try calling a local cab company. Within 20 minutes About Time Transportation arrived to give me a ride and I was surprised and relieved.

The experience got me wondering: How have local cab companies fared over the last two years with the onslaught of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft? How have all of those companies fared through the pandemic? (Hint: Not great.) So where are all the drivers going? I dialed up some local drivers to find out.

SHIFT INTO REVERSE

Uber and Lyft have been operating in Grand Traverse and Leelanau counties since 2017. Independent drivers signed up to give rides in their own cars whenever they made themselves available and they got paid for doing so. For many it was an easy way to make extra cash. For others it was a full-time job.



Suttons Bay resident Marti Johnson started driving for Uber soon after they launched in the area. She said it was a great way to meet new people make money and test out material for her comedy routine. Through meeting some of those new people she learned that she could operate as an independent ride service and make more money. She gained more control over pricing set her own rates and schedules and also started offering wine tours.

""Uber was the first time I worked as a driver"" Johnson says. ""I wanted to be able to help people out and make extra money. But I was busy enough with private drives that I just didn't drive [for Uber] anymore when the pandemic struck. I didn't need to.”

Although Northern Express wasn’t able to access any data on the number of Uber or Lyft drivers working locally before and after the onset of the pandemic it’s likely demand for rides sharply decreased when restaurants bars and many other social venues closed.

As local businesses reopened however it appears few drivers returned to the companies. On a recent Friday night one Northern Express staffer waited more than an hour before the single Uber driver on the road in Traverse City that night was available for a two-mile ride home from an Elmwood Township eatery on West Bay.

When asked about the extensive wait the driver told our rider that he is often the only driver available. Most Uber drivers he said quit altogether or switched to drive for meal-delivery services which were in high demand during the height of the pandemic and continue to be now. The working conditions when delivering food instead of passengers he added are better; no drunk or unruly passengers and less risk of exposure to COVID-19.

Johnson has found that Uber and Lyft’s loss has proved to be her gain.

“I just had these four gals who were staying at Island View Cottages call me. They were stuck at Chateau Chantal because they had thought they could just Uber back. Thankfully someone gave them my card so I was able to give them a ride.""

SO WHAT ABOUT LOCAL CABS?

If anyone knows the cab business it's Ashley Montgomery. The Traverse City local has worked with cabs since she was 15 years old. She previously owned Cool Cab (pictured above) and helped start About Time Transportation.

""My grandpa was a trucker and my grandma drove school buses so driving is in my blood” she says. “When I was a stay-at-home mom I did not want to drive a bus. I'm with kids all the time at home! When I'm at work I don't want to deal with them.”

But because she has young kids she wanted a flexible job. Working as a driver for local cab companies gave her that flexibility and eventually inspired her to launch her own service Cool Cab in August 2018. The competition from Uber and Lyft wasn’t easy but Cool Cab withstood it even adding a new SUV to her fleet of minivans. Montgomery managed to hang on for several months after the pandemic started — even offering free deliveries of groceries and other necessities to help the community that spring. But by the second shutdown in November it had become too much. Business slowed again to a crawl and keeping drivers on staff became a burden. She closed Cool Cab before November 2020 was out.



Montgomery tried to drive for Uber after closing her business but was denied based on the year of her car. (Drivers must own a vehicle that is 15 years old or newer.) The neatly kept fleet of cabs Montgomery used for Cool Cab were older model cars. In her experience cleanliness matters more than modernity.

When she couldn't get hired with Uber she started working for the food delivery services DoorDash. It's a solution for now.

""There are nights when it's good but then there are nights where people just don't tip and it's not worth it to sit in line for someone at Taco Bell for $3.""

OVERDRIVE

DoorDash isn't struggling the same way that Uber is. For one there is no age requirement for vehicles. For some there's also the added appeal of less contact.

""I would rather drive food around than people"" says local Michael Babcock. ""No one's going to puke in your car or give you a hard time.""

He's been DoorDashing in the Traverse City area for the past two years. He works full-time at another job but uses DoorDash as a way to make a few extra dollars. He tells Northern Express he’s made at least $500 some weeks and enjoys the flexibility and incentives DoorDash provides such as Peak Pay bonus pay added to each order accepted during busy times like lunch hour and dinnertime. Achieving fun company challenges can result in additional bonuses.

A DoorDash I ordered last Sunday took less than 45 minutes though it should be noted that I always provide a decent tip whenever I order. Those who don't might find themselves waiting longer; the app enables drivers to see how much they'll earn for delivering an order before they choose to accept or not. Basically the better the tip the faster you'll receive your food. A pitfall of Uber: Drivers don't know if they're getting tipped or not until after the ride. Tip transparency or not Montgomery misses her cab-driving days.

""If people aren't tipping [for DoorDash] then it just isn't worth it. DoorDash essentially pays for your gas while you're driving to pick up these orders so if people aren't tipping you're just not making money"" she says.

What Montgomery misses about cab driving is the consistency the pay and even the people.

""I have my days. Since COVID people have been Karens and have been just disrespectful. So in that aspect I like dealing with the food just because I don't have to deal with grumpy people. But I miss talking with people. A year and a half ago things were just different.""

Hayley Prim a representative from Uber told me that Uber's need for drivers is a trend in other parts of the country as well. ""Riders have returned to the platform at much higher rates than drivers. It's not unique to Traverse City.

To combat the imbalance Uber offers a sign-on bonus that pays new drivers anywhere from $500 to $1000 after completing a certain amount of rides. ""We do still see some supply issues and we understand that there are longer ETAs and people are having a harder time finding a ride but we are still definitely operating in Traverse City"" said Prim.

In short if you’ve got a hankering for a meal from your favorite local restaurant and want it delivered to your door you’re likely going to get it quickly (provided you offer a fair tip). But if you need a ride to get somewhere at a certain time such as the airport or your home after the bars close you might not want to count on a last-minute Uber or Lyft ride in Traverse City; booking with a local cab company in advance is the closest thing to a guarantee you're going to get. And if demand for cab rides continues to increase Montgomery says she might even open up Cool Cab again.

""When it's all said and done the local [cab services] end up costing the same as Uber. And I just like being a cab driver. Once I started I didn't want to stop"" Montgomery says. ""I like driving around and listening to music and making a difference in someone's day.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEwMDA2MTkzL1ViZXItYm9zcy1hZG1pdHMtY2FiLWhhaWxpbmctc2VydmljZS1zdWZmZXJpbmctaGlnaGVyLWRyaXZlci1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb25zLmh0bWzSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDAwNjE5My9hbXAvVWJlci1ib3NzLWFkbWl0cy1jYWItaGFpbGluZy1zZXJ2aWNlLXN1ZmZlcmluZy1oaWdoZXItZHJpdmVyLWNhbmNlbGxhdGlvbnMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber boss admits cab-hailing service is suffering 'higher driver cancellations',"Why it's become so hard to get an Uber: Perfect storm of problems facing customers wanting a ride Lack of drivers Uber has lost thousands of drivers since the start of the Covid pandemic according to those working with the service. Many drivers are understood to have swapped taxi driving for takeaway deliveries following a huge drop in demand for cabs during lockdown. Uber says it wants to recruit 20000 new drivers by the end of 2021. Surge pricing A lack of drivers has led to an increase in surge pricing some say. The app automatically raises prices to match increased demand. With less Uber drivers around surging happens more drivers say. Drivers using rival apps Uber drivers are allowed to use rival ride-hailing apps at the same time. This allows them to pick and choose the best fares. But it also means drivers can cancel trips enroute to pick-ups if they find a better fare leaving users facing a longer wait. Trips not worthwhile for drivers Because Uber does not pay its drivers to get to a customers drivers say short trips which take a long time to get to aren't worthwhile. It means if you are far away from a group of drivers and it is a short trip it may not be economically viable for them to pick you p. Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes causing a nightmare On top of that Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes are making it harder for taxi drivers to reach their customers discouraging them from accepting fares.

An Uber boss has admitted the cab-hailing service is suffering 'higher driver cancellations' with frustrated customers experiencing longer waits for a pick-up as drivers ditch jobs they don't think are 'worth the fare'.

MailOnline previously revealed that users were finding it harder to get an Uber after 'thousands' of drivers quit the app since the start of the Covid crisis - with many now working for takeaway delivery firms such as JustEat Deliveroo and sister firm UberEats.

Jamie Heywood Uber's general manager for northern and eastern Europe has now admitted that the app is suffering higher driver cancellations with 35 per cent of cars now taking five or more minutes to arrive.

Speaking to the Sunday Times he said some of these problems can be traced back to a decision to introduce 'upfront pricing' last October giving driver and passenger a fixed price for the journey.

Though it is meant to be fairer than the previous system of an estimated price range drivers say they lose money if traffic is heavier than expected or if they must make a diversion.

The price is only revised upwards if they have to drive at least 40 per cent further or for 20 per cent longer than calculated.

It can take a while to work out if a job is worth accepting and drivers suffer no penalty if they reject it. Many other drivers also work for one or more of Uber's rivals so they can scroll on through other better offers and ditch a fare to avoid risk.

Mr Heywood said that demand for Uber has risen by as much as 40 per cent in some cities since the end of lockdown as many people seek to avoid public transport - which has has left him looking to recruit an extra 20000 drivers to add to the 70000 regulars.

Uber increased the service rate from 20 to 25 per cent for thousands of drivers after Supreme Court judges in the UK ruled the company must give its workers benefits such as holiday pay.

To keep their take-home pay up drivers are taking to 'multi-apping' - using other ride-hailing services such as Bolt and FreeNow at the same - in order to pick-up the highest fare.

But it means passengers waiting for an Uber are regularly having rides accepted only to have them cancelled while the driver is en route. Some disgruntled passengers say they have waited more than 10 minutes for a ride in London - where pick-up times were previously a matter of minutes.

On top of that cabbies have continued to rail against the dreaded Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes (LTNs) which are making it a nightmare for drivers to reach customers.

Disgruntled users have meanwhile vowed to no longer use Uber due to its long wait times and 'crazy' prices. One customer previously told MailOnline: 'I use Uber quite a lot but have now decided to use other apps. I realised that it takes ages to get a ride.

'I had to wait around 10 minutes once for a service and have also had rides confirmed thinking I would be on my way out just for it to have it cancelled - and this happened more than once.'

How do the prices compare? MailOnline price checked the leading ride-hailing app to see how their prices compared. The figures are based on a trip from our office in Kensington to Trafalgar Square and were all quoted around 11am on August 12. Uber - £11.81 for a standard vehicle Bolt - £5 (with discount offer of 50 per cent) FreeNow (formerly Hailo) - £14 - £18 for a black cab Advertisement

Drivers previously told MailOnline how the issue began at the start of the Covid pandemic when demand plummeted due to the Covid lockdown in the UK.

Uber driver Nader Awaad said 'thousands' subsequently quit the ride-hailing app because many were unable to make a living nor claim financial support.

Others were forced to take out Covid support loans to tide them over during the pandemic.

Mr Awaad who is the elected chair of United Private Hire Drivers (UPHD) said many of the drivers began working for delivery firms such as sister company UberEats and rivals such as JustEat and Deliveroo.

He previously told MailOnline: 'I had to take out a £20000 loan at the start of the pandemic.

'I didn't stop driving. I was driving seven days a week to keep myself going.

'Not everyone was able to do deliveries my car is a Mercedes so it wouldn't work for me. But that's why we lost a lot of drivers.'

He says the situation has been made worse by an effective cut in pay for thousands of Uber drivers.

Uber increased its service fee for many drivers following a Supreme Court ruling in the UK in February.

The ruling meant that Uber drivers are now classed as 'workers' rather than contractors and thus entitled to benefits such as holiday pay.

Uber later moved its longer serving drivers from a 20 per cent service rate - the cut it takes from each fare - to a rate of to 25 per cent.

Bosses of the ride-hailing app say the move was to 'standardise' the charge. Uber said newer drivers were already paying this higher rate prior to the court judgment.

But Mr Awaad says that some trips for Uber drivers are now no longer worth taking particularly in the midst of rising fuel prices.

He says drivers are also not paid for their journey to the customer meaning many drivers are rejecting trips which are not in a close vicinity.

This along with the increased service charge he says has resulted in some drivers taking to 'multi-apping'.

Multi-apping which is permitted by Uber is when drivers have numerous ride-hailing apps opened at one time.

For example a driver can be searching for an Uber customer and one from rival ride-hailing app Bolt at the same time.

Mr Awaad says this allows drivers to pick and chose the best fare. He said: 'I feel guilty cancelling a trip but drivers are just driving to maximise the price.

'If Uber pays £15 for a trip and Bolt pays £25 what are you going to? That's why customers are waiting for so long at the moment. It's chaos.'

Mr Awaad also said drivers often boost their income by driving in 'surge periods'.

Surge times are essentially public transport peak periods where prices are hiked to reflect demand.

Unlike traditional peak periods though Uber surges can happen late at night such as pub or club kick-out time when there is a spike in demand for Ubers but not as many drivers.

However Mr Awaad said that due to a lack of drivers Uber was now 'surging all the time'.

'It's not fair on the customers' he previously added.

Uber users have noticed the changes with many previously taking to Twitter to moan about the service.

One Twitter user wrote: 'You legit have to allow an extra 20 minutes to your journey when using Uber.

'You have to wait so long for them to connect to a driver and it's almost guaranteed that you'll be cancelled on. Sort it out.'

Another wrote: 'Wait 10 minutes finally connect with a driver... ALWAYS get canceled on at least once before they connect you with another 10 mins away. Such an awful service these days.'

Meanwhile Twitter user Samia previously added: 'Never using Uber again. Every time I try to book a ride home from central London it gets cancelled by at least five drivers.

'I have a 4.5 rating. It ends up taking longer to book an Uber now than to get home for me. I took a black cab home and it was cheaper including my tip!'

Others previously took to Twitter to complain about the 'crazy prices' they are being charged.

One wrote: 'I spent £13 on an Uber for Hockley to The Park Estate the other night... make it make sense.'

Another claimed they were quoted more than £70 for a trip from Croydon to east London.

Union bosses previously pointed the finger at Uber for the drop in service. Charlie McNamara branch coordinator at United Private Hire Drivers (UPHD) told MailOnline: 'Employers often complain about not being to get enough employees while paying low wages. This is one of those cases.

What as the Supreme Court ruling in the Uber case? In February the UK's Supreme Court ruled in favour of drivers being classed as 'workers' after a five year battle. Drivers were previously classed as self-employed 'contractors' by Uber meaning they were not entitled to benefits in the same way paid employees are. But in a landmark ruling for the gig economy Supreme Court judges ruled that drivers should be classed as workers and therefore be given the same rights. It meant Uber faced having to pay workers millions in back-dated compensation while newer drivers would have to be given pay for holidays going forward. The taxi giant had argued its 60000 UK drivers were independent contractors and so not entitled to employment benefits. But judges instead ruled that Uber's 'very tightly defined and controlled' business model and fares process meant drivers were in 'a position of subordination and dependency' - and could not be deemed 'independent contractors' Advertisement

'Drivers need to be able to make a proper living and that's leading to this drop in service.'

Out of Uber's control is another problem for it and many other cab drivers - dreaded Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes.

The schemes have wreaked havoc for drivers particularly in London where borough chiefs have closed off roads to essentially create giant cycle lanes and walkways.

Bollards or large planters are often installed blocking once easy driving routes and sometimes creating long diversions.

Drivers who already say they are struggling to make-ends-meet with some Uber trips say LTN schemes make some trips even hard by forcing them to quite literally 'go-round-the-houses' to reach or drop off passengers.

The United Trade Action Group a union group supported by taxi drivers has been appealing against Transport for London schemes installed as part of its much-maligned Streetspace project.

However last month The Court of Appeal upheld TfL's appeal against a January ruling which declared parts of LTN's unlawful.

Meanwhile another element of concern for Uber who once held the monopoly on ride-hailing apps will be the rise in competitor service Bolt.

The service was launched in 2013 by Estonian entrepreneur Markus Villig who is just 27 years old.

The company previously known as Taxify now operates in more than 45 countries.

It was revealed the firm had €600million (£453million) from venture capital funds to grow the business.

Speaking to the Telegraph Mr Villig who is still only 27 said: 'We have a very different mentality from some of the usual Silicon Valley companies which just raise billions and billions of funding.'

This time the startup's 26 employees met with a local county representative to show off their ambitious project: a fleet of autonomous electric pods that they hoped would soon be transporting commuters throughout the Bay Area.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""Mobility is currently unsustainable whether it's cars or trains or boats or planes"" Mark Seeger Glydways' founder and CEO told Insider during a recent test ride — the first given to a news organization at its secret testing site in Concord California.

He started Glydways in 2016 because he was frustrated with the lack of affordable public transportation options in the US after spending his childhood bouncing around Europe and Asia. ""The costs are high we service very few people the experience is terrible and the economics are just awful"" Seeger said.

Personal rides like an Uber at the cost of a subway ride

Seeger's audacious solution is a network of vehicles 4 feet wide and 7 feet high that can hold four people. Each ride is hailed on demand like an Uber at a Glydways station that is designed to look and feel like a subway platform.

Once inside there's no driver or steering wheel. An iPad-like screen invites passengers to begin the trip. One tap closes the doors and starts the ride. A second tap lets you customize the music: chill energizing or mute.

Instead of jostling for a seat passengers sit comfortably on leather seats. It's surprisingly spacious allowing a person over 6 feet tall to stretch out. Once the ride begins passengers travel down a preprogrammed route going as fast as 75 miles an hour until the destination is reached.

Other rapid transit systems require huge investments in massive new infrastructure such as rail lines or extra roads. The Glydways pods would travel on their own dedicated lanes too but these would be about 5 feet wide — similar to a bicycle lane. The vehicles also have the flexibility to ebb and flow through neighborhoods parking lots parks and university campuses.

""We have four-wheel steering. That means we are totally flexible to work with the city to pick a route that is optimized for the city going around all the things you would normally have to bulldoze your way through"" Seeger said.

Seeger estimated that the Glydways system would cost $50 million per mile which includes four lanes (two in each direction) on an elevated structure the vehicles support equipment and access points where passengers are picked up and dropped off.

That's a relative bargain compared with other public transit systems which often cost at least $100 million per mile. A plan to extend Silicon Valley's BART subway to San Jose California is expected to cost $1 billion per mile.

The company said it could move up to 10000 people per hour in one of its narrow lanes while keeping fares as low as a subway ride in most major cities. It tries to work with private project investors such as the infrastructure investor Plenary to provide financing.

""When we come to the city we're not asking for billions. We're not asking for hundreds of millions. We're either asking for nothing or almost nothing depending on the specifics of the city"" Seeger said. ""And we don't need an annual subsidy to operate it because we operate profitably.""

As the vehicle glided down a 1-mile lane at the secret testing facility the idea of this being my future commute was a bit frightening. It didn't help that Seeger openly discussed the potential risks of a radical new transportation system that would be used by so many people on a daily basis.

What he's most worried about is cybersecurity risks that could arise if hackers gain access to the network. ""The thing that keeps me up at night is that I know I will kill someone"" Seeger said. ""We're going to be moving millions of people per day. Something that we could not foresee is going to happen.""

While the prediction is grim preventing the worst-case scenario is his top priority.

""Every decision we've made is to create a system that is safe by design"" he said. That means not just relying on software to be safe but relying on fundamental safety principles to be safe"" he added.

Seeger 42 was born in Holland and grew up in New Hampshire Singapore and Malaysia. That opened his eyes to the benefits that public transit systems can bring by providing access to employment education and housing.

""I care about equity of opportunity more than anything else"" he said. He added that when he was in Jakarta Indonesia it could take hours to move less than a mile because of a lack of reliable public transit. (Mass rapid transit was not established in Jakarta until 2008.)

Many Silicon Valley VCs didn't buy into his dream. A total of 384 investors said no and some even laughed him out of the room. ""For whatever reason we live in a culture or maybe it's human nature to see something new and immediately discount it and immediately wish it to fail"" he said.

In April 2019 Seeger traveled to Sand Hill Road the epicenter of the startup-funding world to try pitching another venture capitalist this time the billionaire Vinod Khosla and his namesake firm Khosla Ventures. Before he could finish the pitch Khosla stopped him. Seeger anticipated another no but Khosla said ""I've written about this idea already.""

Two months later Seeger received a term sheet from Khosla Ventures his first institutional round raised from a VC. Khosla said that if successful Glydways could solve one of the world's most consequential but hard problems. ""It can make public transit cheaper faster unscheduled and on demand 24/7 and do far better than autonomous cars"" he said.

To date Glydways has raised about $30 million from VCs a relatively small amount in today's frenzied funding environment. Seeger declined to disclose the company's valuation but confirmed that he'd already kicked off conversations for the next round — cash that would come in handy to make it to 2024 when he expects to put Glydways' first vehicles on the road.

The company already has a few contracts under development in California and is in negotiations with city officials throughout the US and in Japan. In recent weeks Fort Lauderdale Florida and San Diego California had expressed interest in working with Glydways Seeger said. He expected the first full-system contract to be signed by December.

""When we sell a system we as a company make a couple hundred million dollars every time"" Seeger said.

The most promising proposal so far was a 4.3-mile project connecting downtown San Jose to SJC the nearest international airport. That was projected to generate $586 million in revenue a business proposal shared with Insider said. ""If we get this right we will shoot up into the billions of dollars valuation very very quickly"" Seeger said.

There's another sizable market opportunity: autonomous delivery. Glydways estimated a cost per ride of $0.25 a mile which means Glydways could compete or partner with Amazon FedEx and UPS to move packages.

The team confirmed that a representative from Amazon's M&A team had visited the Glydways site in recent weeks. For Seeger a delivery partnership would be a win-win that aligned with his passion to lower carbon emissions. ""I want to get the trucks off the road and if they can move a package at a lower cost they are more profitable"" he said. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.

Of all the autonomous-vehicle projects out there Glydways arguably has the most to prove in terms of its ability to scale and the potential risks. It could either change the future of public transportation so that hailing a Glydways would become as ubiquitous as booking an Uber. Or it could be an expensive flop buried in the archives along with a video of the TV news anchor Walter Cronkite taking a test drive in a 1960s StaRRcar prototype another dream of personal rapid transit that never materialized.

Either way the Glydways team is inching forward on plans to roll out the vehicles in the Bay Area as soon as 2024. Khosla believed Glydways could replace half the cars in major cities in less than 20 years.

""The consequences of success more than justify the risk of failure"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdGhlLWVtbXlzLTIwMjEtb3V0bGFuZGVyLXllbGxvd3N0b25lLXdoeS11YmVyLXBvcHVsYXItc2hvd3MtY29uc2lzdGVudGx5LXNudWJiZWQuaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Emmys 2021: From 'Outlander' to 'Yellowstone' — Why Uber Popular Shows Are Consistently Snubbed,"The Emmys are supposed to be television's biggest night.

The usual suspects that the critics love tend to dominate all of the major categories while highly rated fan favorites are often ignored.

The Emmys are supposed to be television’s biggest night. The annual ceremony celebrates the best TV has to offer according to the Television Academy. And scoring a nomination can be career-making for industry professionals who work behind the camera as well as those who are in front of it.

But the Emmys have a habit of being quite divisive. The usual suspects that the critics love tend to dominate all of the major categories while highly rated fan favorites are often ignored.

The Academy finally showed some love in 2020 for Schitt’s Creek. Not only did it get a slew of nominations in its final season but Dan Levy’s comedy also ended up sweeping all of the major comedy categories. This year Ted Lasso broke some records with its very first season.

But there are still a number of shows and stars that the Academy continues to overlook.

The Primetime Emmys refuse to acknowledge ‘Outlander’

For five seasons Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe have steamed up TV screens with their portrayal of Jamie and Claire Fraser in Outlander. The time-traveling fantasy romance based on Diana Gabaldon’s book series Outlander is a global phenomenon with a passionate fanbase. And each episode has a cinematic production quality that is second-to-none.

The Starz series has scored a few nominations at the Creative Arts Emmys — which is the technical awards ceremony — for the production design costume and music. But neither Heughan nor Balfe have received a single nomination for their incredible performances. Tobias Menzies was also snubbed during his run as Black Jack and Frank Randall.

No nominations for ‘Outlander’ in 2021 — but it wasn’t a snub

Outlander fans could point directly to performances from Heughan Balfe and Menzies that should have earned them a nomination. Heughan and Menzies should have been nominated for the penultimate season 1 episode “Wentworth Prison.” Balfe should have scored a nomination for her performance in the season 5 finale “Never My Love.”

The Starz drama received zero nominations for the 2021 Emmys but it wasn’t a snub. In order to be eligible for an Emmy nomination you have to submit work that aired between June 1 2020 and May 31 2021. That June 1 to May 31 time frame is the same every year.

Since Outlander season 5 ended on May 10 2020 the series wasn’t eligible for the Emmy awards in 2021. But they will be next year.

The Emmys always ignore ‘It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’

The insulting and offensive gang at Paddy’s Pub have been making us laugh for 15 years and there’s more to come. In December 2020 FX renewed the series for another four seasons which will make it the longest-running sitcom in TV history.

But during that time It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has only been nominated for an Emmy three times. The only category that the show has received a nomination in is Stunt Coordination. Somehow this hilarious show just hasn’t caught the eye of the Academy.

Bob Odenkirk has earned some recognition for his turn as Jimmy McGill aka Saul Goodman. But the Academy has consistently overlooked his co-star Rhea Seehorn. Her stellar performance as Kim Wexler has been so riveting during the first five seasons she dominates every scene she’s in. But she continues to get shut out.

However there is still hope she will get the recognition she deserves when the sixth and final season of Better Call Saul arrives on AMC.

The Emmys finally acknowledge ‘Yellowstone’

The Paramount Network western Yellowstone starring Kevin Costner ended season 3 in August 2020 as the highest-rated drama on cable TV. But despite the star-studded cast and visually stunning landscapes the television academy has refused to show love to Taylor Sheridan’s series.

There have been zero nominations for Costner’s performance as patriarch John Dutton. No recognition for Kelly Reilly as Beth Dutton or Cole Hauser as Rip Wheeler.

However some of the crew finally got some Emmy recognition this year when Yellowstone scored its first ever nomination in the category of Outstanding Production Design for a Narrative Contemporary Program.

‘The Good Lord Bird’ was the biggest Emmy snub in 2021

The Showtime mini-series The Good Lord Bird — about the incendiary career of 19th-century abolitionist John Brown — is one of the biggest Emmy snubs this year. Ethan Hawke is the star of this series and his performance earned him some of the best reviews of his career.

Many considered Hawke to be a shoo-in for an Emmy nod but he was completely shut out. The same happened to the series itself as it failed to score a single nomination.

The Emmys 2021 skipped the performances in ‘Girls5Eva’

The Tina Fey-produced Girls5Eva — about a 90s girl group trying to make a comeback — has a near-perfect Certified Fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes. But despite all of the love it received from both fans and critics the Emmys completely skipped the stars of the series when handing out nominations.

Creator Meredith Scardino did get a nod for writing. But the Academy snubbed Renee Elise Goldsberry’s iconic performance as a pop diva. They also failed to give any recognition to Sarah Bareilles for her numerous musical compositions.

HBO’s ‘It’s a Sin’ was shut out of the 2021 Emmys

The Television Academy seems to be in love with HBO. In the past they’ve handed out scores of nominations for shows like Succession and Game of Thrones. But has the Academy ever watched the HBO Max drama It’s a Sin?

Apparently not. Because this series about a group of friends enduring the AIDS crisis in 1980s London is “an incredible feat of small screen magic” according to the critics. Yet it failed to garner a single nomination.

Why Trust Us?

Regina Hall says argan oil is the secret to her smooth hydrated skin.

“Ever since I started using it I feel like it keeps your skin really supple and moisturized” the Nine Perfect Strangers star told Town & Country.

We've rounded up options for every price point so you can have flawless skin like Hall's.

Regina Hall might play a character on the wrong side of wellness in Hulu’s Nine Perfect Strangers but in real life she knows her stuff. Case in point: Hall’s impossibly smooth skin which she keeps hydrated with a surprisingly affordable beauty staple.

In an interview with Town & Country about her self-care must-haves the Girls Trip actress 50 revealed her most beloved tactic for keeping dry skin at bay: argan oil a nourishing product that’s growing in popularity. “Argan oil just feels good on your skin” Hall said.

“I tried it and ever since I started using it” Hall continued “I feel like it keeps your skin really supple and moisturized.”

Argan oil which is pressed from the seeds of the argan tree has long been a favorite of beauty gurus. Like the Black Monday star says it’s great for adding moisture to the skin but the oil has plenty of other benefits like reducing wrinkles fading dark spots adding shine to hair and even encouraging hair growth.

“I always wash my face before bed. I’ve always moisturized too” Hall told Health last month. “Now I use argan oil on my face. Your skin changes—it’s different in your twenties than it is in your thirties than it is in your forties and so on. So you have to constantly be looking at your complexion and assessing what it needs.”

Although Hall doesn’t specify which argan oil brand she favors there are plenty of options available for as little as $10. Shop our favorites—including ones previously mentioned in Prevention roundups—below!

If you're looking for more beauty inspiration from the actress Hall shared more of her skin care secrets in the same Town & Country interview. Her other wellness go-tos include  which she says will “make you want chocolate""  especially Diptyque—“When somebody sends a Diptyque that means you’re special” she said. Another favorite of Hall's which is also Nicole Kidman-approved is a “If you tell me anything’s ‘age defying anything’ I’ll buy it"" Hall said.

Clearly the actress and producer takes self-care seriously as we all should. “All things are interdependent—our joy is connected to our health and wellbeing” Hall told Parade in August. “But it’s also connected to the people around us ... we’re not islands and the more connectivity we can generate the better.”

“I love when I eat right and when I feel spiritually centered and connected” Hall said in the Health interview. “You have to think about what helps challenge you and move you—and do those things!”

If you wanted to send a package from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv you would go to downtown Jerusalem and send it through one of the companies and your recipient would go to their office in Tel Aviv to pick it up. Twenty-Five years ago I ran a consumer-facing business where we tried to service customers outside Jerusalem. Back then I thought if only UPS operated in Israel it would transform business in the country. For many years I had a web-based consumer physical goods business in the US. Every day at 4 PM my local UPS man would show up and I would know that every package that was within 200 miles would arrive the next day guaranteed and the further from New York the time would increase all for little money. I could also ship via priority mail for $4; and my package would arrive within three days anywhere in the US. All of this without talking about other options that for more money could get my package delivered anywhere in the US by as early as 9 AM.

Well I received my wish… sort of. Today the brown-colored UPS trucks can be seen in Tel Aviv and their delivery personal are dressed just like their counterparts in the US. FedEx and DHL are also present as is the Israeli post office. But other than their superficial colors the Israeli versions of all these companies are hardly even a pale comparison to their foreign versions.

Receiving packages or even letters in Israel is a little like playing the roulette wheel in Las Vegas. Sometimes you win and sometimes…..

Let’s start with the loses: the postal services’ ability to deliver the mail. Recently I sent an envelope from my nearby post office (they have removed all the mailboxes so you cannot mail a letter without going to the post office) to my accountant two miles away in Tel Aviv. It was not urgent and the post office seems to have known that since it took over two weeks to make the journey. However when it comes to receiving packages from the post office the service is strangely erratic. It seems to work well for larger parcels with a delivery person coming to the house very soon after the package has arrived in the country. Smaller packages which in the past you would pick up at the post office have been outsourced to stores for pickup. In the case of the post office you do not get to choose where you want to pick up the package. In my case this past few months the box had gone to a store about a mile from my apartment-(there are three post offices closer). This particular store is a home goods store. When you arrive they direct you to go to the back of a cavernous store; there you find an old staircase which you have to descend to a poorly lit basement there you traverse until you come to a door where you are efficiently given your package.

UPS FedEx and DHL all use similar services for small packages. And all have provided rich stories in the last few months. About six months ago we received notice that package had been delivered to an ice cream store about a 15-minute walk from our house. My wife went to pick it up and when the proprietor said it was not there she asked if she could look. He then said she was not being nice to him and would not look for the package. The next day I went back and the same person refused to talk to me saying my wife was not nice and a few other choice words I will not repeat. He refused to give me the package; I of course complained to UPS. Their only solution two days later was to send a taxi to get the package and bring it for us. FedEx has generally been efficient even if they charge way too much to clear a package but we had one very typical Israel story last year.

The only thing our family still brings from the US after being back in Israel for the last ten years is Kellogs Corn Flake Crumbs a key ingredient in my wife’s Schnitzel recipe. In the pre-COVID era that was never a problem as there were always people coming and going from the US and Israel. Due to the pandemic we ran out and as it was not an item that Amazon ships to Israel my son to whom the Schnitzel is special took it on himself to order 12 boxes from Walmart and have them shipped FedEx to Israel. Unfortunately we did not know that under the rules of the Ministry of Health one cannot import more than 5 kilos of a particular food item. Even though several people told us that this rule is never enforced FedEx refused to clear the package. Its only solution was to break up the parcel into two. We said fine but they said they could not do it; we would have to come to the airport pay to receive the forms from the Tel Aviv Commerce Office and then physically break up the shipment and pick it up. In short after spending 4 hours at Ben Gurion airport we left with 8 of the 12 packages.

Two weeks ago we ordered a Kindle from Amazon and paid for expedited delivery. DHL handles those deliveries. We tracked the package and on Saturday night it was cleared from customs. I had been asked where I wanted the package delivered and their website pushed me to select a location. The nearest was about a kilometer from our apartment so I picked it and the site confirmed it would be delivered there. The DHL tracking site listed that it would be delivered on Sunday; the day passed and not a word from DHL on the delivery of the Kindle. The next day in the morning I called them. The agent told me I had made a mistake specifying delivery to one of their storefront locations since that takes longer. I asked her why their website pushes you to pick an alternative delivery? The only answer I received was that I should have chosen “other delivery options”on their site. In the meantime DHL had handed the delivery off to a subcontractor that did not work on the day before a holiday. The agent said hopefully the package scheduled to be delivered on Sunday would be delivered to the store on Thursday it was.

Now for the wins in Israeli delivery. When you order from Amazon and choose the slower speed it almost always arrives much quicker than promised. They generally use a a global delivery service which gives you many options for delivery; two are within a block of my apartment. The other service that works is FedEx and UPS delivery of overnight letters. Every time a bank in the US has sent me a credit card it has arrived in 3-4 days from the US.

On a final good note everyone in Tel Aviv knows the Wolt delivery service. The service allows you to order from hundreds of restaurants (and other food services) in Tel Aviv and usually receive delivery within 30 minutes. If only the established delivery services knew how to provide that level of service. Of course even Wolt has its disadvantage mainly delivery people that are in such a rush to make the delivery that they ignore traffic rules.

Israel’s economic success is clearly tied to the ability of Israel’s companies to innovate. When it comes to delivery we could use a little less innovation and a return to basics. When a package is shipped to an address it should be delivered to that address and only that address.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlb3dwLm9yZy9uYWJpc2NvLXN0cmlrZXMtYS1jYXNlLXN0dWR5LWluLWNvbGxlY3RpdmUtYmFyZ2FpbmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nabisco Strikes: A Case Study In Collective Bargaining,"Workers at Nabisco bakeries and manufacturing plants across the country have entered their second month of striking for normal working hours and the removal of a proposed health care plan that would harm newer hires. Although a contract between union board members and Nabisco representatives is supposedly in the works the Nabisco strikes showcase the myriad roadblocks involved in the process of unionizing in America.

The strikes which began on August 10th in Portland Oregon began as a response to a Nabisco plan that would increase work shifts from 12 to 16 hours a week without overtime increase mandatory work on weekends and introduce a two-tier healthcare system that would cost significantly more for new hires potentially creating a rift between the two types of employees. According to Vice the company had consistently “pushed extra hours onto workers instead of hiring new workers” and given that the pandemic work schedule already entailed a grueling six- or seven-day work week with 12-hour shifts and no paid overtime the proposed plan would stretch workers even thinner.

Rusty Lewis a striking warehouse worker at the Nabisco distribution center in Aurora Colorado told Vice that conditions have only deteriorated since he was hired in the 90’s. “It’s gotten worse. It’s gotten horrible. Horrible hours” Lewis said. “They don’t care about frontline workers. They only care about the almighty dollar. We’re tired of getting stepped on and treated like trash. We’ve had enough.”

The strikes have been supported by local communities with facilities across the country attracting “hundreds of local workers community members and politicians who have brought sandwiches donuts and water” to support the strikers at the picket lines says Vice. The workers’ strike fund has far exceeded its goal drawing from thousands of donors around the globe. However the striking workers have also garnered sustained backlash from Nabisco and its parent company Mondelez who have threatened workers with legal action and the offshoring of future jobs have bussed in unqualified workers to work high-skilled jobs in an attempt to break the strike and have even called in police forces and private strike staffing teams to “evict strikers from a rail line leading into the plant.” This has resulted in the assault of several workers and community members according to the International Committee of the Fourth International.

Calling in backup is not uncommon for big companies with a vested interest in stymieing local unions’ success. These companies typically bust unions before they can form with manipulation blackmail coercion and surveillance under the guise of worker education being their usual modus operandi. While these actions are prohibited under statutes of the National Labor Relations Act according to a 2019 Economic Policy Institute report “Employers are charged with violating federal law in 41.5% of all union election campaigns … [and] employers are charged with making threats engaging in surveillance activities or harassing workers in nearly a third of all union election campaigns.” Additionally private strike staffing companies like the Huffmaster Crisis Response company that Nabisco has hired to monitor their facilities are part of a growing industry of strike breakers and consulting agencies created to effectively prevent collective bargaining.

In spite of companies’ and their constituents’ concerted efforts to bust unions and break strikes correctly-managed unions are an immensely powerful tool for negotiating workers’ rights. By serving as an intermediary between workers and company interests unions can successfully negotiate beneficial deals with large companies like the deal currently being discussed with Nabisco as of today. According to Rahna Epting executive director of policy advocacy group MoveOn “We need unions because they spark an understanding within the larger zeitgeist of America that when we come together we are powerful and can pool influence to decide who gets elected and influence their decisions.”

Unionizing and collective organizing have the power to bring about palpable change for workers’ rights if unionizing and striking are made easier and labor laws are reformed to allow workers to better advocate for themselves. As of today a new union-friendly act the Protecting the Right to Organize (P.R.O.) Act is being passed through Senate. This act would “make it easier for workers to form unions conduct strikes and bargain for better wages and working conditions” C.N.N. reports. But while the P.R.O. Act is necessary to protect workers’ rights it is not sufficient. According to the Center for American Progress labor reforms like raising the minimum wage and implementing automatic voter registration as well as reforming “tax policies that harm workers and indirectly weaken unions such as those that encourage outsourcing and offshoring” are sorely needed in order to set a proper expectation for workers’ rights and create a democratic labor system.

Collective bargaining is how we won the 40-hour work week sick leaves workplace regulations and even minimum wage. Things don’t have to stop there. If we empower unions and the workers they represent we can make even more gains for workers’ rights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yMzk4MDQ2L2UtY29tbWVyY2UtaW4tcGFyY2VsLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW1hcmtldC1uZXh0LWJpZy10aGluZy1zdG_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,E-Commerce in Parcel Delivery Market Next Big Thing | STO Express DHL LSO,"E-Commerce in Parcel Delivery Market Next Big Thing | STO Express DHL LSO

They are the companies and institutions that often have tens of thousands of people on their payroll indirectly supporting other businesses with the cash they pay out to their many workers.

Using records and figures from various sources we’ve put together a list of the single biggest employer in each state. To keep things more interesting and diverse we’ve kept the nebulous organizations of simply “state government” and “federal government” off the list because those are actually the biggest employers in nearly every state.

If you think about it you’ll probably know someone who works for the biggest employer in your own state.

Alabama — Redstone Arsenal

You’ll notice a few U.S. military installations on this list as bases around the nation often employ tens of thousands of people at a time. One of them is Alabama’s Redstone Arsenal built in 1941 which is managed by the Army and employs a whopping 60000 people according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The base is located near Huntsville in Madison County. The next biggest employer is the University of Alabama at Birmingham also a public entity but the state’s biggest private-sector employer is the Alabama Power Company with about 5000 workers.

Alaska — Fort Wainwright

The U.S. Army comes out on top again as the biggest employer in our northernmost state. Fort Wainwright located in Fairbanks was built in 1941 and employs a reported 6100 people. When you think of Alaska you probably think of seafood — after ice and the Iditarod maybe — and that connects to the state’s second-biggest employer UniSea Inc. With 5000 employees this massive fishing operation is listed as the top private-sector company in North America’s “last frontier.”

Arizona — Banner Health

According to an exhaustive database compiled by The Arizona Republic in 2019 the hospital network run by Banner Health is easily the biggest employer in the state. Nearly 45000 people were working for the company at that time which helped it top nationwide powerhouses like Walmart Kroger and McDonald’s all of which also hire many Arizonans. The publication reported that the state’s top 100 employers account for about one in five payroll jobs in Arizona.

Arkansas — Walmart

The state of Arkansas is home to several massive companies that were first founded there as modest operations. From Tyson Foods to J.B. Hunt to Dillard’s many Americans work for companies that came out of Arkansas. But the biggest of all those homegrown success stories is Walmart. The company has nearly 48000 workers on its payroll in Arkansas making it the top private workforce there.

California — University of California

Dec 8 2019 Los Angeles / CA / USA – Walmart truck driving on the interstate after the rain; wet asphalt visible

Tech giants like Alphabet (aka Google) Apple and Facebook are big employers across California but they are far from the state’s biggest workplaces. The various branches of the University of California separately occupy 10 spots on the list of the 25 biggest employers in the state according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. When you add up all the employees of the academic giant you get more than 185000 workers across the Golden State easily surpassing Los Angeles Airport’s 45000 workers as the state’s biggest single-company total.

Colorado — Denver International Airport

Major transportation hubs are some of the biggest single-location employers in the nation and Colorado’s Denver International Airport is no different. Roughly 35000 people work at DIA according to the airport which puts it ahead of other major Colorado job creators like Lockheed Martin and HealthOne by a wide margin. The 53 square miles covered by DIA’s property makes the airport larger than the cities of San Francisco Boston and Miami.

Connecticut — Yale New Haven Health System

Hospital systems are among the biggest employers in the United States and more Connecticut residents are employed by Yale New Haven Health System than any other business. More than 22000 people work for the hospital network which paces it ahead of other major companies based there like Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. Praxair and ESPN. What’s more a 2016 Forbes report named Yale New Haven Health as the large employer (at least 5000 workers) where employees were happiest in Connecticut as well.

Delaware — ChristianaCare

The chemical giant DuPont was the largest employer in Delaware for a long time but lost that title in the past few years after downsizing. MBNA was another titan in the state that cut its numbers severely after it was bought out by Bank of America. Meanwhile ChristianaCare a hospital system picked up the slack and maintains a state-leading 12000 workers across Delaware.

Florida — Walmart

It probably won’t surprise you to read that Walt Disney World is reportedly the biggest single-site employer in the United States with more than 77000 people clocking in at the Central Florida resort every day. But it probably would surprise you to know The House of Mouse isn’t the state’s biggest employer overall. That honor belongs to Walmart which employs more than 114000 people across the Sunshine State at an average hourly wage of $15.23 which is well below the state’s overall median hourly wage of $18.07.

Georgia — Emory University

Almost 30000 people in Georgia currently work for Delta Airlines making it the biggest private-sector employer in the entire state. Meanwhile Emory University is the biggest employer overall that isn’t the state government with more than 37000 employees on its payroll across Georgia. Emory’s impact on the economy of the Atlanta region alone is remarkable between the jobs it creates and the thousands of students it houses each year.

Hawaii — The Queen’s Health Systems

As you’d likely expect the single biggest industry across Hawaii is tourism but one hospital network is its biggest job creator. The Queen’s Health Systems has more than 7300 people on its payroll which might sound like a tiny number compared to others on this list but is sizable for a state of fewer than 1.5 million citizens. All those surfing injuries aren’t going to take care of themselves are they?

Healthcare reigns supreme in yet another state. While agriculture and manufacturing have major hiring figures across Idaho St. Luke’s Health System is the state’s single biggest employer. More than 14000 people in the Gem State work for the hospital network according to the Idaho Department of Labor pacing it ahead of Walmart Micron Technology and competitor Saint Alphonsus Health System.

Illinois — Walmart

According to the Illinois Department of Employment Security the industry of healthcare and social assistance employs the most people in the state with more than 800000 people working in that sector as of 2021. Sears was the biggest single employer in Illinois for a long time but long ago lost that mantle making way for Walmart to hold the spot today. According to the retail giant more than 56000 Walmart associates are employed across Illinois making it the single biggest employer that we could find in our research.

Walmart

Indiana — Walmart

Yet another Midwestern state that is dominated by Walmart in terms of its employment figures is Indiana. More than 44000 Hoosiers call Walmart their workplace with 127 stores under the company’s umbrella being operated there as of July 2021. Other major employers include Eli Lilly and Tyson Foods but Walmart reportedly employs more people than any of them.

Iowa — Hy-Vee

It’s somewhat refreshing that Iowa’s biggest employer is a regional supermarket chain that was born in the Hawkeye State. While the University of Iowa claims itself to be the state’s biggest employer with 14000 workers our own math and research find that Hy-Vee should actually hold that title because of the sheer footprint it has across Iowa. Between its corporate headquarters two distribution centers tech office and the more than 150 stores we counted across the state we estimate that roughly 50000 Iowans work for Hy-Vee in some capacity — and that’s a conservative number.

Kansas — Fort Riley

The agriculture industry accounts for a major chunk of the Kansas economy and has the biggest workforce in the state but the U.S. Army’s base at Fort Riley employs more people than any other entity. More than 20000 people work at Fort Riley including service members and civilians. Spirit Aerosystems which is based in Wichita is the biggest private-sector employer in Kansas with 12000 workers expected to be on its payroll by 2024.

Kentucky — UPS

The commonwealth of Kentucky has a very tight race for the title of its biggest employer. While Walmart technically has about 1000 more overall employees in Kentucky than UPS its number includes workers at Sam’s Club stores which is why we’re giving the nod to the shipping giant. UPS and its 29000 workers across the Bluegrass State make up an immense workforce that includes 12000 in Louisville alone.

Louisiana — Walmart

While state government accounts for a reported 57000 jobs in Louisiana we aren’t including them so the honor of the biggest workforce there falls to Walmart. The big-box retailer counts nearly 36000 workers across Louisiana between its flagship and Sam’s Club locations. Other top jobs creators in the state include Willis-Knighton Medical Center and Mistras Group.

Maine — MaineHealth

Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and Walmart combine to employ about 16000 people across Maine but that’s still fewer than the number employed by MaineHealth. The hospital network has at least 18000 employees according to the Maine Department of Labor giving it the biggest workforce in the state. It shouldn’t surprise you when you realize that more than 700 hospitals doctor’s offices labs and assisted-living communities fall under the MaineHealth banner.

Maryland — Fort George G. Meade

While the renowned network of hospitals and institutions under the Johns Hopkins banner employs an impressive 30000 people across Maryland the military is the state’s biggest employer: specifically Fort George G. Meade which is one of the Army’s biggest bases period. Located between Baltimore and Washington Fort Meade has more than 56000 employees on base including civilians and service members.

World-renowned institutions like Harvard University and the University of Massachusetts rank among the biggest employers in the commonwealth but they can’t match its healthcare behemoth. Mass General Brigham recently took a new name in 2019 after previously being known as Partners Healthcare. More than 58000 people in Massachusetts work at Mass General Brigham which is a medical network like some other top employers on this list.

Michigan — General Motors

Automotive production still rules in Michigan — for now at least. If you combine the employees from the University of Michigan and its related Michigan Medicine healthcare banner (roughly 58000 people total) that institution would technically be the biggest employer in Michigan but that seems like cheating. Instead we’re spotlighting General Motors as having the state’s single largest workforce since nearly 47000 people work for the automaker there.

Minnesota — Mayo Clinic

The mighty Minnesota-based Target Corporation employs a reported 31000 people across the state but it’s not the biggest employer there. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester with its 28 Mayo Clinic Health System locations spread across the state is the biggest employer in Minnesota. More than 47000 people reportedly get their paycheck from Mayo Clinic making it quite a formidable workplace.

Mississippi — Ingalls Shipbuilding

An innovative powerhouse Ingalls Shipbuilding is one of the longest-standing large private employers on this list. The company had 11500 workers in Mississippi as of 2021 making it the biggest employer in the state. Ingalls has apparently held that title since 1939 which is remarkable and it looks like the grip won’t be loosening anytime soon. The company recently announced it was looking to add 3000 more employees to its payroll.

Missouri — Walmart

Companies like Boeing and Enterprise Holdings each employ tens of thousands of people across Missouri but neither can touch Walmart’s foothold there. The retail giant counts nearly 44000 residents of Missouri among its workforce making it the single biggest employer in the state. Some reports cite the medical giant BJC Healthcare as Missouri’s biggest employer but with a reported 30000 workers there that’s simply not the case.

Montana — Billings Clinic

Population-wise Montana is one of the smallest states in the nation and that’s why the 10000-plus people reportedly employed by the Billings Clinic is a massive figure there. In addition to being the state’s biggest employer it’s also Montana’s top healthcare supplier. The system also operates in Wyoming but has its biggest presence in Big Sky Country.

Nebraska — University of Nebraska

Omaha’s Offutt Air Force Base is a massive workplace that has 8000 employees but that’s only half of the staff employed by the University of Nebraska. That institution which is comprised of four universities across the state counts 16000 workers among its staff. What’s more the University of Nebraska has been ranked by Forbes as one of the best places to work in the entire state based on a survey of its workers.

Nevada — MGM Resorts

When you think of Nevada your mind has to imagine the bright lights of the Las Vegas Strip so this fact probably doesn’t stun you. MGM Resorts operates 10 properties in Las Vegas including nine casinos making it a monster in the gaming industry. The company reportedly counts 42000 workers among its staff in Nevada giving it the state’s biggest workforce. For comparison’s sake the Nevada state government “only” employs 25000 people.

New Hampshire — Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health

In a state of just over 1.3 million citizens a reported workforce of 8000 people is a sizable one. While Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health also has a major presence across Vermont its biggest footprint is in New Hampshire. The system operates a number of hospitals across the state as well as 24 smaller clinics. Its website boasts that it is the No. 1-rated hospital in New Hampshire as well as the biggest private employer there.

New Jersey — Amazon

For a long time the grocery giant ShopRite was the biggest employer in the Garden State but it recently lost that mantle to Amazon. The retail giant took that title after bringing its presence to more than 40000 employees across New Jersey in 2020. An Amazon spokesperson told ROI-NJ.com that the company has invested $14.5 billion into New Jersey’s economy since 2010.

New Mexico — Presbyterian Healthcare Services

In case you hadn’t noticed medicine is serious business in the U.S. Further proof of this is New Mexico’s Presbyterian Healthcare Services which employs more people than any other private entity across the state. The company counts more than 11000 people among its staff in New Mexico. Nine hospitals across the state are included in Presbyterian’s footprint.

New York — Northwell Health

While New York is home to arguably the most bustling arts and culture scene in the world the state’s single biggest employer is just as typical as it is in many states: a hospital system. Northwell Health says it has more than 76000 employees working across its network of more than 800 care facilities in New York. While the healthcare giant has the title for now it’s been estimated that Amazon could become the state’s biggest employer by 2034 as it seeks to add tens of thousands of new jobs there by then.

North Carolina — University of North Carolina System

When outsiders think of North Carolina basketball at the University of North Carolina probably comes to mind first. That institution and the wide-ranging University of North Carolina System that it’s a part of have a whopping 48000 employees across the state making it the biggest staffer behind state government. A total of 17 institutions are included in the system.

North Dakota — Sanford Health

It’s unique for a company not named Walmart to occupy multiple spots on this list and that’s what Sanford Health can claim. The hospital network stretches across four states but has its biggest presence across North Dakota and South Dakota where it is the biggest employer in each. In North Dakota it’s been reported that Sanford Health employs more than 12000 people.

Kroger The Ohio State University and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base each have an immense workforce in the Buckeye State but the state’s top-rated healthcare giant surpasses them all. The Cleveland Clinic Foundation has nearly 51000 workers on the payroll up sharply from the 37800 employees it reported having in 2009. The system’s flagship location in the heart of Cleveland celebrated its 100th year in business in 2021.

Oklahoma — Walmart

The United States government is actually the single-biggest employer across Oklahoma but Walmart gets the credit when nebulous government entities aren’t included. The retailer cuts checks for more than 33000 people across the state which isn’t far from the 37000 employed by the federal government there. Walmart operates 134 stores in the state 81 of which are supercenters.

Oregon — Intel

Technology rules the workforce in Oregon as Intel has had the title of the state’s largest employer for at least six years. The company says it has about 17000 employees in Oregon ranking it ahead of other major jobs creators like Providence Health System Fred Meyers Stores and Nike. The tech giant operates six campuses in the state and has been operating there since 1974.

Pennsylvania — University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

Hillsboro Oregon USA – October 18 2018: An Intel logo at a corner of JF3 building of Jones Farm campus

Healthcare comes out on top yet again this time in the Keystone State. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (aka UPMC) has an immense presence across Pennsylvania operating 40 hospitals and more than 800 clinics. The company employs a reported 92000 people across the state including a whopping 5000 doctors.

Rhode Island — Lifespan

With just over 1 million citizens between its relatively tight borders the fact that Rhode Island’s biggest employer has 16000 workers there is pretty substantial. Lifespan has been operating in Rhode Island since 1994 and runs six hospitals 40 labs and more than 100 clinics around the state. The military is another major hirer in the coastal state with Naval Station Newport counting roughly 10000 workers among its staff.

South Carolina — Walmart

Rhode Island Hospital Zecchino Pavilion

South Carolina has some serious employers in BMW Boeing and Joint Base Charleston but Walmart tops them all. The company employs more than 34000 people across the state which is about as much as those other three giants combined. There are 122 Walmart stores in South Carolina including 83 supercenters according to the company.

Walmart

South Dakota — Sanford Health

As mentioned previously the Sanford Health system is the biggest employer in both North Dakota and South Dakota. The network’s biggest presence is in South Dakota with its headquarters located in Sioux Falls. It’s unclear exactly how many employees Sanford has in South Dakota alone but the company has an estimated 30000 workers total and it has been widely reported to be the state’s biggest employer.

Tennessee — Walmart

Sanford Health Main Campus Sioux Falls South Dakota USA: 3-2021: Children’s Hospital Castle of Care

Yes Walmart rules the workforce in yet another state. Nissan Shoney’s and Vanderbilt University and its associated hospital are counted among the biggest employers in the state but none can match the big-box store’s staff in Tennessee. According to Walmart it employs nearly 43000 people in the state and operates 150 stores within its borders.

Texas — H-E-B

Texas is yet another state where a retailer has the biggest payroll of all. The San Antonio-based supermarket chain H-E-B counts more than 90000 Texans among its workforce reportedly making it the biggest private employer in the Lone Star State. The chain has more than 300 stores in the state giving it an immense presence there.

Utah — Intermountain Healthcare

The state of Utah has a few large employers ranked in a virtual tie at the top but Intermountain Healthcare just wins the race. The hospital system has more than 20000 employees which ranks it just ahead of the Utah state government and the University of Utah. Interestingly Intermountain was in talks to merge with another major employer on this list Sanford Health until the deal was called off early in 2021.

Vermont — The University of Vermont Health Network

Salt Lake City UT / USA – November 6 2020: Intermountain Primary Children’s Hospital

Frankly we were kind of disappointed to find out that Ben & Jerry’s isn’t the biggest employer in Vermont but what can you do? The fact is that The University of Vermont Health Network employs 8800 people edging out semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries as the state’s biggest staffer. The network is anchored by the flagship UVM Medical Center in Burlington which staffs 1700 nurses and 600 doctors.

Virginia — Walmart

Virginia sees about 46000 of its citizens employed by the combined powers of Huntington Ingalls Industries and Sentara Healthcare but that figure barely surpasses the number employed by Walmart. The retailer has an impressive 45727 workers across Virginia where it operates 149 stores. That figure easily makes the company the biggest staffer in the entire commonwealth.

Photo: Walmart

Washington — Amazon

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a shift at the top of Washington state’s employment rankings. Boeing was the biggest employer in the state until the pandemic hindered the company’s business while doing the opposite for Amazon’s. As a result the online retailer which was born in Washington became the state’s top dog. Amazon counts more than 80000 employees among its workforce in Washington.

West Virginia — WVU Medicine

For nearly two decades Walmart ruled West Virginia as the biggest employer but it was unseated in 2016 by a healthcare titan. WVU Medicine has more than 15000 employees within its network in the state. Other top employers across the state include Kroger Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Lowe’s.

Wisconsin — Advocate Aurora Health

Morgantown WV – 21 January 2021: WVU Medicine covid-19 vaccination center in old mall in Morgantown West Virginia

Another health system this one based in Milwaukee tops another state’s list of the biggest employers. Wisconsin’s Advocate Aurora Health operates 15 hospitals and more than 150 clinics across the state and into northern Illinois. All that care requires 75000 employees to make up its substantial payroll. It’s unclear how many of them work solely in Wisconsin but the company has widely been reported as the state’s biggest private employer.

Wyoming — Walmart

With just 14 stores across the state Walmart’s presence in Wyoming is nowhere near what it is in other parts of the U.S. Still the retailer is counted as the biggest private employer there despite the fact that it has fewer than 5000 workers. Wyoming’s F.E. Warren Air Force Base employs more than 4000 people at a single site but it’s still not quite enough to catch up with Walmart’s payroll in the state."

Askew made the Firestone Fast Six in just his fourth INDYCAR qualifying session this season. He earned the fifth starting spot for Sunday’s Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey (3 p.m. ET live on NBC and INDYCAR Radio Network) with a best lap time of 1 minute 11.8937 seconds.

The result tied Askew’s career-best start -- fifth last season at the GMR Grand Prix on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course.

“I’m very happy with that run obviously” he said. “Very happy for our guys on the Hy-Vee No. 45 Honda and everyone at Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing. This is exactly what we needed. A good starting spot for tomorrow. Here it’s important. As we know it’s difficult to pass.

“I’m looking forward to tomorrow. Hopefully we’ll have a strong run.”

Askew has raced with three different teams this season. He finished 25th with engine issues in the No. 7 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet at Detroit’s second race while standing in for Felix Rosenqvist. Then Askew finished 12th in the No. 21 Ed Carpenter Racing Chevrolet at Road America as a stand-in for Rinus VeeKay.

Last weekend at Portland International Raceway Askew made his first of three starts in the No. 45 Hy-Vee Honda for RLL but he finished 24th after being involved in a first-turn incident. He will finish out the INDYCAR season with the team next weekend in the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach.

Amid all the back-and-forth exchange of seats Askew’s 12th-place run at Road America was his best finish this season as well as his best INDYCAR finish since he finished sixth at Iowa Speedway in 2020 driving for Arrow McLaren SP.

Askew’s best start this season had been ninth which came last weekend at Portland International Raceway. In fact Saturday’s performance at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca was his best qualifying effort since he landed that top-five starting spot on the IMS road course in July 2020.

What’s more Askew 24 bested his RLL teammates that are competing full-time this season on Saturday. Graham Rahal qualified 12th in the No. 15 United Rentals Honda at 1:12.5932 and Takuma Sato will start 23rd in the No. 30 Panasonic/Mi-Jack Honda with a best lap time of 1:12.1443.

However Askew isn’t letting his stellar performance get to his head. Right now he’s just doing his job and not focusing on INDYCAR’s silly season and the stress of performing well during this three-week test run that could land him in the No. 45 car or another ride full-time in 2022.

Instead Askew took note that he is wedged on the grid in between the top two drivers. Series points leader Alex Palou will start fourth with second-place Pato O’Ward sixth. Palou leads O’Ward by 25 points heading to these final two races.

“I don’t want to be in the middle of them but unfortunately I am starting directly in the middle of them” Askew said. “I’m just going to race everyone cleanly and just focus on getting through Turn 1 unlike what happened at Portland last weekend.”

Come Sunday Askew has a chance to shape what the 2022 season might look like for him. He has already outperformed his teammates this weekend by also posting the sixth-fastest time in Friday’s practice and backing it up with the 15th-fastest lap time in Saturday’s practice.

Only Rahal has contended with Askew this weekend by putting up the 14th-fastest time in the second practice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHljYXIuY29tL05ld3MvMjAyMS8wOS8wOS0xOC1MYWd1bmEtQnV6etIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paddock Buzz: Dixon Could Get Creative with Sunday Strategy,"Scott Dixon finished NTT P1 Award qualifying Saturday and promptly pulled on a statement-making hat.

As the hat read Dixon and his No. 9 PNC Bank Grow Up Great Honda crew from Chip Ganassi Racing are series champions until proven otherwise.

Of course Dixon has a difficult road ahead of him to achieve a record-tying seventh NTT INDYCAR SERIES championship but there are enough points available over the next two races to suggest the veteran trailing series leader and teammate Alex Palou by 49 points is not out of contention yet.

Obviously it will take work – and some good fortune – but Dixon might have tipped his team’s race plans for Sunday’s Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey during his post-qualifying television interview.

“From (the eighth starting position) we’ll probably … go off strategy a little bit” he said. “We’ll have to see how that plays (out).

“It’s so easy to flip these races by just one caution and with so many cars going off (track) this weekend there’s definitely a chance of that. If you can catch it right it’s going to bolt you straight to the lead.”

That’s sort of what happened last weekend at Portland International Raceway. Dixon and Palou (No. 10 NTT Data Honda) had to take evasive action in the opening corner and as a result were sent deep in the field on the restart for shortcutting the corner. They made the most of the situation by pitting just before the race went back green and the flow of the race later put them back at the front. Palou won with Dixon third.

To Dixon’s point about flipping “these races” Palou was able to gain 35 points on Pato O’Ward the driver of the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet who entered the Portland weekend with a 10-point lead. Now Palou leads by 25.

After Sunday’s race at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca the series heads down the California coast for next weekend’s season-ending Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach a race Dixon has scored four podium finishes including a win in 2015.

History suggests Dixon will have difficulty winning Sunday at Laguna Seca as 21 of the 23 INDYCAR race winners at this venue have come from the first three starting positions. That’s 91.3 percent.

“It is what it is” Dixon said of the odds stacked against him. “As we saw in St. Louis (at World Wide Technology Raceway) and also at Portland it can flip pretty quickly. We’ll keep our heads down and keep pushing.”

The good news for Dixon: Almost every driver has mentioned the likelihood of high tire degradation during the race. That increases the possibility of the field getting shuffled and Dixon has shown a propensity over the years for being on the right side of the strategy.

Ericsson Still Has Goal To Achieve

Marcus Ericsson (No. 8 Huski Chocolate Honda of Chip Ganassi Racing) faces even longer odds than Dixon as he enters Sunday’s race 75 points behind Palou in fifth place. But he said his focus is on winning at least one more time this season which would give him three wins.

“I think seventh is pretty good qualifying” he said. “Obviously when you’re one spot from the (Firestone Fast Six) you want to be in it no doubt about that. But I think we have had a good car all weekend and we can definitely play from there in the race.”

Only Palou has won more races this season than Ericsson.

“To win the championship for us now is a bit too far away but we said we want to win one more race before the end of the season and we can win from seventh so that’s what we’re going for” he said.

Odds and Ends

NTT P1 Award winner Colton Herta (No. 26 Gainbridge Honda of Andretti Autosport w/ Curb-Agajanian) had the quote of the day: “I know Mario Andretti was sitting on the pit stand” he said. “I’m sure he’s really happy about me taking a pole away from Will Power.” Andretti’s advantage over Power in career poles is just five (67-62).

O’Ward is driving with his big boss on site. Zak Brown the CEO of McLaren Racing became even more prominent with the INDYCAR team when McLaren acquired 75 percent of the Indianapolis-based operation earlier this year.

Max Chilton (No. 59 Carlin Chevrolet) qualified 10th earning his best start of the season. He qualified 11th in last week’s race at Portland International Raceway. “Really really great for us as a single-car team” he said. “We’re one of the few teams that (didn’t) test here as well.”

Graham Rahal (No. 15 United Rentals Honda of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing) will start 12th but he probably should be starting higher. He was penalized for causing a caution when he bounced off a Turn 6 curb and spun into the gravel. Photographs showed his right rear tire getting off the ground as the car bottomed out. “It’s on me” he said. “I was pushing too hard.”

In the battle for Rookie of the Year honors Romain Grosjean (No. 51 Nurtec ODT Honda of Dale Coyne Racing with RWR) will start 13th with Scott McLaughlin (No. 3 PPG Team Penske Chevrolet) 16th. McLaughlin leads Grosjean by 38 points.

Helio Castroneves (No. 06 Meyer Shank Racing Honda) continues to go to “new” tracks. Yes he has raced at Laguna Seca but it has been 20 years. In 2000 he won from the pole for Team Penske. He will start Sunday’s race from the 22nd position (of 27 car-and-driver combinations).

Longtime Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing crew member Larry Faust is too tough for a flying air gun. Faust proved that Saturday when he got struck in the head while behind the pit wall during qualifying but he was wearing a helmet and was back to work shortly after the incident.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHljYXIuY29tL05ld3MvMjAyMS8wOS8wOS0xOS1MYWd1bmEtUmFjZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Herta Dominates in Laguna Seca Win; Palou Closes on Title,"Stats: Race Results | Driver Points Watch: Race Highlights

Colton Herta continued his family’s success at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca with a dominant victory Sunday in the Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey while Alex Palou marched closer and closer to an even bigger win.

Herta earned his second victory this season and fifth career victory beating Palou’s No. 10 NTT Data Honda to the finish by 1.9747 seconds. NTT P1 Award winner Herta led 91 of the 95 laps in the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda.

California native Herta also won this event from the pole the last time it took place in 2019 in his only other start here. This race was canceled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Herta’s father and race strategist Bryan Herta won this race as a driver from the pole in 1998 and 1999.

“I enjoy racing here so much” Herta said. “It’s an amazing track for me and my family. It’s been so good to us. To go two-for-two so far (at Laguna Seca) is great. We were fast all weekend and I’m glad we could pull it off in the race.”

Spaniard Palou pulled 35 points ahead of Pato O’Ward in the NTT INDYCAR SERIES standings with just one race remaining the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach this Sunday at Long Beach California. Palou must finish 11th or better at Long Beach to earn his first title in his second season in the series.

“We didn’t have it today for the win but we did the most we could” Palou said. “I was trying but it was tough. It was Herta’s day today. I’m happy with P2.”

Palou O’Ward and two-time series champion Josef Newgarden are the only drivers eligible to win the Astor Challenge Cup at the season finale. Newgarden is third in the standings 48 points back. Six-time series champion Scott Dixon and Chip Ganassi Racing teammate Marcus Ericsson were eliminated from contention at this race after finishing 13th and sixth respectively.

This will be the 16th consecutive season in which the NTT INDYCAR SERIES title race will be decided at the final race of the season.

Romain Grosjean finished third today in the No. 51 Nurtec ODT Honda after a stirring late-race charge past rivals and lapped traffic in which he sliced between one to two seconds per lap from Herta and Palou. Grosjean’s third podium finish of the season helped him stay alive in the race for Rookie of the Year honors as he trails Scott McLaughlin by 20 points.

Grosjean was 10 seconds behind Herta with nine laps remaining but closed to within 3.7087 seconds at the finish after some deft driving including a wheel-banging side-by-side duel to lap Jimmie Johnson in the famous “Corkscrew” turn with seven laps remaining. Series rookie Johnson was hip-checked off the track by Grosjean but returned to the racing surface to finish a season-best 17th in the No. 48 Carvana Honda fielded by Chip Ganassi Racing.

“The last stint was very fun because we were on new tires and fresher than everyone else” Grosjean said. “So that was exciting. It’s been a great day. Sorry to Jimmie for the contact out there. He was trying to protect Alex (Palou teammate) and I wanted to go chase Alex.

“P13 to P3 today it’s a pretty good day. Laguna Seca I love you. That’s all I can say.”

Graham Rahal finished fourth in the No. 15 United Rentals Honda with O’Ward rounding out the top five in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet.

“All weekend we didn’t have it” O’Ward said. “I truly feel like we used every single ounce of energy and pace that this car had. We pulled off a near-miracle in qualifying to start in the first three rows. In the race honestly that was as much as I had.

“All we can do at Long Beach is win and then let everything else fall. I’ve got faith in myself. I know I’m pretty handy around a street course so let’s see what we can pull off next week.”

Herta’s path to victory become much clearer on Lap 2 of the 95-lap race ironically after he made a mistake. Herta went wide in Turn 4 opening the door for fellow front-row starter and Andretti Autosport teammate Alexander Rossi in Turn 5.

Rossi and Herta banged wheels while side-by-side in Turn 5 and Rossi’s No. 27 NAPA AUTO PARTS/AutoNation Honda then spun into the gravel and stalled. Rossi’s car was refired but he finished 25th two laps down.

After that incident teams unfolded varying tire and fuel strategies trying to undercut or overcut Herta’s lead. None worked as Herta’s speed and consistency were too much.

The only time Herta didn’t lead the race came when Grosjean was at the front on Lap 19 and from Laps 69-71 during pit cycles.

Palou kept the race close around the midway point pulling to within one second of Herta as both drivers’ Firestone tires wore during a stint. But Herta had extended his lead to 5.4 seconds by Lap 75.

“There was always pressure there from Alex behind me” Herta said. “Even at the beginning of the stints when I was a little bit better he was still there. And he closed it back up at the end of the stints. I think he was a little better that time.

“I’m just happy to have done it. This place is so awesome – it’s my favorite track in North America by far. To win here means so much.”

About the only drama for Herta over the closing laps came with 14 laps remaining when he couldn’t avoid what appeared to be a rabbit or a squirrel running across the track. But the wildlife collision did no damage to his machine and he marched home to victory.

Grosjean’s charge kept the race lively over the closing laps. It appeared with 10 laps to go the Frenchman may have been able to shave enough time per lap to pass Palou and possibly catch Herta for the win. But traffic and tire wear blunted that effort and Grosjean ended up 1.734 seconds behind Palou.

As a result it also accelerated opportunities for Horizontal Digital according to Chris Staley co-founder and executive vice president of the St. Louis Park-based company that describes itself as an ""experience forward consultancy.""

Staley said he and Sabin Ephrem Horizontal's co-founder CEO and chief diversity officer couldn't have known when they launched the company in 2003 that the company's blend of marketing and technology would be hot today.

While venture capital firms and investors roll up such firms Horizontal's independence has enabled it to grow and position the digital consultancy and talent agency to deliver for clients that are ""relentlessly focused on this digital customer journey"" Staley said.

""A great brand is about the experience your customers have with that brand"" Staley said. ""You have to connect all these systems and data from sales service and marketing with data from website commerce site and mobile app. It allows you to continue that conversation with your customers as they jump in and out of channels so it feels like one cohesive conversation with your company and your brand.""

Horizontal has four U.S. and five international offices with clients that include Formica Milwaukee Tool Northwestern Mutual UnitedHealth Group and Sub-Zero. The firm expects revenue to increase from a projected $160 million this year to $300 million in five years Staley said and its digital business has doubled in the last two years.

Horizontal's leadership additions include recent hires of Julie Koepsell as president of digital for North America and Joyce Zincke as executive vice president of operations.

Q: How did the pandemic affect Horizontal Digital's growth?

A: Pre-pandemic we were probably $112 million and today we're $160 million. When you have 30 percent growth over two years that's kind of the clip we've been growing at all along. You have to have opportunities for that growth to continue and you have to keep finding them. We've done a very good job of that from day one.

Q: What are Horizontal's differentiators?

A: The biggest thing that you can build in a business is a great culture a great team. Horizontal Digital has been focused on that team and those people our values and our culture. That's allowed us to focus on the needs of our clients. When you have happy employees you deliver better work for your clients. When you ask clients what we do well I think we really do build better connect experiences than our competition. When you put all the pieces together and you teach them to dance as a team we can go and help clients build great experiences.

Q: What's the importance of Horizontal's independence?

A: A lot of investment groups are putting money into firms like ours. What you get with that is their focus on how do I scale this to sell it at the most value? That's a great strategy for growing equity and revenue but it doesn't let you focus on building a sustainable long-term business. Independence for us means we have the light overhead of making quick decisions and zigging and zagging when we need to. It gives us a middle ground to say we're going to build a great company with great values built on delivering great work for our customers not focused on instant returns but long-term value.

It was initially published in 1896 and since then a significant quantity of important information has continued to be provided about inventories from various firms. This guide explores all about this robust index.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) is one of many indexes used as a gauge for how well an entire market performs at any given time. The index can be helpful because it shows where and how much specific markets have fluctuated in value for days weeks or months. It also allows investors to track their investment performance and compare themselves against others with different portfolios.

History of DJIA

The DJIA is one of the oldest and most well-known stock market indexes in America. Charles Dow the co-founder of the Wall Street Journal created the index back in 1884. Charles Dow composed his first stock average of nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the Customer’s Afternoon Letter a daily two-page financial news bulletin that preceded The Wall Street Journal. By 1900 the index was renamed Dow Jones Industrial Average and included 30 equities divided into two groups: the industrials (comprising 19 members) and the railroads (11).

DJIA expanded beyond transportation stocks with the addition of General Electric (NYSE: GE) in 1901. It joined as one of 11 industrial sector companies added that year due to perceived growth prospects based on earnings per share multiples at a time resulting from significant expansion following consolidation/merger wave among USUS manufacturing businesses during the 1890s – 1910s.

Many significant adjustments occurred throughout the 20th century as many former components combined departed or were relocated.

Using historical data from the DJIA you could get a good idea about what factors affect stocks in general. For example if you saw that oil prices tend to go up when there’s terrible weather somewhere – maybe your portfolio has some exposure to alternative energy research?

DJIA history is a significant indicator of the overall direction of top-level economic activity as measured by leading US industrial corporations whose performance is indicative of changes in business conditions and investment prospects for stock market investors. DJIA value has been included in significant decisions regarding monetary policy that affect global markets such as Federal Reserve rate decision announcements published in advance so financial professionals can monitor new information before public release.

Understanding the Dow Jones Industrial Average

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) sometimes called the “Dow” is a stock market index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States are trading during a standard trading session in the stock market.

The components of DJIA are chosen from leading US companies across different industry groups to reflect their significance within those specific industries and national markets overall.

For a company’s stocks to be added onto or removed from this average they must meet specific requirements including management integrity and liquidity along with shareholder equity over time which helps ensure only established corporations remain included.

Dow Jones Industrial Average Components

The DJIA comprises numerous components that are crucial to the information it provides about how well or poorly the stock market as a whole has performed on any given day.

As of 2021 the Dow Jones Average Index includes the following companies: Apple Inc (NYSE: AAPL) Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE: CRM) Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) Visa Inc (NYSE: V) The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) The American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: HON) Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) The Travelers Companies (NYSE: TRV) Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) Merck & Co. Inc (NYSE: MRK) UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) IBM (NYSE: IBM) 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) The Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) Amgen Inc (NASDAQ: AMGN) Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT) Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA).

DJIA vs the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite

While the basic mission of DJIA S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite is similar the way they go about the task is very different.

Their selection methodology varies. The Dow tracks the value of 30 large companies which tend to be blue-chip firms that are household names. The S&P 500 tends to be broader hoping to have a bigger representation of companies from various sectors and industry groups. And the Nasdaq composite includes only stocks that are trading on the Nasdaq market.

Conclusion

The DJIA has been a historical benchmark for investors to keep in mind when evaluating their stock performance compared to other top companies on the market. However there are many different indices these days and each investor needs to conduct thorough research before placing any investments with a financial adviser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA5LTIwL2Jyb29rZmllbGQtbWFrZXMtNy1iaWxsaW9uLWJpZC1mb3ItYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1wb3dlci1jb21wYW550gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brookfield Makes $7 Billion Bid for Australian Power Company,"Why did this happen?

In doing so we assert that any social scientific or historical investigation must be careful not to simply amplify the organization’s own historiography and institutional ethos as the WBG has been prolific in creating representations of its influence and work in the health sector. We highlight some of the limitations of each of these domains and consider how a careful use of source material may help address these limitations. As discussed above these domains are overlapping and the same forms of power may be at play across many of them – they are best seen as three categories for understanding the Bank’s discourse and actions with three different objects of study as their lenses. They represent a matrix through which researchers may study the WBG’s position in the evolving global health landscape the ways in which the Bank’s position on different global health concepts – like universal health coverage – have changed over time and how these changes have impacted health priorities and provision in the Global South.

Knowledge-based: shaping health policy knowledge

The first important object of study is the knowledge that the Bank produces about health policy and project implementation. Two of Moon’s [44] forms of power are central to understanding the WBG’s role here: expert or shaping “what others consider to be legitimate knowledge” and discursive or shaping “the language others use to conceptualize frame and thereby define and understand an issue.” The World Bank produces extensive research to help shape country-level health policy and global health initiatives through various means including through what is now known as the Development Research Group (DRG). In its 1998 World Development Report “Knowledge for Development” then-Bank President James Wolfensohn embraced the idea of the Bank as a “Knowledge Bank” in what Broad [9] has argued was a push to reassert the Bank’s legitimacy as its financial influence waned in the mid-1990s. The institution’s discursive and expert power can be seen in the ways that concepts and theories are put forward in the “technical” assistance the Bank provides. Such assistance takes the form of training and policy guidance and it goes hand in hand with both direct lending or participation in global health partnerships and debates in spaces of global health governance including working groups like the Inter-agency and Expert Group for Sustainable Development Goal Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) or events like the United Nations High-Level Meeting (UN HLM) on Universal Health Coverage.

There has been both continuity and change in the Bank’s concepts and theories that have gained purchase or have been rejected in these global governance spaces. For instance the Bank has consistently applied theories of human capital to the health sector since the 1970s; it linked the economic “stock” of healthy individuals to disease control and nutrition during Robert McNamara’s tenure as Bank President in the 1970s [61 78] doubled-down on human resources as a critical contributor to economic growth in the 1980s [5] and recently put forward the human capital index metric [35 66]. Yet its embrace of privatization has been much more punctuated. While the Bank’s 1975 Health Policy Paper and 1980 World Development Report warned against heavy emphasis on cost-benefit analysis user fees and private sector delivery health economists such as David de Ferranti advocated for a more pluralist mix of public insurance and voluntary sector funding in the early 1980s including user fees for public institutions [4 67]. Although user fees have been critiqued by some within the institution [13 33] this pluralistic approach has continued with the Bank’s advocacy of universal health coverage.

Social scientists have shown that while the Bank has made a deep impression on global health health economists and other experts at the Bank often work in coordination with other global health institutions or amplify longstanding health research. Since the 1980s scholars have reflected upon the Bank’s success in infusing languages (and underlying ideologies) of economics into international and global health [3 11 18 32 56]. Others have effectively shown how many of these concepts predated World Bank involvement in global health and that the Bank’s influence must be understood in a longer trajectory of health development [23 73]. Some argue that there has been a shift towards economic knowledge at the expense of other forms of reasoning at the Bank in ways that have marginalized rights-based discourse [58 59] and particular country-specific contexts [43 67] in its policies and program implementation. Further Walker (2019) has highlighted that the Bank’s emphasis on economic management in health has not necessarily been matched by a consistent application of economic tools to health project planning – pointing again to the importance of studying the Bank’s shifting and heterogeneous approaches and disconnects between discourse and practice.

This research domain sits within a larger scholarly conversation about how international organizations’ knowledge production is a key mode of producing and maintaining power in the global governance space. The Bank’s discursive and expert power in shaping economic political social and environmental knowledge extends far beyond its health work and scholars have shown how the Bank has leveraged these forms of power to set itself apart in the international development landscape. These include the Bank’s use of country-level policy and institutional benchmarks as a “governing tool” for asserting authority over both recipients and donors of Bank funds [57] and how the Bank as a “strategic knowledge institution” has promoted “smaller and better government” in its influential knowledge about good governance ([16]:118). Nay [46] shows how alongside the OECD the World Bank has played an institutional role in the “consolidation and perpetuation of the aid donors’ policy doctrine” here by producing knowledge about the concept of the “fragile state” and protecting the concept from “dissent” in the process.

With these cases in mind future social scientific research into the World Bank’s role in shaping policy knowledge and expertise about health should consider two main questions. First which actors are (and are not) involved in producing knowledge at the Bank? In other words whose research agenda drives the Bank-initiated production of knowledge? How involved are local scholars in the production of knowledge relative to more powerful Bank staff and “clients” (like major donors) and whose interests does evidence serve? Second how are the data so produced used? Do they guide health policy-making or are they used post-hoc to justify decisions already made? The latter questions focus on the functional use of estimates like the global burden of disease (GBD) and may be most relevant in the case of performance- or results-based financing as discussed further in the finance section below. This is particularly important because recent research has indicated that the metrics and tools put forward by the Bank are often not used to assess loans due to their irrelevance to complex political negotiations [19].

We recommend that scholars undertake country or programmatic case studies for this research domain. For instance how have in-country WBG officials leveraged global estimates of disease or advocated for local data collection on maternal and child health? Or how have different entities within the WBG defined the concept of “universal health coverage” [70] “right to health” [58] or “gender equality” [60]? What factors influence discourse around these concepts and what influence do they have on in-country population health and/or programmatic outcomes? Such case studies would further enable health development leaders in countries that receive Bank funding to contextualize health policy recommendations and advocate for more country-owned means of knowledge production and to highlight the ways that contextual knowledge can be used in health development policy. These case studies may be best accomplished through discourse analysis and qualitative thematic analysis of documents particularly of archival data at the WBG Archives partner nation archives and key informant interviews. In theory the World Bank could be a strong ally in this advocacy: a strength of the Bank’s country-based model is that it is uniquely placed to promote local capacity for development including championing the in-country production of health data over the use of estimated data [75].

Governance-based: shaping global health governance

Our second recommended research domain is the role of the WBG since the 1980s in changing the nature of health governance at the supranational national and sub-national levels. Here the two most important forms of power are institutional or the “use of rules and decision-making procedures to shape decision-making” and network or the use of “personal relationships with others to shape their thinking and/or action” ([44]:6–7). The Bank is institutionally different from other global health actors like UN agencies (including the WHO) philanthropic organizations and bilateral donors. It is an organization with member states whose votes matter more at the end of the day based on how much money they provide to the institution. Unlike the WHO UNICEF or other global health donors its point of contact on the country level are ministers of finance linking it more closely to those with the funds to back up its policy recommendations. With the diminishing influence of the WHO due to the freezing of its budgets and the rise of earmarked health funding [10 11] the Bank became one of the most important global health financiers in the 1980s although HNP financing has certainly fluctuated in the decades since. However like its insertion into the health policy knowledge world officials at the WBG have introduced new ways of staking a financial claim in the global health landscape. For instance in the push to increase investment from “billions to trillions” the WBG is positioning itself to de-risk private equity; new financing mechanisms include trust funds to finance outbreak response by channeling funding from reinsurance and bond markets [65] impact investments for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and IFC financing for health projects which now include specific budgetary allocations for blended finance [15].

Research is needed that situates the WBG’s influence relative to other global health actors and borrowing countries through two inter-related questions. First to what extent does the WBG’s financial power affect its power to influence health policy at the country level? This question considers the ways that the WBG has influenced countries’ health financing. It also highlights the WBG’s relationship with ministries of finance which is a privileged position in comparison to the WHO’s point of contact on the national level being ministries of health (e.g. [64]). Second it is important to investigate the ways that the WBG has supported both vertical and horizontal programming – through the IDA and the IBRD’s main modalities (project financing and associated policy advice) the IFC’s investments and the MIGA’s risk reduction for investment. That is in what ways has the organization supported attention to single-issue health interventions or vertical approaches like interventions into HIV/AIDS or malaria in comparison to its attention to overall health systems strengthening or horizontal approaches to health development? How has this impacted countries’ overall health system strengthening activities? To what extent has the IFC’s focus on the private sector constrained – or facilitated – the WBG’s ability to invest in primary health care?

To study these questions and situate the Bank within a complex web of global health partners we recommend three methodological approaches. A first approach is to perform network analysis to map the connections formed by the WBG and ministries of finance and health (or other high-ranking cabinet members). This would be best accomplished by performing interview-intensive or ethnographic case studies on the country level in countries that receive Bank funding. A second country-level approach focuses on the congruence between the Bank’s formal country investment plans and the health priorities voiced by client countries. For instance researchers could identify health priorities stated in Bank country-specific five-year action plans; analyze strategic health policy documents from the national government during this time period which are produced with Bank and WHO staff as well as other stakeholders; and perform interviews with national stakeholders and staff from the Bank and other major global health actors to understand the programs that were ultimately implemented during this time period. Such a document and interview-based methodology would allow for a more accurate understanding of how (and whether) the Bank met country and national priorities and what health areas were neglected.

The third approach is to investigate the Bank’s role in vertical health interventions by studying how silos form in global health. This approach could use case studies based on archival research and interviews at Bank headquarters of institutions that were part of the vertical intervention and a few countries that were beneficiaries of the intervention. It would use these case studies to analyze how funding decisions are made for particular health areas (including the evidence used most influential voices and decision-making structure). For example researchers could investigate how the silo for investing in HIV/AIDS interventions developed and why no such silo has developed for intervening on mental health. Focusing on the Bank’s relative role in this prioritization process would allow for a more nuanced understanding of how the Bank has promoted (or not promoted) what it itself calls “health system strengthening.” It could also provide insight into the Bank’s influence on silo formation relative to other major global health agencies or financiers.

Finance-based: shaping health financing mechanisms

Our final proposed research domain puts health financing at its center. The two of Moon’s [44] forms of global governance power that are most important here are economic or the “use of material resources” to shape action and thought and institutional which is described in the section above. While the Bank’s ideological approach to its health financing agenda has changed since it sanctioned direct lending in 1979 it has consistently retained economic power through the sheer quantity of its lending. During the late 1970s and in its 1980 World Development Report the Bank ideologically aligned with the basic needs approach and largely supported the primary health care movement championed by the Alma Ata Declaration [67]. From the early 1980s through the 1990s however concerns about the affordability of universal primary health care drove the WBG and UNICEF towards selective primary health care [12] and the Bank embraced market-based resource allocation through its Structural Adjustment Programs in an attempt secure it [6 52 67]. As part of the Structural Adjustment Program model the Bank embraced user fees at the point of service. The user fee debate has been covered well through case studies which may be best summarized as pointing to their “sustainable inequity” [48] or enabling of some service provision at the deep expense of equitable access (e.g. [21]). Robert and Ridde’s (2013) documentary analysis indicates that the majority of global health actors surveyed from 2005 to 2011 favored either the abolition of user fees or free care at the point of delivery with the Bank as the only actor that still favored both user fees and free care at the point of service.

As it prepared its health financing agenda for the new millennium the WBG’s Operations Evaluation Department (the predecessor to the IEG) argued that “despite an initial focus on government health services the Bank is increasingly focusing on issues of private and nongovernmental organization (NGO) service delivery insurance and regulation” and stated that clients viewed it as a powerful actor for donor coordination [31]. Indeed since 2000 IBRD and IDA have shifted their language toward increasing public expenditure in health and attention to health systems strengthening [68] although the relative growth of the Bank’s trust fund financing for public-private partnerships compared to its core health sector lending indicates that this shift may be somewhat rhetorical [64]. The Bank’s embrace of health system strengthening and UHC have been complicated by the relative rise in power of the IFC and the WBG’s recent renewed interest in insurance as a means to secure universal health coveragee. The relative percentage of health and education within the IFC’s portfolio for instance rose from 2 % in 2007 to 8 % in 2015 and it has championed private health sector commitments for diagnostic chains health insurers information technology and medical education [28]. In 2014 the HNP Global Practice was launched to accelerate progress towards UHC and to build on the WBG’s 2013 Corporate Strategy of “One World Bank Group” embracing public and private solutions. However as pointed -out by the Independent Evaluation Group [29] collaboration between the IBRD/IDA and the IFC may be more rhetoric than reality with a single Global Lead for Harnessing the Private Sector leading coordination activities. The contrast between the WBG’s stated support of UHC and the rise of IFC’s privatized investments in health has attracted surprisingly little scholarly attention.

How have researchers unpacked the financing mechanisms that fuel these financing ideologies? The World Bank’s unique position in the terrain of financial governance because of the size of its health lending portfolio cannot be overstated. Core World Bank funding for the health sector (HNP programs) totaled approximately $17.5 billion from 1985 to 2000 and $60.9 billion from 2000 to 2015 [78]. As Sridhar et al. [64] have documented the theme allocation for HNP funding has changed significantly over time with the largest portion (44%) targeted to reproductive maternal and child health from 1985 to 2000 and the largest portion (34%) going to budgetary support by 2000–2015. Yet the Bank’s reported HNP data is only the “tip of the iceberg” in terms of its involvement in financing mechanisms for projects that impact health.

At least three additional factors contribute to the WBG’s influence on health financing. First regional and global trust funds for health activities have proliferated as financing mechanisms since the 1990s and are largely not captured by HNP financing data. A few studies have analyzed the reasons for the proliferation of trust funds in the 1980s and 1990s especially related to geopolitical forces at the United Nations in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g. [17 72]). However comprehensive thematic analyses of trust funds held at the Bank particularly financial intermediary funds (modalities used to support Global Partnership Programs) and IFC trust funds have not been undertaken. The IEG’s [29] report quantified health sector support to IFC and IBRD/IDA trust funds – which by 2016 supported approximately 29% of all health services projects – but did not perform a deep analysis of financial intermediary funds. These funds are typically used to support national or global public goods often in collaboration with specialized United Nations agencies (particularly the WHO and UNICEF). The Bank is not a passive ""banker"" for most of these Global Partnership Programs [64]. For instance as of 2016 the World Bank Group was represented at the governing body of twenty-two of the twenty-five existing Global Partnership Programs. This has provided the Bank with a distinct influential network of high-level national and international stakeholders [29].

Second the Bank also exerts economic power on the global health agenda through projects that are not technically in the health sector. As examples many HNP projects and trust funds are targeted at humanitarian and sanitation projects in post-conflict states and some long-standing trust funds such as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and the Cities Alliance fund support activities related to food security and slum upgrading [30]. Third health projects can serve as a vehicle for building relationships with the Bank and ""leapfrogging"" into wider lending arrangements (e.g. [34]).

To further unpack the Bank’s economic power and financial influence we identify three main research questions: (1) in what ways has the WBG influenced the way that the “public” and the “private” are conceived in global health (2) to what extent and through what vehicles has it embraced a “selective” approach to primary health care and (3) what types of influence has it exerted through its trust fund infrastructure such as through performance-based financing and its financing of Global Partnership Programs?

The first question can be approached by “following the money.” How much money is allocated to states and the private sector in a country portfolio in a given number of years based on official project and disbursal reports? The Global Health Governance Programme has analyzed Bank financing including trust funds by the IBRD and the IDA for health themes (e.g. [53 68]; Winters et al. 2017 [64]) but scholars have not compared IFC IBRD and IDA country loans and grants in a health-specific context. This comparison of private health investments across the WBG should be investigated with special focus on any associated redistribution of social benefits especially at the national level. Tracking country investments may require archival or document-based research and interviews in member states as the Bank’s main modality is a government loan or grant which may lack full transparency in disbursal reports. It can also be approached by studying the ideological underpinnings of privatization across the Bank. For instance researchers could track the way that states and the market have been discussed by Bank employees and how this has changed over time through oral histories and document analysis. Has the market-orientation of the Bank’s involvement in health in the 1980s and through its 1993 World Development Report been replaced with other conceptualizations of health equity and how do these new visions position health within the Bank’s larger development agenda? Finally research on privatization should focus on the presence or absence of policy coherence between different Bank entities especially between the IBRD the IDA and the IFC.

The second question builds on Structural Adjustment Programs and the Bank’s lack of buy-in to the primary health care movement. This area requires a deeper investigation of the links between UNICEF and the World Bank which have often been closer than the Bank and the WHO (e.g. [76]). In this context ""following the money"" may be complicated due to low transparency of early trust funds at the Bank [79]. A document-based analysis of the Special Grants Program and Development Grant Facility including financial records and memoranda from the WBG Archives may be most effective. This research could be supplemented with oral histories and interview-based methods with both World Bank staff and national staff involved in collaborative global programs.

For the third question it would be productive to perform deeper analyses of the Bank’s performance- and results-based financing programs and Global Partnership Programs. Results-based financing has been used by the Bank over the last twenty years incentivize performance and improve efficiency of service delivery in LMICs [51]. The Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) launched in 2007 and closed for fundraising in 2017 was designed to build and share an evidence base from results-based financing in the health sector and represents the Bank’s newer model of coupling country grants with IDA lending. It has been replaced by the heavily-funded Global Financing Facility in Support of Every Woman Every Child (GFF) which incorporates a similar model of ""catalytic aid"" [27 29]. To critically approach the HRITF and GFF and understand the diffusion of performance-based financing at the global level it may be helpful to begin with critical discourse and documentary analyses. Taking Gautier and Ridde's [20] and Robert and Ridde's [55] analyses of user fee favorability and HRITF politicized evidence respectively as examples sources for this research could include public documents from official websites (both the Bank and participating governments). For projects with Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) available researchers could use Malik and Stone’s [40] coding system to further understand private actors’ potential influence over project evaluation and enforcement of conditionality.

Analyzing the complex influence that the World Bank exerts relative to other global health actors through performance-based financing and Global Partnership Programs may require deeper access to its experts. This can be provided through ethnographic approaches and oral histories such as those conducted by Lie [39] on the World Bank-Uganda partnership. Ethnographies may be most appropriate to disentangle the Bank’s collaborations with the IFC (including at a country level) its financial relationships with ‘clients’ within country portfolios and its influence – and role as a broker – on financial intermediary fund boards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vbnNhZHZvY2F0ZS5vcmcvMjAyMS8wOS8xOS9sdXh1cnktYm9uZXMtd2h5LXdlLW5lZWQtdW5pdmVyc2FsLWRlbnRhbC1jYXJlLWFuZC13aHktaXQtbmVlZHMtdG8tYmUtcHVibGljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Luxury bones – Why we need universal dental care and why it needs to be public,"KJIPUKTUK (Halifax) – As we head towards a federal election we’ll hear – as we do every 4 years or so – politicians pay lip service about access to dental care. To some of us it may seem baffling that the bones in our mouths don’t receive the same consideration as the rest of our bones. Canadians take pride in our public health care system so naturally we should also care about the health of our mouths.

Where we are today

Since dental care is not included in Medicare people rely primarily on work related insurance and out of pocket payments to access care. In fact 95% of dental spending in Canada is private and only 5% goes towards public dental programs. The share of public dental spending in Canada is even less than the US at 10% and not even close to the UK at 46%. Due to the current structure of dental care in Canada many people lack access to care.

In 2018 approximately 1 in 3 Canadians lacked any dental insurance and over 1 in 5 avoided the dentist due to financial constraints. For people who lack access to dental care preventive and routine care is neglected in order to focus resources on dealing with pain and infection which results in a population with poorer oral health. This has many consequences on individuals and society as a whole.

For individuals poor oral health has been shown to cause or worsen many general health conditions including: cardiovascular disease diabetes having a low birth weight infant aspiration pneumonia erectile dysfunction osteoporosis metabolic syndrome and stroke. Further having visible decay or missing front teeth can affect employability and one’s self esteem.

For society there is increased healthcare spending for a society with poorer oral health. One reason for the increased spending on healthcare is due to the effects of poor oral health on overall health. Further hundreds of thousands of Canadians end up in an emergency department each year seeking treatment for dental pain a problem that is estimated to cost over $150 million per year.

Even before the pandemic access to dental care in Canada was poor and getting worse. Due to changes in the economy fewer people have dental insurance. Many people are retiring and losing work related dental insurance and an increasing number of people are working in the precarious ‘gig economy’ that does not provide benefits like dental insurance tied to their labour. With the financial hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic even more people are struggling to access dental care.

How we can implement it

The federal NDP has proposed a plan to provide dental insurance to uninsured families making $90000 per year or less. The plan is desperately needed and is expected to help over 6 million Canadians with a cost of only $1.5 billion per year. Don Davies the federal NDP health critic has stated that he sees this plan as an interim measure while we work towards integrating dental care into Canada’s universal health care system.

Ultimately Canadians need to confront the fact that dentistry is big business with corporate ownership of dental clinics rapidly growing in Canada. Fortunately confronting the profit motive in dental care will allow serious gains in public health.

Saskatchewan had a public dental program that ran out of schools in the 1970-80’s that showed the benefit of taking the business end out of dentistry. The program used dental therapists which are providers that can do fillings and simple extractions at a fraction of the cost of a dentist. Due to the easy accessibility of the clinics the focus on prevention and cost efficient use of dental therapists the program was a huge success lowering the need for fillings and extractions in children by half. Further dentists that worked in the program could focus on more complex procedures that only they were trained for. It is important to learn from this model and allow government funding to bring clinics like this into our communities. For example with proper funding clinics like the North End Community Health Centre could be expanded to provide dental care to the community. Currently the clinic relies on local dentists to donate their time but this is not enough to meet population needs.

It is clear that the status quo for dental care is inadequate. Maintaining a minority parliament this election is an opportunity to start expanding Medicare to include services like dental care. When Medicare was originally implemented it was with the intention of including dental care at a later date. Now over half a century later it is time to follow through with this vision.

Ahead of a dialogue at the UN on Monday between senior United Nations officials UN News explains the importance of vaccine equity.

What is vaccine equity?

Quite simply it means that all people wherever they are in the world should have equal access to a vaccine which offers protection against the COVID-19 infection.

WHO has set a global target of 70 per cent of the population of all countries to be vaccinated by mid-2022 but to reach this goal a more equitable access to vaccines will be needed.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said vaccine equity was “not rocket science nor charity. It is smart public health and in everyone’s best interest.”

Why is it so important?

Apart from the ethical argument that no country or citizen is more deserving of another no matter how rich or poor an infectious disease like COVID-19 will remain a threat globally as long as it exists anywhere in the world.

Inequitable vaccine distribution is not only leaving millions or billions of people vulnerable to the deadly virus it is also allowing even more deadly variants to emerge and spread across the globe.

Moreover an unequal distribution of vaccines will deepen inequality and exaggerate the gap between rich and poor and will reverse decades of hard-won progress on human development.

According to the UN vaccine inequity will have a lasting impact on socio-economic recovery in low and lower-middle income countries and set back progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). According to the UNDP eight out of ten people pushed into poverty directly by the pandemic are projected to live in the world’s poorest countries in 2030.

Estimates also suggest that the economic impacts of COVID-19 may last until 2024 in low-income countries while high-income countries could reach pre-COVID-19 per capita GDP growth rates by the end of this year.

Is it working?

WHO Confirmed cases of COVID-19 (15 September 2021)

Not according to Dr Tedros who said in April this year that “vaccine equity is the challenge of our time…and we are failing”.

Research suggests that enough vaccines will be produced in 2021 to cover 70 per cent of the global population of 7.8 billion. However most vaccines are being reserved for wealthy countries while other vaccine-producing countries are restricting the export of doses so they can ensure that their own citizens get vaccinated first an approach which has been dubbed “vaccine nationalism”. The decision by some nations to give already inoculated citizens a booster vaccine rather than prioritizing doses for unvaccinated people in poorer countries has been highlighted as one example of this trend.

Still the good news according to WHO data is that as of September 15 more than 5.5 billion doses have been administered worldwide although given that most of the available vaccines require two shots the number of people who are protected is much lower.

Which countries are getting the vaccines right now?

Put simply the rich countries are getting the majority of vaccines with many poorer countries struggling to vaccinate even a small number of citizens.

According to the Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity (established by UNDP WHO and Oxford University) as of September 15 just 3.07 per cent of people in low-income countries have been vaccinated with at least one dose compared to 60.18 per cent in high-income countries.

The vaccination rate in the UK of people who have received at least one vaccine dose is around 70.92 per cent while the US is currently at 65.2 per cent. Other high-income and middle-income countries are not doing so well; New Zealand has vaccinated just 31.97 per cent of its relatively small population of around five million although Brazil is now at 63.31 per cent.

However the stats in some of the poorest countries in the world make for grim reading. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo just 0.09 per cent of the population have received one dose; in Papua New Guinea and Venezuela the rate is 1.15 per cent and 20.45 per cent respectively.

Find more country specific data here.

What’s the cost of a vaccine?

© UNICEF/Raphael Pouget A nurse holds a dose of vaccine at Sheikh Zayed Hospital in Nouakchott Mauritania.

Data from UNICEF show that the average cost of a COVID-19 vaccine is $2 to $37 (there are 24 vaccines which have been approved by at least one national regulatory authority) and the estimated distribution cost per person is $3.70. This represents a significant financial burden for low-income countries where according to UNDP the average annual per capita health expenditure amounts to $41.

The vaccine equity dashboard shows that without immediate global financial support low-income countries would have to increase their healthcare spending by between 30 and 60 per cent to meet the target of vaccinating 70 per cent of their citizens.

What has the UN been doing to promote a more equitable access to vaccines?

© UNICEF/Arlette Bashizi A delivery of COVID-19 vaccination doses provided through the COVAX Facility is checked in Goma in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

WHO and UNICEF have worked with other organizations to establish and manage the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility known as COVAX. Launched in April 2020 WHO called it a “ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development production and equitable access to COVID-19 tests treatments and vaccines”.

Its aim is to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world based on need and not purchasing power.

Currently COVAX numbers 141 participants according to the UN-supported Gavi alliance but it’s not the only way that countries can access vaccines as they can also make bilateral deals with manufacturers.

Will equal access to vaccines bring an end to the pandemic?

© UNICEF/Antoine Raab Students at a school in Cambodia are studying despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

It’s a crucial step obviously and in many richer countries life is getting back to some sort of normality for many people even if some pandemic protocols are still in place. The situation in less developed countries is more challenging. While the delivery of vaccines provided under the COVAX Facility is being welcomed across the world weak health systems including shortages of health workers are contributing to mounting access and distribution challenges on the ground.

And equity issues don’t disappear once vaccines are physically delivered in country; in some nations both rich and poor inequities in distribution may still persist.

It’s also worth remembering that the imperative of providing equal access to health care is of course not a new issue but central to the Sustainable Development Goals and more precisely SDG 3 on good health and well-being which calls for achieving universal health coverage and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

En su intervención en la Supercon 2021 de Florida el 12 de septiembre Cena dijo que fue un error comercializar sus NFT de la WWE como parte de un paquete con coleccionables físicos: una gorra una camiseta unas pulseras un cinturón una toalla una foto autografiada y el coleccionable digital. La empresa ofreció 500 paquetes de nivel dorado con los NFT por USD 1000 pero sólo se vendió una parte de ellos.

""Hablo mucho del fracaso esta idea no funcionó"" dijo Cena. ""Yo mismo y la gente de la WWE pensábamos que USD 1000 era un precio justo. Nos equivocamos. Estábamos absolutamente equivocados"".

El 15 veces campeón mundial añadió:

""Vendimos 37 de ellos. Fue un fracaso catastrófico"".

Cena y la WWE pusieron a la venta dos niveles de NFT para la superestrella del wrestling: una subasta de 24 horas de un ""NFT de platino de John Cena"" y los 500 NFT de edición limitada como parte del mencionado paquete de coleccionables físicos al día siguiente. El NFT de platino se vendió por USD 21000 y el mejor postor recibió entradas VIP y un paquete completo para WrestleMania 38 en Dallas Texas o WrestleMania 39 en Los Ángeles California.

La veterano de la WWE promocionó el espacio de las criptomonedas en las redes sociales mucho antes del aumento de la popularidad de los NFT. Antes de la carrera alcista del Bitcoin (BTC) en 2017 cuando el precio estaba en los USD 4000 tuiteó una foto del token físico.

El papel físico acabó vendiéndose por USD 343000 mientras que la puja final por el NFT fue de 12 Ether (ETH) es decir unos USD 27460 en ese momento.

El impacto negativo de la salida de su máximo emblema Lionel Messi hacia el París Saint Germain (PSG) en el pasado mercado de pases europeo le puede generar al Fútbol Club Barcelona un impacto negativo de 137 millones de euros entre la caída de los sponsors de la venta de abonos anuales al Camp Nou o de camisetas en tanto que a sus dirigentes se les pide explicaciones por preparar una oferta por el jugador del Leizpig y la selección española Daniel Olmo por 75 millones casi el doble de lo que iba a cobrar el argentino si se le renovaba el contrato.

La consultora “Brand Finance” estimó que con la salida de Messi (obligada por el club porque el jugador no quería marcharse y aceptó reducirse su salario en todo lo que el club le sugirió) el Barcelona perdería hasta el 11 por ciento de la marca que se estima hoy en un valor de 1266 millones de euros ubicándose aún como la segunda entre todos los equipos de fútbol del mundo y apenas por detrás del Real Madrid (1276 millones) aunque en cualquier momento podría caer detrás del Manchester United hoy tercero con una valoración de 1130 millones.

Esto no es sólo privativo del Barcelona porque algo similar (o peor) le ocurrió al Real Madrid en 2018 cuando el portugués Cristiano Ronaldo (considerado como la máxima figura del equipo desde los tiempos de Alfredo Di Stéfano en los años cincuenta y sesenta) se marchó a la Juventus y la marca disminuyó un 19 por ciento.

Apenas por el rubro de los ingresos comerciales el Barcelona sufriría una pérdida de 77 millones otros 17 millones serían por la pérdida de ventas en los días de partido (rubro conocido como Matchday) y otros 43 millones en ventas de camisetas de las que un 80 por ciento correspondían al argentino y ya el club las tuvo que retirar del mercado así como quitó su gigantografía del estadio. Por otra parte se calcula una caída de 40 millones por abonos de plateas para ver al equipo en el estadio porque 26.238 socios se retiraron esta temporada (incluso antes de que se produjera la salida de Messi del club) por lo que de un total anterior de 83.500 se pasará a otro mucho más reducido de 57.262 lo que ya se vio reflejado en los primeros partidos de la temporada en condición de local.

Se calcula una caída de 40 millones por abonos de plateas (Foto: Reuters)

Si la venta de camisetas va en picada peor situación es la que tendrá el Barcelona a partir de la temporada 2022/23 porque la empresa japonesa Rakuten auspiciante principal de la indumentaria y que aporta 30 millones en 2021/22 y que ya dejó 250 millones en las arcas del club en los últimos cinco años (por la pandemia y por Messi disminuyó desde los 55 millones de años anteriores) anunció que se retirará el 30 de junio próximo.

Sin nuevo sponsor a la vista a Rakuten se le suma la anunciada salida de Beko auspiciante de las mangas de la camiseta. Hasta el momento los auspiciantes aportan un total de 180 millones anuales y la comisión directiva entrante ya manifestó que quiere tratar de llegar a los 250 en esta temporada como para ir paliando el enorme agujero negro a sabiendas de que la salida de Messi significa perder un tercio de los ingresos directos e indirectos del club según varios de los estudios consultados y que a su vez indican que estas previsiones se complicaron para los próximos meses.

Por ejemplo Marc Ciria uno de los principales consultores del Barcelona y perteneciente a la empresa “Diagonal Inversores” afirma que “a partir de ahora para mantener a los patrocinadores tendrá más importancia la competitividad del equipo que los nombres. Messi les aportaba un relato y ahora se han quedado sin él” y si bien se puede pensar en el futuro en otros jugadores emblema como Ansu Fati o el recién llegado Memphis Depay todo indica que no llegarán al nivel de lo que fue el argentino en cuanto a atracción para los auspiciantes en el corto plazo.

Según los consultores el Barcelona no debería descartar la opción de renegociar a la baja el contrato por el auspicio de la camiseta con Rakuten y hasta considerar otras salidas como la de convocar a empresas de compraventa de criptomonedas un sector muy especulativo y de riesgo variable con el que la dirigencia “culé” no se siente muy cómoda.

Otro problema que aparece en lo inmediato es la relación con “Nike” que puso como fecha límite el mes de octubre para saber cuál es el nombre del nuevo patrocinador principal de la camiseta desde el 1 de julio de 2022.

“El Barcelona ha felicitado esta semana a través de sus redes sociales a un jugador del PSG por haber superado a Pelé como máximo goleador sudamericano con la selección de Argentina” ironizó días pasados Alberto Masnou en su columna del diario deportivo catalán “Sport”.

El periodista sostuvo que la marcha de Messi “duele en lo más profundo del corazón barcelonista porque el club catalán ha dejado de estar en el epicentro del mundo futbolístico. Ahora incluso el Barꞔa debe mirar a París o a Buenos Aires. Hoy el aficionado de Hong Kong Australia Malasia USA o Senegal han dejado de estar pendientes del Barcelona ha perdido interés por el club que gracias a Leo se convirtió en el más grande del mundo”.

“Dejar marchar a Leo cuando quería quedarse –insiste Masnou- es el mayor error de la historia del FC Barcelona. El Barꞔa es hoy un equipo mediocre cuya delantera son retales del Leganés del Sevilla o del City”.

Mientras el Barcelona sufre estos avatares en París en poco más de un mes desde su llegada el PSG ya firmó acuerdos con “Dior” “EA Sports” o “Crypto.com” (pagará 30 millones de euros por año) “Accor” el actual sponsor y que paga actualmente 50 millones ya propuso renovar y el precio del “Token” (criptomoneda del PSG) ya aumentó un 130 por ciento según el portal web de seguimiento de precios de activos digitales “CoinMarketCap”.

Un informe de “L’Equipe” indica que la venta de camisetas de Messi con el número 30 superan en más del 50 por ciento a las del 10 de Neymar de hace cuatro años cuando el brasileño llegó al club parisino en tanto que apenas un día después de oficializar el pase el club francés aumentó en cinco millones sus seguidores en Instagram.

Si de Instagram se trata Messi (240 millones) cuenta con más del doble de seguidores que el Barcelona (995) lo que demuestra según el consultor Marc Ciria “que hay una gran masa de aficionados que siguen al jugador y no al club” y que si el argentino genera 200 millones de euros al año en venta de camisetas el club se queda con un 15 por ciento de ese valor.

La situación económica del Barcelona es tan dura que hace unas semanas (Messi aún permanecía en el club) la agencia de calificación “Fitch” le dio un triple B negativo cuando intenta refinanciar su deuda de 525 millones de euros bajo la tutela de la banca Goldman Sachs. Según los asesores esa calificación no cambiará en el corto plazo.

Por lo pronto el Barcelona ya cambió de director comercial por tercera vez en 2021. Si antes estuvo en manos de Cinto Ajram y luego de Xavier Asensi –que se fue con David Beckham al Inter de Miami- Jordi Camps renunció en julio pasado por “diferencias en la hoja de ruta”.

Si hay alguien que conoce al Barcelona al dedillo es el ex dirigente y empresario Josep María Minguella (el que acercó a Diego Maradona y a Messi al club) quien también es columnista de distintos medios catalanes y tiene un influyente canal de Youtube con temática azulgrana.

“El Barꞔa que tiene una camiseta gloriosa un escudo único y una afición mundial ha perdido en poco tiempo cerca de 70 goles por temporada al prescindir de Luis Suárez no renovar a Messi y reforzar al Atlético de Madrid con Antoine Griezmann -afirmó días pasados-. Se sabe que estamos en una situación delicada pero creo que el socio tiene derecho de una vez a saber cuáles fueron las realidades de no poder firmarle su contrato. Se ha publicado que para el partido contra el Bayern Munich hubo poco más de 30.000 solicitudes para asistir al Camp Nou. Puede tener diversas causas pero en ellas habría que incluir la falta de nombres de impacto”.

La confusión sobre la salida de Messi y la supuesta imposibilidad del Barcelona de hacer frente al pago de su contrato choca con las crecientes versiones de que el club prepara una oferta de 75 millones (casi el doble de lo que se había acordado con el argentino) para contratar al delantero español del Leizig Daniel Olmo.

En este sentido el empresario de medios y avalista del presidente del Barcelona Joan Laporta Jaume Roures sostuvo al programa “La Sotana” que si bien firmado con Messi “no había nada estaba todo acordado de palabra y muchas cosas escritas pero los días previos a ese jueves se complicó todo por todos lados pero fue más desde el punto de vista deportivo y no económico porque Messi ya hizo las concesiones que se le pidieron. El mundo del fútbol es muy complejo”.

Roures afirmó que la situación del Barcelona “es peor de la que todo el mundo pueda imaginar. Se podría haber avanzado mucho con renovar a Messi incluso sin el dinero del acuerdo que hizo la Liga con el fondo CVC por los derechos de TV pero las cosas no son fáciles. La exigencia y la necesidad de un equipo competitivo es algo que ya ha ido diciendo Leo desde que era capitán y este es un elemento que se mezcló con unos temas que estaban bastante resueltos”.

Al menos en las últimas semanas el Barcelona tuvo un mínimo respiro al cerrar un acuerdo con la marca “Allianz” hasta 2024 mientras que con “Lego” el club viene realizando algunas colaboraciones que podrían implicar algún tipo de contrato con la empresa danesa como sponsor.

También desde 2012 el Barcelona tiene un acuerdo con la Agencia Catalana de Turismo (ACT) con el objetivo de promover la ciudad en los mercados internacionales con el club como epicentro y algunos deportistas o ex deportistas como ejes como son los casos de Gerard Piqué Carles Puyol Ricky Rubio o Mireia Belmonte.

Pero los problemas siguen y el pasado martes la Junta Directiva aprobó el cierre del ejercicio 2020/21 con pérdidas de 481 millones de euros y un presupuesto de ingresos previstos para la temporada 2021/22 de 765 millones una baja sensible para lo que fueron los anteriores algo que deberá ser ratificado por la asamblea de compromisarios del fin de semana del 16 y 17 de octubre coincidiendo con el partido ante el Valencia mientras que el 6 de octubre se presentarán los resultados de la Due Dilligence que lleva adelante el club desde que Laporta asumió como presidente.

Junta Directiva aprobó el cierre del ejercicio 2020/21 con pérdidas de 481 millones de euros (Foto: EFE)

La deuda total del FC Barcelona es de 1350 millones de euros y en ese monto se incluyen los 52 que debe pagarle al propio Messi como parte del salario diferido que el jugador dejó de ganar durante la pandemia para aliviar la situación económica del club.

El Barcelona tiene previsto efectuar pagos correspondientes a esta deuda entre lo que queda de 2021 y 2022 aunque está negociando los plazos con los abogados del argentino.

Horas antes del partido contra el Bayern Munich por el inicio de la fase de grupos de la Champions League el ex presidente del club alemán Uli Hoeness afirmó que “ya no considero al Barcelona como un referente del mundo del fútbol (el Bayern por muchos años se le quiso parecer). Ya no es un modelo para nosotros en absoluto. En realidad está en quiebra. En Alemania el Barcelona sería un caso para un juez responsable de insolvencia. Somos favoritos en este partido porque el Barcelona no puede estar en forma debido a la venta de varios jugadores clave y a los problemas económicos”.

Consultado el ex jugador y director general del Bayern Karl Heinz Rummenigge sobre la salida de Messi del Barcelona sostuvo que tanto él como Cristiano Ronaldo “dejan un vacío en términos de marketing que la liga no podrá llenar. Cada uno es libre de opinar lo que quiera pero considero un gol en contra haberse visto obligado a perder al argentino por consecuencias del Fair Play financiero pero lo vimos venir. Cuando acumulas tantos gastos es normal que las cuentas no terminen saliendo especialmente después de la pandemia. No hay alternativa hay que reducir gastos y mi buen amigo Laporta lo sabe”.

El Barcelona que meses atrás había caído estrepitosamente contra el Bayern Munich por 8-2 por la Champions League ahora inició la nueva temporada europea cayendo por 3-0 ante el mismo equipo en el Camp Nou.

Las ventas del sector privado en el país sumaron USD 86.259 millones entre enero y julio de 2021 según la Cámara de Comercio de Quito (CCQ).

Eso significa un alza de USD 13.765 millones o lo que equivale a 19% más en comparación con el mismo período de 2020.

Si se analiza por tipo de contribuyente las ventas de las empresas sumaron USD 64.913 millones entre enero y julio de 2021.

Mientras que las ventas de las personas naturales fueron USD 20.331 millones y las pertenecientes a los actores de la Economía Popular y Solidaria llegaron a USD 1.014 millones.

Este reporte sobre las ventas de la Cámara de Comercio llega días después de que el SRI registró un aumento en la recaudación tributaria originada en parte por las acciones de control emprendidas y por la reactivación económica.

Según el SRI la recaudación tributaria ascendió a USD 1.073 millones en agosto de 2021 un crecimiento de 19% versus el mismo mes de 2020.

El representante legal del Tianguis Pirotécnicos A.C. Joel Guerra Razo manifestó que durante los festejos del mes patrio la comercialización de este producto se redujo de manera exponencial pues pasó del 80 al 30 por ciento esto lo asocian a la reducción de horario para la venta de pirotecnia ya que anteriormente se retiraban a las 24:00 horas y ahora se quedan nada más hasta las 19:00 horas.

“Este año estuvo muy tranquilo tuvimos ventas muy bajas pese a que las fiestas patrias están dentro de las fechas donde más se compra pirotecnia sin embargo no nos desanimamos y esperamos que para las fiestas decembrinas y fin de año esto pueda repuntar pues seguiremos vendiendo hasta que termine el año” explicó.

Además de la pandemia el comercio de los fuegos artificiales también se ha visto afectado por la compra de pirotecnia de manera clandestina ya que un gran número de personas prefieren consumirles debido a que cuentan con precios más accesibles y se ubican en lugares de mucha concurrencia.

Para 2025 representará 7% de la facturación total de retail en el mercado

Con la llegada de la pandemia y los confinamientos a Colombia las personas se vieron obligadas a volcarse al mundo online para adquirir los diferentes bienes y servicios que acostumbraban a disfrutar de manera presencial. Esa nueva realidad hizo que el comercio electrónico tomara mucha más fuerza en la cotidianidad de los colombianos.

Para 2020 el comercio electrónico creció 53% en Colombia y se espera que hacia 2025 incremente 74% representando 18% del crecimiento total de las ventas en retail del país.

Así lo concluye un estudio realizado por Euromonitor International y que fue desarrollado para Google sobre el futuro del retail en Colombia.

“No es un secreto que la tecnología se aceleró en el último año y medio a nivel global; esta forma permanente en la que los negocios se relacionan con los usuarios y consumidores sumado al cambio del comportamiento de los mismos inclusive en la forma en la que trabajamos ha despertado toda oportunidad de aceleración de la transformación digital; Latinoamérica y Colombia no son ajenos a esta realidad” aseguró Juan Restrepo líder del segmento Retail en Google Colombia.

“El comercio electrónico en el país seguirá siendo una palanca muy importante de cara al futuro y en el corto plazo es un dinamizador súper relevante para la reactivación económica en el país. Colombia tiene una gran oportunidad de fortalecer los eventos de activación de ventas que son puros del comercio electrónico como pueden ser los Cyberlunes Hotsale y BlackFriday” complementó el ejecutivo de Google.

Según el estudio de Euromonitor para 2025 el comercio electrónico alcanzará 7% del total de las ventas de retail en Colombia. Esta es una cifra relevante si se tiene en cuenta que el comercio electrónico solo representó entre 3% y 5% de las ventas totales en Colombia entre 2019 y 2020.

“Con ese crecimiento de 74% que proyectamos entre 2021 y 2025 en el comercio electrónico al final de 2025 7% de la facturación total del país en retail va ir por vía electrónica” precisó Marcos Aramburu gerente de marketing de producto en Google.

Para Daniel Enríquez Delgado fundador y director de Estrategias Impacta estas proyecciones se acomodan a la nueva realidad que trajo el covid-19.

“Antes de la pandemia no eran muchas las empresas que estaban dedicadas a esta actividad y ven ahora en el comercio electrónico una oportunidad; se vieron obligadas a mirar nuevas formas de distribución y entendieron que no es costoso acceder a plataformas electrónicas. La diversificación de plataformas ha llevado a que se aventuren más empresas a participar del e-commerce” comentó.

Del lado del consumidor el estudio reveló que hoy en día buscan omnicanalidad privacidad y personalización en la venta. De hecho el estudio detalló que 79% de los consumidores declaró que su celular es una parte fundamental del proceso y 59% afirmó haber dejado de comprar en un negocio por cuestiones de privacidad.

“El consumidor va a elegir el canal que más le resuelva sus necesidades y que le proteja su privacidad” aseguró Aramburu.

Enríquez Delgado indicó que “el servicio al cliente es un punto clave en procesos de compra sobre todo cuando los compradores están mucho más informados y requieren respuestas rápidas; los empresarios deben ser oportunos y ágiles en los procesos para que el usuario en la menor cantidad de clicks logre el objetivo de su compra”.

LOS CONTRASTES

Juan Restrepo Líder del segmento retail de Google “El comercio electrónico en el país seguirá siendo una palanca muy importante de cara al futuro y en el corto plazo es un dinamizador de la reactivación económica”.

Daniel Enríquez Delgado Fundador y director de Estrategias Impacta “Antes de la pandemia no eran muchas las empresas que estaban dedicadas a esta actividad y ven ahora en el e-commerce una gran oportunidad porque no es costoso acceder a él”.

Pese a esta nueva realidad y a las proyecciones de comercio electrónico el estudio de Euromonitor International especificó que las tiendas físicas no van a desaparecer y por el contrario asumirán un nuevo rol en el mercado.

“Se espera que los puntos empiecen a tomar roles más híbridos pueden ser puntos de prueba o de consulta” agregó Aramburu.

Claves para mejorar ventas en e-commerce

En el estudio de Euromonitor para Google se plantean cinco claves que deben tener en cuenta las empresas o emprendedores para mejorar los procesos de venta en comercio electrónico: respetar la privacidad utilizar insights del consumidor ser ágiles basar decisiones en datos y tener equipos expertos en tecnologías digitales. Para Daniel Enríquez fundador de Estrategias Impacta “lo principal es entender que la tienda online es un negocio más y debe cuidarse como se cuida un punto de venta físico debe abrirse limpiarse actualizarse no se trata solo de abrir una página”."

These phones are now available for pre-order and will ship on August 20th.

New Motorola Droid phone features

The Droid Ultra features a 5 inch 1080p HD display 2130 mAH battery7.2 MM-thin body f2.4 lens and 10-megapixel camera capable of 1080p video. The Droid Maxx features the similar 5 inch 1080p HD display wireless charging capabilities 32 gigabytes of storage and 3500 mAH battery. The Droid Mini features a 4.3 inch HD S AMOLED Display and wireless charging. The full list of specifications for the Droid Mini has yet to be released.

The Verge added “As Motorola said at the event the Ultra’s main selling point is its thinness while the Maxx yet again promises absurdly strong battery life — up to 48 hours. Despite the huge battery the Maxx is still only 8.5mm thin while the Ultra is even smaller at 7.2mm. The Ultra (and presumably the Maxx) feature a 10-megapixel camera with a f2.4 lens and both phones feature the familiar Kevlar backing that Motorola started introducing with the Droid RAZR nearly two years ago. Strangely enough the new phones re-introduce capacitive buttons below the screen rather than using the on-screen buttons found on last year’s models. As for the displays both devices feature 5-inch 720p screens. We’re a little disappointed with the resolution at that size but on the plus side both screens use OLED technology and doesnot include the Pentile sub-pixel arrangement found on previous Droid RAZR devices.”

Motorola’s new phones should create more interest in Android and more competition for Samsung. It should also provide more competition for Apple.

Unions were essential to the initial survival and growth of Occupy Wall Street although the two of them never managed to connect with each other as fully as they should have. I was a participant in Occupy Wall Street starting from the initial planning meetings and continuing with my involvement in the Labor Outreach Committee where I tried to help deepen the alliance between OWS and New York City unions so I had a front-row seat to both the successes and the failures of their collaboration.

An Overlapping Agenda One of Occupy’s central messages was that the richest 1 percent of Americans had perverted American democracy by using their wealth to gain an outsized influence and control over the US political system. Unions were sympathetic to this message because it dovetailed with unions’ entire reason for being: to fight for higher wages and better treatment for workers against their bosses the 1 percent. This shared opposition to the overwhelming power of the rich in American politics motivated unions to defend and help legitimize Occupy although this contribution was never fully appreciated by Occupy’s activists. Labor’s connection to Occupy Wall Street began even before September 17 the day the occupation was launched. CWA workers went on strike against Verizon in August 2011 while the organizers of Occupy were planning OWS. After planning meetings Occupy organizers would visit the CWA picket line at Verizon’s office which was just blocks from Zuccotti Park to show their support for the Verizon workers. Once the occupation launched Verizon workers returned the solidarity by coming to Zuccotti Park and supporting the occupation. Occupy organizers also marched with local fast food workers who were fighting for a $15 hourly wage. This was one of the first of the Fight for 15 campaigns in the US and helped launch this demand into a national movement. The fast food workers also made another equally important contribution to Occupy specifically. One of the chants they used on their marches said “We are the 99 percent” which became the signature slogan of the entire Occupy movement. I don’t know if the fast food workers got this slogan from someone else before them but they seem to be the ones who passed it on to Occupy. That by itself is a huge debt that Occupy owes to the labor movement and specifically to these low-wage workers most of whom were people of color working in the service sector. Unions’ first major support action for Occupy Wall Street came on October 5 2011. Over ten thousand people turned out for a protest in support of Occupy many of them from AFSCME DC 37 TWU 100 PSC-CUNY SEIU 1199 and the UFT. Occupy was less than three weeks old at this point and it was still unclear if it was going to be a flash in the pan or something more lasting. The Foley Square protest helped change that. It indicated that the labor movement a weakened but still crucial player in US politics was prepared to throw its support behind Occupy and that rank-and-file union members saw a commonality between their views and interests and the goals of Occupy. From this time on it became harder for the media and politicians to ignore Occupy’s message. One could argue that Bernie Sanders’s future campaigns for president were born on this day. The second time that unions came to the rescue of OWS was even more dramatic. On October 14 just nine days after the Foley Square protest mayor Michael Bloomberg and the New York police had announced that they would clear Zuccotti Park OWS’s home base in order to clean it. After the cleaning new rules were to be instituted banning people from sleeping in the park or erecting tarps or other large installations. It looked like OWS was about to be eliminated — until Occupy activists who had prepared to nonviolently resist this eviction received a massive infusion of reinforcements in the form of thousands of union members who had received calls to action from their unions in the middle of the night showing up in the wee hours of the morning to resist the expulsion. It looked like OWS was about to be eliminated — until Occupy activists who had prepared to nonviolently resist this eviction received a massive infusion of reinforcements in the form of thousands of union members who had received calls to action from their unions in the middle of the night showing up in the wee hours of the morning to resist the expulsion. The Occupy organizers had planned to allow the park to be cleaned one-third at a time which would allow them to maintain a presence in the park at all times and hopefully ward off a full-scale eviction. But the park was so packed with supporters including many union members that it wasn’t even possible to clear one-third of the park. Luckily the NYPD blinked likely because they didn’t want to anger the city’s powerful unions allowing the occupation to continue. Without this emergency mobilization on the part of the unions Occupy would likely have been smothered in its crib before it could grow to its maximum size. Around this time a Labor Outreach Committee was formed by Occupy activists to coordinate future collaborations with the city’s unions. The committee drew large turnouts typically around forty to seventy people per meeting a mix of young union members and labor supporters from Occupy Wall Street veteran activists who had been organizing in their unions for decades and mid-level union staff sent to represent their unions. The committee tried to connect the idealistic young activists from Occupy with the leadership of the city’s unions but we never really succeeded in finding the magic formula to achieve this. Despite their shared criticism of the 1 percent there was a yawning gulf between the political worldviews and strategies of these two groups.

Labor’s Missed Opportunity Unions and Occupy agreed that the 1 percent had too much power and wealth at the expense of the 99 percent but they diverged on their approach to how to redress this imbalance. The Occupiers saw Democrats and the Republicans as equal partners with the 1 percent in ruling the United States for their own benefit. Occupy wanted to disrupt and transform US politics by breaking out of the two-party system. Occupy activists were never entirely clear about how they wanted to go about doing this but they argued that it would only happen as a result of ordinary people organizing themselves — not through anything that elected officials or the media might do. This was not a view that was shared by most labor unions which continued to offer financial political and electoral support to the Democrats despite the paltry support they received in return leading to tensions between unions and Occupy. For the unions Occupy was an opportunity to promote a union-friendly message of opposition to economic inequality. They didn’t have much interest in or desire to engage with Occupy’s other goals. The disconnect between these two visions is why the alliance between Occupy and the labor movement peaked in early October and largely failed to evolve from there.

The committee drew large turnouts typically around forty to seventy people per meeting a mix of young union members and labor supporters from Occupy veteran activists who had been organizing in their unions for decades and mid-level union staff. The committee struggled with how to connect the idealistic young activists from Occupy with the leadership of the city’s unions. Despite their shared criticism of the 1 percent there was a yawning gulf between the political worldviews and strategies of these two groups. One of the core messages of Occupy was that the two-party system had been completely co-opted by the 1 percent making both the Democrats and the Republicans equal partners with that group that ruled the United States. This was not a view shared by most labor unions which continued to offer financial political and electoral support to the Democrats despite the paltry support they received in return leading to tensions between unions and Occupy. When unions mobilized to support Occupy on October 5 and 14 they did so by sending out a call to their members. This was a form of action that those members were well familiar with as New York City unions periodically call large protests in central public spaces to promote their preferred candidates for political office or some policy position or another. These protests usually followed a familiar and predictable script: Thousands of union members would gather at the prescribed time and location where they would find a large elevated stage surrounded by big speakers and video screens with the whole area enclosed by temporary metal railings courtesy of the NYPD. A procession of union officials Democratic politicians and leaders of nonprofit advocacy groups would speak from the dais. A handful of rank-and-file union members or more junior union officers might be sprinkled in but the overwhelming impression was always of a highly choreographed top-down production. The leadership spoke to the rank and file not the other way around. The rally in Foley Square was in this mode although it was now in support of a different cause: the insurgent Occupy movement. There was a corresponding difference in the tone of this rally with more energy and spontaneity than you would find in a typical union rally. It seemed as though there might be a true meeting of the minds between the union members there and the Occupy activists especially when the protest marched to Zuccotti Park. The potential seemed even more tangible at the anti-cleaning mobilization again at Zuccotti nine days later. But the potential for meaningful collaboration never fully materialized. For the unions Occupy was an opportunity to promote a union-friendly message of opposition to economic inequality. It was essentially a gift basket of free media attention to an issue that the unions cared about. That message was part of what Occupy activists cared about but it left out other key pieces of Occupy’s message and mass appeal. Occupy was equally passionate about changing the business as usual of US politics with a fervent desire to break out of the two-party system. Occupy activists were never entirely clear about how they wanted to go about doing this but one thing they did know was that it would only happen as a result of ordinary people organizing themselves — not through anything that elected officials or the media might do.

The Need to Democratize New York Unions This goal of transforming the US political system through grassroots mobilization and popular democracy was not a vision that was shared by the leaders of New York City’s unions and the disconnect between these two visions is why the alliance between Occupy and the labor movement peaked in early October and largely failed to evolve from there. Like most unions throughout the United States New York’s labor unions operated under a blend of what Jane McAlevey calls an advocacy model and a mobilizing model. Union officers and staff would negotiate contracts for their members; endorse support and lobby Democratic politicians; and offer a range of consumer services to their members. Most unions had relatively anemic spaces for internal democratic debate and decision-making and relatively little space for rank-and-file members to make their voices heard or exercise control over what their unions did. Attempts by union members to adopt a more grassroots approach or to challenge the city’s liberal establishment were typically met with hostility by union leaders. The New York labor movement was not a monolith and there were some notable exceptions to this such as TWU 100 the transit workers union. But as a rule the New York labor movement preferred to entrench itself in city institutions rather than challenge those institutions. Occupy’s approach was different. The whole goal of Occupy was to destabilize existing political institutions. The most beautiful and promising aspect of Occupy was the way that it empowered ordinary people to say things outside of the political consensus. The union leadership had no interest in directly engaging with this kind of activity and may not have even really understood what it was about. They didn’t oppose it; they just stood aside from it. For the labor movement this was a missed opportunity because its political strategy of supporting the Democratic Party and sidelining grassroots organization had resulted in decades of stagnation and defeat. Unions supported Democratic politicians year after year through generous campaign donations and get-out-the-vote efforts but the Democrats did little to halt the ever more aggressive union-busting of corporate America which contributed even more generously than unions to Democratic campaign funds. With few other options on offer unions were stuck in a bind with the Democrats and few in labor had any appetite for trying to get out. Occupy could have helped provide an antidote to this long-term decline by infusing the labor movement with the spirit of democracy and grassroots organizing but this was not a road that union leaders showed any interest in following. Unions’ commitment to supporting Democrats was coupled with a repressive response to reform movements that emerged from their own ranks. Union officials regularly quashed demands from members for more democracy within their unions and more control over how their contracts were bargained largely because these movements threatened their own power. This hostility to rank-and-file movements eroded the long-term sustainability of unions by alienating their most active members and dismissing many of the basic bread-and-butter concerns of their memberships. Occupy could have helped provide an antidote to this long-term decline by infusing the labor movement with the spirit of democracy and grassroots organizing which had the potential to revive sagging union membership and activity but this was not a road that union leaders showed any interest in following."

Generic drugs are considered equal to and interchangeable with one another — and also with the name brand. This gospel has existed since 1984 when a law known as Hatch-Waxman was passed allowing companies to make drugs that had gone off patent without having to replicate the same expensive clinical trials. For the most part all they had to do was prove that the generic was manufactured using good practices and worked in the body in a similar way within an acceptable range.

Hatch-Waxman has been a stunning success. Americans have grown increasingly comfortable with generic medications which now represent 90 percent of the prescriptions that are filled in this country. Their widespread use has translated into trillions of dollars in savings. Politicians and experts agree that any hope we have for affordable universal health care rests on generic drugs.

But in recent years the generic drug supply has been plagued by problems. Whereas name-brand drugs can be so expensive that people can’t afford them generics are often so cheap that companies stop making them or cut corners to turn a profit. Competition for market share at rock-bottom price points has led to chronic shortages unpredictable price-spikes allegations of illegal price-fixing and substandard and even dangerous practices. Production of generics has shifted overseas where it’s harder for the Food and Drug Administration to inspect factories. Major companies have been caught faking and manipulating the data that is supposed to prove that drugs are effective and safe. Probable carcinogens have been discovered in the drug supply. During the pandemic which caused several countries to ban the export of medical supplies a new fear has arisen: that faraway factories might one day cut Americans off from their drugs. Dozens of lifesaving medications are made with ingredients no longer manufactured in the United States.

I got interested in the generic drug supply this summer after I heard that the nation’s largest generic drug factory — the old Mylan plant in Morgantown W.Va. — was slated to close. Its looming closure flew in the face of promises by Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden to encourage more drug production on U.S. soil. The factory workers in Morgantown aided by activists from Our Revolution were pushing for the facility to be declared critical infrastructure essential for national security. “They say they want to shore up domestic production. If that’s true you can’t have a better scenario” Joe Gouzd the president of the factory’s union United Steelworkers Local 8-957 told me. “This is a turnkey facility.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Stocks with game-changing growth potential can grow exponentially in a matter of years but among the many companies aggressively pursuing growth today only a handful seem capable of making it through the stock gyrations and hitting the coveted $1 trillion market capitalization by 2035. After all only five companies have made it to the $1 trillion club so far so unless a company is already growing like a weed and has convincing catalysts ahead to sustain that momentum it's hard to make it that far.

To be able to get your hands on a potential trillion-dollar company early in the game is a dizzyingly tempting idea though so I dug deep into the hundreds of stocks with a market capitalization of more than $100 million to see which ones could go that far. I found four stocks that have a really good chance of making it. Read along.

COVID-19 pandemic is a boon for this stock

Many use Visa (V 0.79%) cards but few are aware of the kind of growth the company can enjoy in coming years.

At the recently held Deutsche Bank Technology Conference Visa's CFO Vasant Prabhu highlighted four structural trends triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic that should power up the company's growth:

Acceleration of cash digitization or the use of digital modes of payment instead of cash.

Booming e-commerce particularly cross-border e-commerce as people are buying things online they traditionally bought in stores like groceries and drugs.

Greater adoption of cashless modes of payment by merchants of all sizes as they realize the importance of going online for survival.

Growth in value-added services like data solutions digital security and CyberSource -- an e-commerce card payments management company owned by Visa.

These are all secular trends that Visa knows how to exploit given its dominance in the payments processing space with 3.6 billion cards issued under its name as of the last quarter.

Management has clear-cut plans to grow shareholder wealth: Capture growing consumer payments and value-add markets through acquisitions and new services pay out 20% to 25% of annual earnings per share in dividends and repurchase shares with remaining cash. Visa's attempt to acquire fintech company Plaid may have fallen through on regulatory concerns but it's a fine example of Visa's hunger for growth.

Visa is already a cash-cow machine thanks to a low-capital high-margin core business and it generates operating margins north of 60%. With the pandemic forcing economies to go cashless and online Visa with its market cap of $492 billion should be able to hit $1 trillion long before 2035.

There's more money to be made from this massive trend than you think

I am going to make my boldest $1 trillion contender pick yet: It's a utility with a market cap of $165 billion.

Yes you read that right but I strongly believe NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%) will become the first utility stock in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club by 2035.

NextEra Energy's stock price has risen more than fivefold in 10 years and even more in dividends which have risen every year for more than 25 years. Now if the company could achieve that kind of growth when renewable energy was still in its nascent stage imagine where it could be once countries start working toward their net-zero emission goals. 137 countries have already committed to these goals mostly by 2050.

Statista projects that the global renewable energy market will cross $1 trillion as early as 2027 up from only $613.8 million in 2020. Projections through 2025 from the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2020 report are even more notable:

By 2025 major oil and gas companies' spending on renewables could grow tenfold.

Renewables could account for 95% of the increase in total global power capacity.

Renewables could make up one-third of the world's total electricity led by hydropower solar and wind.

Now consider this: NextEra Energy's subsidiary Energy Resources is already the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and has a backlog of 16.7 gigawatts (GW) which means near-term growth is already built into its portfolio.

To top that NextEra Energy's Florida Power & Light company is a steady cash-flow machine and its affiliate NextEra Energy Partners a steady source of funds. Then there's the opportunity in green hydrogen which alone could be a $12 trillion market by 2050.

There's another reason why NextEra has me excited: Growth via acquisitions. After its failed bid for Duke Energy I'm sure NextEra Energy is on the lookout for the next big merger or acquisition opportunity which could speed up this top renewable energy growth stock's journey to $1 trillion.

This company is beating the best in its game

Customer relationship management (CRM) has emerged as the fastest-growing software market as a rising number of businesses now understand why digitizing customer management is critical to retain and gain customers in an ever-expanding virtual world. These stunning statistics reveal why Salesforce.com's (CRM 0.55%) market cap could easily grow fourfold to $1 trillion well before 2035:

The global CRM market grew by 6% to $69 billion in 2020 according to Gartner.

Salesforce dominated the market with 19.5% share two percentage points higher than the combined market share of SAP  Oracle  Microsoft MSFT 0.59% ) Adobe  according to Statista.

   according to Statista. While SAP's and Oracle's market shares dropped in 2020 Salesforce's market share grew from 18.4% in 2019 to 19.5%.

Salesforce has more than doubled its revenue in the past three years.

Salesforce predicts revenue to cross $50 billion by 2026 from $21.1 billion in fiscal 2021.

Clearly Salesforce has its pulse on the CRM market like none other. Salesforce uses artificial intelligence extensively and its recent acquisition of business messaging platform Slack could be a potential game-changer as Slack competes directly with Microsoft's Teams platform. Slack added a record net new 13000 paid customers and had 169000 total paid customers as of last quarter including biggies like IBM.

As Salesforce is also already profitable its journey toward a $1 trillion market cap should be easier if it can grow sales as projected.

These industries could explode and so could this stock

Sea Limited's (SE -1.64%) market cap has grown at an astounding pace to $189 billion from only about $4.9 billion in October 2017. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results but Sea Limited's market cap growth so far wasn't a fluke: It was backed by exponential growth in revenues and gross profit. And if Sea Limited can continue to make a splash in the two big markets it's targeting nothing can stop its stock from hitting $1 trillion.

Sea Limited's integrated online platform forms the base of its three core businesses:

Entertainment (gaming): Garena.

E-commerce: Shopee.

Digital financials services: SeaMoney.

Here's how each business is faring:

Garena: Quarterly active users (QAUs) and quarterly paying users (QPUs) hit 725.2 million and 92.2 million respectively in second-quarter 2021. QAUs and QPUs were 402.1 million and 35.7 million as of March 30 2020.

Shopee: Gross merchandise value and orders hit $15 billion and $1.4 billion respectively in Q2 2021 from only $6.2 billion and $0.4 billion as of March 30 2020.

SeaMoney: Mobile wallet payment volumes crossed $4.2 billion in Q2 2021 from only $1.1 billion as of March 30 2020.

If anything at all these numbers indicate Sea Limited's growth potential.

Its flagship game Free Fire beat Tencent's (TCEHY -0.15%) PUBG Mobile to become the world's third-most downloaded mobile game in August 2021. Shopee is already the leading e-commerce company in Southeast Asia and Taiwan and is now expanding into Latin America Europe and even India. SeaMoney is growing beyond mobile payments -- it has already won a banking license in Singapore and recently acquired Indonesia's PT Bank.

Remember though Sea Limited's losses are swelling and that's something that may not sit well with some investors. However Sea Limited is a typical growth stock focused on customer and top-line growth and has successfully monetized Garena to reinvest the cash into e-commerce and financial services beyond Southeast Asia. If you believe in the power of these two businesses Sea Limited could be an enormous winner by 2035.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltbWlncmF0aW9uLmNhL2FtYXpvbi1oaXJlcy0xODAwLXRlY2gtd29ya2Vycy1pbi1jYW5hZGEtdGhhbmtzLXRvLW9wZW4tZG9vci1pbW1pZ3JhdGlvbi1wb2xpY3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Hires 1800 Tech Workers in Canada Thanks To Open-Door Immigration Policy,"Amazon is on a tech worker hiring blitz in Canada in a move largely anticipated by experts who predicted earlier this year that Ottawa’s progressive immigration policies were likely going to lure American tech giants north.

Venture capitalist Chris Albinson the incoming CEO of Communitech saw the writing on the wall in May and warned American policymakers then in an opinion piece in The Globe and Mail.

“As the United States has tightened immigration and become less welcoming Canada has made shrewd policy moves to attract top global talent and capital” wrote Albinson.

“Canada now has six times as many skilled immigrants as a percentage of population as our American neighbours do – a significant stat when you consider half of the founders of America’s tech unicorns (private companies worth $1-billion or more) were born outside the U.S.”

Those are proving to be prophetic words.

Canadian Immigration Policies Fuelling Growth

This week retail giant Amazon announced it will hire 1800 new corporate and tech employees in Canada this year alone to support its AWS Alexa Amazon advertising and retail and operations technology teams in Vancouver and Toronto.

The tech-driven retailer whose business is booming due to pandemic-fueled online shopping already has more than 1500 positions posted on amazon.jobs for:

software development managers;

“Amazon is proud to create good jobs that provide opportunities for employees to develop new skills and grow their careers while innovating on behalf of customers” said Jesse Dougherty Amazon vice-president and Vancouver site lead.

Global Talent Stream Good Way To Get To Canada

There are many pathways for highly-skilled tech workers to gain permanent residency in Canada including the Global Talent Stream (GTS) of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) under which Canadian work permits and visa applications are processed within two weeks.

America is well-known for its historical welcome of people from throughout the world.

There’s even a bronze plaque at the base of the Statue of Liberty in New York that features a quote from a decidedly pro-immigration poem The New Colossus: “Give me your tired your poor Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.”

Trump Clampdown Hampered Recruitment Efforts

Under then-President Donald Trump though the United States clamped down on immigration even as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opened the doors wider for immigrants to come to The Great White North.

A report by polling giant Gallup highlights the difference in immigration policies between the two leaders.

“Until the pandemic forced Canada to slow immigration to a trickle the country was poised to admit more than one million permanent residents between 2019 and 2021 with targets increasing every year” wrote the poll’s authors. “In the U.S. the Trump administration is estimated to have cut legal immigration by almost half since taking office.”

Now the impact of Canada’s more welcoming approach to immigrants is being felt in the country’s booming tech sector.

“From 2013 to 2019 80000 tech jobs were created in the Toronto-Waterloo Corridor alone – more than in San Francisco Seattle and Washington D.C. combined” writes Albinson. “That’s pretty compelling evidence that Canada is winning the hearts and minds of the world’s best and brightest for the first time in a generation.”

Amazon Is Hiring In Canada

Full-time employees at Amazon which is rated the second-best employer on Forbes magazine’s list of World’s Best Employers receive competitive wages as well as medical vision and dental coverage a group RRSP plan stock awards and performance-based bonuses.

Amazon is also committed to providing employees with access to the education and skills training they need to grow their careers offering a variety of company-funded training opportunities to help them transition into higher-paying in-demand careers within the company and beyond.

Among the up-and-comers of the Canadian tech sector who have either just launched or are about to launch initial public offerings are Thinkific Labs Inc. Magnet Forensics Inc. Vendasta Axonify Miovision Dejero Trusscore Vidyard and Intellijoint Surgical.

“The truth as we’ve shown over the past five years is that capital follows talent” wrote Albinson. “Canada had a net gain of 5000 STEM workers in the past 12 months alone and the capital is following.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltbWlncmF0aW9uLmNhL3NvdXRoLWFmcmljYW5zLWxlYWQtd2F5LWluLWdhaW5pbmctcGVybWFuZW50LXJlc2lkZW5jeS10aHJvdWdoLXN0YXJ0LXVwLXZpc2EtcHJvZ3JhbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Africans Lead Way In Gaining Permanent Residency Through Start-Up Visa Program,"South Africans hoping to gain permanent residency in Canada under the Start-Up Visa program are enjoying a level of success that is nothing short of remarkable.

An amazing 90 per cent of South African applicants to Canada’s Start-Up Visa program are accepted far in excess of the average overall acceptance rate of 38 per cent according to Statistics Canada.

That success rate puts South Africa at the top of the list of countries whose applicants are accepted under this program.

Canada remains deeply committed to its relationships with African countries both for humanitarian and economic reasons.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau toured the continent last year. During that trip Trudeau strengthened Canada’s partnerships with countries across Africa and committed to creating economic growth increasing trade and investment promoting democracy advancing gender equality and fighting climate change.

Start-Up Visa: How Canada Beats US On Attracting Immigrant Entrepreneurs

How Much Money Do I Need to Qualify for Canada’s Start-Up Visa?

Canada’s Start-Up Visa Anomaly: Why Paper-Based Applications for NextGen Tech Entrepreneurs Must Change to Online

Canada Wants To Foster Strong Ties With African Countries

“Canada and African countries will continue to work together to find solutions to the global challenges of today and prepare for the ones of tomorrow” said the prime minister in May.

“We cannot defeat COVID-19 unless all countries have the resources to respond to and recover from this crisis. The Government of Canada will keep working with international partners to support an equitable access to COVID-19 tests treatments and vaccines and a strong global economic recovery that benefits everyone including by recognizing the specific needs of African countries.”

Watch

The positive working relationship between Canada and South Africa was further exemplified earlier this year when Mitacs the Canadian non-profit designed to promote research and training programs struck a formal partnership with South Africa’s National Research Foundation.

With that partnership the NRF effectively launched its Industry Partnership Strategy which aims to develop highly-qualified personnel through collaborative training opportunities with industry joint research and collaborative networks with other countries.

The program is the first of its kind in South Africa with a combined investment of $1.26 million over three years.

Mitacs and South Africa’s National Research Foundation Ink Deal

“I am delighted to launch this first agreement between Mitacs and the National Research Foundation” said Dr. John Hepburn Mitacs CEO and scientific director in mid-May.

“We are proud to support the innovation ecosystem by offering a significant opportunity to PhD students and postdoctoral fellows for global mobility between Canada and South Africa” he said. “The connections established through this partnership will advance outcomes for both countries while providing new opportunities for researchers.”

That innovative thinking and entrepreneurial bent is one of the reasons why South African entrepreneurs who apply to Canada’s Start-Up Visa program do so well.

Under the Start-Up Visa program immigrants can get permanent residency in Canada provided their business idea is approved.

Angel Investors Venture Capital Funds and Business Incubators Help Entrepreneurs

The program requires that these budding entrepreneurs gain the support of one of three types of private-sector investors: angel investors venture capital funds or business incubators. A designated venture capital fund must confirm that it is investing at least $200000 into the qualifying business.

Candidates can also qualify with two or more commitments from designated venture capital funds totalling $200000.

A designated angel investor group must invest at least $75000 into the qualifying business – or candidates can qualify with two or more investments from angel investor groups totalling $75000.

Watch

A designated business incubator must accept the applicant into its business incubator program. It is up to the immigrant investor to develop a viable business plan that will meet the due diligence requirements of these government-approved designated entities.

That’s usually done with the help of business consultants in Canada’s start-up ecosystem with oversight from experienced corporate business immigration lawyers who can ensure a start-up’s business concept meets all industry-required terms and conditions.

Candidates applying under the Start-Up Visa program can initially come to Canada on a work permit supported by their designated Canadian investor before their application for permanent residence is finalized.

Ottawa Does Not Provide Financial Assistance to Start-Up Visa Applicants

The basic government-imposed candidate eligibility requirements for the Start-Up Visa program are:

a qualifying business;

a commitment certificate and letter of support from a designated entity;

sufficient unencumbered available and transferable settlement funds to meet settlement funding and;

proficiency in English or French at the minimum Canadian Language Benchmark level 5. However it frequently occurs that higher levels of English are needed to meet due diligence requirements imposed by designated entities

Ottawa does not give financial support to new Start-Up Visa immigrants. When candidates apply they need to show evidence they have the finances to support themselves and their dependents in Canada. This money cannot be borrowed.

Additionally it often occurs that candidates will need to show additional sufficient funding to meet start-up costs of their business project as a condition of investment by a designated entity (VC or Angel).

This is an area where experienced legal consulting will prove invaluable. The amount of settlement funding needed depends on the size of the candidate’s family.

Certainly the Start-Up Visa program is growing in popularity. In 2019 the total number of new permanent resident approved admissions reached 510 more than double the 250 welcomed in 2018. The figures had been increasing steadily over the last five years until the pandemic slowed immigration to Canada to a trickle.

International Students Can Get Fast Permanent Residency Through Start-Up Visa

The Start-Up Visa program also represents an important option for international students many of whom do not qualify for permanent residence through the skilled worker immigration streams. While Ottawa has taken steps to gear up the Express Entry system to favour international students they are by no means guaranteed to qualify for a coveted Invitation to Apply under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).

The minimum score needed to qualify has often been over 470 leaving many students unable to qualify even with the support of a job offer from a Canadian employer. These candidates can either sit in the Express Entry pool and hope the minimum score under the CRS falls or they can make the transition from temporary to permanent residence. This is where the Start-Up Visa program becomes an option.

Unlike almost every other federal and provincial-level entrepreneur program which requires a minimum of one or two years of previous experience either owning a business or in top-level management the Start-Up Visa program does not require previous management experience.

The support of a government-designated entity is enough. And that support can be either financial or in the form of accepting the candidate into a business incubator program. Immigrants who avail themselves of the Start-Up Visa program consistently report that it is quick both for the initial work permit and permit residence application.

Start-Up Visa Application Process Usually Under Six Months

With a viable start-up business project an immigrant entrepreneur can expect it to take about four to six months to secure a commitment certificate or letter of support from a designated entity. Once that letter of support is received the application for permanent residence can be submitted.

It will then take approximately 18-months to finalize the application through to the issuance of a permanent residence visa. For the candidate to qualify for permanent residence:

The intended business must be incorporated and carrying on business in Canada;

The candidate must own at least 10 per cent of the voting rights in the corporation and;

No other person can hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights in the corporation.

As many as five candidates can have their permanent residence application supported by the same business investment. But that can come with a risk. Certain candidates may be designated as essential to the business. If any of the essential candidates withdraw their applications or are refused all other candidates under the same business investment will see their applications terminated.

“Canada has massive potential” states the report published by the start-up ecosystem think tank StartupBlink. “Considering the active approach by an efficient public sector to develop start-up ecosystems and a relative abundance of resources there is no reason Canadian start-up ecosystems should not take an even more substantial role in producing massive global hubs.

“For this to happen there will have to be more Canadian start-ups with global impact.”

Foreign investors looking to create start-ups with such a global impact through Canada’s Start-Up Visa program can take comfort in knowing the country’s many advantages have it ranked in the top five countries in the world yet again this year for start-up ecosystems.

Start-Up Visa: How Canada Beats US On Attracting Immigrant Entrepreneurs

Canada’s Start-Up Visa Anomaly: Why Paper-Based Applications for NextGen Tech Entrepreneurs Must Change to Online

In the 2021 Global Start-up Ecosystem Index Report Canada is again ranked fourth – and boasts more cities in the top 50 than most other countries with only two exceptions: the much larger United States and China.

“Canada is fortunate to have three cities in the top 50 globally with the ecosystem of Montreal increasing three spots to rank 46th globally. Only the U.S. and China have more cities in the top 50 than Canada showing the diversity of the nation’s strong global and regional hubs.”

Market-Oriented Economic System High Standard of Living

In the education technology industry and energy and environmental technology sector Canada ranks even higher in third place globally.

The report is clear. The only thing Canada needs to become an even stronger player on the world stage when it comes to start-ups is to work harder to attract more “high-quality foreign talent.”

Watch

“The market-oriented economic system high standard of living native English language proximity to the U.S. and strong position of the nation’s start-up ecosystems already make the country attractive for foreign talent which means Canada would benefit from focusing on entrepreneur retention” states the report.

Ottawa which is bullish on immigration is working to fill that need for more foreign investors willing to start-up businesses in Canada.

That drive to attract immigrant entrepreneurs and tech talent to Canada is not going unnoticed by other countries vying for the same immigrants.

American business magazine Forbes has gone so far as to warn Washington that Canada is doing a better job of attracting immigrant entrepreneurs and boosting its economy than is the United States.

“While America has tried and failed to pass a start-up visa geared toward immigrant entrepreneurs for years Canada is one of two dozen countries including the U.K. and Singapore that have launched the idea and are now wooing them” wrote Forbes senior editor Amy Feldman earlier this year.

Business Leaders Laud Competitiveness of Start-Up Visa

“Canada’s Start-up Visa program began as a five-year pilot program in 2013 and was made permanent in 2018” she wrote. “Since its launch foreign entrepreneurs representing some 200 start-ups have become permanent residents there.

“Among its success stories: Edtech unicorn ApplyBoard founded by brothers Martin Massi and Meti Basiri who moved from Iran to Canada for school and who now employ more than 500 people.”

Since then Canadian cities have also been recognized as being a better bang for the buck than many of the rest of the world’s metropolises.

Watch

Asset management firm Mercer’s 2021 Cost of Living City Ranking report has shown that even Vancouver Canada’s most expensive city is far below many others throughout the world in 93rd spot in the rankings. New York City by comparison is the 14th most expensive city in the world and Los Angeles the 20th.

Canada’s ongoing affordability and progressive immigration policies put it in good stead to attract a growing share of immigrant entrepreneurs through the Start-Up Visa program.

Start-Up Visa: Permanent Residency for Immigrant Entrepreneurs

Under that program immigrants can get Canadian permanent residence if they qualify as immigrant entrepreneurs.

Three types of private-sector investors are considered: angel investors venture capital funds and business incubators.

A designated venture capital fund must confirm that it is investing at least $200000 into the qualifying business. Candidates can also qualify with two or more commitments from designated venture capital funds totalling $200000.

A designated venture capital fund must confirm that it is investing at least $200000 into the qualifying business. Candidates can also qualify with two or more commitments from designated venture capital funds totalling $200000. A designated angel investor group must invest at least $75000 into the qualifying business. Candidates can also qualify with two or more investments from angel investor groups totalling $75000.

At least 125 part-time employees at Indiana University Health system the largest physicians network in the state have lost their jobs for not complying with Covid-19 vaccination requirements a spokeswoman said Friday.

“Indiana University Health has put the safety and well-being of patients and team members first by requiring employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 1” said Berkley Rios an Indiana University Health spokeswoman.

“After a two-week unpaid suspension period ending Sept. 14 a total of 125 employees the equivalent of 61 full time employees chose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and have left the organization.”

The vacancies “will have a minimal effect on staffing” according to Rios.

IU Health’s website says the system has more than 34000 staff members.

“IU Health has been working to hire for positions in areas where team members have shown non-compliance” Rios said.

More and more private companies across the country are announcing vaccine mandates.

Companies ranging from Disney to Walmart to Google have recently begun mandating their employees get shots to protect against Covid-19.

President Joe Biden last month announced a requirement that all federal employees and on-site contractors be vaccinated or submit to regular testing and mitigation requirements.

Yet here we are decades later and generations of fans are still watching reruns and Mark-Paul Gosselaar (you know him as Zack Morris) is still talking about episodes.

Gosselaar is among guests at Fan Expo Dallas a major pop culture convention at Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center that began Friday and continues through Sunday in downtown Dallas. Gosselaar took part in a Saturday Q&A session and as mentioned above he told those in attendance that he and his cast mates always thought the series was going to end after every season.

“We would say goodbye to each other and that was it. We never thought we would go four seasons with the main show and one season with the college years” Gosselaar said referring to a follow-up series “Saved By the Bell: The College Years. “We would go back to school and that was it.”

“Saved By the Bell” was a staple of Saturday morning TV from 1989 through 1993. Gosselaar is watching episodes for the first time in decades to do prep work for a “Zack Morris is Trash” podcast. Gosselaar makes notes when watching an episode so he and co-host Dashiell Driscoll can dissect and elaborate on what occurred in the episode.

That’s one route for “Saved By the Bell” to remain fresh. Here’s another: A “Saved By the Bell” reboot began streaming on Peacock in November and has been renewed for a 10-episode second season. The reboot features a new class of kids at Bayside High and the return of series originals reprising their original roles including Gosselaar Tiffani Thiessen Elizabeth Berkley Mario Lopez and Lark Voorhies who was a guest star in a season one episode.

Gosselaar said he and his old mates loved playing those characters but how do you bring them back for a reboot with a premise that moves the franchise forward?

“I’m glad that Tracey Wigfield who is the showrunner was able to figure out the best way” Gosselaar said. “I think she did an amazing job and the writers have done an amazing job. ... She cracked the crowd. I’m really proud of the reboot.”

Gosselaar who wants to add to his directing credits said he directed an episode of the rebooted series. Driscoll is among writers on the show.

Gosselaar was asked by a panel moderator if there is anything people shout to him when they see him on the street. Gosselaar said he doesn’t get recognized a lot. He constantly changes his look which he did when was in the casts of recent series “Mixed-ish” and “The Passage.”

“I think the only reason I get recognized is because my wife is a 6-foot blond and it’s one of those things” he said. “Whoa. Who’s the guy with the unicorn? Oh it’s that guy.”

Gosselaar joked that people think he’s James Van Der Beek. Van Der Beek was in a different 1990s TV project (“Dawson’s Creek”) about high school years.

Gosselaar provided an abbreviated version of how he got into the entertainment business. His Indonesian mother and Dutch father had no connection to show business but he was the proverbial cute kid who started doing print work when he was 4. Maybe you saw him in a department store advertisement? He transitioned to television commercials secured a Screen Actors Guild Card when he was 10 and landed his first TV series gig courtesy of a 1986 “Highway to Heaven” appearance. He appeared in a half dozen other series including “Punky Brewster” before being cast in “Good Morning Miss Bliss” the original title for “Saved By the Bell.”

Gosselaar dyed his hair to be Zack Morris. He said you can’t check a box on your driver’s license to identify what color his hair was then because that color doesn’t exist. He based the character on what he gleaned from the alleged cool kids in his school. He said nobody in his high school watched “Saved By the Bell” because it wasn’t their thing. He said they watched “Beverly Hills 90210” because it was the cooler show.

People now tell Gosselaar their high school experiences were nothing like “Saved By the Bell.” His response? “Yeah. It was a TV show.”

It was suggested to Gosselaar by a panel attendee that maybe “Saved By the Bell: The College Years” would have had a longer life if it had aired on Saturday mornings instead of in prime time. No thanks.

“We didn’t get paid very well for being on Saturday morning” he said. “It wasn’t until we went on prime time that we got prime time-ish money. ... It was a substantial amount compared to what we made on Saturday mornings. I don’t think any of us would have wanted to go back to Saturday morning pay.”

Gosselaar said he went through a dry period after the end of “Saved By the Bell: The College Years.” A trio of three-words-in-the-title TV movies (“She Cried No” “Dying to Belong” Born into Exile” got him back in front of viewers’ eyeballs and he has a lengthy list of credits since including a four-season run on “NYPD Blue.”

Gosselaar said he never auditioned for “NYPD Blue.” He was cast in the show after auditioned for “Philly” a Steven Bochco legal drama starring “NYPD Blue” alum Kim Delaney. Gosselaar read for “Philly” even though he knew the role was destined for Tom Everett Scott. Bochco responded by saying nice things and saying he wanted to work with Gosselaar. It was more than a polite rejection. Gosselaar was summoned to the “NYPD Blue” cast by Bochco after Rick Schroeder departed.

Gosselaar was welcomed to the show with a hug and kind words (“whatever you need I am here for you”) from Dennis Franz who won multiple Emmys for his work on “NYPD Blue.” Gosselaar called Franz one of the most genuine people he has ever met.

“It’s not easy working with different personalities on the set” Gosselaar said. “People take it for granted that you get along. Everyone’s different. Sometimes you have good chemistry. You would be surprised at movies that you love or shows that you love and the two stars of the show can’t stand each other but yet they make great television or films. Dennis and I genuinely liked each other. He still is a great friend.”"

The train’s battery-powered electric powertrain can be paired with a traditional diesel engine to reduce fuel consumption by over 11% leading to an 11% reduction in carbon emissions – the equivalent of more than 6200 gallons of diesel fuel saved and approximately 69 tons of CO2 emissions reduced.

Earlier this year the FLXdrive completed a successful trial run in California traveling for three months and 13000 miles (20920 km) between Barstow and Stockton. The California pilot program was part of a $22.6 million grant from the California Air Resource Board awarded to Wabtec BNSF Railway and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District.

The battery-electric locomotive is capable of hauling 430000 pounds (195045 kg). The prototype freight train delivers 22.5 tons of energy capacity (2.4 MWh) from over 20000 lithium-ion battery cells. This allows the FLX prototype to reach speeds around 75 mph (120 km/h) and travel 350 miles (563 km).

In addition to the pilot program Wabtec also announced a collaboration with General Motors (GM) to develop and implement GM’s Ultium battery technology into Wabtec’s freight locomotives. Most recently Wabtec sold its very first FLXdrive electric train to Roy Hill. It will receive the newest version of the FLXdrive battery-electric locomotive in 2023 with an energy capacity of 7 MWh which Wabtec says could reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30% even while hauling several thousand tons of freight in a mile-long train.

Wabtec’s goal is to develop the next generation of zero-emission locomotives. The company has a clear path to power new locomotives – and repower existing locomotives – with batteries hydrogen internal combustion engines and hydrogen fuel cells. It is part of Wabtec’s vision for the rail industry to play a key role in building a clean energy economy and will enable the reduction of up to 300 million tons of global carbon emissions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Beth McGrath’s Facebook video of her unorthodox resignation has gone viral with more than 160000 views and growing.

“Attention Walmart shoppers and associates my name is Beth from electronics” McGrath says over the store’s PA system.

“I’ve been working at Walmart for almost five years and I can say that everyone here is overworked and underpaid” she said.

“The attendance policy is bulls–t. We’re treated from [sic] management and customers poorly every day” she said. “Whenever we have a problem with it we’re told that we’re replaceable.

“I’m tired of the constant gaslighting” McGrath continued. “This company treats their elderly associates like s–t. To Jarred our store manager you’re a pervert. Greta and Kathy shame on you for treating our associates the way you do. I hope you don’t speak to your families the way you speak to us.

“I didn’t record the video for clout I recorded the video for my fellow co-workers … I wanted to be their voice” Beth McGrath says. Facebook

“F–k management and f–k this job” she said. “I quit.”

McGrath posted the video Tuesday and later followed up by thanking Facebook users who responded saying she was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support.

“I never intended for the video to blow up the way it did” she said in a new post. “It’s been an emotional roller coaster for me and I’m just at a loss for words.

But Amazon and Walmart are engaging in a price war for prescriptions. And the drug discount card networks they are leveraging may be well worth your consideration.

Amazon Pharmacy offers six-month supplies of select prescription meds for as low as $6 to Prime members. Meanwhile Walmart+ the retailer’s membership program launched in September 2020 offers medications at zero cost.

How much money can you save? And how do you trigger the discounts? Here’s how to tell if it’s worth side-stepping your insurance plan and buying some meds directly.

How much can you save on prescriptions?

Prescription savings will require membership with either retailer. That’s an annual fee of $119 for Amazon Prime or $98 for Walmart+ plus applicable taxes.

“The Amazon Prime prescription savings benefit saves members up to 80% off generic and 40% off brand name medications when paying without insurance. It is included with the Prime membership at no additional cost” Jacquelyn Miller an Amazon spokesperson said in an email response.

Meanwhile Walmart+ members can get select medications at no cost and “thousands of additional prescription medications” have discounts of up to 85% the retailer said in a press release.

The Walmart program includes the “most commonly prescribed medications” the company said for numerous chronic ailments including heart and mental health conditions diabetes allergies and antibiotics for bacterial infections.

How the Amazon and Walmart drug discounts work

The nation’s two largest retailers aren’t totally disrupting the pharmaceutical industry — yet. The Amazon and Walmart programs are built on the foundation of existing discount card networks Express Scripts’ Inside Rx and MedImpact’s America’s Pharmacy respectively. You may have heard of other companies such as GoodRx and Blink Health which use similar models.

Any of these discount channels can offer savings on meds. However if you have a prescription plan through insurance you’ll also want to consider your deductible.

Do you need to order six-month supplies to get the best price?

Amazon Prime members will find some medications are available starting at $1 per month when ordering six-month supplies. Customers can compare the price per month for 30- or 90-day supplies as well and then compare that to their insurance copay cost.

Walmart+ hasn’t promoted six-month prescriptions and typically offers 30- and 60-day options. You share your digital pharmacy savings card information with a pharmacist who will work with you to compare savings options on varying supplies.

Can you combine the discounts with insurance coverage?

No. The prescription savings cards are not insurance and can’t be combined with insurance. However you can always opt to use the discount programs rather than your insurance if a drug price is less than your copay.

Once you enter the prescription and your insurance information the Amazon service offers an insurance copay lookup tool so you can compare that to the discount price on a particular prescription.

‘Zillow for health care’

Thanks to online services such as Zillow and Autotrader it seems easier to shop for a home or a car than prescriptions.

“We need that for health care” says Mark D. Peters II of Flemington New Jersey a Doctor of Pharmacy and vice president at nonprofit CancerCare.

The reason there is little transparency in the pricing for medications and health care as a whole is a tangled web of providers Peters says.

Pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs — such as Express Scripts OptumRx and CVS Health — are a part of the complicated prescription supply chain. PBMs a bridge between drug manufacturers wholesalers health insurers pharmacies and large employers build a list of approved drugs called a formulary.

“Sometimes not always but sometimes this list of medicines is based on the best deal that they can get from the pharmaceutical company. So the PBMs are making all this money and sometimes they pass it forward to the patient many times they’ve not” Peters says.

Typically drug wholesalers also take a portion of the profit. And a tiny sliver is usually taken by the retail pharmacist.

How to save on prescriptions: shop around

Peters believes the services provided by retailing mammoths Amazon and Walmart are worth exploring.

“When you look at the diseases most people have the chronic conditions like diabetes heart disease hypertension hypercholesterolemia depression — almost all of that can be managed by generics that the Amazons and the Walmarts of the world have.”

Though he offers a caveat: “You have to shop around. Check out the pricing on Amazon and check out the pricing on Walmart just like you would for any product.”

NerdWallet priced some of the most-prescribed drugs in the U.S. comparing the same strength and tablet quantity in 90-day refills on both Amazon and Walmart+. We found a meager difference of just cents on some prescriptions but a more substantial difference of dollars on others.

More proof that it pays to compare prices.

Are these prescription drug discounts better than insurance?

“Insurance and prescription benefit plans vary widely so it’s hard to make an overarching statement about how this compares to insurance” Amazon’s Miller said. “In some cases the price for a medication either before or after savings may be less than an insurance copay.”

In fact Peters has found that to be the case with a prescription of his own. He has a generic drug prescription that costs him a $5 copay through his insurance. But the price without using insurance is even less.

“Shame on you for treating your associates the way you do. I hope you don’t speak to your families the way you speak to us.”

After listing the names of colleagues and expressing her support for them she added: “Walmart doesn’t deserve y’all.”

“F**k management and f**k this job I quit” she concluded.

Ms Mcgrath has gone on to receive a huge amount of support with the post gaining more than 150000 views and 3700 comments at the time of writing.

“You are my hero” reads one.

Another user commented: “Hell yea girl you tell em! Life’s too short to work with a**holes.”

“My f’n hero. Hit me up if you ever need a job in [North Carolina] but for now enjoy that freedom” said a third.

When the video was shared to Twitter people praised her there too:

A day later the former employee shared a follow-up video in which she said she was “so grateful” for the support and donations she has received.

“It’s been an emotional rollercoaster for me and I am just at a loss for words.

“I didn’t record the video for clout. I recorded the video for my fellow co-workers to let them know that I do love them and I do want what’s best for them.

“I wanted to be their voice. I wanted to be my voice” McGrath said.

Rounding off the video and holding back tears she said her advice from this would be “do not be afraid to speak your piece even if it tears you down first”.

It isn’t the first time that a Walmart employee has resigned over the PA system as a video of a worker from Texas doing the same thing went viral in November.

One week from Friday marks the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Walt Disney World Resort. I will be in Orlando for Disney's media event leading up to the kick-off of ""The World's Most Magical Celebration."" To get ready for the big birthday all this week I will be featuring stories from my book about working at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom Stories from a Theme Park Insider. Here is how my Disney career started.

* * *

Less than two miles from the world's most popular theme park and I'm in the middle of nowhere.

Orange groves in every direction as far as I can see. A deep blue sky overhead with no clouds to shade Central Florida's brutal summer sun. The temperature's already well past 90 and so's the humidity even at 9 a.m. I slow my car as the intersection approaches. There's no light no big sign. Just a narrow pole with a street name perched on top. Reams Road. As I turn the wheel to the left a dusty old sedan blasts from the road peeling around the corner to the right speeding off in the direction I'd just come.

A little over a mile down the road I pull up to a set of mobile home-style trailers. “Casting” the sign says with a small hyper-enthusiastic Mickey Mouse painted beside.

Welcome to the back side of Walt Disney World.

My parents had moved to Orlando the previous fall while I was attending Northwestern University north of Chicago. Not having anywhere else to go for the summer I followed them down to Orlando hoping I could find a gig when I arrived.

Northwestern breaks for the summer in mid-June which can make it tough to find a decent summer job. Most of the good ones get snapped up a month earlier by the students who get out in May. But my sister who still was in high school had landed a job in the foods department in the Magic Kingdom so I figured I'd give Disney a shot too.

The fact that I knew only one other employer in town probably influenced that decision too. (If I didn't get the Disney job my plan was to drive over to SeaWorld and try my luck there. Shamu I could have worked for you!)

I'd called Disney for an appointment but they told me to just come on in. So I did walking up to a lady in a sundress who was sitting behind the desk in the cramped trailer. I asked for an application.

Yes here you go. Fill it out please. Take a seat please. We'll call you back for an interview in a few moments thank you.

Twenty minutes later three of us were called into another trailer two young ladies around my age and me.

Since all the workers seems to have had wide grins plastered onto their faces I figured I should put on my chipper happy face too. I walked in with a big smile and tried to be as enthusiastic as I possibly could about any job with the Walt Disney World Resort all the while hoping that I wouldn't get stuck in foods like my little sister. Or worse custodial.

One of the two girls matched my fake enthusiasm smile for smile. We shot each other sarcastic looks whenever the interviewer looked away from us and suppressed giggles as if to say ""I cannot believe we're acting this silly."" But we just ratcheted our enthusiasm up another notch each time the interviewer looked back at us.

The second girl answered her questions politely with a pleasant yet professional expression on her face. No corny smiles. When the interviewer looked away from her she'd shoot the two of us a disapproving schoolmarm glare to silently reproach us for not being professional enough in a job interview. She reminded me of my classmates at Northwestern - the serious ones headed to Europe before starting their lives on Wall Street.

Later I learned that the first girl was a relative of a then-nationally-famous Republican politician so she'd been around political campaigns her entire life. She certainly knew how to turn on the charm. I talked with her again on our first day as “cast members” as Disney calls its employees. We were working the cash registers at the old Mickey's Mart souvenir shop in Tomorrowland.

The second girl? I never saw her again. She didn't get the gig.

Years later a person who's been around the theme park business for years told me about the interview form used by another theme park chain. It contained nothing but six empty checkboxes.

The interviewer would make up whatever questions he or she wanted to ask the applicants. The applicant's answers didn't matter. The interviewer would simply check one of the boxes whenever the applicant smiled.

If the applicant smiled six times before the interview was over he or she got a job. Those who didn't smile enough didn't get hired - no matter what they said where they went to school or where they'd worked before.

So if you've ever thought about working for The Mouse or any other theme park I have just one piece of advice for you.

Smile. A lot.

Oct. 1 2021 is the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World and Saratoga Springs N.Y. has been a significant part of that history since Day One.

In fact the very first thing guests saw when they arrived at the Magic Kingdom in 1971 was a stunning replica of the Saratoga Springs Delaware and Hudson Railroad Station.

Labeled the “Main Street Train Station” the imposing grand Victorian structure is still the primary depot for the Walt Disney World Railroad and the only entrance to the Magic Kingdom. Guests (who arrive either by bus boat or monorail) must pass under the train station to enter the park. First at Disneyland (1955) then at Disney World Walt Disney sought an immersive experience wherein guests become part of the animated and live-action magic he created for them on screen. In both parks the Main Street Train Station serves as the gateway from reality to fantasy. The station blocks excited guests’ views of the world within; guests must be transported literally and figuratively into the “show.”

And of course the most iconic form of transportation in US history is the railroad (it didn’t hurt that Walt and his “Imagineers” were avid train enthusiasts!).

After guests walk through darkened tunnels underneath the train station they emerge into Town Square and onto “Main Street U.S.A.” Only then do they get their first glimpse of the castle and the many adventures that await. Main Street U.S.A. is also connected to Saratoga Springs as the avenue is modeled after northeastern small towns a style Imagineers dubbed “eastern seaboard Victorian” made famous in Saratoga. Main Street serves as a subtle time machine taking guests from the late 19th century into the early 20th.

Town Square is dated 1871 which is the year the Delaware and Hudson Railroad Station opened.

As guests proceed down Main Street they travel forwards in time ending in 1910. The architecture designs and businesses evolve accordingly (impressive details missed by most guests whose eyes are transfixed by the soaring castle).

The 1871 Delaware and Hudson Railroad Station was located right in the middle of downtown Saratoga Springs along Railroad Place between Division Street and Church Street where the Price Chopper and Bow Tie Cinema are today. Built by Cummings & Birt of Troy the station featured a Mansard roof a tower in the center and four towers in each of the corners. Inside was a spacious arcade and beautiful black walnut wainscoting. It replaced a much smaller structure and befitted a resort town on the make. Though Saratoga Springs had been a popular vacation destination since the antebellum era (especially among Southern enslavers eager to escape malarial lowlands and their aggravating human property) it was not until the late 19th century after the construction of the Saratoga Race Course (1863) and the expansion of the railroads that the town began to really grow and flourish.

The Delaware and Hudson Railroad Station was a symbol of that newfound prosperity and its grandness best represented that ornate “eastern seaboard Victorian” that Imagineers sought. Sadly the building burned in 1899 and was quickly replaced by a less decorative depot.

Saratoga Springs is also the inspiration for a major resort at Walt Disney World: Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa. The largest Disney Vacation Club resort it was completed in May 2004 and is located across from the Disney Springs shopping and dining district on the former site of the Disney Institute. The luxury resort is divided into several sections named for familiar Saratoga haunts: Congress Park; The Springs; The Paddock; The Carousel; and The Grandstand. Built by a Massachusetts firm the architecture is loosely based on the Saratoga Victorian style of gingerbread trim pastel colors verandas porches turrets and towers. Interior and exterior decorations all reference Saratoga Springs in one way or another from the “Health History & Horses” motto to Race Course memorabilia to horse statues to red and white awnings.

Moreover the dining and recreational options including The Turf Club Bar & Grill and The Backstretch Pool Bar are named and designed after the Saratoga Race Course.

The resort the train station and Main Street U.S.A. are a testament to the public’s enduring fascination with Saratoga Springs. Disney Imagineers had seemingly endless design options to choose from yet they decided to replicate the look and spirit of Saratoga again and again. The millions of guests who pass through the entrance tunnels ride the Walt Disney World Railroad walk down Main Street and stay at the Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa all get a taste of where many of us call home.

Walt Disney World’s 50th anniversary is reason to celebrate especially if you’re from Saratoga Springs.

David Hewitt a veteran of God of War studio Sony Santa Monica has been named as studio head by Warner Bros.

As revealed by GamesIndustry Warner Bros Games has appointed David Hewitt as the new studio head of Monolith Productions. Hewitt is a veteran of Sony Santa Monica – the studio behind all the major God of War games from the 2005 PS2 original right up to the upcoming God of War: Ragnarok.

Hewitt served there under various titles including director of product development senior managing producer and senior producer. According to his LinkedIn profile in particular he was part of the “small internal leadership group” tasked with rebooting the God of War brand and the entire Santa Monica studio – which resulted in what a lot of PlayStation fans probably think of as the game of the year for 2018.

Monolith released Middle-Earth: Shadow of War in 2017 and other than DLC for the game the studio’s been very quiet about what it’s working on – although it’ll probably feature its patented Nemesis system again.

Welcome aboard David! We're thrilled to have you with us. Let the next adventure begin. https://t.co/IOLylIDy3a — Monolith Productions (@MonolithDev) September 17 2021

As for WB Games Hewitt’s hiring seems to be a further sign that Warner Bros is comfortable keeping its game division following the merger with Discovery. It previously stated that it would not be selling any of its major game studios so despite reports that there was uncertainty regarding WB’s brands – particularly regarding DC fighting game Injustice 3 – hopefully things are fully on track.

As for whether the next release from Monolith will be another Middle-Earth game we’ll gaze into our Palantir and get back to you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC90aWZmLTIwMjEtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zLWRlYWxzLTEyMzQ2NjU1NTQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TIFF 2021 Sales Activity: Where Are the Deals?,"The Toronto Film Festival marked its completion Saturday with an unfortunate milestone: No major acquisitions deals have been announced since the festival kicked off its 10-day run. It was far from a bust: Early awards contenders like Kenneth Branagh’s “Belfast” picked up steam and on-the-ground audiences in Canada reveled in the joy of once again gathering to experience big movies like “Dune.” Nor is the overall film market lukewarm: Deals have been ironed out at a steady clip throughout the year.

It raises the question: Why was nobody buying at Toronto?

There’s certainly not one cause though unsurprisingly COVID is an easy catchall to explain why TIFF was unable to maintain its status as the fall’s most important dealmaking venue this year.

This marked the second year in a row that TIFF was a largely virtual affair with a lineup just one-third the size of the 300-plus it screened in 2019. While Canadians showed up to the TIFF Bell Lightbox the Princess of Wales Theatre and other venues around Toronto attendance by American and international industry members largely tuned in from home.

Here’s a breakdown of some of the things that contributed to a lukewarm acquisitions market at this year’s festival.

Distributors got ahead of the game

TIFF delivered on programming many of the season’s most anticipated movies. But this year the most anticipated films almost all had distribution.

Thirteen of the 15 Gala presentations had long secured distribution before their TIFF debut including People’s Choice winner “Belfast” (acquired by Focus Features in December) and Mia Hansen-Løve’s “Bergman Island” (picked up by IFC Films ahead of its Cannes debut this summer).

Compare that to last year’s Gala slate where six of the nine titles were still up for grabs leading up to the festival. That led Netflix to quickly snap up three movies in quick succession: Halle Berry’s directorial debut “Bruised” the Rosamund Pike satire “I Care a Lot” and “Pieces of a Woman” which would go on to earn Vanessa Kirby her first Oscar nomination.

The good news for distributors is there are plenty of attractive movies available. The Sigourney Weaver adult drama “The Good House” the Penélope Cruz-Antonio Banderas starrer “Official Competition” Lucile Hadžihalilović’s genre film “Earwig” and Barry Levinson’s biopic “The Survivor” are just a few of the titles that earned warm critical reception out of TIFF.

COVID uncertainty made it hard to plan

While the ebbs and flows of the pandemic have begun to feel like normal whether Canada would be open for business remained an open question.

TIFF announced its plans for a hybrid event way back in June giving the agents and buyers plenty of time to organize themselves around the fall festival season. That’s when big titles including Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune” and Edgar Wright’s thriller “Last Night in Soho” were announced. But at that point the Canadian border remained closed to U.S. travelers.

Authorities didn’t reopen the border for fully vaccinated travelers until August 9 just a month ahead of TIFF and a few weeks before the start of the Telluride Film Festival. The final go-ahead may have came too late especially as the hope of a hot vax summer waned amid the reality of the Delta variant and breakthrough cases. (TIFF required either proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test.)

Telluride took center stage

Telluride on the other hand was an in-person festival experience made for the pandemic if there ever was one. Charter flights from Los Angeles (and new for this year New York) along with required proof of vaccination and a negative test result offered even more comfort to the select group of press and industry who attended the notoriously intimate pilgrimage to the Colorado mountains. Organizers announced back in February that it would be not only an in-person event but with an extra day tacked on to the festivities.

Telluride Venice TIFF and NYFF are traditionally compliments to each other in the buildup to sales and awards buzz but this year the industry simply put more of its eggs into the Telluride basket.

As proof look no further than the sales activity out of Telluride: Netflix picked up Robert Greene’s Catholic sex abuse documentary “Procession” and Kino Lorber nabbed Bill Morrison’s “The Village Detective: a song cycle.”

Digital/in-person divide bifurcated the buzz

There is of course no replacing the communal experience that comes from watching a film in person at a festival. But TIFF succeeded last year by making its full slate available online: If the festival was showing it industry members around the world could tune in at the same time for a shared virtual experience. It was a strategy repeated by Sundance in January to banner results for the film market with an opening day that yielded a record-breaking deal for “CODA” and sales for the buzzy documentaries “Flee” and “Summer of Soul.”

But this year’s TIFF was defined by a digital and real-life divide. In-person audiences including Canadians and a smaller-than-usual group of press and industry had access to the full lineup in Toronto while virtual attendees had severely reduced options.

Responding to distributors’ anxieties about showing their wares virtually TIFF allowed rights holders to pass on online screenings. And many did: There was no “Dune” no “Last Night in Soho” no “Spencer” and no “The Eyes of Tammy Faye” for at-home audiences. The result was that sales titles were unable to capitalize on the buzz and excitement of those titles that could have made TIFF screenings nightly required viewing from the start.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9saXZlLW5ld3MvZW1teS1hd2FyZHMtMjAyMS9oX2E5OWY3NWEwMGQwMDdmMjAzYzQ1ZDU2MzY4ODcwOTg50gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9saXZlLW5ld3MvZW1teS1hd2FyZHMtMjAyMS9pbmRleC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 2021 Emmy Awards: Live updates,"""Ted Lasso"" (Colin Hutton/AppleTV+)

Somebody has to sort it bag it and take it out to the street.

There is no “away” as in to “throw away.” As every household chore manager knows to throw away does not mean in the waste basket or just the garbage can. Somebody has to sort it bag it and take it out to the street.

And still it has not gone “away.” Not everyone has street pick-up. Rural folks drive their garbage to landfills and recycling centres. That waste is transferred to Whitehorse by truck and some of the reusable and recyclable waste is shipped south.

It’s a complicated and expensive system to manage. Politicians are feeling the heat about their proposed closures in Keno City Silver City Braeburn and Johnson’s Crossing.

“At this stage nobody’s paying the full cost of garbage production” said Richard Mostyn Yukon’s minister of community services. “They are paying a portion of the cost but they get to know how much it is costing the territorial government and municipalities to deal with garbage.”

According to the 2018 Ministerial Advisory Committee’s Report on Solid Waste there are 27 waste management facilities that serve the residential Yukon population. These 27 facilities are operated by two government departments eight municipalities and are permitted by Environment Yukon. Highways and Public Works is responsible for three and Community Services operates 11 community landfills and five transfer stations.

Not included in the report are the industrial/mine permits issued to mining operations in the territory. Environment has an agreement with the ‘compliance monitoring and inspections’ branch within Energy Mines and Resources to inspect permitted commercial dumps that are associated with mines. The environmental health branch in the department of Health and Social Services permits sewage disposal sites.

The streamlining standardization and rationalization of costs has been on the government agenda for many years. Higher standards better processes expectations of diversion ever-increasing quantities of waste and climate change urgencies are all adding to the pressure to do something.

The president of AYC Gord Curran said “Some of the considerations were the need to manage better environmental risk operate using clear standards and have comparable user fees at all municipal and YG sites. This meant that all sites needed attendants gates and potentially infrastructure upgrades. As a result the potential for closing smaller facilities within a reasonable distance from regional facilities was discussed as part of the rationalization of services but mainly by YG since they operated the smaller sites.”

Curran continued “Municipalities never dictated or advocated that they should be closed. However I distinctly remember advocating to YG that the communities affected by the closures need to be consulted about the changes.”

Mostyn maintains that both he and his predecessor minister and colleague John Streicker have been engaged and listened to community voices on multiple occasions. For politicians it has not been easy while residents don’t feel heard. Residents have suggestions and ideas to help make things more workable.

“I have no doubt that the elderly will find ways to carpool and work together and really build community around this as well” Mostyn said. “I mean this is about innovation. I have every confidence in their ability to innovate and come up with solutions to this new way of dealing with our waste in the territory making for a cleaner better territory.”

Perhaps other solutions will be generated next week when Mostyn travels north on the Alaska Highway to meet with residents affected by the proposed closure at Silver City.

The total operational costs for all 27 locations came in around $3 million not including transportation recycling and composting. Including these other costs brings the total figure to the report’s stated $10.5 million in 2018 at least $11 million now.

“Simply it is not sustainable” Mostyn continued. “So if you produce garbage you will pay a portion. Twenty per cent of the cost of dealing with that garbage is going to be paid by the person producing it.”

But this deal is not done yet. The Yukon government still needs to reach agreements with municipal landfills. The release reads “As these agreements are reached the Government of Yukon will close down the smallest most expensive (per capita) transfer stations and concentrate savings into regional landfills.”

These new regional agreements between YG and municipalities are in the works. Officials with Mayo Haines Junction and Teslin confirmed that the agreements are just being negotiated now. Dawson Whitehorse and Watson Lake already have agreements to accept waste from outside their boundaries.

There is a shortage of data on waste volume and weight that is handled in the system. Scales might be needed and databases developed to track and cost. Tipping fees seem to have been accepted at Marsh Mount Lorne Tagish and Carcross for over a year now. The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) with industry is being fast-tracked in Environment as part of Our Clean Future.

These sometimes contentious principles of garbage and producer pay and whether or not rural service delivery expectations are realistic and affordable and who incurs tourist burden — all come dangerously close to the elephant in the room. A councillor who declined to be identified whispered that it has been many decades since a rural property tax increase has happened in the territory. Questions of what is fair varies by the beholder.

Achieving parity is problematic. Communities don’t want to be held to a higher standard than industrial mine sites and the Yukon Conservation Society (YCS) is concerned about that as well. It is a problem of bad actors.

Lewis Rifkind of YCS wrote in an email that “any large industrial operation generates large amounts of waste is of concern (think antifreeze alone) and it all has to be disposed of properly. The responsible companies do a good job it’s the irresponsible ones that YCS gets worried about. We’re utterly dependent on the mining inspectors to monitor and control this.”

Mike Bailey the operator of the Mount Lorne Community Transfer station with 30 years of experience in solid waste would like to see investment in innovative infrastructure and have the federal government phase out or ban the production of the plastics that resist recycling (specifically numbers 6 and 7) like happened with chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s) in the eighties.

People with different kinds of experience like Bailey and Rifkind were not on the Ministerial Advisory Committee nor was anyone from an unincorporated community.

It’s a problem of smallness remoteness and fair attribution of the benefits and burdens of a political society and the need for compromise between efficiencies and flexibility.

Somebody has to take out the garbage.

Project goals were to establish a new stand of Atlantic white cedar on 22 acres along the Factory Branch in Double Trouble State Park and to identify and create a defensible buffer for the newly established and existing Atlantic white cedar utilizing fire and fuel breaks in the adjacent high hazard forest fuels.

Activities included repairing the main access road to the north side of Factory Branch 17 acres of fire break installation and enhancements improving access to the restoration site aerial herbicide application to control hardwood tree and shrub competition in August of 2012 and obtaining privately held property for a second point of access for safe prescribed burning and fire suppression in the upland forest north of the Factory Branch.

Fire mitigation strategies also included the protection of homes located along Carriage Way Carriage Road Penhook Road and Lacey Road.

There has been a five-fold increase in the amount of clothing Americans buy over the last three decades but each item is worn only an average of seven times according to reports. This has resulted in more discarded clothing than ever.

Many Americans donate their used clothing to charities when they are finished with it under the assumption that it will be reused. But with the increasing amount of items being discarded and the poorer quality of fast fashion less and less can be resold and millions of garments are put into bales and shipped abroad every year.

""Whatever they cannot sell in their thrift stores gets sold off into the 'salvage' market"" Liz Ricketts co-founder and director of the OR Foundation told CBS News.

""It's a long and complicated supply chain that is completely invisible to not only the average person but even to people participating"" Rickets said.

""The U.S. is the biggest culprit""

At Ghana's Kamanto market around 15 million items of used clothing from Western countries arrive every week. The entire population of Ghana is only 30 million.

""The whole fast fashion model is built around… building cheap clothing and the U.S. is the biggest culprit exporting more second-hand clothing than any other country on earth"" Samuel Oteng a fashion designer and project manager at the Or Foundation told CBS News.

Trucks offload bales of textiles — called Obroni Wawu or ""Dead White Man's Clothes"" — at the market which is a seven-acre maze of over 5000 stalls. The bales are purchased by market traders — who do not know ahead of time what's in them — for between 25 and 500 dollars each They then clean tailor and re-dye what they can of the clothing to give it new life.

CBS News

But Oteng says upcycling is becoming increasingly difficult because of the poor quality of fast fashion garments.

""Before they used to have good quality clothes but now there's a lot of trash"" he said. ""I feel like waste is being built into the model of fast fashion: Overproduce overproduce overproduce. In the end people wear clothes for just like two weeks and then just discard them. The waste doesn't end up in America. Ultimately it ends up here in Kantamanto.""

""Do not hide under the guise of donations""

The upcycling work of traders at Katamanto is not enough to reduce the glut of clothing created by America's addiction to fast fashion. It is estimated that 40 percent of all the clothing bales sent to Ghana end up in landfills.

And some of the unsold clothing washes out to beaches when it rains creating massive tangled webs called ""tentacles"" in the sand.

CBS News

The director of waste management for the Accra Metropolitan Assembly Solomon Noi delivered a message to the U.S.: ""Deal with it.""

""Do not hide under the guise of donations of secondhand clothing and then you ship them over to us just to cause problems to us"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5b25saW5lLmNvbS9zaW5nYXBvcmUvbmV3LWNvdmlkLTE5LWNhc2VzLXNlcHQtMTgtMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Covid-19: 1004 new locally transmitted cases; clusters found at Pfizer Asia Pacific and waste-management firm,"Singapore registered 1009 new Covid-19 cases on Sept 18

Of these 1004 were locally transmitted and five were imported

Pharmaceutical firm Pfizer Asia Pacific and waste-management company NSL OilChem were added to a list of active clusters being tracked

There has been an uptick in patients with serious illness and under intensive care compared with Sept 17

SINGAPORE — Singapore on Saturday (Sept 18) recorded 1004 new locally transmitted cases of Covid-19 with pharmaceutical company Pfizer Asia Pacific and an industrial waste-management firm added to a list of active clusters under close monitoring.

Including five imported cases there were 1009 new coronavirus infections reported here the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its daily update on the coronavirus situation.

This is the highest single-day tally since April 23 last year when there were 1037 cases. That was during the circuit breaker which halted almost all social and economic activities to contain the spread of Covid-19.

In recent weeks the national Covid-19 task force has been warning that daily infections would likely cross 1000 with Health Minister Ong Ye Kung saying most recently on Friday that this could happen soon.

MOH said that the cluster at Pfizer Asia Pacific which is not involved in vaccine production has 22 cases after seven were added.

The cluster at NSL OilChem an industrial waste-management company has 27 infections after 21 were added to it.

Meanwhile compared with Friday there were 15 more patients needing oxygen help to breathe and four more cases under intensive care.

MOH said that some public hospitals here have been facing a surge in patients rushing to their emergency departments with mild symptoms of acute respiratory infections.

“We urge those who have mild symptoms to avoid seeking treatment at the hospitals and instead consult a general practitioner at a Swab and Send Home clinic.”

Doctors at these clinics can assess their symptoms and perform Covid-19 tests to confirm their infections.

Visiting these doctors instead of hospitals will free up hospital capacity for those who truly need hospital care MOH added.

Of the 1004 new locally transmitted cases 926 were in the community and 78 were migrant workers in dormitories. Among the cases were 259 seniors above the age of 60.

Four of the five imported cases developed the infection while in isolation and the remaining one was detected on arrival here.

In all Singapore has recorded 76792 coronavirus cases since the pandemic struck.

CLUSTERS UNDER CLOSE MONITORING

MOH said that it was closely monitoring 10 large clusters two fewer than the day before.

Giving details of the new cluster at Pfizer Asia Pacific it said that transmission took place in the workplace and there was no evidence of spread beyond the worksite.

Of the 22 cases 20 are staff members and two are cleaners.

As for the cluster at NSL OilChem transmission there also happened in the workplace but there has been further spread to household contacts.

Of the 27 cases 25 are staff members and two are household contacts.

SERIOUSLY ILL

As of Saturday there were 863 Covid-19 cases who are hospitalised up from 813 the day before.

“Most are well and under observation” MOH said.

There are now 105 seriously ill patients needing oxygen support to help them breathe 15 more than the day before.

There are 18 patients in critical condition under intensive care four more than the day before.

Of those who have fallen very ill 100 are seniors older than 60.

Over the last 28 days the proportion of local cases who had no or mild symptoms is 98.1 per cent MOH said.

In that period 177 cases needed oxygen support and 18 were under intensive care. All four patients who died from the disease were not fully vaccinated.

MOH on Saturday recorded Singapore’s 60th Covid-19 death after an unvaccinated 90-year-old man died from complications due to the disease.

VACCINATIONS

As of Friday 82 per cent of the population have completed their full immunisation regimen or received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine and 84 per cent have received at least one dose.

A total of 8922035 doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered under the national vaccination programme which includes the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Moderna jabs. These doses cover 4571939 persons.

In all 4444525 people have completed their full vaccination regimen.

For other vaccines recognised under the World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing such as China’s Sinovac jab 182716 doses have been administered covering 86968 persons."

Their decade-long efforts resulted in a new study that confirms the species as an endangered pygmy blue whale — an animal last recorded in Philippine waters in the 19th century.

Researchers call the pygmy blue whale “Bughaw” a Filipino word for the color blue.

They say Bughaw’s presence could help establish Philippine waters as part of the extended migration path of the Indo-Australian population of pygmy blue whales.

A solitary whale frequently spotted in the Bohol Sea in the southern Philippines has long had a nickname: Bughaw or “blue.” Now thanks to recently published research the whale also has a confirmed species and subspecies knowledge that could shift understanding about the distribution of whale populations throughout the southern Pacific.

True to his name Bughaw is a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) a species that until recently experts thought did not venture into Philippine waters. Given the whale’s location and relatively small size estimated at 19-22 meters (62-72 feet) he has been identified as a pygmy blue whale (B. m. brevicauda) a different subspecies from the true blue whale (B. m. musculus) which can grow up to 30 m (98 ft).

No blue whale sightings were reported in the Philippines between 1870 and 2004. The first time was when a mother and calf were spotted by a TV crew in the Bohol Sea. The pair were initially identified as Bryde’s whales (B. edeni) a species known to visit the area. Since then there have been 33 documented blue whale sightings in the Philippines all in the Bohol Sea.

The Bohol Sea north of the Philippines’ southernmost island of Mindanao is considered one of the country’s important marine mammal areas (IMMAs). It’s also a key marine biodiversity area. Jo Marie Acebes co-author of the study recently published in the Journal of Threatened Taxa says the proper identification of Bughaw highlights the need to properly manage this region which is threatened by unsustainable fishing practices. She says managing “commercial fisheries is just one part of it but is a really significant one not just for the whales but for the coastal communities who depend on marine resources.”

Bughaw has a semicircular indentation on the left side of his dorsal fin which in blue whales is relatively small and positioned far back on the body. His tail has notches both on the left and right tips; the left side of his body has identical blotches. Blue whales in general have a large broad U-shaped head; a prominent fishy ridge; and project a tall dense broad blow.

There are four recognized bluewhale subspecies: B. m. musculus which inhabits the North Atlantic and North Pacific; B. m. intermedia in Antarctic waters; B. m. brevicauda (the pygmy blue whale) in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean; and B. m. indica in the northern Indian Ocean. These subspecies are acoustically separated into 10 distinct populations.

The Philippines lies near the areas where B. m. brevicauda B. m. indica and B. m. musculus are known to range the study notes. The timing of the blue whale sightings in the Philippines from January to June narrows down the identification further suggesting Bughaw is a pygmy blue whale. The Indo-Australian population of B. m. brevicauda is known to migrate west during this period passing Australia Timor-Leste and Indonesia where it ends its migration by June. Finding Bughaw within the Bohol Sea north of Indonesia means the Philippines and particularly the Bohol Sea may be an extension of the northern migration path of the Indo-Australian population the study says.

The Bohol Sea could be a feeding ground for blue whales according to the study. The sea’s distinctive underwater topography as well as its connections with deep basins (the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Sulu Sea in the west) contribute to productivity of marine life in the area. Its relatively short continental shelf — the shallow sun-kissed seabed that runs from the shoreline until it drops off into deeper waters — makes it more of a pelagic or open ocean zone than a coastal one.

These conditions coupled with water movements cause upwelling a process in which cold water rises from the deep bringing to the surface nutrients that makes the area an ideal fishing ground Acebes says. The time when the blue whales arrive in the area coincides with “months of high productivity” the study notes.

While Bughaw has been spotted in various spots around the region researchers say there’s a need to conduct more studies to confirm whether the Bohol Sea is also a breeding ground for the species.

Researchers say their combined survey efforts are insufficient to identify blue whale movements and habitat use in the Philippines since those surveys are done in different months. So far they have covered 2092 square kilometers (808 square miles) of the northern Bohol Sea with another 29000 km2 (11200 mi2) left to survey.

“It is very important to keep searching and the more people looking out at sea the better” Acebes says. Her group has been collaborating with three others for more than a decade. “By pooling together our survey effort and data we were able to get a better idea of the extent of where the blue whale was found and more importantly we were able to do a photo ID of Bughaw.”

Red circles are sightings from research surveys while green crosses are from reported sightings. Image courtesy of Jo Marie Acebes/BALYENA.ORG.

Acebes says five of their encounters with the blue whale happened because local contacts informed them of sightings which prompted them to look for the whale.

“After years of wondering if that encounter in 2010 during their vessel-based survey was just a fluke (pun intended) it is good to finally confirm that the species is found in our country’s waters” Acebes says adding that the next step will be to find a way to confirm the discovery through genetic sampling and analysis.

Ultimately the researchers say further acoustic studies matched with photo-identification techniques can help catalog the blue whales of the Philippines which in turn will have implications for both the conservation of this endangered species and its migration routes.

A $100 million loan on Donald Trump's Fifth Avenue tower has reportedly been placed on a watch list.

Bloomberg reported that the decision was due to ""lower average occupancy.""

Wells Fargo said occupancy fell to 78.9% from 85.9% at the end of 2020.

A $100 million loan on Donald Trump's Fifth Avenue tower has been placed on a debt watch list according to data from banking giant Wells Fargo.

Bloomberg first reported the story on Friday noting that the decision was a result of ""lower average occupancy.""

Wells Fargo which is the master servicer of the loan said occupancy has dipped to 78.9% from 85.9% at the end of 2020 according to the outlet.

The building's real estate income was $33.7 million in 2020 and $7.5 million in the first quarter of this year according to loan documents Bloomberg noted.

The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Insider's Kelsey Vlamis previously reported other financial challenges at Trump Tower.

Recently multiple tenants fell behind on rent. The Trump Organization sued the maker of Ivanka Trump's shoe line earlier this year for $1.5 million in unpaid rent according to reports.

Some of Trump's properties elsewhere in the US have also been facing scrutiny. The former president's property tax was slashed for his Chicago office tower because the building's commercial space was mostly vacant The Chicago Sun-Times first reported.

That building's retail space had its assessed value cut to $12.5 million down from $19.9 million Insider's Kevin Shalvey reported. The assessed value was cut by about 37% because about 95% of the square footage was vacant the report said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxseXZvaWNlLmNvbS93ZWxscy1mYXJnby1jZW50ZXItcGFya2luZy1sb3RzLWNhc2gtZWFnbGVzLXRlbXBsZS1mb290YmFsbC_SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5waGlsbHl2b2ljZS5jb20vd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tY2VudGVyLXBhcmtpbmctbG90cy1jYXNoLWVhZ2xlcy10ZW1wbGUtZm9vdGJhbGwvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wells Fargo Center parking lots will no longer accept cash,"Cash will no longer be accepted at the Wells Fargo Center parking lots starting this weekend.

A California prison guard was arrested for allegedly racially abusing and attacking a Wells Fargo bank manager who told him to wear a mask in the building.

James Allen Jones Jr. 50 of Grover Beach California was arrested on suspicion on Tuesday following a 10-day investigation for the September 3 attack on the victim.

The Grover Beach Police Department obtained warrants to search his home and property and arrested him at his job California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo on suspicion of committing a hate crime making criminal threats and battery with serious bodily injury.

The bank manager told the San Luis Obispo Tribune that a customer became upset when he asked the man to put on a mask as required by local health orders called him a racist slur and caused a commotion in the lobby.

Later that evening the manager said the man showed up in the parking lot in the central California city of Grover Beach and fought with him. The man fled before police arrived.

The department launched the investigation after articles of Jones's clothing were found at the scene.

Grover Beach Police Chief John Peters said investigators identified Jones as the suspect after interviewing witnesses and gathering surveillance video and still photos of him.

'Hateful speech violent behavior racism bigotry and prejudice of all forms are not acceptable and they have no place in our society"" Peters said in a news release.

'The city of Grover Beach is committed to fostering a collaborative safe and culturally diverse environment for its residents workers business owners and tourists.'

Peters said police will present their case and ask San Luis Obispo County prosecutors to file charges next week. Jones was released from custody after posting $50000 bail.

'Hate crime investigations are sensitive cases that are taken very seriously by the Police Department and the department takes caution in releasing information' the department said.

'Our officers and investigators spent several days following up on many leads conducting numerous interviews of witnesses conducted multiple follow-up interviews with the victim collected several articles of evidence and ultimately identified a suspect that was not known during the preliminary stages of the investigation.

'In this case the distribution of preliminary information could have negatively impacted our investigative efforts and could have resulted in inaccurate witness statements the loss of physical evidence and the suspect evading capture.'

Jones a 27-year employee is on administrative leave pending the outcome of his case and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is cooperating with the investigation spokeswoman Vicky Waters said. She would not specify if he is on paid or unpaid time off.

'The details of this incident are deplorable and CDCR does not tolerate this type of behavior on or off duty"" Waters said.

'This does not represent our department nor the standards and expectations we have of our staff.'

It's not known whether Jones has an attorney who can speak on his behalf.

It's one of several instances of violence or threats that have been reported nationwide by workers trying to enforce COVID-19 restrictions at businesses schools and elsewhere.

In August a man was stabbed and a radio reporter were attacked during an anti-vaccine protest that occurred in Los Angeles.

The fighting started around 2pm on August 14 after anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers - many of whom are affiliated with the Proud Boys - clashed with counter-protesters from Antifa outside the Los Angeles City Hall and Police Department - as the city reimposes stricter mandates because of rising COVID cases.

Anti-vaxxers held the rally dubbed the 'Choose Freedom March' to protest against what they described as 'medical tyranny' of mandatory vaccinations and vaccine passports.

They were confronted by a counter-protest - calling itself 'No Safe Space for Fascists'.

Both sides were seen in videos lining up in the street with fists raised and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Both sides threw punches and wrestled to the ground.

Prison shank-like weapons and knifes were allegedly used to stab people on both sides.

Bloody chaos unfolded after the anti-vaxxers harassed the skateboarders in front of what appeared to be dozens of police officers who didn't immediately stop the fight.

It took three minutes for the police to get involved after the fight broke out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZ3cnguY29tLzY2MDk5OS9tYXZlcmljay1tY25lYWx5LXdoYXRzLWluLXRoZS1iYWctd2l0Yi0yMDIxLXNlcHRlbWJlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maverick McNealy WITB 2021 (September) – GolfWRX,"Driver: TaylorMade Qi10 (8 degrees @8.25) Buy here.

Generic drugs are considered equal to and interchangeable with one another — and also with the name brand. This gospel has existed since 1984 when a law known as Hatch-Waxman was passed allowing companies to make drugs that had gone off patent without having to replicate the same expensive clinical trials. For the most part all they had to do was prove that the generic was manufactured using good practices and worked in the body in a similar way within an acceptable range.

Hatch-Waxman has been a stunning success. Americans have grown increasingly comfortable with generic medications which now represent 90 percent of the prescriptions that are filled in this country. Their widespread use has translated into trillions of dollars in savings. Politicians and experts agree that any hope we have for affordable universal health care rests on generic drugs.

But in recent years the generic drug supply has been plagued by problems. Whereas name-brand drugs can be so expensive that people can’t afford them generics are often so cheap that companies stop making them or cut corners to turn a profit. Competition for market share at rock-bottom price points has led to chronic shortages unpredictable price-spikes allegations of illegal price-fixing and substandard and even dangerous practices. Production of generics has shifted overseas where it’s harder for the Food and Drug Administration to inspect factories. Major companies have been caught faking and manipulating the data that is supposed to prove that drugs are effective and safe. Probable carcinogens have been discovered in the drug supply. During the pandemic which caused several countries to ban the export of medical supplies a new fear has arisen: that faraway factories might one day cut Americans off from their drugs. Dozens of lifesaving medications are made with ingredients no longer manufactured in the United States.

I got interested in the generic drug supply this summer after I heard that the nation’s largest generic drug factory — the old Mylan plant in Morgantown W.Va. — was slated to close. Its looming closure flew in the face of promises by Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden to encourage more drug production on U.S. soil. The factory workers in Morgantown aided by activists from Our Revolution were pushing for the facility to be declared critical infrastructure essential for national security. “They say they want to shore up domestic production. If that’s true you can’t have a better scenario” Joe Gouzd the president of the factory’s union United Steelworkers Local 8-957 told me. “This is a turnkey facility.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maWVyY2VwaGFybWEuY29tL3BoYXJtYS9tYXNzaXZlLXR1bW9yLXByb2dyZXNzaW9uLWVkZ2UtYXN0cmF6ZW5lY2EtYW5kLWRhaWljaGktcy1lbmhlcnR1LXNob3dzLXJvY2hlLXMta2FkY3lsYS13aG8tc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ESMO: With massive tumor progression edge AstraZeneca-Daiichi's Enhertu shows Roche's Kadcyla who's the better ...,"Pharma watchers have always suspected that AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo’s Enhertu is a better HER2 therapy than Roche’s Kadcyla. But guessing is all they could do without a head-to-head trial to show just how different the two antibody-drug conjugates are.

Enhertu slashed the risk of disease progression or death by a massive 71.6% over Kadcyla in second-line HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients previously treated with Roche’s Herceptin and chemo AstraZeneca and Daiichi reported at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2021 virtual meeting.

The showing is so impressive that the study authors concluded that the study dubbed Destiny-Breast03 will lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Jefferies analysts recently pegged Enhertu’s peak sales in the second-line setting at $500 million.

Enhertu showed superior benefits on several fronts in the trial. The median time to disease progression or death was not reached for Enhertu and 6.8 months for Kadcyla according to a blinded independent review which led to the above 71.6% progression-free survival edge. By investigator’s analysis the median time to progression or death was 25.1 months for Enhertu versus 7.2 months for Kadcyla and there was a risk reduction of 73.5%.

Kadcyla appeared to show an inferior efficacy profile compared with its historical clinical results. In its own phase 3 Emilia trial among second-line patients Kadcyla recorded a progression-free survival of 9.6 months.

Kadcyla did seem to have underperformed in some patients Dave Fredrickson AstraZeneca’s head of oncology business unit acknowledged in an interview but he pointed out that the Emilia trial was run at a time when Roche’s Perjeta wasn’t approved for the postsurgery treatment of patients with early breast cancer. So those patients didn’t have the big upfront impact from early treatment with Perjeta. In the post-Perjeta as adjuvant era Kadcyla’s performance is largely in line with real-world experience he said.

In Destiny-Breast03 Enhertu also more than doubled the number of patients who responded to treatment as the AZ-Daiichi med shrunk tumors in about 8 of 10 its patients while the rate for Kadcyla was just a little over one third.

“The investigators that we talked to start talking about maybe we’re opening up the possibility for some women that a cure could be possible in advance disease” Fredrickson said.

The life extension data remain immature; Enhertu cut the risk of death by 44.5% at the interim analysis though it hasn’t met the statistical significance bar. The estimated 12-month survival rate was 94.1% for Enhertu versus 85.9% for Kadcyla.

Decreasing interstitial lung disease rate 'very encouraging'

Beyond the unquestionable efficacy win industry watchers have been keeping a close eye on the potentially dangerous side effect of interstitial lung disease (ILD) which has appeared at higher rates in drugs developed with Daiichi’s antibody-drug conjugate technology. Doctors often cite the safety signal as a key reason why they aren’t already prescribing Enhertu in the FDA-approved third-line breast cancer setting.

Here Fredrickson described Enhertu’s safety profile as “very encouraging.” ILD turned up in 10.5% of Enhertu patients none in the severe grade 4 or 5 groups. For Kadcyla the problem occurred in 1.9% of patients all belonging to grade 1 or 2. Previously the Destiny-Breast01 trial in late-line disease linked Enhertu to a 13.6% ILD rate including 2.2% of deaths.

RELATED: AstraZeneca Daiichi Sankyo launch Enhertu head-to-head trial with eyes on a new breast cancer standard

Lower overall ILD rate and no patient deaths are improvements for Enhertu but two breast cancer experts had previously told SVB Leerink that Enhertu’s ILD rate needs to come in along the lines of 5% to significantly penetrate the front- or second-line breast cancer settings.

Fredrickson argued that physicians are mainly focused on grade 4 or 5 ILD event because “there is an acceptance that grade 1/ 2 ILD is something that is manageable.” AZ has invested in awareness monitoring and management of ILD he added and the rates in the real-world appear to be “much lower” as a result of those efforts.

AZ and Daiichi have recently moved Enhertu into a front-line HER2-positive breast cancer trial and are exploring the ADC in a range of disease areas. These include the Destiny-Breast 04 trial in second-line HER2-low breast cancer which expects to read out in the first half of 2022.

Adding new stomach cancer lung cancer data

Also at ESMO 2021 the pair unveiled data from the single-arm Destiny-Gastric02 trial of Enhertu in Western patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Among patients who received one or two prior lines of therapy Enhertu triggered a response in 38% of patients lasting a median 8.1 months.

The numbers were slightly weaker than in the pivotal Destiny-Gastric01 trial in Japan and South Korea that earned Enhertu its FDA go-ahead in previously treated stomach cancer in January. There the drug spurred a response in 43% of patients with a median duration of 11.3 months among a group of patients who had received a median two previous therapies for advanced disease.

The prevalence of stomach cancer and how it’s treated are different between Asian populations and in the West Fredrickson explained. AstraZeneca said the two trials complement each other and “will support ongoing discussions with global health authorities.”

RELATED: ESMO: Daiichi unveils first early peek at next-gen ADC as analysts see strong data against rivals

In addition Enhertu also reported at ESMO 2021 more data from the phase 2 Destiny-Lung01 trial. After a median follow-up of 13.1 months Enhertu shrunk tumors in 54.9% of patients with HER2-mutant non-small cell lung cancer who had received a median two prior cancer therapies.

Probably because these patients already suffered from lung disease the rate of ILD was high at 26.4% in the trial including 6.6% at grade 3 or above.

Combined with the latest data with the positive readout reported earlier from the HER2-overexpressing cohort of the study AZ and Daiichi are talking to regulators about a path forward for Enhertu in NSCLC Fredrickson said.",,,,,,,,,

This logic has paved the way for the rise of the digital nomad a seemingly average person who travels while on the job taking advantage of the mobility that telework provides. These digital nomads aren’t just mixing work and play; they’re also chronicling their journeys on social media.

You’ve probably seen these digital nomads while scrolling through your Instagram feed. With a one–way ticket out of America in one hand and their MacBook in the other digital nomads curate enviable social media feeds that make you want to live their easygoing lifestyles.

However the concept of the digital nomad is much less ethical than these influencers' online presences might make it seem.

First of all these nomads often take very little interest in the local communities and practices that surround them. They're mostly worried about how their adventures will look on their feeds. Instead of traveling to different work locations to experience new cultures digital nomads often go to tropical places and still experience what work is like in America with its air–conditioned workspaces and plenty of smoothie bowls. Then they deem local practices as “inferior” to those they're familiar with.

The influx of these travelers who demand restaurants offices and shops that they feel comfortable with (i.e. that are westernized) has created a wave of transnational gentrification. Under this model local populations are exploited for their labor while their communities are destroyed. For example in Canggu a surfing hub in Bali rice fields are now being replaced with cheap bars hotels and nightclubs to attract more foreigners.

These patterns of exploitation aren’t new—they’re reminiscent of how western countries have used the concepts of white supremacy and western modernity to “industrialize” and colonize non–western nations.

Not only do digital nomads gentrify and perpetuate myths of western supremacy but they also encourage others to do the same—treating the Global South as an escape from the daily grind. In an infamous Twitter thread a user moved to Bali to “elevate” her lifestyle calling it a “perfect medicine” and telling others on Twitter to also move to get away from American work culture.

However while foreigners might see Bali as a place to live a more luxurious life tens of thousands of locals live in poverty with numbers increasing dramatically after COVID–19 destroyed the tourism industry.





When I think about it it's super clear that the move was intuitive. Bali is where I was supposed to be through it all. There was an energy about the states that I had to take a break from. Bali was the perfect medicine. pic.twitter.com/S643pu7hAE — Kristen Gray (@kristentootie) January 16 2021





Girl good for you but pls stop promoting this kind of lifestyle to other Westerners. The locals are living out of breadcrumbs while the foreigners get the best bit of the island. — Gisa (@gruusomeflower) January 17 2021





Relocating to places like Tulum to work while vacationing parallels age–old American patterns of imperialism. People not indigenous to an area disturb local ways of life spread COVID–19 in places that don’t have easy access to vaccines and overwhelm community resources. Digital nomads themselves often argue that they’re boosting these tropical economies and say that they’re the “future of remote life” but local leaders are constantly telling people to stop the travel boom.

While it's true that tourism and digital nomads can support local economies it’s also important to recognize that tourism as an industry is inherently unsustainable. As destinations become more and more popular tourists can sap a location’s resources until it becomes unappealing to those who want to use it as a vacation spot making it no longer “trendy.” Once this happens locals are left with higher prices and fewer resources and their way of life is drastically different.

Many digital nomads need to learn that the Global South is not a playground. While these travelers have the privilege of being able to pack up and leave once they’re tired of a destination the locals who serve them cheap drinks and açaí bowls have to live with the consequences of their takeover.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc3VuZGF5dGltZXMubGsvMjEwOTE5L3Nwb3J0cy9zcmktbGFua2EtdG8tb3JnYW5pc2Utd2VzdC1hc2lhcy1iaWdnZXN0LW9ubGluZS1jaGVzcy1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtNDU1NTAxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sri Lanka to organise West Asia's biggest Online Chess Championship,"Sri Lanka to organise West Asia’s biggest Online Chess Championship Western Asian Youth Chess Championship 2021 View(s): View(s):

The immediate reaction from a senior executive was to battle on saying in a statement that ""put simply we want our day in court.""

The North Charleston-based chemical manufacturer's wish came true this month. And it lost again in a decision that could cost it almost $85 million.

Ingevity is one of the few major publicly traded companies left standing in South Carolina. It was hatched decades ago within the research labs of what is now the WestRock paper mill along the Cooper River to create chemicals from pine trees and other forest products.

The fast-growing business was spun off in 2016 when it listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Ingevity now employs about 1850 workers at 25 locations worldwide and pulled down $1.22 billion in sales last year.

This month's legal showdown pitted the O'Hear Avenue company against German rival BASF Corp. The venue was a federal courtroom in Wilmington Del. widely viewed as the nation's business-litigation capital.

The dispute between the companies emerged several years ago after BASF began encroaching on Ingevity's turf. It centers on an arcane piece of automotive technology — small canisters that capture gasoline fumes as they evaporate and return them to the engine as fuel.

Ingevity fired the first legal salvo. In a 2018 lawsuit it alleged BASF was infringing on a patent tied to the absorbent ""honeycomb scrubbers"" stuffed inside the vapor canisters.

BASF which was developing a competing emissions-control product shot back. In a 2019 counter-complaint it argued that Ingevity's patent was invalid and accused the U.S. company of amassing a monopoly by requiring canister makers to only buy its scrubbers.

BASF went on to say that demand for its ""superior"" and ""less expensive"" alternative had been ""stymied"" by anticompetitive practices alleging that ""fears of ... coercion"" from the dominant global supplier had scared off prospective customers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He launched Groove Capital during the pandemic last year in a drive to close the gap of early-stage investment deals in the Twin Cities. The company has already maxed out its first fund through more than a dozen investment deals.

Now as the 2021 version of Startup Week is underway Robinson and Groove Capital's Mickayla Rosard are assembling a legion of angel investors to continue writing first checks to Minnesota founders.

""All of these amazing companies we have today they all started as this"" Robinson said. ""If we don't continue to replant those seeds the things we experience many years later are a lack of abundance. We're hedging that problem by insuring we're investing in that next wave and making it possible to have a vibrant business ecosystem.""

In the Groove angel network individuals write checks varying from $5000 to $25000 into a startup Rosard said. The network consists of just over 100 angels and limited partners in Groove's network.

Robinson's plan is to triple that number over the next couple of years. The network will be a mixture of Minnesota-based investors and others who want to invest in Minnesota companies.

He estimates there could be as many 70000 people in Minnesota who meet federal guidelines to be an accredited angel investor. For that a person needs net worth of $1 million or more and individual income of over $200000 or joint income of $300000 for the the last two consecutive years according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Robinson's estimates are on par with census data. Just over 14% of the state's population has a household income exceeding $150000 according to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED). That's a pool of nearly 80000 people.

Of those thousands though only 370 are certified as angel investors in Minnesota.

""The biggest issue you run into is people not knowing where to begin or how to get started"" Robinson said. ""That's what we're trying to target is that next part of the conversation.""

To groom more investors Groove Capital this summer launched a series called Angel Fest where people interested in becoming angels could learn about the process and network with other angels. More than 165 registered to attend four events within the series two of them being in person.

Created by Rosard the concept of the series was focused on developing more female investors in Minnesota though men were able to attend.

Rosard and Robinson are considering making Angel Fest a cohort-based semiannual or quarterly series beginning in 2022. During Startup Week Groove will host Angel Investor Rally where Robinson and Rosard will show attendees how they are connecting investors with startups. Following their event they'll lead the group to the BETA Showcase at Huntington Bank Stadium where nearly 40 entrepreneurs will pitch their ideas and products.

""It's important for me to build some programming around that to make sure people don't get wrapped up in tag lines or get-rich-quick schemes"" Rosard said.

Local investors and executives Monique Maddox and Rachael Scherer are limited partners in Groove Capital and will participate in Groove's angel network. They participated in Angel Fest as panelists where they spoke with attendees about diversifying their investment portfolio and how to determine which businesses to support based on their interests.

""There's a lot of money sitting on the sidelines"" in Minnesota Maddox said because potential investors aren't sure where to find businesses that can grow. Networks like Groove's would also help investors make deals with entrepreneurs they may otherwise not have noticed she said.

""You tend to go people that look like you and people in your circles and you give that money to them"" she said.

Scherer a former executive at Medtronic is now a senior adviser with Epiq Partners a Minneapolis investment and portfolio management firm. She began seed-stage investing in the late 1990s and a third of her investments are in angel networks. She focuses some of her investments in female-led companies and companies within medical technology.

""The largest companies in the Twin Cities today they all started small"" Scherer said. ""Somebody needed to believe in them both from sweat equity passion entrepreneurs but also the funders.""

Maddox owns a consulting business in the Twin Cities. An investor since 2015 she said investments in underrepresented entrepreneurs make up about 80% of her investment deals not including her investments with Groove.

""My focus is on underrepresented and underserved communities"" she said. ""I want to make sure those founders that look like me and founders that most represent me are actually getting they money. You don't see a lot of VC's that are supporting women early-stage founders especially Black and brown early-stage founders.""

A solid angel network includes mentors and advisers that help startups reach their full potential said Samuel Herzog an angel investor with Groove and owner of Unique Opportunities a property development company in Alexandria Minn.

""Everybody is bringing something to the table besides money"" he said. ""They're bringing a perspective and they're bringing experience and all of that brings value.""

Early-stage investing in Minnesota is thriving in 2021 more than any year over the past five years. Through the first eight months of 2021 startups in Minnesota raised more than $124 million from angel and seed-stage investors almost twice that of 2019 ($69.8 million). Of that $124 million however $117 million went to startups in the Twin Cities metro.

To boost angel investing the Legislature created the Minnesota Angel Tax Credit program which provides a 25% credit to investors or investment funds that make equity investments in Minnesota startup companies.

Across the state 125 business are certified to participate in the program. In 2021 $27.3 million has been invested into 73 businesses that are certified through the program said Neela Mollgaard executive director of Launch Minnesota an initiative within DEED created in 2019 to support Minnesota startups.

Lawmakers allocated $10 million for the tax credit program in 2021. In 2022 another $5 million is expected to be allocated to the program Mollgaard said.

Of the 125 businesses certified through the state's angel tax program only 10% are located outside the metro area.

""We're trying to create more opportunities for companies that don't fit the traditional startup model perfectly to succeed"" Herzog said. ""A lot of companies in outstate Minnesota miss opportunities to be looked at.""

For entrepreneurs those initial dollars are invaluable said Sean Higgins and investor with Groove and founder of St. Paul tech startup BetterYou who has started companies in the Twin Cities some with angel investment. Entrepreneurs need seed capital to buy computer equipment rent office or manufacturing space build a staff develop a product test the product in the market and if they're lucky cash a paycheck for themselves.

""Without it it's still two people in a garage more often than not"" Higgins said.

If the Twin Cities doesn't maintain an good environment where investment dollars are flowing ""people will leave"" Higgins said.

""They'll leave for San Francisco or Boston and we'll never see them again"" he said.

By keeping innovative companies in Minnesota job opportunities are made available for Minnesota's college grads looking to apply their knowledge in artificial intelligence virtual reality cloud computing and other kinds of emerging technologies Gregg Forsberg another limited partner in Groove said.

""People are learning that right here in our universities and then having to leave the Twin Cities to find someplace else to work"" he said. ""With this environment they can stay here.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9qYWNrLXdpbGxpYW1zLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTE4MTQ1Mjcz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jack Williams Obituary (2021) - Avon CT - Hartford Courant,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/hartfordcourant/name/jack-williams-obituary?id=18145273 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9qYWNrLXdpbGxpYW1zLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTE4MTQ1Mjcz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdXRhaHN0b3JpZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvaG93LWdhc3Ryb25vbXktaW5jLWNoYW5nZWQtdGhlLWZhY2Utb2Ytc2xjLWRpbmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Gastronomy Inc. Changed the Face of SLC Dining,"One of the first restaurants I ever ate at in Utah was a Gastronomy Inc. eatery. It was 1992 and I was being hosted by a headhunter who was among other things trying to “sell” me on Salt Lake City and convince me to relocate from New York City. She chose Baci Trattoria as the venue for our dinner and it was a very good choice indeed.

At the time this was one of Gastronomy’s newer businesses having opened in 1989. Gastronomy had debuted their flagship restaurant The New Yorker in 1978 followed by Market Street Grill in 1980 and the Market Street Oyster Bar in 1981 which launched on New Year’s Eve.

That was followed by Cafe Pierpont in 1986 and as mentioned Baci in 1989. Market Street Broiler near the U of U and additional Market Street Grills would follow in Cottonwood and in South Jordan as well as at the SLC International Airport. There were also at least three Market Street Fish Markets in operation.

I think it is fair to say that the face of SLC — particularly downtown — would look very different if not for Gastronomy Inc. which paved the way for many more restaurants and other businesses to thrive here.

Gastronomy Inc. (although it wasn’t called that yet) was founded by business partners John Williams and Tom Sieg who mutually saw possibilities for the old downtrodden New York Hotel on Market Street. Eventually they would turn the Hotel which was also home to a Salvation Army Soup Kitchen into the much-heralded New Yorker restaurant.

For years The New Yorker was the go-to downtown spot for fine dining. It was a place where women could wear a gorgeous gown and where men didn’t feel out of place in a pre-opera tuxedo.

In 2005 I wrote that The New Yorker’s recipe for success was a fairly simple one: “A blend of traditional and contemporary American cuisine paired with outstanding service in an almost timeless ambiance resulting in happy customers coming back year after year.”

To this day I believe that The New Yorker’s chef Will Pliler was one of the best chefs ever to work in Utah and I miss his cooking. The New Yorker closed in October of 2018.

A third Gastronomy Inc partner — Tom Guinney — joined Seig and Williams in 1980 and the dapper trio would transform downtown SLC repurposing old run-down historical buildings and turning them into eye-popping eateries such as Cafe Pierpont Baci Trattoria and Market Street Oyster Bar. All three partners — now deceased — were also generous supporters of opera in Utah as well as the fine arts and dance and filled their restaurants with artwork produced by local painters and sculptors.

Today diners are accustomed to eating freshly caught fish and seafood at restaurants like Takashi Nom Current Fish & Oyster Harbor and others. But it was John Williams and Tom Sieg — back in the late 70s — who paved the way for that freshness. They arranged to have fresh salmon flown to SLC on Western Airlines which became Delta.

That would grow eventually into daily shipments of fresh cod halibut oysters shrimp crab and more. I remember speaking to chef Greg Neville who worked with Gastronomy years ago about having to make trips out to the airport to pick up fresh seafood shipments. Today we take such freshness for granted but circa 1978 it was anything but. Sieg and Williams were pioneers in the local fresh food movement.

In its heyday Gastronomy Inc. operated 10 restaurants (anybody remember the short-lived Asian eatery called China Star?) numerous fish markets and had some 700 employees. It was estimated by John Williams before his tragic death that Gastronomy restaurants had spawned more than 100 other eateries that were started by former employees.

I know a couple dozen chefs servers managers and bartenders who have gone on to open their own businesses since being trained by and working with Gastronomy. As Chris Redgrave said once on KSL referring to the downtown Gastronomy restaurants “This is one of the first successes of Downtown Rising before it was Downtown Rising!”

Today — in part due to the passing of all three Gastronomy Inc. partners — all that is left of their local restaurant empire is the three Market Street Grill locations and Market Street Oyster Bar. But noshing on freshly shucked oysters with a cold glass of white wine to sip alongside at the Oyster Bar is still one of this food writers’ favorite pastimes and hopefully will be for many more decades to come.

Through nine specific action points they commit to supporting the goal of global net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner.

The initiative which has been led by some members of the Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Groups in the UK (ICSWG‐UK) and US (ICSWG‐US) is endorsed by the United Nations Race to Zero campaign and supported by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). The twelve investment consultants are: Barnett Waddingham bfinance Cambridge Associates Cardano Frontier Hymans Robertson JANA LCP Meketa Redington Willis Towers Watson and Wilshire.

Key influencers of capital allocation: investment consultants’ role in the Net Zero transition

Investment consultants play a crucial role within the savings and investment ecosystem. They provide strategic advice to asset owners such as pension funds sovereign funds endowments insurers foundations and family offices in areas such as investment beliefs and strategy asset allocation asset manager selection. They also provide broader education on the long‐term investment risks and opportunities related to climate change such as transition risk physical risk and stranded assets risk. These firms are often the critical link between asset owners and asset managers determining which firms and strategies are favoured for selection. Consultants also provide guidance to asset managers about ESG capabilities and climate competence as well as advising on the development of new investment solutions.

The commitments developed for the NZICI have been designed to facilitate alignment with the UN‐ convened Net‐Zero Asset Owner Alliance the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and other signatories of the Race to Zero campaign. They will work together with other signatories of net zero initiatives as a member of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).

Clear commitments and timeframes

The NZICI sets out nine actions that investment consultants will take to support the goal of global net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner in the context of legal and fiduciary duties and specific client mandates. First among these actions: integrating advice on net zero alignment into investment consulting services as soon as possible and within two years of making this commitment. The commitments apply to investment advisory service and business operations. For those consultants which offer discretionary asset management services the commitments include a pledge to align with the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative within two years.

The nine actions are as follows:

Within our investment advisory services we will:

Integrate advice on net zero alignment into all our investment consulting services as soon as practically possible and within two years of making this commitment Work with our institutional asset owner clients to identify the investment risks from climate change highlight the importance of net zero alignment and where applicable support our clients in developing policies that align their portfolios to a net zero pathway Support efforts to decarbonize the global economy by helping our clients prioritize real economy emissions reductions reflecting the target of 50% global emissions reduction by 2030 or sooner using existing decarbonization methodologies 1 Assess and monitor asset managers on the integration of climate risks and opportunities in their investment decisions and stewardship and reflect this evaluation in our client recommendations

With respect to our fully discretionary services we will:

Align with the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative as soon as practically possible and within two years of making this commitment

With respect to our own business operations we will:

Set emissions reduction targets across all our operational emissions in line with 1.5°C scenarios

Within the wider financial community we will:

Where suitable net zero methodologies do not exist work collaboratively for the benefit of our clients to address these challenges seeking harmonized methodologies Engage directly or in collaboration with regulators and policymakers to facilitate the transition to net zero carbon emissions addressing any barriers to our clients adopting and achieving their net zero targets

To ensure accountability we will:

Report progress by our firm against the commitments made here at least annually in public domain.

Quotes are included below from signatory firms PRI and Race to Zero.

Alex Pocock Head of Investment Consulting at Barnett Waddingham: ‘A systemic change like net zero can only be achieved by working together with other organisations ‐ to go further and faster to build a sustainable future. For Barnett Waddingham sustainability is about moving forward and meeting the needs of the present without jeopardising future generations. Joining this initiative means cementing our commitment to working with others across our industry and beyond to solve the complex systemic problems of climate change. Collaboration is absolutely key and this initiative demonstrates our collective commitment for the future; none of us can be ‘net zero’ alone.

David Vafai CEO at bfinance: “We believe that global investment consultants working closely with our asset owner clients have a vital part to play in the transition towards a resilient Net Zero economy and we are committed as a firm to making a difference. This initiative is an important milestone for us: we are making some significant changes to policies and processes as we look to deliver on commitments. A number of our clients are already very advanced in addressing issues such as portfolio carbon intensity temperature alignment and investment opportunities relating to the energy transition.”

David Druley CEO at Cambridge Associates: “Earlier this year Cambridge Associates proudly announced its global carbon neutral accreditation. As investors and stewards of long‐term capital it is also essential that our commitment to sustainability reach beyond the walls of our firm and permeate directly across our work with clients. We are lucky to already be working with several clients that are leading on the full spectrum of what needs to be done from decarbonization to investing in real world solutions and are looking forward to utilizing this expertise across our broader client base.”

Keith Guthrie Deputy CIO at Cardano: “The challenge with getting to Net Zero is that it’s a collective action problem. Net Zero is not properly priced in markets which is why it warrants attention – in other words markets are financing investments that remain profitable in the short‐term but are inconsistent with long‐term environmental goals aligned with Net Zero. The focus on Net Zero across the investment‐ value chain including advisors allows us to move the market‐as‐a‐whole and that’s why it’s helpful to set that out in writing in the form of a commitment. In other words this is a step beyond financial risk / return characteristics to focus on driving real change in the global economy. At Cardano we support the Paris Climate Agreement of limiting global warming to +1.5°C versus preindustrial levels. We do this by committing our investment portfolios to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We support global emissions reduction of 50% by 2030 with baseline year 2019. This informs our asset‐class decarbonisation targets. This is our default position – in our fiduciary management our advice and our liability driven investments. It’s for these reasons we strongly endorse the launch of the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative.”

Andrew Polson CEO at Frontier: “Collective action is vital in meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement. By joining the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative Frontier is proudly and publicly committing to develop capabilities to support our clients align their investment strategies to a 1.5C degree future while also achieving their performance objectives. While accomplishing net zero is daunting it is critical so we are determined to play our part in contributing to reducing real world emissions alongside like‐minded investment consultants and asset owners.”

Simon Jones Head of Responsible Investment at Hymans Robertson: “In joining our peers to make this net zero commitment we are sending a clear message about the role the financial services industry has to play in addressing climate change. The NZICI recognises that investment consultants are both educators and influencers and we can help ensure our clients take actions that create real world change. Our commitment builds on the climate pledge we made at the start of 2021 to integrate the consideration of climate risks into our research advice and services. Having already invested in developing both our people and the tools available to support the advice they give we will continue this thereby ensuring that our clients are properly equipped to address the risks and opportunities that the transition to a net zero economy will inevitably bring.”

Jim Lamborn Chief Executive Officer at JANA: “JANA is proud to be a part of the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative (NZICI). JANA’s mission statement is that together we have the opportunity to impact millions of people. However achieving the UN’s SDGs will require sustained international collaboration. This is why global initiatives like the NZICI are so critical. We are proud to be involved with the NZICI and look forward to working with others in the investment community to work towards meeting our universal goal of a global net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner.”

Clay Lambiotte Head of Investment at LCP: ““LCP puts sustainability at the heart of how we operate and how we support serve and inspire our clients. Net Zero is ultimately about protecting everyone’s future so working together with our clients and their investment managers is a critical part of that vision. We are therefore pleased to be supporting the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative from the outset. As part of that commitment we will be proactively raising net zero alignment with our investment clients and supporting them with practical solutions to address the associated climate risks and opportunities.”

Sarah Bernstein Managing Principal at Meketa Investment Group and Chair of the Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Group – U.S.: “Given the urgency with which climate change must be tackled investment consultants such as ourselves want to provide investment advisory services to support asset owners as they seek to implement investment strategies to help limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5 °C in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement and work to reduce our own corporate carbon footprint. We are very pleased to be a founding member of the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative. We expect our commitment to drive the development of consulting practices that will ensure an informed assessment of risks and opportunities related to transitions to net zero in the real economy are provided to Meketa clients.”

Fiona Reynolds CEO for the Principles for Responsible Investment: “We welcome the establishment of the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative. The initiative underlines the growing awareness that a move to net zero must be realised at every stage and level of the investment process. Investment consultancies have a key role to play in facilitating this shift by working with their clients to help embed ESG considerationsthroughout theirinvestment activity. The scope and influence of the founding partners behind the initiative is extensive and sets the tone for the rest of the sector. We encourage other investment consultancies to consider their involvement in positively affecting the shift to net zero and to come together to support this vital work.”

Mitesh Sheth CEO of Redington: “We are delighted to join with leading firms across the Investment Consulting industry in committing to delivering net zero advice to our clients. This reflects our own commitment earlier this year to make net zero our default advice and our ongoing efforts to embed climate change issues into our assessments of fund managers’ investment approaches and stewardship. The world economy faces a majortransition and we acknowledge ourrole and our clients’ roles in helping deliver the change that is needed.”

Nigel Topping High Level Champion for Climate Action at UN Climate Change Conference (COP26): “We are delighted to announce the launch of Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative. Assisting and advising asset owners to meet net zero goals through investment choices is crucial in meeting the collective decarbonisation targets. This commitment also cements their role in holding asset managers accountable on stewardship and product innovations. As part of GFANZ we look forward to working together to make the investment process align to net zero.”

Luba Nikulina Global Head of Research at Willis Towers Watson and Co‐Chair of the Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Group – UK: “The global transition to a net zero economy means asset owners have to develop their understanding of climate risks think about changing pathways for their assets and exercise their stewardship rights. Investment consultants play a vital role in supporting asset owners on this journey and helping them increase their level of climate ambition. I am delighted to work together with other NZICI members to make this industry wide transition quickly effectively and sustainably. We are proud to partner with the Race to Zero and the Principles for Responsible Investment to achieve better alignment across all stakeholders in the investment industry. It is only by working together that we can create a sustainable future for us all.”

Daniel E. Ingram Senior Vice President Chair of ESG and Diversity Committee at Wilshire: “Helping clients navigate the risks and opportunities unique to their portfolio and investment strategy to improve outcomes is an important part of our pedigree. As proud signatories of new Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative (NZICI) we are signalling our commitment to help clients invest for a better future. We’re honoured to collaborate with our peers on this initiative where as stewards in the institutional advisory space working together we can significantly magnify the impact we’re able to make individually to benefit investors industry wide.”

Peloton queen Jess King is her followers’ ride or die.

The former Las Vegas resident got on her bike in 2014 and has amassed an international cult following of riders and runners who spend time sweating and much more with her each day.

An intimate experience? King says there are few things deeper. “I’m intentionally speaking to people’s hearts but on the bike” she says. “I want you to know if you are hurting and suffering you’re not alone. I’m right here with you. I see you. Biking together is a deep connection.”

King cut her TV teeth as a pro dancer on Fox’s “So You Think You Can Dance.” She is also known for her starring role in “Le Rêve” at Wynn Las Vegas and her popular online cooking show called “Ooo Mami” with fiancée Sophia Urista.

Next up is Season 3 of her own show “Jess King Experience” which Peloton will premiere this fall.

How did the idea of Peloton appeal to you as a dancer and artist?

As an artist I realized that this was just a different type of stage. And the impact of this worldwide audience blew other ideas out of the water. It’s millions of people watching you as opposed to how many you can pack into a theater. This was just moving the performance to a virtual world. It was also bringing art to fitness.

Out of all of the instructors why are you one of the most popular?

I think it’s all about a commitment to authenticity. It’s not something I’m consciously seeking to achieve. It just happens.

What makes a spin class great versus “My rear is numb and I’ll never do this again”?

It’s the synergy of the music and the movement. It’s similar to a dance — it must fit together. A great class is a moving meditation. It takes you out of what you are familiar with in your world like your job or your to-do list and brings you into this sacred space where you can explore things you don’t know in your heart or your head. You might be on the threshold of a great idea or pushing to break a record or moving to get yourself going for your day. It’s deeply personal.

Do Peloton teachers have groupies?

(Laughing) It’s nice. Fans come up. Mostly it’s a surprise when people see me. I’ll hear “Oh s---! Is that really you?” And I’ll say “My friend!” The person will then say “I see you every single day.” Those are my people.

What are your memories of playing the woman in the red dress in “Le Rêve”?

I learned how to ballroom dance in water. It was like I went scuba diving every night when I wasn’t doing aerial work. It was one of my first professional jobs and a hard gig but it taught me so much from a skill-set perspective. There was no mediocre. You weren’t allowed to not go for it. If you didn’t go full out you would get injured.

How physically taxing was the show?

Dancing on a rubber stage that went 30 feet into the water was tough. By the way we were in little leather ballroom shoes in the water. It was so hard on my feet especially the little joints. It got to the point where after every show I was doing ice bucket after ice bucket just to get to the “ahhhhhh.”

When will you and fiancée Sophia Urista visit Vegas again?

Oh I’m not done with Vegas. It’s such an interesting place and holds a lot of memories for us both. Sophia did the show “Opium” in Vegas. I did “Le Rêve.” Lots of fun times. Plus I love a good dinner at Catch.",,,,,,,,,

More than 60000 people in Minnesota and Wisconsin started the day without power and about 12000 remained in the dark into the evening. By late Saturday afternoon that total was around 1700.

The storms hit the Twin Cities metro hardest according to Xcel Energy which said hundreds of employees worked through Friday to restore power.

The National Weather Service confirmed that at least three tornadoes touched down in Savage Apple Valley and northeast Burnsville.

The weather service said the St. Cloud area received the most rain — 1.05 inches. A total of 0.24 inches fell at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and 0.14 inches in Mankato.

""We had a lot of wind damage ... trees down trees uprooted"" said meteorologist Chris O'Brien of the NWS' regional office in Chanhassen.

A 4-year-old girl died when a tree fell on her family's tent about 2:30 a.m. at Land of Memories Park in Mankato city officials said. The girl who was in a tent with her parents was rushed to a hospital where she was pronounced dead. Other family members were unharmed.

The family of three was staying at the park for the Mahkato Annual Traditional Powwow said powwow organizer Dave Brave Heart. He said the girl whose first name was Nytalia was excited to wear her new jingle dress and participate in the jingle dress special a traditional healing dance.

Citing the family's privacy Brave Heart declined to give the girl's last name. Mankato police said they did not plan to identify her for 24 hours.

Brave Heart said the family planned to remain at the park with spiritual and community leaders while they grieved.

""They're going to stay for the rest of the powwow; that's what their daughter would want"" he said.

A jingle dress dance and a blanket dance were planned this weekend to raise money to benefit the family Brave Heart said.

He said organizers have been criticized for not canceling the powwow a three-day event that Explore Minnesota says has been held annually since 1972.

""The family does not want that"" Brave Heart said. ""They want to honor their daughter to be able to create some kind of healing memory.""

O'Brien the meteorologist said Friday morning's storm was not uncommon for September. The severe-weather season generally lasts until late in the month or early October.

Much of the metro-area damage stretched from Savage to Eagan.

In addition three schools canceled classes after losing power in the South Washington County Schools district: Nuevas Fronteras Spanish Immersion Pullman Elementary and Hillside Elementary.

The storm forced Stillwater Area Public Schools to cancel or delay in-person classes for two hours while St. Croix Preparatory Academy in Stillwater closed for the day.

The storms also brought more-widespread damaging straight-line winds that downed trees and branches. Authorities reported at least one death — in Mankato where a 4-year-old girl died when a tree branch fell on a tent at a city park. Mankato city officials on Saturday identified her as Nytalia I. Ashes of Sioux Falls S.D.

About 1700 homes and businesses remained without power as of 5 p.m. Saturday in Xcel Energy's Minnesota and western Wisconsin service areas more than 36 hours after the storms barreled through. Xcel said that was down from a peak of more than 100000 outages immediately after the severe weather.

It was set to be a weekend of cleaning up storm debris for many residents in the the Twin Cities especially in the southern and eastern metro area.

Friday morning's storms uprooted large trees with some landing atop homes; branches and other debris blocked streets in some neighborhoods. Winds gusted to 64 mph at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

The Weather Service said most of the damage was caused by straight-line downburst winds. But survey teams sent out to assess the damage confirmed at least four tornado touchdowns — three in the south metro and one in Sibley County. All were rated EF-0 with winds estimated at 65 to 85 mph:

Savage: The Weather Service reports the tornado touched down near State Highway 13 and Connelly Parkway at about 3 a.m. and tracked east for just over 2 miles sending trees onto houses and vehicles. There was roof damage at a Savage Public Works building and a light pole was bent at a baseball field.

Burnsville: This tornado touched down near State Highway 13 and Cliff Road just after 3 a.m. and tracked northeast for about a mile knocking trees onto homes and vehicles.

Apple Valley: A tornado touched down just after 3 a.m. near Cedar Avenue and 145th Street and traveled east-northeast for just under a mile sending trees onto homes and vehicles.

Sibley County: This tornado touched down just after 2:30 a.m. a couple miles north-northwest of Le Sueur. It was on the ground for about 1.6 miles mostly crossing corn fields but also downing large branches in a grove of trees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8va3N0cC5jb20va3N0cC1uZXdzL3RvcC1uZXdzLzNyZC10b3JuYWRvLWNvbmZpcm1lZC1pbi1zb3V0aC1tZXRyby1hbWlkLWZyaWRheS1zdG9ybXMtbGFjay1vZi1zaXJlbnMtZXhwbGFpbmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3rd tornado confirmed in south metro amid Friday storms; lack of sirens explained,"[anvplayer video=”5057523″ station=”998122″]

The National Weather Service has confirmed that a third tornado touched down early Friday morning in the south metro.

According to an update Saturday morning the twister touched down in Savage at 3 a.m. near Highway 13 and Connelly Parkway and moved east for just over 2 miles. Wind speeds topped out at 85 mph and it was rated an EF0 tornado.

Most of the damage came from trees falling on houses and vehicles. There was also some roof damage to the Savage Public Works building and a light standard was bent at a baseball field according to the NWS.

The two other Twin Cities tornadoes touched down in Burnsville and Apple Valley. The NWS rated both as EF0 storms.

Strong storms moved through the south metro and western Wisconsin early Friday morning causing damage and leaving thousands without power.

From Denver’s first European settlers who joined an Arapaho camp led by Chief Little Raven at the confluence of the South Platte and Cherry Creek to the urban pioneers who reclaimed the river from a history of neglect and now flock to the bustling Joe Shoemaker Plaza at the same confluence the city’s residents have been shaped by the river their fates intertwined.

The plaza is the crown jewel of nearly 50-year campaign to “breath[e] life” into what had for decades been a “dead urban waterway” as the foundation tasked with revitalizing the South Platte describes it.

If the 10.5-mile stretch of the South Platte through Denver has a patron saint it’s Joe Shoemaker the late state senator and one-time deputy mayor of Denver who co-founded the Platte River Development Committee with then-Denver Mayor Bill McNichols in 1974 and shepherded its transformation into the enduring Greenway Foundation.

When Shoemaker died in 2012 a Boulder-based environmental newsletter eulogized his impact.

“Joe was a visionary who stood on the banks of the South Platte River (when there was not a single park or trail when the river was so polluted that it was toxic to touch when raw sewage was being pumped into the river and when no one else thought the river had a chance of survival) and said ‘We can do better’” wrote the editors of The Blue Line.

Shoemaker is also a great chronicler of the river’s revival recalling in his 1981 book “Returning the Platte to the People” that only a few years earlier the river had been treated as “Denver’s receptacle for anything they wanted out of sight out of mind.”

Before he undertook his life’s project of “turning the blighted Platte into an amenity” he wrote most Denver residents had “treated the Platte virtually as abandoned territory.” Even years into its rehabilitation Shoemaker said he had to struggle with an attitude that said ""If you have something to dump down to the river it goes!”

That all changed on a June afternoon in 1965 when a slow-moving storm dumped nearly 14 inches of rain into the South Platte watershed just south of Denver unleashing the largest natural disaster in the city’s history — flooding a quarter of a million acres leaving 25 dead and causing the equivalent of $14 billion in damage in today’s dollars.

“Instead of the normal 300 cubic feet of water per second or the 3000 that we called exceptionally high” Shoemaker wrote “the raging South Platte hit us with the astonishing flow of 150000 cubic feet per second.”

In addition to the destructive water the flood returned to the city the industrial waste chemicals and trash that had accumulated in what the Greenway Foundation said had been a “virtually abandoned and forgotten open sewer” awakening a few visionaries in the city to their role as stewards of the river.

More than $500 million has since been invested in the river and surrounding parks and trails through Denver accomplishing what Peter Warren a University of Denver professor described in its early stages as “one of the most remarkable examples of urban revitalization in the United States.”

The work Warren wrote in “The Greening of the Platte” a 1980 Rocky Mountain News article cited by Joe Shoemaker in his book was transforming “a blighted degraded river — little more than an open sewer — into a major amenity for Denver.”

“One of the key reasons Denver is the strong international city it is is because we have a vibrant river” Jeff Shoemaker Joe Shoemaker's son who became executive director of the Greenway Foundation in 1982 said in a presentation to supporters.

“Without that environmental asset I don’t believe that all the adjacent development — be it residential or commercial — I don’t think their vitality strength and existence would be where they are today” he said.

What’s in the water?

Denver’s Department of Public Health and environment has sampled the water in many of Denver’s streams and lakes for six decades. Last year the South Platte earned a quality rating of “fair.”

Persistent challenges include E. coli nitrogen and phosphorous. In all 25% of the river does not meet all of the state’s water quality standards including segments in the Denver metro area.

Bear in mind. the river's metro watershed includes six Superfund cleanup sites one of the worst environmental designations the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency can assign.

“Denver’s streams and lakes receive runoff from streets and discharges from industry and wastewater treatment plants” Denver’s health department warns. “As a result DDPHE discourages anglers from eating fish caught out of any of the small tributaries to the South Platte River or Cherry Creek (or any of Denver’s streams or lakes).”

Last year the Colorado Water Quality Control Commission rejected a recommendation to upgrade the level of protection from polluters like Metro Wastewater or Suncor. The state is currently reviewing Suncor's permits to release storm water and treated wastewater. The refinery has had 17 reported spills since November 2012.

“We cannot wait five more years to upgrade or revisit what’s happening to the communities in north Denver” Ean Thomas Tafoya of GreenLatinos told the water quality commission earlier this month asking for a reconsideration of its prior rejection.

In addition to industrial polluters the South Platte also has historically suffered from a more dispersed threat: the residents of Denver.

“It’s terrifying to look at the rivers and see the state some people leave it in. Finding needles. It’s sad it’s terrifying it’s scary"" said Miguel Hallman of Odell Brewery during a volunteer river cleanup in downtown.

River pollution was part of the justification for Denver enacting a 10-cent fee for disposal bags that went into effect this year. Residents use upward of 100 million disposable bags annually nearly all of which are not recycled and some of which make their way into waterways.

Before and after Denver

A river born in Park County travels 440 miles to join the North Platte in Nebraska. Its journey to Denver is its most scenic traversing canyons rich with anglers rafters backpackers and typically an abundance of cool water year-round.

After it passes through the urbanized industrialized Denver metro area — with its slalom course of streets and freeways railroad tracks an Xcel power plant and plenty more industries — a different animal creeps out to the farmlands of the Eastern Plains.

Fed by the drainage of a city both of Denver’s main waterways the South Platte River and Cherry Creek battle E. coli levels above recreational standards landing it on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's list of impaired waterways for pathogens.

Denver doesn’t shoulder the water quality burden alone. The South Platte arrives with baggage from years of forest fires that dumped heavy sediment in the river which is a major hassle for Denver Water the metro region’s supplier.

Strontia Springs a cup that holds drinking water for 1.5 million Front Range residents inherits the equivalent of thousands of dump truck loads of grit each year Denver Water says.

City officials are hopeful the redevelopment of the National Western Center means a fresh look at the river and the work that could be done to improve it there and elsewhere in town.

Headed out of town the South Platte picks up the outfall at the Metro Wastewater Reclamation District plant.

Dr. Dave Lipson the principal hydrogeologist for HRS Water Consultants Inc. is on the board of the Scientists and Engineers Section of the National Ground Water Association. He's also an adjunct professor in advanced hydrology at the Colorado School of Mines.

He looked at the water quality data upstream and downstream from Chatfield Reservoir.

“If you drank a glass of South Platte River water upstream of Chatfield you’d be ingesting sulfur arsenic uranium lead cadmium zinc and other metals which are present in the river due to a legacy of over 100 years of mining and no or relatively little cleanup of waste rock dumps that leach metals directly into the river” Lipson said.

Nonetheless urban runoff is no friend to the South Platte either.

“I would not drink a glass of water from the South Platte River at Commerce City” he said. “The discharge from Metro Wastewater contains phosphorus nitrogen and potassium and probably dilutes contaminants from our mining legacy and urban runoff.

“So farms in the northeast that obtain South Platte River water downstream of Denver are getting a veritable industrial stew of contaminants.”

Someday: 'The best place to live'

Denver's efforts to show off its river and weave it into the city images has had mixed results even flopping once before on the national stage.

In March 1996 when Vice President Al Gore came to town some city officials wanted to make the South Platte look better than it was.

That prompted the Denver Water Board to fling open the heat gate at the Chatfield Reservoir to release 92 million gallons of water enough for 240 families of four for an entire year.

That PR stunt cost $59000 worth of water ultimately paid for by utility customers. The move was panned even by the environmentally conscience Gore whose staff said afterward he didn't know about the wasted water and would not have approved it.

""I thought it would be nice to have it look good for the vice president″ the late Chips Barry head of the Denver Water said at the time.

Gore was in town to talk bout a proposed public-private restoration of the South Platte worth $40 million the the latest attempt to reclaim the river.

Three years ago Denver voters passed Ballot Measure 2A pledging $46 million per year through a bump in sales tax for the city’s parks trails and open spaces with a portion dedicated to restoring waterways rivers canals and streams. The funding provides the backbone for Denver’s “Game Plan for a Healthy City.”

A 2021 progress report notes that the plan includes protection for the South Platte through an expansion of “its role in creating great neighborhoods improving flood management and expanding natural habitat.” The plan calls for restoration of “the river’s ability to provide natural benefits that promote water quality flood control ecosystem health and socio-economic growth” and developing a multi-disciplinary plan to guide the future of the river including its environmental stormwater water quality flood mitigation recreation and urban design components.

What does all that mean? So far not much. A five-year capital projects plan from Denver Parks and Recreation doesn’t appear to include any projects for the South Platte. The only money for waterways in the five-year plan is $250000 to be spent in 2020 on “restoration” for non-river projects such as “ballfield lighting” irrigation at City Park and improvements to infrastructure at Grant Frontier Park a remodeled space along the river south of Evans Avenue.

However Shoemaker who co-chaired the campaign for 2A has more ambitious plans for the river and what is built along it now.

It’s known as “The River Mile” and it’s the grand vision for a new neighborhood on the current Elitch Gardens site running along the South Platte starting at Colfax and ending at Speer Boulevard. River Mile represents the vision of Joe Shoemaker who once said “Someday the best place to live work and play will be along the South Platte River in Denver.”

The goal according to Jeff Shoemaker is to have as little of a water footprint as possible in the community.

According to its website River Mile would add 27 acres of river-edge parks and open space. The project is under the auspices of the foundation the city of Denver developer Revesco Properties and Stan Kroenke owner of the Denver Nuggets Colorado Avalanche and Ball Arena.

Elitch Gardens will remain in its current location for the foreseeable future but when it’s ready to move Revesco will help it find a better location according to plans.

Shoemaker said that in the next 20 years about a third of a billion dollars of federal money will be invested in the development of The River Mile. Eventually the River Mile could be home to an estimated 15000 residents with what could be 7600 homes including 984 affordable housing units.

River Mile’s south end would be anchored by Meow Wolf an immersive art installation that has won fans in other parts of the country and is due to open this month. It will eventually include a half-million square feet of retail space two light rail stations a new elementary school and a recreation center. Residential offerings are expected to be ready by 2024.

The project also will fulfill some of the promises made to the Globeville-Elyria-Swansea neighborhoods. Shoemaker said those neighborhoods have always been important to the Greenway Foundation and it's backed that up by setting up environmental education for neighborhood school groups known as SPREE a program that has been part of the foundation for decades. Some former SPREE participants over the past 40 years are now bringing their children to the program.

As part of the commitment to the area the first funded project for River Mile will be to deal with flood control habitat restoration and increased wetland areas on the South Platte just south of the neighborhoods. That project will make the river healthier safer and more accessible Shoemaker said.

A river for the for people

As the South Platte winds its way through the city landscape it's flanked by more than 20 parks and miles of hiking and biking trails. Those green spaces and natural areas are a far cry from the river's state six decades ago.

“Every single park that you're looking at up and down the river was an abused site” the younger Shoemaker said. “It was either a landfill dumpsite it was industrial yards it was railroad yards it was a superfund site.”

That all began to change in the wake of the 1965 South Platte flood. It was time to rethink the city’s relationship with the river and the elder Shoemaker took the lead.

In 1974 he approached McNichols — who had defeated him the 1971 mayoral race after Shoemaker ran on a platform of reinvigorating the South Platte — with a question: What are you going to do about the river?

As it turned out McNichols had $1.9 million in leftover federal dollars that he wanted to put toward the river. He appointed Shoemaker to lead a panel tasked with spending it giving birth to the Platte River Development Committee which evolved into The Greenway Foundation.

First came Confluence Park in 1975 at Denver’s birthplace. Progress on reducing pollution and creating green spaces continued through McNichols’ time in office and under the administration of his successor Federico Peña.

But according to Jeff Shoemaker the “largest evolutionary commitments to the river from the city” came under Mayor Wellington Webb who declared 1996 the Year of the South Platte. By the time he left office in 2003 the river in Denver featured 75 more acres of parkland and seven new or expanded parks.

“The whole park system along the South Platte is one of my proudest achievements” Webb told Colorado Politics. “To me this is as important as the airport because once you get the people here they've got to go somewhere and parks and open space add to the value of any city.”

Data from The Greenway Foundation backs that up. A study Joe Shoemaker commissioned in 1970 found properties within a half-mile of the South Platte and Cherry Creek were valued 17% lower than other properties elsewhere in Denver. By 2017 however riverside properties were valued 36% higher good for an increase in value of roughly $18 billion over those 47 years.

As does a city and a river its cast of supporter rolls on as well. Jeff Shoemaker announced his retirement from the foundation earlier this month after 39 years with the organization.

“The whole project was met with laughter and skepticism far more than excitement and enthusiasm” his son said of the early days of the Platte River Development Committee. “And my father's response... was ‘Mark my words: one day this will be the best place to live work and play in Denver.’

“How right he was.”

YUM,Yum! Brands,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtcGl6emEtaHV0LW1hc3MtY2xvc3VyZXMtb3Zlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Major Pizza Chain May Finally Be Done With Mass Store Closures,"Last year while the pandemic was wreaking havoc on the restaurant industry one of the largest restaurant operators to be affected was NPC International a major franchisor of several national fast-food brands including Pizza Hut. NPC declared bankruptcy in July 2020 exposing its 1200 locations of the beloved pizza chain to potential closure. But as it turns out NPC's implosion couldn't have been better timed.

Based on comments from David Gibbs CEO of Pizza Hut's parent company Yum! Brands who spoke to investors in a conference call on Monday the future of the Pizza Hut brand was never at stake in the NPC bankruptcy. In fact it allowed Yum! to accelerate a strategy it's been pursuing since before the pandemic: ridding the Pizza Hut brand of less profitable dine-in locations. In fact at the time of NPC's bankruptcy proceedings 300 of its units were already scheduled for closure.

The Saddest Restaurant Closures in Your State

According to Gibbs in the past 18 months Yum! Brands has closed ""a lot of the dine-in stores that didn't belong on the [Yum! Brands] portfolio."" But as Gibbs reassured investors on Monday the closures were part of a longer-term system-wide pivot towards takeout and delivery one that's been in the works since the year 2000 and was recently accelerated due in part to the pandemic.

More importantly though the shuttering of Pizza Hut locations seems to finally be over. Pizza Hut has phased out over a thousand restaurants since 2014 and at the end of 2020 had reduced its footprint to some 6600 units. As Gibbs told investors the dine-in locations that are still standing after the 18-month purge are here to stay. ""For the most part the stores we have in the portfolio now are good long-term stores"" he said.

Indeed net unit growth is only one aspect of a healthy fast-food brand and does not necessarily correlate with sales performance. Pizza Hut is a perfect example. While the brand has been shrinking since 2014 its sales growth in recent years has been solid. Gibbs reported to investors that same-store sales at Pizza Hut (factoring out dine-in business) were up 20% over a two-year period putting the pizza chain on par with competitors like Domino's and Papa John's.

To stay competitive Yum! Brands recently acquired a number of technology companies in hopes of accelerating the transition of its brands into takeout and delivery business models. Exclusive access to companies like Kvantum (an AI startup) and Dragontail Systems (an order management solutions company) will help Pizza Hut and other Yum! subsidiaries make that leap.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

In the meantime fans of good old-fashioned dine-in Pizza Hut restaurants can breathe a sigh of relief. Closures of the iconic ""Red Roof"" restaurants are finally at an end. For now.
